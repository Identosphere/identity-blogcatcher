 Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain <p>Ontology and Binance have a long history of cooperation and partnership that has generated benefits for both sides, none possibly more important the integration of Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solution into the Binance Smart Chain. The symbiotic relationship sees Ontology, and ONT ID, as the sole partner for BSC in terms of providing a truly decentralized identity option and KYC user verification.</p><p>The recent explosion of projects landing on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is expected to be accompanied with a meteoric rise in the number of potential investors interested in Security Token Offerings, otherwise known as STO’s. A key variable that is addressed through Ontology’s partnership with BSC is the problem of identifying potential investors, and ensuring their identities are not only protected but also validated through Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway and overall Trust Ecosystem.</p><p>About ONT&nbsp;ID</p><p>ONT ID is a framework for decentralized identity, built on the Ontology blockchain and integrated with the Binance Smart Chain. So any user, developer or project launching STO’s will have access to fully integrate the benefits of ONT ID and with it, decentralized identity, into their existing developments. Protected by cryptographic techniques, ONT ID provides any entity with a digital identity that is controlled by the entity through decentralization. The entity in question here can be a variety of things, including but not limited to individuals, organizations, or objets. This makes tasks such as authentication, authorization or performing audits much simpler while protecting the data of the entity being authenticated, authorized, or&nbsp;audited.</p><p>About ONT&nbsp;TAG</p><p>Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway (TAG) is a decentralization platform based on ONT ID which provides access to security features such as KYC (know your customer) and global authentication services such as Shufti Pro, IdentityMind, and CFCA to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>How does this help&nbsp;STO’s?</p><p>For any security token offering on BSC, the most important aspect is being able to accurately and safely verify the assets held by potential investors, while adding a layer of anonymity and protection to their identity through decentralization. Some pain points in compliance requirements include verifying of qualified investors, cross-border sales of security offerings, and the duration of the qualification validity period for both the United States and the European union. In a normal STO process, the issuance, self compliance, fundraising, and working with technical issues can be both time consuming and difficult. Neither of which is conducive to a successful STO. But by integrating ONT ID and adopting the ONT TAG, any STO on the Binance Smart Chain can identify potential investors much quicker, and nudge them through the checklists smoother. Not to mention that this is a more secure form for investors to participate while having their personal ID protected through the decentralization powered by Ontology — the only partner who offers this service on&nbsp;BSC.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-the-only-decentralized-identity-partner-for-binance-smart-chain-d531efbc569">Ontology — The ONLY Decentralized Identity Partner for Binance Smart Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

They bring a level of convenience to anyone who needs to access applications throughout the day to conduct business effectively and without having to enter credentials each time. So, it is not surprising that Okta, who’s the leader in the market, oftentimes uses the following tagline: “One-click access to all your enterprise apps—in the cloud and behind the firewall.” But, there is another slogan used by Okta that tends to leave me perplexed: “Okta is one trusted platform to secure every identity, from customers to your workforce.”</p>

   The Ugly Face of Yesterday’s CIAM

   The Ugly Face of Yesterday’s CIAM 
<p>We all have multiple different personas. But before we put on our hats as identity “experts” -&nbsp; either as architects, implementers or vendors - let us start by simply being consumers.&nbsp; Consumers of online services for banking, e-commerce, education, entertainment, and more.&nbsp; And by thinking as consumers, we can all tell endless stories of poor user experiences with respect to using those services. Those poor user experiences are essentially putting an invisible barrier to entry to the applications and goods we wanted to consume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one forgets how someone or something made them feel, and a poor registration, login or password reset journey, at best reduces the likelihood of consumer recommendations, at worst, you simply lose users which ultimately results in lost revenue.</p>
<p>The lack of a “digital fabric” is typically the root cause of those badly performing ecosystems.</p>
 Broad Requirements Drive The Need for an Identity Fabric 
<p>CIAM however is not just about the end-user experience. Obviously, the UI “is THE application” from an end-user point of view, but under the hood, there's an entire catalog of other requirements that are needed to make CIAM a success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core elements of a good Consumer Identity Fabric are:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Functionality for upholding compliance (think GDPR for EMEA or CCPA for the US amongst others),&nbsp; 
 Multi-device integration,&nbsp; 
 Adaptive and contextual security,&nbsp; 
 Bot-protection&nbsp; 
 Fraud management checks at various different states of the end-user journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>Data integration and data access are also important things to consider and are likely to need the creation not only of new software components - either through development or procurement - but also new operational structures and potentially new teams to manage that new landscape.</p>
<p>Put simply, CIAM isn’t just IAM. CIAM is an outside-in view of identity as opposed to the inside-out model for employee IAM. Features are different, but so too are the non-functional requirements. Scale - for storage and throughput - will be considerably higher, as will geographical availability, support for different locales and languages and the ability to elastically respond to changes in service demand. Many of these overall needs would unlikely have been a priority if a CIAM project was not needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new requirements however are driving the need for a more integrated, extensible and accessible set of identity services - likely based on an API/SDK first approach. This is where the “fabric” model of identity comes into play.</p>
 Start With The End in Mind 
<p>So how can we make CIAM a success for the organization?&nbsp; The most simple approach is to “start with the end in mind” and by asking, what the CIAM platform is going to achieve for the business. In the identity world, CIAM is the solution most closely aligned to the organization's business objectives so it needs to be a priority for any organization going through a digital transformation and having their customers and partners in mind. It can open up new revenue streams, alter how business is conducted and provide a foundation for continued growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Stakeholders in the implementation process are numerous –&nbsp;typically the CISO, CMO, a digital leader, and various identity services leads are involved. So having a platform of distributed components that can assist them in their divergent goals is critical to making CIAM effective. By supporting services for a range of stakeholders we are moving towards developing a broader cross-business unit platform that can break down silos. This is exactly what an identity fabric aims to achieve.</p>
 CIAM Lifecycle 
<p>CIAM interactions really follow a cyclical pattern of interaction, from initial registration, through to secure login and contextual access, allowing consent and data management to take place seamlessly across a range of devices at a time of the users choosing. Throughout that lifecycle, we need to look beyond assurance and knowledge levels of those user interactions and should ask ourselves how a target service or application for the end-user can be provided in a way that encourages them to refer, recommend and renew?</p>

			 Eva joined the team six months ago as an intern to complete her graduation internship. 

		 
	 
              
	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Eva Gasyte and I am from Lithuania. Even in my childhood I was interested in banks and the financial world, so as a first step towards my career, I studied finance in Vinius. After this I decided to deepen my knowledge and get a Master’s degree, but I also wanted to gain some international experience, and so in 2019 I moved to Monaco and started studying MSc Finance at the University of Monaco. This month I am finishing my internship at Tokeny and I am about to start my professional career.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>As part of my studies at University of Monaco, I am required to do a 6-month internship. Luckily, I was noticed by Tokeny’s HR manager Radka on Linkedin as she read an article about me published by the university, in which I mentioned I am looking for an internship. She contacted me, and after a few interviews I was offered the internship. This is how Tokeny came into my life.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>The experience was great in a lot of ways. I like the team, my duties and the company’s culture. Tokeny is a remote friendly company, with people working all over the world. I’ve been communicating with most of the team remotely, but I feel very happy that some of those people became my friends, even though I’ve never met them in real life! During the internship I’ve had a very dynamic schedule – every day was unique for me, with different tasks, and therefore I’ve gained a lot of experience in various fields. Our offices here in Monaco are at MonacoTech which provides a very dynamic and innovative environment. The start-up atmosphere there is amazing. It’s a combination of such a challenging place, exciting projects I took care of and great colleagues that helped me to grow even more and gain agility.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love traveling and discovering new cultures – it amazes me how many breathtaking places are on Earth, one life is not enough to see everything. Even in Monaco – it is one of the tiniest countries in the world and after 2 years I still find places here I’ve never seen before.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is very simple – all I wish is to live a happy life. To succeed in my career, to have a nice family, and that everyone around me is happy as well.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I love animals, and if I could, I would provide home and food for all of them that are abandoned in this world.</p>

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>Platform livelihoods hold great promise for making work more inclusive for young women. At the same time, they also present <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">new expressions of gender differences</a> in opportunity, uptake, earnings, and the ways work intersects with other areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>These tensions are apparent in a participatory <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">video storytelling project</a> carried out by Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of Mastercard Foundation, in October 2020. The project equipped seven young women based in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda with mobile phones, video training, and mentoring, to enable them to tell us their own experiences of platform work over a period of two&nbsp;months.</p><p>The women — two web developers, a farmer, a carpenter, a motorcycle rider, and two social commerce entrepreneurs — told us how marketplace platforms have enabled them to challenge structural barriers such as access to capital, sexism, freedom of movement, access to ICTs, and personal safety. Some needed very little capital to start. Others could conduct the work from the comfort and safety of their home, which enabled digital platforms to provide an entry point into the world of&nbsp;work.</p><p>Some women also leveraged the fact that they already had a computer, internet access, and the requisite skills to perform their platform work; others pushed themselves to learn skills that enabled them to join a male-dominated profession. While the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted their lives, the women all fought to stay financially afloat and keep their passions alive&nbsp;online.</p><p>Despite these opportunities, the women’s stories also bring to light gender-specific challenges associated with platform livelihoods, like sexism and having to balance unpaid care work at home with platform&nbsp;work.</p> Breaking down gender stereotypes in the workplace Dathive<p>Dathive, 31, known as “Señorita” to her regular customers, is one of only two female motorcycle taxi riders on Uganda’s SafeBoda ride-hailing platform. Before becoming a driver, she has tried numerous other business ventures like running a mobile money business and a fashion boutique. However, none offered the potential profit of boda boda work. Joining this male-dominated sector means that Dathive has not had it easy; she sometimes had to prove that she could transport passengers well regardless of her gender. However, being one of only two female SafeBoda riders does have its&nbsp;perks.</p><p>“When I take a customer, I see that they are really very happy to ride my motorcycle. When we reach [our destination], and we negotiate the money, they give me a tip. We take a selfie, they call their family, their neighbors [and say]…come and see my driver, come and see who’s brought me.” — Dathive, SafeBoda driver,&nbsp;Kampala</p><p>SafeBoda has helped boost Dathive’s profile by popularizing her in the media, she&nbsp;says.</p><p>“I have been on TV, radio, and in the newspapers. SafeBoda did this so that people could get to know me and feel confident when I show up as their rider on the app,” Dathive says. <a href="https://youtu.be/QQdK1hVNVj8">Watch Dathive’s story</a></p><p>Sabina, 29, is also one of a few women in a male-dominated profession. She is a carpenter with Lynk, an on-demand labor platform based in Nairobi, Kenya. Sabina’s move into carpentry was thanks to a partnership between Lynk and BuildHer, a social enterprise that equips women in Kenya with vocational and life&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Sabina’s experience points to the types of training that might be needed to set women up for success with platform work outside of vocational training alone. She told us that the training she received taught her life skills and coping strategies that she could apply beyond her profession as a carpenter. This is worth investigating further if there is a possibility to help more women succeed on platforms by seeing what types of training they&nbsp;need.</p><p>“BuildHer taught me the basics of life skills, the career itself, carpentry and joinery, and how to cope with life.” — Sabina, Lynk carpenter, Nairobi</p>Sabina<p>After completing the training and employment program with BuildHer, Sabina began working full time as a carpenter for Lynk. She spoke of how hard it was initially when she had just joined the platform. “When you come to the workshop, [men’s] first impression is like, ‘Really? Like really, can you make anything?’” Sabina&nbsp;says.</p><p>She adds that Lynk helped to create an environment where she could thrive as a female carpenter. The platform played a critical role in further developing the skills she needed to be able to prove herself through her competence in the profession. The platform work has become Sabina’s passion and only source of income. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/sabina/">Watch Sabina’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>After graduating from the University of Lagos with a degree in Chemical Engineering, Anastestia (Ann), 24, found it challenging to find a job. As she sent out job applications after job applications, a friend suggested she think more laterally. Having seen the success of some of her friends on platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, Ann thought, “Okay, I can do this,&nbsp;too.”</p><p>When Ann realized that she could make good money as a coder, she began to teach herself the basics of coding. She is now part of a small but steadily growing number of female developers in Africa. <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/e358c23f-afe3-49c5-a509-034257688580/e-Conomy-Africa-2020.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=nmuGYF2">Recent statistics</a> show that only one in five developers in Africa is female. She quickly fell in love with the work and loves that she’s making it as a young Nigerian woman in a male-dominated industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Ann’s&nbsp;story</a></p> Social commerce: An easy (and free) choice for female entrepreneurs <p>For platform sellers like Gloria, Mary, and Dorcas, social media sites like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and YouTube reduce the barriers to entering the world of platform selling. Women often face these barriers when setting up their own business or engaging in offline work, like a lack of capital and having to balance work with childcare responsibilities.</p><p>Social selling has provided Mary, 24, a young entrepreneurial farmer in Kenya, with the flexibility to earn an income while caring for her young son as a single parent. She already owned a computer and a phone and didn’t need much else to start her own YouTube channel, through which she shares farming best practices and promotes her mushroom and strawberry businesses. She cross-posts these videos on her Facebook page and then moves conversations with interested buyers over to WhatsApp. These channels helped her connect with buyers during the pandemic when the markets were closed. Mary is also looking forward to earning money from her YouTube channel once she reaches the 1000-follower mark, the minimum number of subscribers one must have before their channel is monetized. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/mary/">Watch Mary’s&nbsp;story</a></p><p>For Dorcas, 41, in Nairobi, platforms have helped her overcome the limitations of lupus that keeps her mostly housebound. She started by baking and selling cakes on Facebook and WhatsApp and has since managed to expand her home-based business to include shoes. She relies on her social networks and various Facebook groups as a low-cost means to find customers.</p>Dorcas<p>“90% of my sales are generated from Facebook. And then the few who do not buy, they give exposure. So, you find someone who will refer my page to someone else. So that’s how my business grows.” — Dorcas, social commerce entrepreneur, Nairobi. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">Watch Dorcas’s&nbsp;Story</a></p><p>For Gloria, 30, social commerce represented a flexible way to diversify her income, something that became critical when she lost her job just before the outbreak of COVID-19. While doing her full-time job, Gloria co-founded House of Penda, a Kampala-based company, as a side business selling fashion accessories through Facebook. It became her only source of income during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/kemi/">Watch Gloria’s&nbsp;story</a></p> The tension behind the flexibility of online&nbsp;work <p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender/">Some studies</a> have discussed the tensions of “flexible” platform work and raised questions regarding the expectations of women that it perpetuates, specifically in handling both full-time obligations in the home along with platform work. An ODI <a href="https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/resource-documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">study</a> found that women gig workers in Kenya and South Africa identified childcare as the biggest challenge to their economic opportunities, along with work–life balance and the decreasing quality of their&nbsp;work.</p>Mary and her&nbsp;son<p>The women engaged in this project confirmed this tension. On the one hand, many of them talked about how platform work has offered a level of flexibility that enables them to choose when, where, and how to work. For Dathive, a single mother of four, for example, the flexibility that comes with her ride-hailing job enables her to head out early in the morning, drop students to school and workers to work, then return home in time to give her children breakfast and get them to school, too. She is glad that the money she makes from SafeBoda is enough to provide her children’s needs.</p><p>Four of the seven women in this project are single mothers. They talked about the challenges of splitting time between work and children on top of the responsibility of being the sole breadwinners for the&nbsp;family.</p><p>Mary, for example, explained how she needed to be online regularly to connect with her customers. She said it consumes a lot of time away from her&nbsp;family.</p><p>On the whole, despite the challenges, the platform experience for these women was positive. Even during the pandemic, they earned some income by doing work they enjoy through platforms.</p><p>However, the many unique challenges women face as they engage in platform-based work should not be overlooked. Platforms and policymakers should recognize the gendered aspects of platform labor and devise ways to improve women’s platform livelihood opportunities.</p><p>This year, Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will embark on a multi-country study to further explore the intertwining of gender in digital work, aiming to make specific recommendations for programmatic and policy engagement. We look forward to sharing more on this important topic.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy59hX8paPYDHbfOg9mJ8J1jt">Watch all the videos from the project&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/womens-platform-livelihoods-balancing-the-opportunity-with-the-myth-of-flexibility-4b08cf05da44">Women’s platform livelihoods: Balancing the opportunity with the myth of flexibility</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Miranda Grant and Grace Natabaalo</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital and Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design</a>, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, embarked on a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project </a>that put 11 young Africans who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the center of their own story. For two months, the seven women and four men in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda shared their experiences as platform workers and&nbsp;sellers.</p><p>A key theme that stood out in these stories was the prevalence of “side hustles” — money-earning businesses, gigs, or jobs undertaken in addition to a person’s primary business or employment. With personal needs and families to take care of, along with the economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many platform workers and sellers have taken on side hustles in the form of additional platform work or the pursuit of off-platform ventures. Below, we share insights on these side hustles as shared through their video&nbsp;diaries.</p> 1. Hustling across platforms <p>Many platform workers and sellers operate across various digital platforms, also known as multi-homing. As singular platform work often fails to provide enough income, workers and sellers are driven to sign up to multiple platforms. Studies by <a href="https://fair.work/wp-content/uploads/sites/131/2020/12/Fairwork-2020-Annual-Report.pdf">Fairwork</a>, for example, have found that many gig workers still earn below minimum&nbsp;wages.</p><p>In early 2020, David, 28, took up a motorcycle delivery rider gig with Solar Taxi, a ride-hailing and courier company in Accra that uses solar-powered cars, tricycles, and motorbikes. David secured the bike on a hire purchase agreement and has to make monthly payments. To meet his payment target of $7 a week, David tells us he had to sign up to other platforms, including Wote, Bolt Food, and Enrout, on top of riding for Solar Taxi. But even then, David is worried that the money he earns from across these platforms is not enough for him to fulfill his big dreams, one of which is to start a&nbsp;family.</p><blockquote>“I stay online as and when a trip comes. I accept whether on Bolt, on Solar Taxi, or on Enrout. I accept them and then I run,” he&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nairobi, Dorcas, 41, sells cakes and children’s shoes across multiple social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In Uganda, Gloria, 30, does the same, selling fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Although they are already using various platforms to help increase sales, they are both planning to set up their own websites as yet another way to reach more customers.</p><blockquote>“I want to set up a website especially for the cake business. I want to make it big but still, home-based. Because I have been asked by so many people if I can tutor them on how to do just basic cakes. I can go to where they are and then just maybe tutor or even take advantage of online and then just do either Zoom classes or Google class,” Dorcas&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>Even online freelancer Anastestia, 24, who is a software developer and still new to online work, knows that creating a profile on more than one platform pays off. She is toggling Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal, and Freelance.com. She sees Upwork as her main hustle as it is where she gets most of her jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/_GUOh_CZ9fI">Watch Anastestia’s story</a></p> 2. “Double-up your side hustle” and move&nbsp;offline <p>Some of the workers also balance on-platform work with off-platform side hustles, using the flexibility platform work offers to run and set up other businesses.</p><p>On top of being a rider for three apps, David is also an independent delivery guy and takes calls from customers off the platforms. However, despite working across multiple platforms and independently, he is still looking for additional means of earning&nbsp;money.</p><blockquote>“There are bigger projects I want to do which this one cannot fund. So, what I will do is to add more avenues to make money so that I can actually see my dreams come true,” David&nbsp;shares.</blockquote><p>Peter, 35, drives for Bolt and Taxify in Nigeria. A few months ago, he invested what money, time, and energy he had left into a 2000-bird poultry farm. If COVID-19 has taught him anything, it’s that you need to have a Plan B. He sees the poultry farm as a more stable investment than his platform&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“You need to double up your hustle. You need to look for strategies and ways apart from what you’ve been thinking. You need to think a step or two steps ahead just to achieve or get the pursuit of your goals,” Peter&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>In Nigeria, Okoli Edwin, 20, who runs a physical shop selling solar products, tried to expand his business online through Jumia and Jiji at the onset of the pandemic. He assumed there would be a surge in solar panel demand as people would be quarantined and in need of consistent power supply. However, what he had not accounted for was the stretched pocket of buyers in a strained economic year. Okoli said he went online to look for ideas on how to make extra cash and came across forex trading. Now, Okoli takes forex trading classes online and watches the markets through his phone for any potential investments and&nbsp;deals.</p><blockquote>“It got to a time where everything was just crazy — no more resources, we were out of stock, we couldn’t supply the customers. I fell down, really bad because how am I going to feed my family? How am I gonna do a lot of things? And so, I thought to myself, ‘Man, I had to get a side hustle. I had to look for another thing to do,’” Okoli&nbsp;says.</blockquote><p>For Gloria, what used to be her digital side hustle has now become her only source of income. In 2019, she and a friend founded House of Penda, a social commerce store that sells fashion accessories through Facebook and WhatsApp. Back then, she still had a full-time job in brand marketing and considered House of Penda as her side business. When the pandemic hit, Gloria lost her job; she has, since then, focused on growing House of Penda. However, as it struggles to make enough money, she is now looking out for branding gigs and also applying for full-time jobs.</p><blockquote>“I told everyone that hey, I’m available for gigs. I’m passionate about brand and communications. Tell someone that you know someone, mention my name, and that you know someone who’s really good at this. That was my strategy, get gigs and hope to God that a job comes along,” Gloria&nbsp;shares.</blockquote> 3. The struggle for those who don’t have a Plan&nbsp;B Stanley<p>Workers who are not able to find or take on side hustles are fully reliant on the work that comes through the platform, leaving them vulnerable when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Stanley, 35, previously a cleaner on Lynk, an on-demand labor platform in Kenya, relied on the platform as his sole source of income. In fact, as part of an incubation program, Lynk even paid him a monthly stipend and bonuses. However, despite its best efforts, Lynk was forced to halt its cleaning services a month into the pandemic, leaving Stanley with no work and no income. Stanley says this has taught him a lesson — “Have a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C, and even a Plan&nbsp;D.”</p><p>As Muthoni Mwaura’s Kenyan <a href="https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/handle/123456789/12985">study found</a>, “The notion of side hustling is particularly important for understanding youth livelihoods in contemporary contexts” because it helps to understand how young people make meaning of themselves and opportunities around them in extreme socioeconomic conditions. Listening to the platform workers and sellers over two months has revealed how having a side hustle — whether working across platforms or juggling on-platform and off-platform work — is key to surviving and thriving across digital platforms.</p><p>However, this also points to the shortcomings of platform work, and should make us question if this work is really dignified. Should people have to frantically piece together so many sources of income to earn a living? Does this make platform work meaningful or fulfilling?</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-of-young-people-in-africa-the-hustle-is-real-c566b3b3a7f9">Platform livelihoods of young people in Africa: “The hustle is real”</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>By Miranda Grant, Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>In October 2020, Caribou Digital engaged my production company, Nairobi-based <a href="http://www.storyby.design">Story x Design, </a>to produce a <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">participatory video storytelling project</a> that put 11 people who earn their livelihood from digital platforms at the center of their own story. We are passionate about innovative storytelling methods and were able to apply our experience in user-generated content and production skills training to design and implement the&nbsp;project.</p><p>This project was a continuation of Caribou Digital’s ongoing work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">platform livelihoods</a>. At the onset of COVID-19, Caribou Digital initiated <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/covid-19-and-the-platform-livelihoods-of-young-african-workers-f0b5efa1d9c">a series of conversations</a> with platform workers and sellers in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda about how the pandemic had impacted their lives. This storytelling project brought to life the stories of 12 workers through video&nbsp;diaries.</p><p>My company provided the workers with training on videography skills, equipped them with decent camera phones, and provided ongoing narrative mentorship to empower the participants to tell their stories over a period of two months. Through a series of short self-shot videos, each participant shared their real-life experiences as digital laborers during the pandemic.</p><p>In this blog, we share our methodology, including successes, challenges, and tips for those who are interested in running in a similar&nbsp;project.</p> Methodology <p>During the project design phase, we discussed how the participants would submit their footage; we decided that issuing a smartphone would be our best chance for success. It would also be an incentive to participate in the project. The 12 participants were sent a Samsung A21s smartphone, chosen for the quality of its camera and for its price. We locked the phone at the start of the project using <a href="https://preyproject.com/">Prey</a>, a software that can remotely control and secure the&nbsp;phone.</p><p>Upon successful completion of the project, each phone was unlocked and ownership was transferred to the participant. A small octopus tripod, a Bluetooth selfie stick, a lapel microphone, and a selfie light were also distributed to each participant. This small production kit was designed to increase the production value of the video recordings and aid skills development.</p><p>For their contribution to the project, each participant received three payments tied to the delivery of a video for each chapter. The payments were a recognition of the time invested by the participants in the project while doing their platform work. In addition to their smartphone kit, they also received internet data bundles for&nbsp;uploads.</p><p>It was important in the project design phase to ensure the project was designed in an ethical and respectful way. We clearly outlined the terms of the engagement through a formal agreement form and gathered the informed consent of each participant for the usage of their image and likeness. This process also allowed the participants an opportunity to voice concerns about how their story would be edited and disseminated. A few participants told us they did not want to film their families and others drew boundaries in terms of time commitment. Knowing this upfront helped us work together with respect and understanding.</p><p>Through an agile approach, we engaged the participants in three ways: via video skills development, one-on-one narrative mentoring, and through a participatory, post-production process.</p><p>Video Skills Training — Using WhatsApp, we ran a series of one-on-one training sessions on how to record video using their phone. The participants were asked to submit video samples before the training that were used as examples to identify common mistakes. Afterward, they were taught how to stabilize the camera, record clean audio, and capture shots to build a scene. We created a series of training videos and supporting graphics that were shared on WhatsApp, and then re-shared when a participant needed a specific reminder to, for example, turn their radio off while recording a video&nbsp;diary.</p><p>Narrative Mentorship — To support the storytelling outcomes, our mentor Abu “Sensei” Majid worked remotely with each participant to help them identify and express stories important to their lives. Through WhatsApp messaging and Google Duo video sessions, Abu spoke to the participants weekly for two months. This organic dialogue built trust and confidence, while empowering participants to self-direct their own story. Guided by <a href="https://scottdistillery.medium.com/dan-harmon-the-heros-journey-and-the-circle-theory-of-story-b64bb77d6976">Dan Harmon’s popular 8 story circle structure</a>, Abu and I crafted a series of standard narrative prompts for the participants. As we received material back, we adapted the narrative model to the nuances of each person’s evolving&nbsp;story.</p><p>Participatory Post-Production — The participants shared their video diaries and original video footage primarily through Google Drive, <a href="https://wetransfer.com/">WeTransfer</a>, and <a href="https://send-anywhere.com">Send Anywhere</a>. The upload to cloud platforms was often stalled by unreliable internet access. Our post-production team downloaded the files to review and edit the material, sharing previews and follow-up questions with each participant in real-time. This structure helped the participants maintain ownership of their story without the need for high-level technical skills. Our team found Google Drive challenging as a cloud platform for video editing because it lacked file prioritization functionality and slowed down the back-and-forth feedback&nbsp;loop.</p> Successes <p>Overall, the project succeeded in capturing a variety of otherwise underrepresented voices in a unique and timely way. We produced and published 23 video chapters over the course of two months. That’s 92 minutes of content created remotely by a small production team and first-time self-shooters in quite a short period of time. Some of the specific successes include:</p>  One-on-one Mentoring — The greatest success of the project design was the inclusion of the role of Story Mentor from the very beginning. Abu was the only touchpoint for all the participants, which reduced any confusion and streamlined communication. Abu delivered one-on-one skills training using WhatsApp audio and video, Google Duo App, and occasionally, traditional network carrier phone calls when experiencing internet downtime. In these calls, he provided narrative guidance and contributed to the project management, ensuring the success of the&nbsp;project.  Empowered Voices — Eleven of the 12 participants successfully delivered three video chapters showing a strong level of engagement as self-driven storytellers. Some participants were quick to engage and able to share their story readily. Others were slower to unfold. But as the participants gained technical skills and saw we were treating their story with respect, confidence grew. By the third chapter, Mary Ikigu, 24, politely declined our prompts and self-directed her entire shoot, a significant milestone in our&nbsp;eyes.  Intimate Stories Captured — The stories captured went deeper than conventional reportage or research would permit. Video highlights include a COVID-19-related funeral, a wedding, and a genuine, real-time emotion that help audiences engage more deeply with the participants’ lived experience. For example, Stanley Shiafu, 34, was an on-demand cleaner with Lynk Kenya who lost his work during the COVID-19 pandemic. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/stanley-story-coming-soon/">Watch his three chapters&nbsp;here.</a>   Challenges and how they were&nbsp;overcome <p>We knew the project was ambitious. The 12 participants live in four countries and two time zones. By the nature of their work, they are busy people with mouths to feed and lives to live. This storytelling project, though compensated, was always going to be a big ask. But we learned a lot and, by all accounts, so did the participants. Some of the challenges include the following:</p><p>B-roll — B-roll is footage that is laid over interviews or video diaries. It illustrates the story being told. For example, Dorcas Mutheu, 41, runs a cake business, so visuals of her baking, decorating, and boxing her product were important to show her work. We trained the participants in basic video conventions such as the different purpose of establishing and close-up shots. Also, because we wanted the project to be as collaborative as possible, we resisted being prescriptive about what B-roll participants should be filming. However, it became clear that recording video diaries was fairly easy for most to do and that filming B-roll of their lives was more challenging. Through continual briefings, resending our video instructions, and eventually, sending specific shot lists, we were able to co-create each story in a visually engaging&nbsp;way.</p><p>Deadlines and Incentives — Between the ambitious two-month timeline and the demands of their lives, the engagement of the participants varied over time. We found it was difficult for most of them to upload enough content to meet the tight edit turnaround. We decided we needed to incentivize them to meet their deadline by offering a small cash transfer via mobile money in addition to their agreed installment fee. This worked really well and about two-thirds of the participants uploaded on&nbsp;time.</p><p>Data Uploads — The upload of video files was challenging for all participants, particularly those in rural areas where internet speeds were slow. Stanley, for example, had to commute to a nearby town to access good upload speeds. Okoli Edwin Chimereze, 20, an ecommerce entrepreneur, had to go to cyber cafés in Lagos to help with faster internet. When it became clear the upload was slowing down the Google Drive production workflow and frustrating the participants, we distributed additional data bundles, some of which needed to be reloaded for each chapter. We also encouraged use of alternative file transfer websites like WeTransfer and Send Anywhere. However, this meant organizing the files manually, which consumed a lot of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Language Barrier — It became evident that a lot of communication was lost in translation with one participant. She was getting frustrated and unmotivated, so we translated her prompt questions to her mother tongue and hired a translator for one-on-one calls. This made for easier, efficient one-on-one training sessions. Her subsequent video submissions were of greater depth and&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Insecurity — Showing where you live and work was an important part of gathering B-roll. However, this was not always possible or safe. One participant was treated with aggression while filming on the streets of Kampala during a tense political climate. We worked with her to find creative ways to film while reducing her exposure. Also, two of our participants were mugged during the course of the project and had their phones stolen. While we had installed a lock-out software on the phone in the case of such a scenario, we were only briefly able to trace the locations of the two stolen phones. Fortunately, we were able to retrieve the data remotely. We had a contingency budget, so we re-issued the phones to keep the two participants on&nbsp;track.</p> Tips for others considering using this technique <p>This innovative participatory approach is exciting for the participants and engaging for audiences. When used in combination with more traditional research or reportage methods, it has a great deal of potential to unlock surprising insights. However, there are a few things to consider before embarking on your project&nbsp;design.</p>  Set clear expectations. We drew up a clear project agreement and informed consent document, which each participant signed, scanned, and sent back to us. However, we didn’t make clear how much time we would expect people to put into the project. The time it takes to produce a video, particularly the B-roll overlay footage, often surprises newcomers to video. It would have been helpful to communicate a conservative estimate of hours the project would require. In hindsight, we estimate each chapter took the participants approximately eight hours to plan, film, and upload. In addition to training and communication time, the average time spent on the project was about 30 hours per participant. For most, the remuneration was fair. However, it still would have been better to estimate and communicate how much time this would actually equate&nbsp;to.  Try to be realistic. Participatory projects like this have a huge payoff in terms of the originality and access to the stories that are shared. However, they also take a lot more concerted effort and time. Our two-month timeline was probably too ambitious for the amount of content we co-created. We could have done with a third more month, a third less participants, a third more staff, or a third less videos. If you’re looking to undertake a similar project, set your goals high and then add a third more resources!  Stay agile. No, really, stay agile. Flexibility and improvisation are central to a participatory approach. The project design was premised on producing and publishing three discrete video chapters per person. For some people, their story naturally unfolded over time and the three-chapter format made sense to track their journey. For example, Peter Maraizu Ogbonna, 35, a taxi driver in Lagos, captured the construction of his new poultry farm side-hustle over the course of two months. For others, such as Onyinyechukwu Anastestia Onyekaba, 24, a software developer also in Lagos, her story was more compellingly told in just one compressed chapter. The decision to vary the number of chapters edited per participant was made in the last days of the project, triggering a furor of re-editing but ultimately making the content more engaging for audiences across a variety of platforms. Also, one participant found the challenge to record B-roll and in-depth video diaries too difficult to manage with his end-of-year work commitments, so we collectively decided to end his involvement in the project without any video output. While disappointing, we had anticipated there would be a level of attrition and were pleased 11 of the 12 participants successfully engaged with the demands of the&nbsp;project.   Conclusion <p>This participatory process has led me to feel deeply connected to 12 people I’ve never met. In fact, because Abu was the only person to speak directly to each person, I’ve never even spoken to them. After a hard year for most people around the world, and a particularly hard year for my production business and the creatives I work with, this project was a deeply healing&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Without even realizing the impact they would have, these 12 participants took on a huge new challenge. They learned new skills. They bravely bared their souls. They said “Yes” at a time when the world was consumed by anxiety. I personally think this is very cool. Not only do they offer important insights into the reality of work on digital platforms, but by sharing their stories, they also validate the struggles of millions like them, surviving and thriving even during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">Watch all the videos&nbsp;here</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-11c38e746b2e">A platform of their own: Our experience running a participatory video storytelling project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The Growth of Artificial Intelligence in Identity Governance 

<p>Organizations are facing increasing pressure to provide employees and contractors with the right access to the right applications and systems at the right time. But how can they do this with their existing, manually-driven Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions and processes? How can security and IT professionals address the needs of the new remote workforce and its demands for access to new cloud applications and services? Combined with new machine identity types, accelerated DevOps/Agile development methodologies, and unplanned organizational changes, static IGA solutions and processes need to become more flexible, more dynamic, and more automated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the introduction of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into IGA</a>, organizations have a clear path to hyper-automating their existing identity governance solution and processes. By applying AI and ML, enterprises can further streamline and automate intelligence across all identity governance use cases, including access requests and approvals, access reviews, and role engineering. Here are a few examples of how AI and ML can<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga"> hyper-automate IGA</a> solutions and processes to help combat your organization’s entitlement creep problems:&nbsp;</p>

  Identify access risks across the entire organization and provide actionable insights to help accelerate the removal of overprivileged access 
	 Identify excessive privileges, orphaned accounts, and provide confidence scoring (example: low, medium, and high) in order to provide the right level of security risk context&nbsp; 
	 Enable micro-certifications, where only a small set of entitlements and roles are approved between annual or biannual certification campaigns 
 <p>While no new technology is 100% foolproof, the introduction of AI and ML capabilities into <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance solutions</a> and processes provides organizations with the most promising way to address the silent access challenge known as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-entitlement-creep">entitlement creep</a>.</p>

 ForgeRock’s Modern Approach: Autonomous Identity&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">ForgeRock Autonomous Identity</a> provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility. The solution allows organizations to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">accelerate secure workforce access,</a> achieve regulatory compliance, mitigate risks, and reduce costs. By leveraging AI and&nbsp; ML techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data to identify security access and risk blind spots. The solution provides organizations with a complete user access landscape view – what good and bad access looks like across the entire enterprise. It provides organizations with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations, such as the removal of overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts.&nbsp;</p>

 How it Works 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood that an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization. By applying AI and ML techniques, Autonomous Identity can quickly analyze all your organization’s identity data and identify overprivileged access, excessive permissions, and orphaned accounts. All are key contributors to your organization’s entitlement creep challenges.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity? 

<p>Here’s how Autonomous Identity’s unique and highly differentiated capabilities address entitlement creep:&nbsp;</p>

  Global Visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (example: accounts, roles, assignments, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility to all identities and what they have access to, including over privileged user access. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Data Agnostic: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with all identity data types to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. By consuming and analyzing tens of millions of data points quickly, Autonomous Identity can predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. Total landscape visibility provides highly accurate models based on what good access should and shouldn’t look like, including excessive permissions. Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions that are based on static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on organizational data to develop an analysis that is free from bias originating from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your existing identity governance solution. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike other “black box” identity analytics solutions, ForgeRock Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, security and risk professionals can contextually understand what key risk indicators were met and, more importantly, why they were met. For example, why are certain employee and contractor accounts orphaned? This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
  Eliminate Entitlement Creep with AI-Driven Identity Analytics 

<p>In today’s new reality, organizations have dynamic business challenges. They need a dynamic solution to help them achieve their business goals and grow the business. By applying AI-driven identity analytics, organizations can hyper-automate their existing identity governance solutions and processes, thereby eliminating entitlement creep. By detecting user access patterns – identity analytics can quickly highlight inappropriate user access. In turn, AI-driven identity analytics can automate the removal of high-confidence and low-risk access rights, lowering the risk of entitlement creep across your organization.&nbsp;</p>

 Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for&nbsp;Hosts  Leadership &amp; Org Update&nbsp;#25 <p>When we first began this project, we shared our vision for an Internet of peer-to-peer web applications that would give users the power to direct their own online experiences. We connected with thousands of people also inspired by the possibility of removing centralising powers built into the infrastructure so that humanity might vastly expand its creative and collaborative potential.</p><p>The launch of Elemental Chat in our Alpha test certainly doesn’t get all that done. But it is a real step towards realising that promise. Elemental Chat running on HoloPorts has no central database. Each person who is running the app signs their messages to their own chain and then automatically posts them to the shared database that is hosted by the other users of the application. This is the start of something. This isn’t simply the seed of an idea. The deep roots of Holochain and Holo have fully sprouted and are now growing and strengthening.</p><p>This rapid recent growth is demonstrated in the timeline of events that led us to the current&nbsp;release.</p>  15-Sept-2020<br> <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/a-big-leap-forward-for-holochain-holo-2efaaa54ed08">We shared publicly about Holochain RSM</a>  15-Oct-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-path-from-rsm-to-beta-1fdca3f581a">We shared our Path to Beta roadmap for Holochain RSM</a>  12-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/real-p2p-networking-coming-to-holochain-rsm/">We shared about the upcoming Networking features for Holochain RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  27-Nov-2020 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/networking-has-landed/">We announced also in the Dev Pulse that Networking in RSM had&nbsp;landed</a>  24-Dec-2020 <br><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/closing-the-year-with-elemental-chat-on-holochain-rsm-105f9eede19c">We announced Elemental Chat was released to Pre-release testers</a>  29-Jan-2021 <br><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">We shared about rewriting automated test tools for RSM in the Dev&nbsp;Pulse</a>  10-Feb-2021 <br><a href="https://forum.holo.host/">We announced the release of Elemental Chat to&nbsp;Hosts</a>  <p>The speed at which we have been able to move since the launch of Holochain RSM is indicative of how quickly and easily others will also be able to bring new P2P apps to market. So let’s dig into what Elemental Chat is, what it is not and what it lets us do moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Elemental Chat is simply a proof of concept application. What we mean by that is that it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of popular messaging apps on the market today. You can create channels and you can send messages. You can also query the application network to see how many nodes are connected and how many people have the application open in a&nbsp;browser.</p><p>What you can’t do is limit what channels you see or follow, or send messages to only one person. You also can’t have reply threads, and in fact, the UI doesn’t even showcase all of the best features in Holochain. In this super-basic testing app, you see everything and can differentiate little which means a less than ideal user experience.</p><p>None of those wonderful user-friendly features are included with Elemental Chat, and that is intentional. We wanted an uncomplicated app with only a few features to avoid spending too much of our time testing and debugging a chat application, when our focus is really to build the underlying infrastructure that comprises the Holo distributed hosting platform.</p> A chat app differentiates Holochain from blockchain <p>Paul explained a few of the reasons why we chose Elemental Chat to release as the first distributed app for Holo quite nicely in the December 24 Dev&nbsp;Pulse:</p><blockquote>“First, we thought it would be more fun to test; second, we knew it would push against all of Holochain’s capabilities in ways that would show up any bugs; and third, we wanted something that would show us where the performance bottlenecks were.”</blockquote><p>But another important reason for us is because chat functionality illustrates the difference and potential of Holochain as compared to blockchain.</p><p>Releasing a chat app — even a toy app like Elemental Chat — demonstrates unequivocally that Holochain is designed for building classes of applications that could never really work on a blockchain. Think about apps where things like scalability, and speedy transactions or interactions are crucial for basic functionality. The vast majority of web apps that we use in our lives simply do not require the global consensus of a blockchain and in fact could be hampered if we try to force them into consensus models. Chat exemplifies this difference to us in the most natural of&nbsp;ways.</p><p>Imagine being at a party with 25 to 100 of your closest friends with people in small groups around a room chatting. Many different conversations are happening in the room simultaneously. You might be able to hear parts of many of them, but you are likely paying attention to one or two of them more than others. Each other person in the room is most likely doing the same — that is they are listening to the conversation they are having — not to the general humm of conversation in the entire space. Because of that, each person has their own unique experience of what is being said. I doubt anyone at that party would say there was something wrong with the way people were communicating. In fact — that very normal in-person multi-sensory type of setting is exactly what many of us have been missing this past year due to the pandemic.</p><p>So let’s talk about how a typical blockchain might try to model the communication at that party. One person (Alice) might say something. Another person (Bob) would need to process it and clarify to everyone else what was said and would record it and ensure that each other person understood it the exact same way. The first person (Alice) could not say something again until the first thing she said was processed by every person in the room. Some sort of order would need to be created for who was speaking because each statement would need to get placed in the correct order and shared with every other person in the room for the conversation to be deemed&nbsp;valid.</p><p>This sounds ludicrous — because it is. Consensus models are irrelevant for many human needs and when it comes to collaboration they are often extremely inefficient. With blockchains that inefficiency is evidenced in multiple ways but perhaps most explicitly by the extreme consumption of energy and creation of waste used to power the networks.</p><p>The reality is many applications only need to do two things really well: enable ease of coordination and reach eventual consistency.</p><p>Let’s take a look now at how Holochain’s natural patterns approach would model that same party. As you speak with a small subset of your friends, your messages are saved to your local chain. Your friends that are participating in your conversation would receive an immediate signal and hear your message. After someone’s message is saved to their local chain it is also saved to the group database or DHT. After a short while, your part of the shared database would get updated with messages from other conversations happening elsewhere in the party — and eventually you’d have access to all the gossip messages from the party. Sounds like a great and memorable party!</p><p>The use of natural patterns to model digital interaction is something that makes Holochain different — it’s why Holochain enables applications that can truly scale and why it’s ideal for collaboration. Holochain ensures agency for each user but does not require imposing a singular perspective.</p> How does Holochain work for currencies? <p>So we can see why Holochain is great for modeling a chat app, but many were expecting us to release the app that will run Holo’s cryptocurrency HoloFuel. People often ask “How can HoloFuel work without consensus?”</p><p>Imagine a bunch of parents in a community create a babysitting time swap system and have a phone app where I can credit you for three hours of babysitting, and my babysitting balance goes down by three hours when I do. Some people have provided more babysitting than they’ve received and they’d show positive balances of hours. Other folks who have received more babysitting than they’ve provided, would have a negative balance of&nbsp;hours.</p><p>If Alice needs to transfer some credits to Bob, do we really need global consensus? Do we need to know the state of every account in the system? No. Only Bob’s and Alice’s accounts are changing from this transaction, and they are the only authorities to make changes to their accounts. They can sign a single identical transaction to each of their chains (a transaction that shows Alice spending credits and Bob receiving them), and when they publish it to the rest of the network, others on the network will validate the transaction to make sure it follows the shared agreements. It is basically that simple. (Well it’s not quite that simple, but for a better understanding of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3yqYhJViCQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">how Holochain works, check out this twelve minute&nbsp;video</a>.)</p><p>This model for currency is more like peer-to-peer accounting of value, where your chain holds the history of your transactions. Not everyone is transacting in hours of babysitting but the principles of the model work exactly the same way when you replace babysitting with distributed cloud hosting as the service, and it will work that way for food, energy, and many other applications as&nbsp;well.</p> What’s Next <p>The release of Elemental Chat for hosts is an important step forward on the journey. For us though, the next infrastructure milestone is the one we’ll be doing backflips about. That is when non-hosts — regular web users — will actually get the experience of creating an account and logging into Elemental Chat that is hosted on a hosts’ HoloPort. We are already beginning the testing cycle for that milestone.</p>Roadmap<p>In the coming weeks, you can count on us to support more and more hosts to connect their ports to the Holo network and to begin chatting in Elemental Chat. We will be assessing how well the performance scales and listening to what folks have to say about&nbsp;it.</p><p>We will most likely make a few small changes to the chat app as we prepare for the wider release to web users. We will continue to evolve the testing framework so that it can be used more generally by hosted apps, not just applications we directly install on&nbsp;HPOS.</p><p>As we shared in the previous article, we are also moving forward on several of the other milestones that come after Hosted Elemental Chat. We may even be releasing the Host Console work simultaneously, but we are not promising that yet. After that, we’ll be focusing on the HoloFuel application.</p>Approx Progress on Upcoming Milestones<p>What isn’t visible from these diagrams, however, is the work on Holochain that is continuing to evolve and which is critical for both Holo and community application developers who are building apps in our ecosystem.</p><p>Holochain has been steadily improving usability of the framework. When we first announced RSM, though it was a vast improvement technically, we hadn’t started releasing to crates, nor stabilized the Holochain development kit (HDK). We have recently shipped a raft of breaking changes to the HDK which should be fairly stable now. We’ve also ‘nixified’ Holochain to make it easier to install and ensure identical installations among collaborators. You can stay current with the latest tested version via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/">Holochain.love</a>.</p><p>In the coming weeks, there will be additional improvements to Holochain. Following the changeover of the database engine, we’ll be implementing sharding and other key network scaling features before we move on to more security and identity management features. All of these are foundations necessary for the Beta release of&nbsp;Holo.</p><p>So, I will leave you with yet another shout out to all of those who are supporting this amazing work coming into being. Kudos to the dev teams for bringing this release across the finish line. Kudos to the community-facing teams who are supporting hosts getting connected to the network. Kudos to all the app devs in the community pulling for new features and demonstrating how natural patterns work in Holochain. Kudos to all the admins and volunteers who share their knowledge with newcomers to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>In gratitude,<br>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/title-elemental-chat-the-first-holochain-p2p-app-released-for-hosts-3e9f44bdcaca">Elemental Chat — The First Holochain P2P App Released for Hosts</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bloom's CTO Isaac Patka recently gave a talk at ETHDenver 2021 in which he discussed the co-evolution of the DeFi and Decentralized Identity spaces; and how Bloom is bridging the gap between them. </p><p> Watch the full talk by clicking on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/909811905?t=05h30m09s">this link</a>. &nbsp;</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; DeFi are Disconnected <p>While the markets for decentralized finance and decentralized identity are both expanding rapidly with new and novel products, the two are still largely disconnected. &nbsp;</p><p>DeFi apps are increasingly built to be interoperable amongst each other mainly due to their adherence to a single common standard, ERC20. &nbsp;This allows tokens to move between projects to contribute liquidity to Automated Market Makers, be used as collateral for loans, or provide much needed liquidity to borrowers in return for interest. &nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, decentralized identity products and services are quickly maturing into its own ecosystem, with continued collaboration between service provider members of <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> and a quickly developing standard of interoperability through W3C. &nbsp;And yet despite fast maturing markets in each sector, few solutions exist to bridge the communication and integration between these two worlds.</p> Decentralized Identity is Chain-Adjacent <p>The beauty of the decentralized identity space is that it is built on blockchain fundamentals. &nbsp;While the identity record or credential itself is created off-chain, it can rapidly be brought on-chain and converted to a digital identity solution using technologies developed by a number of innovators in the space including Sidetree and Bloom. &nbsp;Existing open-source blockchain wallet technologies already support native distribution of decentralized identities (DID). &nbsp;<a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>, for example, is a scalable DID protocol that enables interoperability with IPFS and any decentralized ledger system.</p> Bridging Decentralized Identity with DeFi <p>While decentralized identity systems can be said to be chain-adjacent, they need an intermediary to help facility the relaying of this chain-adjacent information to on-chain requestors such as DeFi applications. &nbsp;These intermediaries or so-called bridges already exist in many forms and can be leveraged to provide decentralized access to DID systems. &nbsp;Examples include Oracles, which can connect with data vaults to retrieve information specific to an individual user. &nbsp;NFT’s are another example, where unique attributes can be packaged within them and exchanged for specifically tailored services. &nbsp;Because of the rapid innovation that has occurred in the DeFi and larger blockchain space, the technology already exists to facilitate a complete ecosystem of interconnected products starting with digital identity verification to the rendering of decentralized finance products and services.</p> Decentralized Identity &amp; DeFi are Complimentary<br> <p>DeFi Has a Trust Problem</p><p> Popular DeFi lending apps like Compound and Aave have a trust problem. &nbsp;Because they collect no information on their participants, they are unable to make informed decisions on how much to lend, what interest rate to charge, and for how long the loan should be extended. &nbsp;Instead, they must treat all participants with the same level of risk, and thus require significant sums of collateral, in exchange for loans. &nbsp;This means that borrowers must already possess more than the value of cryptocurrency they are asking to borrow, making DeFi lending impractical for participants who own little to no cryptocurrency. &nbsp;</p><p>To compound this issue, regulations in the cryptocurrency space are quickly expanding and evolving. &nbsp;According to the FATF “Travel Rule,” Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are required to verify the identities of individuals using their products in an effort to curb the financing of terrorism. &nbsp;DeFi platforms are unlikely to successfully skirt these regulations based on the technicality that they are “decentralized.” &nbsp;While most operate in a decentralized manner, they are still subject to regulatory enforcement. &nbsp;For example, Compound has equity investors and therefore must have a base of operations and an entity to which these original equity contracts were signed. &nbsp;This means it can be subject to the same regulatory requirements that are required by traditional financial institutions. &nbsp;Thus, DeFi platforms like Compound are very likely to be required to adhere to Travel Rule regulations, necessitating eventual screening of participants.</p><p>Decentralized Identity has an Adjacency Problem</p><p>Even with the strides made within the decentralized identity ecosystem, including new use cases in a variety of different industries, their widespread use is still limited. &nbsp;The decentralized identity space is poised to deliver a myriad of novel solutions to the world of distributed ledger applications; but its dependency on decentralized apps that are still finding traction means it may take some time to find adoption.</p><p>However, the one blockchain sector that has proven scale and usage is DeFi. &nbsp;It has an immediate need and demand for decentralized identity solutions and is perfectly suited to be paired with such platforms. &nbsp;It’s immediate need from both a consumer demand and regulatory compliance standpoint means that it is an ideal first-mover fit with current DID solutions. &nbsp;Bloom is just one of the many decentralized identity management platforms that offers highly-performant solutions to bridge the gap between DeFi and DID systems. &nbsp;Other examples exist which we will discuss.<br></p> How Decentralized Identity is Being Used<br> <p>Health Data Passports</p><p>Currently the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is exploring methods in which travelers can move across borders freely without concern for further COVID spread and transmission. &nbsp;IATA has proposed the use of a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-23-01/">Travel Pass</a> which will contain testing information on travelers in a verified and secure way. &nbsp;Travel Pass itself is based on IATA’s OneID, an initiative endorsed by resolution at its 75th Annual General Meeting to help securely facilitate travel through the use of a single identity token. &nbsp;It is one of the first of its kind to retain passenger identity information on a device, specifically managed and permissioned by the traveler, ensuring privacy through a decentralized identity management solution. &nbsp;OneID serves as the base for Travel Pass.</p><p>Employment Information</p><p><a href="https://truu.id/">Truu</a> is an example of a platform that facilitates the simplified management of employment information through the use of a decentralized identity management system. &nbsp;It collaborates with regulatory bodies, central National Health Service (UK) organizations and trusts to provide a digital passport for healthcare professionals. &nbsp;It builds a comprehensive record that includes identity information, qualifications, workplace-based assessments, medical licensing, and employment information all as separately verified credentials. &nbsp;Truu enables employers to make fast decisions on employment without the inefficiencies in tracking down records and other documents or managing communications between a variety of different data sources. &nbsp;This is especially helpful in circumstances where rapid medical deployment is necessary such as in pandemic situations where medical professionals are being moved and employed between new job sites in any given day of the week. &nbsp;Credentials are held digitally within a professional’s mobile device ensuring privacy and enabling specific dissemination of information on an as-needed basis. &nbsp;Truu runs on Everynym’s distributed ledger technology and is a founding-member of Sovrin, a nonprofit organization enabling self-sovereign identity on the internet.</p> Credit, Income, KYC Data<br> <p>Bloom continues to set the benchmark for how digital identity can be leveraged by decentralized financial institutions. &nbsp;Bloom works by securing an individual’s digital identity information through receipt of verified credentials from an issuing body. &nbsp;From there, it allows an individual to interact with various DeFi platforms that request and require identity information on its users to provide specifically tailored services such as credit facilities or to simply pass KYC checks as required by law. &nbsp;Bloom’s DID platform provides several methods in which third-party applications can access DID data and isn’t specifically limited to DeFi uses cases. &nbsp;It can function wherever DID is needed, and the technology is expandable to support other use cases where personalized information needs to be made sharable but private at the same time.</p> Building Solutions<br> <p>Digital identity management systems enable DeFi platforms to perform KYC. However, in the spirit of DeFi, just as cryptocurrencies used to interact with these platforms are held non-custodially, the digital identity data can also be processed in a non-custodial manner. &nbsp;In fact, according to information provided by the original author of KYC legislation, financial institutions need not store a copy of information used to perform KYC, only evidence that such KYC checks have occurred. &nbsp;This means DeFi platforms can maintain the highest levels of security and privacy by reducing risks of “honey pot” hacks, while greatly improving user experience.</p><p>DID systems also provide a gateway to unsecured lending. &nbsp;They help transition existing CeFi users on platforms like BlockFi and Celsius over to non-custodial DeFi platforms, enabling the benefits of CeFi without its risks and drawbacks.</p><p>The industry is ripe for exploration with new use cases and innovations being rolled out regularly. &nbsp;If there is something you want to build at the intersection of decentralized identity and crypto we’d love to hear from you.</p><p>Contact: <a href="mailto:isaac@bloom.co">isaac@bloom.c</a>o</p><p>Telegram: @IsaacPatka</p><p>Github: <a href="https://github.com/ipatka">https://github.com/ipatka</a></p><p>DIF Banking &amp; Finance SIG: <a href="https://lists.identity.foundation/g/finance-sig">https://lists.identity.foundation/g/finance-sig</a><br><br><br></p>

<p>IMPULSE (Identity Management in PUbLic SErvices) is an european project led by Gradiant – Research and Technology Organization (RTO) focused on connectivity, intelligence, and security technologies – and involving 16 entities from 9 different countries, including InfoCert.</p>



<p>The alliance will work on the concept of Electronic Identity (eID) – the way users can identify themselves (and be identified) through the network – and its implications in multiple contexts – through the use of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The current health crisis around the world has limited personal interactions, digitising all kinds of procedures. This brings a number of problems, not only for those unfamiliar with the complex identification systems on the internet, but also for those who are not comfortable providing their personal data over the internet.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in a world where it is increasingly common to carry out all kinds of processes online, avoiding fraud and deception is only possible with first-class technology.</p>



<p>InfoCert and the other 15 partners involved in the project aims to create a tool which combines two of the most promising technologies available today, such as Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain networks, with the aim of improving the management of digital identity and electronic identification in the public sector.</p>



<p>The application of these technologies in the field of digital identity will substantially improve the existing electronic identification systems at the time legal, privacy or social issues requiring further analysis may raise.</p>



<p>IMPULSE will incorporate advanced face biometrics and document validation techniques based on AI to facilitate identification processes and provide the user with a digital onboarding experience that is fully transparent.</p>



<p>In addition, blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts will allow adding trustworthiness in the process, providing mechanisms for users to demonstrate their identity without the need to disclose their personal data to third parties, a priori, not reliable.</p>



<p>The consortium, made up of partners from Spain, Italy, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland, Iceland, France and Denmark, is funded by the European Union with €4 million under the Horizon 2020 programme.</p>

Source: <a href="https://polkadot.network/">https://polkadot.network/</a><blockquote>Note: This article provides a general and slightly technical introduction to Parachains and indicates how to get started building a Substrate based blockchain which can be launched as Parachain in the Kusama &amp; Polkadot ecosystem. It will explain some parts of Polkadot but it won’t get too much into specific details like staking, slashing or other important mechanics in the ecosystem. Check out the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/">official wiki</a> to learn more about Polkadot.</blockquote> Status quo <p>First of all it is important to mention that the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-parachains">Parachain</a> functionality is not live yet. This functionality is the last missing piece of the Polkadot <a href="https://github.com/polkadot-io/polkadotpaper/raw/master/PolkaDotPaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> and there is a public <a href="https://polkadot.network/launch-parachains/">rollout plan</a> available that provides an overview about the progress. However, <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/introducing-rococo-polkadots-parachain-testnet-e3e67fc40b56">since August 2020</a> the Parachain functionality is being tested in the official Parachain Testnet Rococo which in V0 only ran with prototype code. In December 2020 <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">Rococo V1 was launched</a> and recently Plasm Network <a href="https://medium.com/plasm-network/announcing-plasm-network-parachain-on-rococo-v1-bf49b3f3ca53">announced to be the first project that joined the Rococo V1 Testnet</a> which surely is a big milestone as the codebase of Rococo V1 will also be used in Kusama and Polkadot. Meanwhile other possible future Parachains like KILT <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/kilts-path-to-parachains-ad3be644db8a">followed and announced their own&nbsp;Roadmap</a>.</p> Kusama vs.&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Although Kusama can be seen as the pre-production environment for Polkadot you should be aware that Kusama might and probably will evolve independently from Polkadot. If your project is in an early stage or you want to experiment with Parachains in a real world environment before moving it into production you will probably prefer Kusama over Polkadot first. You might also be interested in testing specific features in Kusama which aren’t yet available on Polkadot.</p>Source: <a href="https://polkadot.network/">https://polkadot.network/</a> Relay Chain &amp; Parachains <p>The Relay Chain is the central chain of Polkadot. All validators of Polkadot are staked on the Relay Chain in DOT and validate for the Relay Chain. It has deliberately minimal functionality and its main responsibility is to coordinate the system as a whole, including Parachains. Other specific work is delegated to the Parachains that serve different purposes. All Parachains that are connected to the Relay Chain share the same security. Polkadot also has a shared state between the Relay Chain and all connected Parachains to ensure the validity of the entire system. Smart Contracts are not supported on the Relay Chain but can be supported by Parachains.</p><blockquote>It’s expected that each Parachain will be as light and application specific as possible and serve a specific use&nbsp;case.</blockquote>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-path-of-a-parachain-block-47d05765d7a">The Path of a Parachain Block</a> it is described in detail how a new Parachain Block is produced.</p><p>You may notice the term Parathread in the picture above. The current (optimistic) assumption is that the Relay Chain supports up to 100 Parachains and some of these Parachain slots will be permanently reserved to serve the network on system level (e.g. Governance). Thus there probably won’t be enough slots available for all projects which is why they need to be obtained in a so-called auction (more on that below). Whereas Parachains get a guaranteed high throughput by bonding DOT tokens, Parathreads follow a <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">pay as you go model</a> where a fee in DOT is being paid to validators for creating blocks. In some cases this even makes sense if there aren’t many or high frequent state updates expected (e.g. DNS, Oracles).</p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06">https://medium.com/polkadot-network/parathreads-pay-as-you-go-parachains-7440d23dde06</a><p>Parachains can become Parathreads and vice versa as they share the same technical base.</p> Parachain Slot Auction &amp; Parachain Crowdloans <p>In order to become a Parachain in Kusama or Polkadot a slot must be obtained in a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-auction">Parachain Slot Auction</a>. Each slot duration is capped to 2 years and divided into 6-month lease periods. Parachains may lease more than one slot over time in order to extend their lease to Polkadot past the 2 year slot duration. Depending on the auction it might be possible that a slot is owned by 4 different Parachains during the 2 year slot duration.</p><blockquote>Parachains don’t need to always inhabit the same slot. As long as a Parachain inhabits any slot it can continue as Parachain.</blockquote><p>Parachain candidates can place bids in unpermissioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_auction">candle auctions</a> that rely on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function">verifiable random functions</a> (VRFs) where the original mechanism has been slightly modified to be secure on a blockchain. The auction can be divided into two&nbsp;phases:</p>  Opening Phase  Closing Phase  <p>No matter in what phase the auction is, the bids are public. From the first block until the last block during the Closing Phase a winner will be determined randomly and nobody knows which block determines the winner until the Closing Phase is finished.</p><p>Projects will also be able to launch a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-crowdloans">Crowdloan Campaign</a> with specific parameters which allows them to loan DOTs from the community to obtain a Parachain slot without having to bond all the required DOTs on their&nbsp;own.</p><p>In the video above core developer Shawn Tabrizi explains both variants very&nbsp;well.</p> Substrate <p>After giving an overview about the Polkadot ecosystem it’s time to introduce Substrate. It is a modular framework that enables you to create purpose-built blockchains by composing custom and/or pre-built components.</p><p>Substrate is the foundation of all blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem and requires knowledge in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>In the Substrate Developer Hub (link below) you can learn everything that is required to get started developing your own Substrate-based chain.</p><p><a href="https://substrate.dev/">Official Substrate Documentation for Blockchain Developers · Substrate Developer Hub</a></p><p>A few important things to know about Substrate:</p>  The runtime of Substrate is referred to as the “state transition function” which contains the business logic that defines the behavior of the blockchain. You as a developer can define storage items that represent the state of the blockchain and functions that allow users to make changes to the&nbsp;state.  Substrate ships with FRAME (Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularized Entities) which is a set of modules (called Pallets) and support libraries that simplify runtime development. Pallets are individual modules within FRAME that host domain-specific logic.  To enable forkless runtime upgrade capabilities, Substrate uses runtimes that are built as WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode.  <p>To learn more about how to perform a forkless runtime upgrade you can take a look at the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/upgrade-a-chain/">official tutorial</a>.</p> Pallets vs. Smart Contracts <p>For people heading over from other chains and ecosystems like Ethereum it might be obvious that application specific logic is always written in Smart Contracts which in turn are deployed on the blockchain. But as you already learned the idea of the Polkadot ecosystem is to have different Parachains that are as light and as application specific as possible.</p><p>There are basically 3 possibilities to add custom logic to a Substrated-based blockchain:</p>  Write custom Pallets and include it in the runtime<br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/">https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/create-a-pallet/</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html">https://substrate.dev/recipes/pallets-intro.html</a>  Include the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet">Contracts Pallet</a> in the runtime and write contracts in ink! (Rust based eDSL)<br>- <a href="https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs/">https://paritytech.github.io/ink-docs</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/substrate-contracts-workshop</a>  Include Frontier (Pallets that serve as Ethereum compatibility layer) to the runtime and write contracts in Solidity<br>- <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">https://github.com/paritytech/frontier</a><br>- <a href="https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop/#/">https://substrate.dev/frontier-workshop</a>  <blockquote>Custom Pallets are the best choice if you are building a greenfield project that serves a specific purpose and needs to run its own&nbsp;network.</blockquote><p>Substrate already provides a lot of Pallets which you can combine together as needed, including your custom Pallet(s) in order to build a lightweight and unique runtime for your application specific blockchain:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/v3.0.0/frame">Default Pallets of Substrate</a> (Note: The link points to the v3.0.0 version of Substrate which was released a few days ago. Most tutorials are still based on&nbsp;v2.0.0)  <a href="https://github.com/danforbes/pallet-nft">NFT Pallet</a> (There is also a WIP reference implementation that showcases CryptoKitties on Substrate)  <p>I also discovered a <a href="https://marketplace-staging.substrate.dev/">Substrate Marketplace</a> where you are able to find different Pallets (at least the default ones) which you can include into your&nbsp;runtime.</p><p>If you aim to write contracts in ink! or port a Solidity based application from Ethereum over to a Substrate-based Parachain you don’t necessarily need to launch your own Parachain as there already exist projects that plan to launch a Parachain and include the required Pallets in their&nbsp;runtime:</p>  <a href="https://edgewa.re/">Edgeware</a> (ink! based contracts)  <a href="https://moonbeam.network/">Moonbeam</a> (Solidity contracts)  <blockquote>Note: To check out how Moonbeam works you can clone the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground">https://github.com/51nodes/moonbeam-playground</a></blockquote> Polkadot compatibility with&nbsp;Cumulus <p>When you have written (and hopefully tested&nbsp;;-)) your custom Pallets you need to make sure that you build a Polkadot compatible runtime that exposes an interface for validating its state transition and provides interfaces to send and receive messages of other Parachains.</p><p><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-cumulus">Cumulus</a> is an extension to Substrate that makes it easy to transform any Substrate-built runtime into a Polkadot-compatible Parachain. It is still in development, but the idea is that it should be simple to take a Substrate chain and add the Parachain code by importing the crates and adding a single line of code. You can also dive deeper into that topic and learn more about the mechanics of Polkadot by reading the <a href="https://w3f.github.io/parachain-implementers-guide/index.html">Parachain Implementers Guide</a>.</p><p>If you have built your own Parachain and want to join the official Rococo Testnet you have to follow <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-parachains-rococo#rococo-v1-parachain-requirements">this guide</a>. The auction mechanism mentioned above is not active yet and Rococo is currently controlled by the development leads at Parity Technologies. For joining the network you have to run at least 1 Collator for your Parachain and 1 Validator node for&nbsp;Rococo.</p><blockquote>Note: Learn how to setup a local Polkadot network based on Rococo by following the Readme of our repository: <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo">https://github.com/51nodes/polkadot-local-rococo</a></blockquote> Final Thoughts <p>Substrate has a clean design and makes it very easy to build an application specific blockchain for everyone familiar with Rust. If you decide to run your own Parachain (or Parathread) you should also think about how to incentivise other players to run a Collator node in your network — for example by introducing your own network&nbsp;token.</p><p>Although Parachains are not live on Kusama and Polkadot yet we can already see many projects that aim to become a Parachain as soon as possible. It will be interesting to watch the battle of those projects to secure their exclusive Parachain slot on Kusama and Polkadot. Personally I am very interested to see how the auction mechanism works and which projects will secure their Parachain slot via a Crowdloan Campaign.</p><p>I am also looking forward to play around with the interoperability features that Polkadot provides when the implementation is mature&nbsp;enough.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> based in Stuttgart is a provider of Crypto Economy solutions.</p><p>51nodes is member of the <a href="https://www.parity.io/announcing-substrate-delivery-partners/">Substrate Delivery Partners</a> program and supports companies and other organizations in realizing their blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/kusama-polkadot-build-an-application-specific-blockchain-and-launch-a-parachain-524ff4560acf">Kusama &amp; Polkadot: Build an application specific Blockchain and launch a Parachain!</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Join the growing list of forward-thinking companies and organizations across the globe who are actively building the future of digital identity. This is your chance to be a part of the newest and most dynamic network in decentralized identity technology, open for innovative developers and companies eager to bring their solutions to market.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>At Indicio, we’ve seen a rapid rise in demand for robust, stable, and professionally maintained networks to support decentralized identity solutions. It’s not a surprise: decentralized identity’s moment has arrived. That’s why we’ve been hard at work creating Hyperledger Indy networks upon which developers all over the world are building, testing, and launching their solutions. Powering these networks are Node Operators— companies and teams from around the world and from various industries who are designing and launching decentralized identity solutions.</p>
<p>What is a Node Operator?<br>At the heart of a decentralized identity ecosystem lies the distributed ledger— a distributed database made up of multiple copies of a ledger, hosted by various nodes. In practice at Indicio.tech, this means companies and organizations, together as a community, volunteer to run a copy of the ledger on a server that is under their authority. On the Indicio Network, we call these “Node Operators.” Together, these copies make up a verifiable data registry, from which credential issuers and verifiers can prove important information.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				  Set your solutions up for success by becoming a Node Operator 
<p></p>
<p>Be where the action is happening<br>We’re creating a community of doers, made up of companies worldwide who are creating digital identity solutions for use cases of all kinds, including banking, education, supply chain, travel, and humanitarian efforts. As a node operator, you’ll be on the frontline of the innovation, playing a leading role in this world-changing digital transformation.</p>
<p>Get access to resources<br>Node Operators are eligible to receive a complementary business support package for their first year in the program, including architectural guidance, best practice checks, an account-dedicated Slack channel, and a dedicated network engineer monitoring your environment and assisting you with your needs. We also help our node operators prepare their presentations and marketing materials for webinars and informational events.</p>
<p>Learn by doing<br>There’s no better way to get trained on how a decentralized identity ecosystem works than to play a critical role in the ecosystem itself. Supporting one of the nodes on the network gets your team a front-row view of how a network functions from the inside. We’ve seen firsthand how operating a node speeds up a company’s ability to develop and deploy their own solutions.</p>
<p>Take part in community events<br>Indicio hosts community events, such as monthly Node Operator sync-ups and spotlights, giving our Node Operators a platform to showcase, demonstrate, and discuss their solutions. We help keep our node operators up-to-speed by discussing new open source tools, improvements, network updates, and standards progress, as well as help them identify business opportunities. </p>
<p>Make identity simpler<br>The decentralized identity world can be daunting for newcomers and veterans alike. There are myriads of working groups, governance bodies, standards organizations, and cross-industry initiatives. While these all play a vital role in the development and adoption of the technology, they can often lead to “information overload” and distract your team from developing a refined, commercial-ready product. We’re here to help our Node Operators make sense of the tools and information available to them in the community, saving them valuable time, money, and resources. We don’t just talk the talk. We understand business demands and work closely with Node Operators to get to market fast. </p>
<p>Concerned running a node might be too challenging? </p>
<p>Our “Node Operator as Service” option can take care of your network needs, leaving you free to focus on building your identity solution and participate in the Node Operator community. Indicio can host your node on a service of your choice, maintaining it with business-critical updates.</p>

<p>Fission is working with Jeremy Ruston, creator of TiddlyWiki, to build a TiddlyWiki on Fission app and make the Webnative SDK available as a plugin to save and load TW content across browsers.</p><p>We’ve been working out in the open in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">TiddlyWiki group on the Fission forum</a> for a couple of weeks, so now it’s time to welcome more people to join us.</p><p>The goal is to make it so that TiddlyWiki can easily run as an app on the Fission publishing platform. Individual users will be able to sign up and launch a new TiddlyWiki or upload their own. Then, they will have everything saved and portable automatically from any browser, including mobile, that's logged into their Fission account.</p><p></p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/introducing-flag-cat-tiddlywiki-on-fission-mascot/1578">TiddlyWiki on Fission Flag Cat</a>. Stay tuned for more images and stickers!<p>Fission’s webnative javascript libraries and app publishing platform are open source and built on open standards. We’re designing the system to be portable and easy-to-personalize for anyone--not just professional developers--so that they can launch a business around apps, themes, or other creative software experiments.</p><p>We want to work with TiddlyWiki creators who are making custom <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Editions.html">Editions</a>. The TiddlyWiki launcher that we’re working on with Jeremy can include any community Editions that people want to include, and we’ll be opening up the Github repo shortly for that.</p><p>And if you’re a creator that wants to build a business around a TiddlyWiki Edition on Fission, with your own supported app that 100s or 1000s of users can launch with a click and have their own custom domain, we’d love to talk. Our upcoming App Cloning feature is designed for this, and we’ll showcase this ability in the community-supported TiddlyWiki on Fission app so that you can see how it works.</p><p>We’re totally inspired by the TiddlyWiki community, and want to see what else we can build together. We're on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywiki">TiddlyWiki Google Group</a>, and please come by and chat with us in the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/c/apps/tiddlywiki/57">forum</a> or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord chat</a> if you have questions. If you're a developer, you can follow <a href="https://guide.fission.codes">Fission's guide</a> to set up your developer account and get started.</p><p>Please join us at tomorrow’s <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/fission-demo-day-february-2021/1442">Fission February 2021 Demo Day</a> if you’d like to find out more and talk live with Jeremy and the Fission team.</p><a href="https://lu.ma/event/evt-nHhXeNbXYwW4DW1">

Clubhouse is the end of a chapter, not the beginning of a new&nbsp;one. Photo: William&nbsp;Krause<p>Clubhouse is the belle of the ball right now. This is a pandemic story. This is a content creation story. And sure, COVID was a clear catalyst, but it was probably only a matter of time audio joined text and video in reaching this logical destination.</p><p>Facebook, Twitter, Mark Cuban, and I’m sure countless others have already gotten the&nbsp;memo.</p><p>As Ben Thompson notes, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse was “inevitable</a>”:</p><blockquote>Clubhouse, meanwhile, Silicon Valley’s hottest consumer startup, feels like the opposite case: in retrospect its emergence feels like it was inevitable — if anything, the question is what took so long for audio to follow the same path as text, images, and&nbsp;video.</blockquote><p>Also:</p><blockquote>The most obvious difference between Clubhouse and podcasts is how much dramatically easier it is to both create a conversation and to listen to one. This step change is very much inline with the shift from blogging to Twitter, from website publishing to Instagram, or from YouTube to&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, like those successful networks, Clubhouse centralizes creation and consumption into a tight feedback loop. In fact, conversation consumers can, by raising their hand and being recognized by the moderator, become creators in a matter of&nbsp;seconds.</blockquote><p>In other words, it’s not that Clubhouse ushers in a new chapter of anything — well, aside from the democratization, which itself is arguably a game changer. Rather, it represents the natural conclusion of the last cycle, in part due to audio’s stunted evolution during the period, now supercharged in a locked down&nbsp;world.</p><p>One telling&nbsp;fact:</p><p>This is a well-worn story, but one story it isn’t? It’s not yet a monetization story. It’s unclear how you seamlessly insert algorithmic ads into real-life conversations.</p><p>According to Ben, tipping is a potential path forward that’s been discussed, a path Twitter is looking to also&nbsp;take.</p><p>And so the rapid ascent Clubhouse has enjoyed is easy to understand, but it will run into similar challenges — perhaps greater — than all the other analogs from this past&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>All of which speaks to the need of Trusted Engagement.</p><p>That’s the story here, and like the pitter patter on Clubhouse, that story is being told in real-time.</p><p>Stay tuned.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> — <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-ceo-floats-user-tipping-213724463.html">Twitter CEO Floats User Tipping, Exclusive Content&nbsp;Features</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations">Mark Cuban is co-founding a podcast app where hosts can talk to fans live and monetize their conversations</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-wins-deal-for-creator-economy-startup-stir-at-100-million-valuation">Andreessen Horowitz Wins Deal for Creator Economy Startup Stir at $100 Million Valuation</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/attention-economy-after-trump-bfa0ef27-b10d-432a-a40a-6bb642424709.html">After Trump, the attention economy&nbsp;deflates</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-wechats-struggle-to-slow-down-tiktok-owner-bytedance">Inside WeChat’s Struggle to Slow Down TikTok Owner ByteDance</a>  <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/clubhouses-inevitability/">Clubhouse’s Inevitability</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/jvs">/jvs</a> — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs">Fan Subscriptions | Facebook for&nbsp;Creators</a>  Via kiwipete — <a href="https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/brave-browser-the-passive-income-king-a5d78da848c3">Brave Browser, The Passive Income&nbsp;King?</a>   2. A reminder of Clubhouse’s old chapter challenges: <p><a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china">Stanford</a>:</p><blockquote>The Stanford Internet Observatory has confirmed that Agora, a Shanghai-based provider of real-time engagement software, supplies back-end infrastructure to the Clubhouse App. This relationship had previously been widely suspected but not publicly confirmed. Further, SIO has determined that a user’s unique Clubhouse ID number and chatroom ID are transmitted in plaintext, and Agora would likely have access to users’ raw audio, potentially providing access to the Chinese government. In at least one instance, SIO observed room metadata being relayed to servers we believe to be hosted in the PRC, and audio to servers managed by Chinese entities and distributed around the world via Anycast. It is also likely possible to connect Clubhouse IDs with user profiles.</blockquote> 3.

It would also block Apple from making developers use its payment system for in-app purchases and subscriptions.</blockquote><blockquote>In Virginia, a digital privacy bill that’s supported by some tech trade groups and companies like IBM is set to pass and be signed into law. It would make Virginia the second state to pass a major data privacy bill, after California’s 2018&nbsp;law.</blockquote> 5.

					 <p>Trinsic is the best way to implement <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>. Our platform is made up of three APIs built specifically for <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-the-verifiable-credentials-model/">verifiable credential exchange</a>. Trinsic’s APIs make developers’ lives easier by making the implementation of verifiable credentials simple and accessible. Below, we give a brief introduction to Trinsic’s APIs with accompanying resources to learn more.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Provider API 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/">launched</a> our newest API—the Provider API—last year as the first product built specifically for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) providers. Providers are the organizations that bring together issuers, holders, and verifiers into a single ecosystem, generally under a single use case or family of use cases. They establish the rules around who is able to participate in their ecosystem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In verifiable credential exchange, as shown in the graphic below, instead of verifiers having to establish a relationship with every single issuer in an ecosystem in order to perform verifications, the verifiers establish a single relationship with the provider. If they can trust the provider, they can trust the credentials coming from any number of issuers in the ecosystem.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>A familiar example of a provider is Mastercard, and within the Mastercard ecosystem, banks are the credential issuers (in this case the credential is a Mastercard credit card), consumers are the holders, and merchants are the credential verifiers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Provider API makes it possible for providers to create credential issuers and verifiers programmatically instead of one at a time. With the Provider API, any organization can literally become a SSI provider for their ecosystem. When the Provider API was first released, one of our users created 13,000 verifiers in a singles script! Unlike the Credentials API and the Wallet API below, the Provider API is a paid feature on our platform.</p>

					 <p>The Credentials API is as simple as it sounds—it is for issuing and verifying credentials. Verifiable credential issuance and verification is at the core of every SSI use case, so the Credentials API is used, whether directly or indirectly through <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a>, by all of our customers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Get started</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  See the documentation of the Credentials API <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/reference#connections">here</a>.

					 <p>The Wallet API is for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders (i.e. individuals). The cloud wallets you create with this API can hold credentials, make connections, and respond to incoming requests. This API is ideal for organizations that would like to manage wallets on behalf of individuals (and uses its own authentication to authenticate the person to the correct wallet). <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">Cloud wallets</a> are flexible in that individuals can access them via mobile app or browser.

 Let’s Talk About Digital Identity with Ben Cronin, Managing Director at UBO Service. 
<p>In episode 39 of LTADI, Oscar talks to Ben about UBO Service and the challenges it solves around verifying Ultimate Beneficiary Owners, how UBO Service is leveraging Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) for KYC and enhanced CDD, and the Global LEI Foundation’s validation agent (VA) framework.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was very obvious to us that adding the LEI to that identification piece was very powerful because you’re really identifying and verifying the entity to a very high standard. By using data that we get from official government registries – adding that to an LEI just makes complete perfect sense to us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Serial entrepreneur Ben Cronin founded GBR (Global Business Register) in 2008. GBR morphed into <a href="https://www.kyckr.com/">Kyckr</a> over the following years and Kyckr listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 2016, providing commercially proven products for the authentication of businesses globally. His roles at Kyckr included Managing Director and Chief Data Officer. Ben is a supporter of Max Schrem’s organisation, NOYB – European Centre for Digital Rights; the fight for data privacy is important for all citizens. Ben played professional rugby with Munster and Ireland in the 90’s. His other interests include tennis, whisky, science and family!</p>

  <p>Today, we are going to build a simple web application that implements a to-do list. The backend will be written in Go. It will use the Go Gin Web Framework which implements a high-performance HTTP server. The front end will use the Vue.js JavaScript framework to implement a single page application (SPA). We will secure it using Okta OAuth 2.0 authentication. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-go-gin-vue-example">GitHub</a> if you’d like to check it out.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go, Gin, and Vue Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, create a project directory where all of our future code will live:</p>

   <code>mkdir ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
cd ~/okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>A Go workspace is required. This is a directory in which all Go libraries live. It is usually <code>~/go</code>, but can be any directory as long as the environment variable <code>GOPATH</code> points to it.</p>

<p>Next, install the Gin package into the Go workspace using this command:</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
</code>   

<p>If you haven’t already got Node.js and npm installed, you’ll need them to use Vue.js. To install Node.js and npm, go to <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm">Downloading and installing Node.js and npm</a> and install them.</p>

<p>Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can now install Vue.js with this command:</p>

   <code>npm install --global @vue/cli
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Go/Gin Application 

<p>We will start by creating a simple Gin application. Create a file called <code>simple.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/", func(c *gin.Context) {
        c.String(200, "Welcome to Go and Gin!")
    })
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s explain what this code does. The <code>import</code> statement loads the Gin package from the Go workspace. The <code>main()</code> function is the program entry point. First, a default Gin server is created with the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> statement. The <code>r.GET()</code> function is used to register code with Gin that will be called when a matching HTTP GET request is called. It takes two parameters: the URI to match (<code>/</code>), and a callback function that takes a Gin context struct as a parameter. The <code>String</code> function is called on the context (<code>c</code>), passing it the response status and the response body. Finally, the <code>Run</code> function is called to start the server listening on port 8080 by default.</p>

<p>Next, run the server.</p>

   <code>go run simple.go
</code>   

<p>You will get some warnings when you run the command above, which you can ignore for now.</p>

<p>Now, we can test the server using <code>curl</code>.</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>You should see the <code>Welcome to Go and Gin!</code> welcome message.</p>

 How to Build a RESTful Application 

<p>First of all, we will build the RESTful backend server. We will later add a Vue.js frontend and add Okta authentication.</p>

<p>We are going to make a Go module called <code>golang-gin-vue</code> which is the same name as the working directory. This will create a file called <code>go.mod</code> which defines the module and the version of Go.</p>

   <code>go mod init okta-go-gin-vue-example
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>main.go</code> containing the following Go code.</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "net/http"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>This contains some enhancements from the previous program.</p>

<p>A slice called <code>todos</code> has been created to contain the todo items.</p>

<p>The function <code>Lists</code> processes GET requests and returns a JSON object containing the items.</p>

<p>The <code>net/http</code> package has been imported so that we can use the more readable <code>http.StatusOK</code> as a status code rather than the opaque number <code>200</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>c.JSON()</code> serializes the structure into a JSON string in the response body. It also sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header to <code>application/json</code>.</p>

<p>The function <code>gin.H</code> is used to create JSON objects.</p>

<p>The <code>GET</code> function now calls the <code>Lists</code> function when the request URI is <code>/api/lists</code>.</p>

<p>Now we can run the server. The first time it is run Go will have to resolve the Gin library and add it to <code>go.mod</code>.</p>

   <code>go run main.go
</code>   

<p>We can test that it’s working using this curl command in another terminal window</p>

   <code>curl http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

<p>You should get a response that looks like this:</p>

   <code>{"list":["Write the application"]}
</code>   

 What Is a Path Parameter and How Do I Implement It in Gin? 

<p>A path parameter is a URI with a variable part. Any part of a URI can be a path parameter. In our example, we can get individual entries using URIs such as <code>/api/lists/0</code>, <code>/api/lists/1</code> etc.</p>

<p>The implementation is quite simple. The variable part of the URI is prefixed with a colon when the URI to function mapping is defined.</p>

   <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
</code>   

<p>The implementation of this is shown in the <code>ListItem()</code> function below:</p>

   <code>func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The name specified in the URI after the colon can be extracted using the <code>Params</code> function in the Gin context.</p>

<p>Update your code in <code>main.go</code> to add <code>strconv</code> to the imports, include the <code>ListItem</code> function, and add the <code>r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)</code> statement to the <code>main()</code> function so that <code>main.go</code> looks like this:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>The server can be tested running the <code>go run main.go</code> command and then using <code>curl</code>. Verify that the error handling works using invalid URIs.</p>

   <code>curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/0
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/1
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists/foo
</code>   

<p>Notice that the last two commands will display different error messages.</p>

 How Do I Handle a POST Request Using Gin? 

<p>A POST request simply requires using <code>POST</code> in place of <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>Add the following statement to the <code>main()</code> function in <code>main.go</code></p>

   <code>r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
</code>   

<p>The POST handler uses a <code>PostForm</code> method to extract the parameters, add the code below to <code>main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}
</code>   

<p><code>main.go</code> should look like this now:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
    "net/http"
    "strconv"
)

var todos []string

func Lists(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"list": todos})
}

func ListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    errormessage := "Index out of range"
    indexstring := c.Param("index")
    if index, err := strconv.Atoi(indexstring); err == nil &amp;&amp; index &lt; len(todos) {
        c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"item": todos[index]})
    } else {
        if err != nil {
            errormessage = "Number expected: " + indexstring
        }
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": errormessage})
    }
}

func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    item := c.PostForm("item")
    todos = append(todos, item)
    c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
}

func main() {
    todos = append(todos, "Write the application")
    r := gin.Default()
    r.GET("/api/lists", Lists)
    r.GET("/api/lists/:index", ListItem)
    r.POST("/api/lists", AddListItem)
    r.Run()
}
</code>   

<p>It is important to note that a REST POST request creates a resource on the server and assigns it a URI. The proper response to a POST is a status of 201 Created and the response body should contain the URI of the new resource.</p>

<p>The server can be tested using <code>curl</code>. Restart the server using <code>go run main.go</code> and then use the <code>curl</code> commands below to test it out:</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST -d "item=Build Vue frontend" http://localhost:8080/api/lists
curl -i http://localhost:8080/api/lists
</code>   

 How to Build a Simple Vue Application 

<p>A number of files need to be created to build a Vue application. The Vue client (Vue CLI) can create the necessary files for us. Let’s use the Vue CLI to create an application called <code>todo-vue</code>.</p>

   <code>vue create todo-vue
</code>   

<p>The creation process will ask a number of questions. Use the arrow keys to select the option required then hit the enter key.</p>

 
   It may ask if you want to use a faster registry: answer Y. 
   Please pick a preset: use the arrow keys to select Manually select features. 
   Check the features needed for your project: Babel, which is a JavaScript compiler, and Linter / Formatter should be selected. 
   Choose a version of Vue.js that you want to start the project with (Use arrow keys): select 2.x. 
   Pick a linter / formatter config: select ESLint with error prevention only. This will check for and catch common errors but will not enforce strict rules. 
   Pick additional lint features: select Lint on save. This will check for errors when files are saved in the project. 
   Where do you prefer placing config for Babel, ESLint, etc.? Select In dedicated config files. Several small files are better than one big file. 
   Save this as a preset for future projects? select type N. 
   Pick the package manager to use when installing dependencies: select Use NPM 
 

<p>The Vue CLI will then create the project. This includes downloading components which can take some time.</p>

<p>Let’s see what got created in the new directory <code>todo-vue</code>. We will explain the content of the files in more detail as we build the application:</p>

<p>The directory <code>node_modules</code> contains the Node.js modules which are needed by Vue.</p>

<p>The file <code>README.md</code> contains instructions on building and running the Vue application.</p>

<p>The file <code>package.json</code> describes the Vue package and its dependencies.</p>

<p>The template for the application is <code>public/index.html</code> it contains <code>&lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> which gets replaced by the Vue content.</p>

<p>The <code>src</code> directory contains the core Vue application. The entry point for the application is in <code>src/main.js</code> which replaces the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML page with the content.  The file <code>src/App.vue</code> contains the top-level Vue component. There is one component <code>src/components/HelloWorld.vue</code> which can be deleted as it is not required.</p>

<p>We will now simplify the file <code>src/App.vue</code>to have the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'App',
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk about what this does. The template element contains the HTML which will replace the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in the HTML file. The script element exports the application and gives it a name. The style element is self-explanatory and can be modified any way you want to.
We can now run a built-in development server to test the application.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run serve
</code>   

<p>This will build the application and start listening on port 8080 by default. You can access the page by pointing a web browser at http://localhost:8080. If you are curious, the port number can be changed by setting the environment variable <code>PORT</code> to another value.</p>

 How to Add the To-Do List to the Application 

<p>First, we are going to add a placeholder for the actual to-do list. We need to modify <code>App.vue</code>. The style element will be omitted in the example as it doesn’t change.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
const appData = {
  todolist: "More to do"
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>So, what has changed? The template has been modified to add the list. The `` gets replaced with the contents of a variable called <code>todolist</code>.</p>

<p>There have been two changes to the script element. An object called <code>appData</code> has been added which defines the variable <code>todolist</code> used in the template and gives it a default value. The default application now has a function called <code>data()</code> which returns the <code>appData</code> object.</p>

<p>Now, run the application and point a web browser at it. You should see the text “more to do” on the page.</p>

 How to Combine the Web Servers 

<p>When a Vue application is ready to use it can be converted into a static website. Run the command below to do that:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>dist</code> containing the static content.</p>

<p>Then, we change the Go server to deliver the static content. We will serve the <code>todo-vue/dist</code> directory as the root URI <code>/</code>. Modify <code>main.go</code> and add <code>"github.com/gin-contrib/static"</code> to the imports and add the following line to the <code>main()</code> function, after the <code>r := gin.Default()</code> line:</p>

   <code>r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./todo-vue/dist", false)))
</code>   

<p>Run the Go server with <code>go run main.go</code> and point a browser at http://localhost:8080 to see the Vue generated web page.</p>

 How to Make the Vue App Call the Server 

<p>The Axios JavaScript package is required to call the server. Make sure it is installed locally.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install --save axios
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to modify <code>src/App.vue</code> to make the Ajax call and render it.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: ["More to do"]
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the changes. At the start of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, the Axios package is imported. At the end of the script the function <code>getList()</code> is defined. It makes an Axios <code>get()</code> call to the API. The response is a JSON object which gets transformed into a JavaScript object. The JSON object contains an object called <code>list</code> which is an array of item strings. The response is in <code>res.data</code> and <code>res.data.list</code> extracts the array of item strings that are assigned to the <code>todolist</code> variable.</p>

<p>In the <code>export</code> the <code>methods</code> object exports the <code>getList()</code> function as a JavaScript function with the same name which is visible to the application. The <code>mounted</code> entry defines a function that is called when the page has loaded. It calls <code>getList()</code> to get the list of items.</p>

<p>In the template, there is now an unordered list. The <code>v-for</code> attribute iterates over the array of strings contained in <code>todolist</code> creating a <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element for each entry. The <code>v-bind:key</code> attribute makes the <code>item</code> variable from the <code>v-for</code> attribute a template variable.</p>

<p>Rebuild the Vue project, then start the server using these commands:</p>
   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then, load the web page. A single item from the API should be displayed.</p>

 How to Make a POST Request from Form Data 

<p>We are going to add a form that enables a new item to be added to the list.</p>

<p>First, add a form inside the  <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> tag, just above the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> line in <code>App.vue</code>.</p>

   <code>    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>The form contains a text input box and a submit button. The <code>v-model</code> attribute associates the text input with a variable called <code>todoitem</code>. The function <code>sendItem()</code> is called when the submit button is clicked. The <code>@submit.prevent</code> attribute prevents the page from being reloaded when the form is submitted.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>sendItem()</code> function at the bottom of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in the <code>App.vue</code> file:</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}
</code>   

<p>The function is made asynchronous so that it is non-blocking. The POST parameters are set using a <code>URLSearchParams</code> object. There is a single parameter called <code>item</code> and its value is the value of the text input passed into the variable <code>this.todoitem</code> which was defined by the <code>v-model</code> attribute on the text input. The POST request is made by calling <code>axios.post()</code>. The <code>await</code> makes the function wait until the POST response arrives. Finally, the <code>getList()</code> function is called to get the updated list.```</p>

<p>You will also need to add the <code>sendItem</code> function to the list of methods that are exposed to Vue. Update the <code>methods</code> section of the <code>export default</code> part of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag so that it looks like this:</p>

   <code>  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
</code>   

<p>Here is how your <code>Vue.app</code> file should look:</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="app"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;To-Do List&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form method="POST" @submit.prevent="sendItem()"&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" size="50" v-model="todoitem" placeholder="Enter new item"/&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li v-for="item in todolist" v-bind:key="item"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import axios from "axios";
const appData = {
  todolist: []
}
export default {
  name: 'App',
  data() {
    return appData;
  },
  mounted: function() {
    this.getList();
  },
  methods: {
    getList: getList,
    sendItem: sendItem,
  }
}
function getList() {
  axios.get("/api/lists").then( res =&gt; {
    appData.todolist = res.data.list
  });
}

async function sendItem() {
  const params = new URLSearchParams();
  params.append('item', this.todoitem);
  await axios.post("/api/lists", params);
  getList()
}

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
#app {
  font-family: Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  text-align: center;
  color: #2c3e50;
  margin-top: 60px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>To test the changes: Build the Vue application and start the server using these commands:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>Then load the web page. Enter a new item and submit the form. The updated list should be displayed.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Application 

<p>To add authentication to the Vue application, we first need to install two packages.</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm install @okta/okta-auth-js
npm install @okta/okta-signin-widget
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication you need to have a free [Okta Developer account] (https://developer.okta.com). Once you’ve done this, sign in to the developer console and select Applications &gt; Add Application. Then select Single-Page App and hit Next. The next page is filled in with default values, most of which are sufficient for this application and don’t need to be changed. Add the URL <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to the allowed Login Redirect URLs. Hit Done.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of information that you need to obtain from the Okta Developer Console. These are your Okta domain name and your client id. These values need to be passed into the Vue application. As these values are effectively secrets, they must not be hardcoded in the application. The way around this is to create environment variables in a file called <code>.env</code> in the <code>todo-vue</code> directory containing these values. Also add <code>.env</code> to the <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

   <code>VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=my-client-id
VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN=my-okta-domain.okta.com
</code>   

<p>PS: The environment variable names must start with <code>VUE_APP_</code> otherwise they will not be visible in the application.</p>

 How to Add Okta Authentication to the Vue Client 

<p>We are going to use the Okta authentication widget to log the user in. A successful login will create an access token that can be used to verify that the user is logged in.</p>

<p>First of all we will add a container for the login form to the template in <code>src/App.vue</code>, add the code below just above the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>&lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to add the login code to the script section of <code>src/App.vue</code>, starting with importing the <code>OktaSignIn</code> object inside the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag.</p>

   <code>import OktaSignIn from "@okta/okta-signin-widget";
import "@okta/okta-signin-widget/dist/css/okta-sign-in.min.css";
</code>   

<p>Next, just below the import lines, modify the <code>appData</code> constant so that it can hold a token:</p>

   <code>const appData = {
    todolist: ["More to do"],
    token: ''
}
</code>   

<p>Next, update the contents of the <code>mounted: function()</code> with the code below. This code creates the widget and extracts the token.</p>

   <code>    mounted: function () {
        var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
            el: "#widget-container",
            baseUrl: "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN,
            clientId: process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
            redirectUri: window.location.origin,
            authParams: {
                issuer:
                    "https://" + process.env.VUE_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN + "/oauth2/default",
                responseType: ["token", "id_token"],
                display: "page",
            },
        });
        signIn.showSignInToGetTokens({
            scopes: ['openid', 'profile']
        }).then(function(tokens){
            appData.token = tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
            axios.defaults.headers.common["Authorization"] =
                "Bearer " + appData.token;
            signIn.hide();
        });
        getList();
    },
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the code to understand what is happening. First of all, we construct an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object. It takes a dictionary as a parameter. The <code>el</code> defines the ID of the template element in which the login form will be displayed. The <code>baseUrl</code> and <code>clientId</code> are extracted from the secrets in the <code>.env</code> file. The <code>redirectUri</code> is set to the current page. This will cause the current page to be reloaded on a successful login with the required access token passed in the URL.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl</code> method causes the login widget to be displayed.</p>

<p>The <code>.then()</code> function is called  on  a successful login. The access token is extracted and then set as an Authorization header in the Axios default headers. This means that the header will be sent on subsequent Axios requests. The sign-in widget is hidden once the token has been obtained.</p>

<p>We are going to validate the token on the server and return an error response if it fails. We need to modify the <code>sendItem()</code> function in <code>App.vue</code> to handle the error.</p>

   <code>async function sendItem() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams();
    params.append('item', this.todoitem);
    await axios.post("/api/lists", params)
    .then(function() {
        getList();
    })
    .catch(function (error) {
        appData.todolist = [ error.message ];
    })
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application, start the server and load the web page:</p>

   <code>cd todo-vue
npm run build
cd ..
go run main.go
</code>   

<p>The login form should be displayed. Log in using your Okta Developer Console credentials.</p>

 How to Validate an Access Token in Go 

<p>The access token which the client obtained is what is known as a JSON Web Token (JWT). To verify the token we will use an Okta JWT verifier. The Go package needs to be installed.</p>

   <code>go get -u github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang
</code>   

<p>First, add an import to <code>main.go</code> to load the Okta JWT verifier package.</p>

   <code>jwtverifier "github.com/okta/okta-jwt-verifier-golang"
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>verify()</code> function to <code>main.go</code>.</p>

   <code>var toValidate = map[string]string{
        "aud": "api://default",
        "cid": os.Getenv("OKTA_CLIENT_ID"),
}

func verify(c *gin.Context) bool {
    status := true
    token := c.Request.Header.Get("Authorization")
    if strings.HasPrefix(token, "Bearer ") {
        token = strings.TrimPrefix(token, "Bearer ")
        verifierSetup := jwtverifier.JwtVerifier{
            Issuer:           "https://" + os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN") + "/oauth2/default",
            ClaimsToValidate: toValidate,
        }
        verifier := verifierSetup.New()
        _, err := verifier.VerifyAccessToken(token)
        if err != nil {
            c.String(http.StatusForbidden, err.Error())
            print(err.Error())
            status = false
        }
    } else {
        c.String(http.StatusUnauthorized, "Unauthorized")
        status = false
    }
    return status
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>toValidate</code> map defines the values of the audience and client ID claims for the verifier. The <code>verify()</code> function looks for an Authorization header containing a bearer token. If the token is found then the verifier is called to verify the token. If the token is verified successfully the function returns true. If the token is not found then a 401 Unauthorized response is sent and the function returns false. If the token is found but does not verify, then a 403 Forbidden response is sent and the function returns false.</p>

<p>Finally modify the <code>AddListItem</code> function to call <code>verify()</code>.</p>

   <code>func AddListItem(c *gin.Context) {
    if verify(c) {
        item := c.PostForm("item")
        todos = append(todos, item)
        c.String(http.StatusCreated, c.FullPath()+"/"+strconv.Itoa(len(todos)-1))
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Build the Vue application—start the server and load the web page. Add a To-Do item and submit the form. You should get an error response. Login and resubmit the To-Do item to verify that token verification works.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The Gin package for Golang makes it very easy to create a web server. It is particularly easy to build a RESTful web server as there is a function for each of the request methods. A user-defined function is called whenever a request is received. Gin can also serve static content from a specified directory.</p>

<p>The Vue.js JavaScript framework makes it easy to build web front ends that generate dynamic content. The Vue client can create the basic directory structure and the files required for a Vue application. The files are validated for correct syntax which helps avoid hard to diagnose JavaScript errors. Vue provides a server that can be used to test development code. Building the code in production mode creates static content that can be delivered by any web server.</p>

<p>The Okta authentication widget makes the verification process very easy to implement. The OAuth 2.0 authentication process is quite complex. The widget hides the complexity securely. Once the access token has been obtained it can be sent to the API server in a header. The JWT verification process is very simple using the Okta Go JWT verifier.</p>

The proposed European <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">Data Governance Act</a> is another progressive indication that the EU is seeking to develop a more equitable digital economy. However, where we go from here depends on how the European Union is able to use the Data Governance Act to strike a balance between the existing tech giants and data platforms alongside an entirely new range of services designed to enable the collection, protection and exchange of data.




 




Currently, a handful of global players enjoy a virtual monopoly on the exploitation of data. Unlocking these data silos and regulating for data mobility and interoperability will provide the vital infrastructure required for meeting the challenges of the next century, including timely and informed decision making.




 




At <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> we believe that enabling citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data will ultimately lead to greater trust and personalisation, resulting in a more prosperous society. However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation such as the Data Governance Act and the digital tools to transform our connected society.




 




We believe this will lead to significant benefits to including personalised health and education, increased financial literacy and better financial decisions, more informed consumer choices which also contribute to protecting our environment.




 




Meeco is endorsing the Data Governance Act as a founding member of <a href="https://datasovereigntynow.org">Data Sovereignty Now</a>; a coalition of leading Europe-based technology companies, research institutions and not-for-profit organisations. We are working together to ensure that the control of data remains in the hands of the people and organisations that generate it in order to play a key role in not only securing the rights of individuals over their data, but also providing significant stimulus for the digital economy.




 




Meeco is also a member of <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global</a> and was amongst the first 16 organisations to be awarded the <a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">MyData </a><a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">Operator</a> designation in 2020. We join in the goal towards developing interconnected and human-centric data intermediaries to meet the personalisation and equity challenges of open digital society.




 




We welcome the regulation as a needed common ground for clarifying the role of data intermediaries, building trust in these intermediaries and setting the direction for data governance, including the emergence of digital human rights.




 




In this context we offer the following suggestions:




 




1. Explicitly include individuals as active participants in the definitions: define the key roles in data sharing (Art. 2 Definitions) so that data rights holders (data subject) and technical data holders (controller or processor) can be separated and acknowledge the type of data sharing where individuals are active participants in the transactions.




 




2. Clarify the scope of the data sharing services (Art. 9 (2)) and extend it to include services that empower the data subject beyond compliance.




 




3. Foster the growth of intermediaries, which offer new technologies and have the greatest likelihood of success in Europe if supported by the Data Governance Act.




 




4. Open silos and implement soft infrastructure such as standards &amp; open APIs to accelerate uptake and interoperability between data sharing services.




 




5. Foster eco-systems and demonstrate the value through practical use-cases. The EU data sharing ecosystem is formative; therefore, it is imperative to demonstrate utility and benchmark best practices that contribute to a more sustainable, healthy, resilient and safe digital society.




 




6. Create a level playing field for sustainable data sharing by providing funding to pioneers at the forefront of developing data eco-systems, this includes start-ups, scale-ups alongside established enterprises.




 




Included is a Meeco <a href="https://www.meeco.me/data">white paper</a> detailing practical use-cases aligned to our response, including the barriers the Data Governance Act can address to make data work for all.

<p>At first glance, account recovery might seem like a simple topic: just write a reset password function, send a challenge code, and you're done!</p><p>But, Fission’s commitment to prioritizing user control makes things a little more complicated. When the user is in control, how do we help them get back into their data if they get locked out? The main relevant factors are:</p>  We’ve designed our account system around portable account identifiers, called Decentralized IDs (DIDs)  Your account holds encryption keys that keep your private content encrypted and private only to you — even the Fission platform doesn’t have access and can’t see your content.  We wanted an account recovery system that was as trust-minimized as possible. Meaning, you don’t have to trust us, and you would require as few third-party systems as possible to help you out if you lose account access.  <blockquote>Oh, and one more thing: we wanted to do all of this without passwords.</blockquote><p>At Fission, being password-free is the default. Instead, we use technology built into modern browsers — including mobile browsers — that generates and keeps a private encryption key safely stored. This is called the Web Crypto API.</p><p>By the way, if you haven’t tried this yet, head over to the default <a href="https://drive.fission.codes">Fission Drive app</a> and create a new Fission account. Notice that it asks you for a unique username and an email address, but it doesn’t ask you for a password.</p><p>To use your account on other devices — like your desktop browser, tablet, or phone — you get access by creating a key on your new device and linking it to another device that already has permission.</p><p>Now, the private keys built into the browsers on all your devices have permission to access your account and all of your encrypted, personal data — all without setting up or having to remember a password.</p><p>Apple is known for providing users with end-to-end encryption that keeps everyone, including Apple, out of any personal information. Fission is taking the same approach.</p> What about lost devices? <p>But what happens if you lose all your devices? Can you still get access to the encrypted content stored and synced online by your Fission account? Right now, the answer is no! We don’t have a copy of your key — and the Web Crypto API built into browsers is designed in such a way that we can’t get a copy for security reasons. If you lose access to all your devices, how can you recover your encrypted content? This is where Account Recovery comes in.</p><p>One of the design goals we have with Fission is to support a broad number of default use cases — we think this stuff should just work for everyone. We do rely on the most cutting edge browser standards, but we choose these standards based on the real world support available in all major browsers, including mobile browsers.</p> Using a single-device as a base case <p>Let’s consider the base case scenario of a person having just one mobile computing device — owning and using a single phone — meaning that losing that one mobile device means you’ve lost everything.</p><p>This is the common base case we need to keep in mind.</p><p>It’s crucial to remember that the typical software developer or early adopter is much easier to support: at least one mobile device and one desktop/laptop device. The private key stored on a desktop is much more likely to stick around for a really long time.</p><p>In fact, in some of our user research interviews, developers told us that the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">private key they used to securely connect to GitHub</a> was often on their machine for 5 years. Basically, the entire lifetime of owning the machine before they got a new computer and set up a new key!</p><p>But since that isn’t the deal for our single mobile device base case, we have to plan for account recovery process with just a single device to make the system accessible and recoverable by the largest number of users.</p> Splitting up keys <p>Our basic principle involves making backup keys and splitting them into pieces. We then store some of those pieces on the Fission platform linked to the user account.</p><p>The other half is stored “offline” by the user, as recovery codes.</p><p>When the offline recovery codes are combined with the pieces on Fission, it creates the complete key that can access the person’s account.</p><p>Because of our commitment to privacy, Fission never has access to the whole key.</p><blockquote>If someone breaks into Fission's database, there are no passwords and no secret keys to leak.</blockquote> Where should I store recovery codes? <p>On Apple iOS devices, basic iCloud file storage is built into the operating system — just like Fission accounts have the Web Native File System included. We’ll recommend that users download the recovery codes and store them in their Safari iCloud downloads folder — or somewhere else on their iCloud files.</p><p>On Android, the defaults are a lot more varied. Many Android phones have Google services built in by default, so we’ll recommend this as a similar approach to using iCloud in our iOS example.</p><p>Advanced users can store this file anywhere they feel comfortable - be it in Apple Notes with a password, printed out on paper, stored in their 1Password account, or even sent as a “Note to Self” in their Signal messenger app.</p>Signal's <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360043272451-Note-to-Self">Note to Self feature</a><p>And in the future, based on the feedback, we may allow advanced security-conscious users to forgo the use of recovery codes entirely, allowing them to self-manage backup keys.</p> Get involved <p>You can check out the in-progress diagrams and notes of our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/account-recovery/1432">Account Recovery design process</a> in the forum.</p><p>We’re not done with our design. We are still working at the level of security, systems, and cryptographic principles, as well as streamlining the user experience and the flows for users.</p><p>The code is being developed out in the open in the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/dashboard">Dashboard code repository</a>.

  IDunion (formerly SSI for Germany) has completed the competition phase of the innovation competition “Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten” and is applying to the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy (BMWi) for the next phase of the innovation competition.  The use of decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies and things is to be tested in over 35 use cases from a wide range of sectors.  The project involves 26 well-known public and private partners.  More information can be found on our website idunion.org.  



<p>Frankfurt am Main, 24 November 2020 – IDunion (formerly “SSI for Germany”) creates an ecosystem for decentralised, self-sovereign identities for natural persons, companies, institutions and things. In a partnership of renowned public and private institutions, a distributed identity network will be established, which will be managed by a European cooperative. The partners develop software applications and components, which leverage the the IDunion network and enable the allocation, storage and exchange of verified identity information. The use of open source software and standardised data formats will create a vendor-neutral solution and transparency as well as promote interoperability between providers, networks and traditional identity solutions.</p>



<p>A distributed test network is currently operated by 12 partners and will be available as a production environment for numerous use cases also outside the consortium from 2021. A detailed legal governance structure for the network has been developed with the support of the law firm Jones Day. In addition, extensive reports were prepared on legal topics, including the GDPR and eIDAS regulations, as well as on security aspects and a freedom-to-operate analysis.</p>



<p>In addition, various software applications were developed for both citizens and companies and tested in extensive user acceptance tests. Currently, identity wallets from the Main Incubator GmbH (Lissi Wallet) and esatus AG (esatus Wallet) are already available for end users to download. All partners are currently evaluating or implementing applications or use-cases for the further integration of the IDunion network into their existing systems.</p>

<p>The Cambria project is an exploration of how to manage changing data formats and schemas in a decentralized piece of software.

			 Security Tokens Get the Green Light in Luxembourg 
<p>Last week, Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities. See the market spotlight below for the panel I spoke on with the CSSF and some other friends.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities? 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulation still need to be applied. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the T-REX protocol are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead? 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p>Due to the progression in regulation we are experiencing a spate of interest and projects from the fund industry. Our customers, WeInvest, Finimmo and Digibrixx have already begun building their projects, with more on the way.</p>

<p>Il World Science Report dell’Unesco ha definito la carriera professionale femminile un tubo forato in riferimento al fatto che, dopo la laurea, non tutte le donne proseguono il proprio percorso nel mondo del lavoro.</p>



<p>A livello mondiale la percentuale di donne impegnate in attività di ricerca non supera il 29%, mentre in Italia:</p>



<blockquote><p>La percentuale di donne ricercatrici varia molto in funzione della disciplina: in biologia, medicina, e in generale nelle scienze della vita i numeri sono molto incoraggianti. […] Gli ultimi dati sui livelli di istruzione registrano un numero maggiore di donne laureate (22,4%) rispetto agli uomini (16,8%). […] La percentuale di ricercatrici invece cala se si considerano solo le materie STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths), in modo particolare scienze matematiche, informatiche, fisiche, ingegneria ma anche scienze economiche e statistiche. In questi campi le donne hanno maggiori difficoltà nel continuare la via della ricerca scientifica dopo aver conseguito il dottorato o anche un assegno post doc.</p>Lucia Votano – dirigente di Ricerca emerita Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare</blockquote>



<p>Considerando questo contesto, InfoCert ha aderito con entusiasmo al progetto Sistema Scuola Impresa di ELIS: un progetto formativo rivolto agli studenti delle scuole italiane con un’attenzione specifica alle ragazze per il loro accesso alle professioni nei settori a prevalenza maschile.</p>



<p>Il progetto ha l’obiettivo di presentare a docenti e studenti dei modelli in cui potersi rispecchiare e in cui riconoscere talenti inespressi e percorsi possibili. Le Role Model individuate dal progetto, sono professioniste aziendali dimostratesi capaci di incidere nel contesto in cui operano con entusiasmo e determinazione.</p>



<p>3 dipendenti InfoCert laureate in materie scientifiche sono state selezionate per prendere parte al progetto in qualità di Role Model.</p>



<p>Alla fine di una serie di incontri di formazione, queste incontrarono gli studenti delle scuole italiane in una nuova edizione del programma, che nella precedente ha raggiunto oltre 18.600 studenti sul territorio italiano, il 97% dei quali consiglierebbe ad altri studenti di fare la stessa esperienza.</p>

It was great. Here is a round up from Jolocom. It is highly recommended.</p><blockquote><p>The paper <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>. Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>  <p>Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.</p>  <p>Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.</p>  <p>Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.</p>  </blockquote><p></p> Blogs  <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/a-unified-theory-of-decentralization-151d6f39e38">A Unified Theory of Decentralization</a> <blockquote><p>The good news is that centralization isn’t the only source of convenience. As you will see in the discussion farther down, decentralized solutions for the problems of distributed systems are more robust and designed to operate in the worst of conditions.</p></blockquote> Windley Writes  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/passwords_are_ruining_the_web.shtml">Passwords are Ruining the Web&nbsp;</a> <blockquote><p>Passwords are ruining the web with awful, lengthy, and inconsistent user experiences. They're insecure and lead to data breaches. The good news is there are good ways for web sites to be passwordless. If you hate passwords, build the world you want to live in.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2021/02/persistence_programming_and_picos.shtml">Persistence, Programming, and Picos</a> -&nbsp; <blockquote><p>Picos show that image-based development can be done in a manner consistent with the best practices we use today without losing the important benefits it brings.</p></blockquote> About: PICOS <blockquote><p>The project name, PICOS, is an abbreviation of “Privacy and Identity Management for Community Services”. The objective of the project is to advance the state of the art in technologies that provide privacy-enhanced identity and trust management features within complex community-supporting services that are built on Next Generation Networks and delivered by multiple communication service providers. The approach taken by the project is to research, develop, build trial and evaluate an open, privacy-respecting, trust-enabling identity management platform that supports the provision of community services by mobile communication service providers.</p><p>Learn more about the <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Motivation.181.0.html">motivation</a>, the <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Objectives.182.0.html">objectives</a>, <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Tasks.183.0.html">tasks</a> and <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Achievements.190.0.html">achievements</a> of PICOS, and get to know the PICOS exemplary <a href="http://www.picos-project.eu/Communities.184.0.html">communities</a>.</p></blockquote> Kaliya has <a href="https://identitywoman.net/two-exciting-new-roles/">two cool new jobs.</a> <p>Working as the Ecosystems Director at Covid Credentials Initiative and heading the <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/verifiable-credentials-policy-commi">Verifiable Credentials Policy Committee</a> of the Blockchain Advocacy Committee.&nbsp;</p><blockquote></blockquote> Organization News  <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/jolocoms-contributions-to-dif/">Jolocom’s latest contributions to DIF</a>  <a href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F252814dd-44ff-4dd6-b8f9-49d94408678e_1500x867.png"></a> <p>Over the course of 2020,&nbsp;</p>  <p>Jolocom added support for an <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/KERI_WP.pdf">off-chain element based on KERI</a>.

But, the inconsistent use of standards and varying implementations have already led to confusion and public concern. An effort coordinated at the federal level would lead most quickly to uniform adoption and true inter-state and cross-domain interoperability.</p><p>LFPH and our partner organizations are ready to collaborate with you on this.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://digitalscot.net/covid-vaccinations-data-donor-proposal/">Covid Vaccinations ‘Data Donor’ Program</a> – A Proposal for the Scottish Government <blockquote><blockquote><p>“The Scottish Government must invest in data, digital and technology in health and social care to help Scotland recover from Covid-19. Closing the data gap in the sector could be worth £800m a year and deliver savings of £5.4bn to NHS Scotland.

 Valuations in our sector are rocking — with no signs of slowing&nbsp;down. <p>Best-in-class, scalable technology solutions that exceed customer expectations are in high&nbsp;demand.</p> Precis <p>2020 saw a rush of adoption and evolution in eCommerce and online presence, not created by but fuelled in pace by the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>By sector we are referring to technology, and fast-growing subsectors digital identity and verification needs and facilitations, the financial technology space, and all eCommerce interactions in this next internet era. Fintechs are consistently part of challenger banking now, or neobanking, upending the oligopolistic traditional financial services practice. This sector is bringing along fast-moving partners and symbiotic cutting-edge solutions that meet and drive customer expectations and behaviour. For clear reasons, the need for safe and trusted digital tools is quickly spreading to all arenas, including verified identity.</p> Safe Harbour <p>Tom Kennedy has been remunerated by KABN Systems NA in the past twenty-four months. He holds a long position in KABN (CSE:KABN) at the time of publication.</p><p>His research is intended for the sophisticated investor to assess market developments and company performance and make insights. His comments are in no way intended as a solicitation to trade in any securities. All comments are subject to Risks and Uncertainties outside of the control of the&nbsp;author.</p><p>Please see the Disclosure Statements at the end of document.</p> The US and Canadian tech sectors are in favour right now, sped up by the&nbsp;pandemic <p>In Canada and the US, and in fact across the globe, technology is a sector in significant favour and flux, and is attracting a lot of interest right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Dozens of new companies over the past few months have found private investor groups in multiple seed rounds, and many are hitting the public markets via IPOs and RTOs for more exposure and access to capital. The M&amp;A cycle is seeing a lot of activity too. Incumbent players are moving fast on new developments to bolster their product offerings and keep up with the customer and market demands. Financial investors are searching for the next unicorn, or more likely a puzzle piece positioned to be gobbled up at handsome valuations by leveraging vertical integrations or amalgamating user bases into their&nbsp;own.</p><p>Internet deals in the US led the way in Q4/20, with almost double the dealflow Healthcare saw in second place. While we do not expect this pace to continue its linear growth, we do expect that 1) Canada typically lags the US markets, and 2) the horse has already left the barn. While KABN’s timing appears to have been excellent, execution demand will only increase as these players are expected to demonstrate they are worth premium valuations.</p><p>Figure 1: Q4/20 was all about internet&nbsp;deals</p>Source: PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree™ Report Q4&nbsp;2020. The stock market is supportive of valuations <p>The stock market is very useful for valuation as buyers and sellers commit to pricing every day trading is open. Over the past two years, we have seen a cyclical shift away from certain sectors like commodities, consumer goods, and traditional financial services towards technology.</p><p>There are many ways to illustrate this point. We compare the Dow Jones industrial Average, a metric of the broad US markets, against the Technology subsector, over the past two years, in Figure&nbsp;2:</p><p>Figure 2: Tech Stocks are just beginning to outperform</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The pandemic didn’t create this upcoming Tech Boom — but it didn’t&nbsp;hurt <p>While the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had huge exogenous impacts on markets and consumer habits, we contend it did not create this evolution. That said, it has clearly sped things&nbsp;up.</p><p>One anecdotal way to explain adoption is that inevitably the customer is likely to embrace a more convenient, safer, cheaper, or better alternative brought on by technology eventually. The exact timing however is often difficult to pinpoint. During the pandemic, many people chose to or were strongly encouraged to purchase food online. This may be an activity they had never engaged in before and might not even have the technology. So they end up buying groceries that arrive at their door in good time and good order, or a prepared meal, and they enjoy it, and are now committed online shoppers. According to 451 Research, a boutique eCommerce research firm in the US, eCommerce spending rose by 23% year over year in 2020 over 2019. These kinds of numbers represent rapid adoption that will not reverse to pre-COVID levels.</p><p>We would note the broader market has also done very well during the pandemic, which is helpful to enhancing access to capital for any subsector.</p><p>A different way to look at the relative performance of tech versus the broader market is seen comparing the value of $1 invested (all figures USD for this point) on 23 March, 2020 to 22 January, 2021. That dollar would be worth $1.95 now, relative to $1.67 for a buck in the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>This represents an alpha, or relative outperformance, of the tech subsector, at 16.8% over that timeframe which is approximately 10 months of data. A couple of caveats are that we have chosen the US market for more robust data but further believe the US market is an excellent proxy for Canada. That said we have not normalized for the exchange rate, but there are so many things from elections to interest rate movements and virtually infinite economic minutiae that affect all durations of currency fluctuation. In addition, Canada typically lags the US, particularly in market developments. This element enhances our point if true and furthermore contributes to the benefits of obtaining a wider US investment audience both from a valuation and adoption perspective.</p><p>Figure 3: Value of $1 invested at pandemic market&nbsp;bottom</p>Source: Investing.com; Tom&nbsp;Kennedy. The Customer will ultimately drive adoption — and that’s where we believe KABN can&nbsp;excel <p>Global professional services firm Accenture surveyed 47,000 customers on their digital banking practices in their Accenture 2020 Global Banking Consumer Study. Our interpretation is that the customers can be segmented logically by range of adoption, from Traditionalists to Pioneers, and they are rapidly adopting digital interactions with a focus on humanized elements (“Congratulations, your loan is approved!”) with security and online threats being a major theme. Note that ‘humanized’ and ‘personalized’ are two different important factors. Humanized means counteracting the user feeling their requests are being served by a computer program, while personalized refers to a customized experience with their online interactions that feels tailored to their needs, attitudes, and utility rather than fees seemingly for a beige product suite with few alternatives. Well, guess what incumbents: there are fast-moving disruptors with better and better mousetraps.</p><p>Trust in interactions has also fallen precipitously as seen in by the survey’s results, led by bank institutions and insurance, but broadly across all major categories. Trust in banking fell to 37% in 2020 (from 51% of customers trusting their bank in 2018), Insurers fell to 32% (40% — 2018) and Online Payments to 21% (from 30% Trust in&nbsp;2018).</p><p>KABN is uniquely placed to play a role in all these personalized, customer-centric interactions. The customer stands to gain online safety and confidence, the customer owns and can transparently monetize their own identity, and Liquid Avatar stands to be a customized key, wallet, and armour to open empowered and expanded online presence and functionality.</p> Two recent transactions — the announced sales of Kount and SoFi — indicate takeout valuation goalposts <p>Two relevant transactions were announced thus far in 2021. The first was Kount, which announced an acquisition for US$640 MM in cash by Equifax (EFX:NYSE). The second was the acquisition of fintech startup SoFi for US$8.65 BB by one of Social Capital’s special purpose acquisition corporations.</p><p>So to valuation: in each of these cases, the takeout premiums were impressive, and de-emphasize revenues in favour of what SoFi refers to as “WINNER TAKES MOST.” We know what this means. My thesis is that the firms with best-in-class products that are in a position to respond to the massive growth in online eCommerce are going to share a huge pie, not take the whole thing. And the value they are in a position to create is driving buyers to pay up for years of as-yet unrealized performance.</p><p>Take <a href="https://kount.com/">Kount</a>, a leading provider of anti-fraud solutions to thousands of North American&nbsp;brands.</p><p>They have two significant assets, one being a robust proprietary data library and the other being a “secret shopper” type process whereby they test your company’s system for fraud protection. Kount then operates as a high end security consulting firm with bespoke solutions for clients’ eCommerce suites.</p><p>This drove a valuation we estimate at &gt;13x trailing twelve months’ (TTM) revenue, a number that obviously demonstrates the value of their non-revenue performance. They appear cash flow breakeven for at least another full year, as Equifax speaks to the value they will add in over two years of future performance as part of the basis of their purchase price. Equifax constantly runs the risk of becoming a dinosaur every passing day and needs the shot in the arm that is found in new and promising technology. That said, they have the liquidity to acquire new products and teams rather than build them in-house so they can quickly leverage for their existing customers and cross-sell for internal use and customer acquisition alike. Equifax is no stranger to security challenges across their own customers, being dealt a blow in 2017 over a security breach that exposed over 150 million customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Social Capital’s offer to acquire <a href="https://www.sofi.com/">SoFi</a> represents a significant going-public premium. SoFi is widely recognized as a central market disruptor in financial services right now. This transaction represents an acquisition by a Special Purpose Acquisition Company, not dissimilar to an RTO (reverse takeover) method of going public. This is effectively a financial transaction with a lofty premium in spite of the lack of any synergies or strategic development other than going&nbsp;public.</p><p>SoFi is a fintech pioneer that is disrupting the banks, being vastly more customer friendly and customer focused, and offering a far lower cost model given the internet infrastructure rather than bricks and mortar banking. The valuation being paid by venture capital firm Social Capital implies 13.6x 2025E forecast Adjusted Net Income on figures released by Social Capital. To provide a nearer term perspective, this implies a valuation of 13.9x 2020E Adjusted Net&nbsp;Revenue.</p><p>This means the buyer has already pre-paid for five full years of success culminating in projected results to be announced around now in 2026, at a 50%+ percent premium to current banking institutions’ one-year forward earnings. In the case of SoFi, the SPAC shell saw its value soar, meaning investors see more room above and beyond the premium’s baked in accomplishments. We would also note there are normal considerable growth milestones yet to be accomplished by SoFi that their growth relies upon, notably the receipt of a federal banking&nbsp;license.</p> Summary <p>In summation, we believe the market is entering a new period of non-standard valuations for best-in-class technology that delivers on customer expectations. We expect this will continue all through 2021 and into the foreseeable future.</p><p>We will leave with a parting thought: Merriam-Webster Dictionary has added the word “crowdfunding” for 2021. Things are developing so fast even the dictionary is trying to stay relevant.</p><p>KABN is potentially well-positioned to thrive in this fast-paced environment.</p><p>© 2021 Thomas Kennedy.

<p>Hundreds of millions of cards have been stolen from online retailers, banks and payments companies before being sold for cryptocurrency on dozens of online marketplaces. According to Elliptic’s analysis, the founder of one of the most popular carding marketplaces, Joker’s Stash, has retired having amassed a fortune of over $1 billion.</p> 
<p>Every time you make a purchase with a credit or debit card, your card details are transmitted and stored in computer systems. Many of the major hacks of retailers and other companies are motivated by getting hold of these card credentials.</p> 
<p>Stolen cards have value because they can be used to purchase high-value items or gift cards, which can then be resold for cash. This process is known as “carding”, and has become a key part of the cybercriminal’s playbook. Carding is very profitable in its own right, but it is also used to help launder and cash-out cryptocurrency obtained through other types of cybercrime.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Joker’s Stash - the King of Carding</p> 
<p>Over the past six years, Joker’s Stash rose to become the largest online seller of stolen credit cards and identity data. It is an example of a carding AVC (automated vending cart), which allows large volumes of cards to be sorted, filtered and purchased for Bitcoin with immediate delivery. In the image below you can see these cards categorised and searchable by country, bank, expiry date and other attributes. The going price for a single card on Joker’s Stash ranges from $1 to $150, with those at the upper end coming complete with the cardholder’s name, address and social security number.</p>

We then describe how we think about traction, then drill down in further and further detail from key performance indicators, to traction hypotheses, and finally to the 2021 product roadmap by quarter. Let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> From 0→ 1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>From Ocean’s inception until the end of 2020, the focus for Ocean was getting product-market fit (“0 → 1”) around <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/mission-values-for-ocean-protocol-aba998e95b8">unlocking data</a> [1]. In early 2020, we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-product-update-2020-f3ae281806dc">2020 roadmap</a>, and by the end of 2020 we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-in-2020-c5297e73584f">had met&nbsp;it</a>.</p><p>Let’s review the major items. In fall 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">released</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-v3-posts-413b2dd33e8f">Ocean V3</a>. It was a huge release for us. It included two products to publish / buy / consume / stake on datasets / services:</p>  <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market webapp</a> — for data publishers, consumers, and&nbsp;stakers  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean developer tools</a> — core software libraries &amp; contracts for developers to integrate with other apps or build wholly new&nbsp;apps  <p>In Dec 2020, we <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">released</a>:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO</a> — a community-curated grants DAO for growth &amp; long-term sustainability.  <p>The reception to all three products has been enthusiastic. There are tens of teams building on Ocean core software, Ocean Market has hundreds of datasets with more than €5M TVL [2], and OceanDAO has a steady cadence of monthly funding cycles to teams which promise positive value. There’s also steady chat in Telegram and Discord channels surrounding all three products, and a vibrant weekly videochat town&nbsp;hall.</p><p>The most important outcome was: People started to treat data as an&nbsp;asset.</p><p>We’d designed for this, by wrapping each dataset as an ERC20 token (datatoken), for use in DeFi. MetaMask became a data wallet, and Balancer a data DEX. People launched new data assets as Initial Data Offerings. People bought data assets not just to consume, but also to speculate. People staked on data AMM pools, not just to curate but also to provide liquidity. The perennial question “how do you price data?” got answered definitively: the market prices the data. Trading volume is over 100 times the consume volume; this is a good thing because trading and liquidity are preconditions for markets to form. We just witnessed the birth of the open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p> To 1→ N (The&nbsp;Future) <p>In short, Ocean has a first toehold in product-market fit (“0→1”). Data is being treated as an asset; this is the foundation going forward. Many users are able to get real value from Ocean’s core product offerings. There’s still room to improve each of these products, for more users. Let’s focus on “more users”. The overall goal is ubiquity — we want Ocean to be used everywhere as key IT infrastructure for the planet, side-by-side with DNS, Bitcoin, and other emerging blockchains and protocols. To achieve ubiquity, we need sustained growth over long periods of time. The label ”traction” encapsulates the goal of growth over time. Therefore the focus for Ocean from 2021 onwards is traction (“1→ N”). Importantly, $OCEAN is <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-token-model-3e4e7af210f9">engineered</a> to grow as traction&nbsp;grows.</p><p>We’ve already started on the traction path, by having rapid iterations with users, to get feedback and translate that into improvements in each of the products (and all the planning, design, construction, etc that happens in between). For example, Ocean Market has seen remarkable evolution in just the few months it’s been live, due to these rapid cycles — from bug fixes to handling fraudulent actors to better-aligning incentives of publishers with&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>That’s a near-term approach to improve traction. We can structure this more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> Ocean Traction&nbsp;Strategy <p>Here’s our traction strategy (inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Traction-Startup-Achieve-Explosive-Customer/dp/1591848369">Traction</a>):</p>  Have target key performance indicators (KPIs)  Have hypotheses of how to grow those&nbsp;KPIs  Try the most promising hypotheses, and observe how they&nbsp;do  Double down on the hypotheses that do the best and prune the&nbsp;rest.  Once those experience diminishing returns, repeat the process with new hypotheses  <p>The next three sections outline (i) the KPIs, (ii) hypotheses, and (iii) specific plans respectively.</p> 2021 KPIs <p>In Dec 2020 and early Jan 2021, the Ocean core team met several times for planning 2021. Traction was the name of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>The following traction-oriented KPIs emerged. We aim to grow each of these indicators.</p><p>Data consumer/provider traction</p>  Value of data consumed in USD. This is particularly important — it’s a good indicator of value being created in this new data&nbsp;economy  Number of datasets / services&nbsp;offered  <p>Staking &amp; DeFi traction:</p>  Total Value Locked of OCEAN &amp; datatokens  Number of DeFi protocols with OCEAN &amp; datatokens as first-class citizens  <p>Developer &amp; community traction:</p>  Number of active high-quality dapps using&nbsp;Ocean  Number of GitHub contributors, external maintainers &amp; support, active ambassadors  Number of community members, and content&nbsp;creators  Value of monthly grants distributed by OceanDAO, while retaining quality  <p>Enterprise/government traction:</p>  Number of engagements. Specifically, for a dedicated handful of partners, maximize their success towards real-world production deployment   2021 Traction Hypotheses <p>With these KPIs in hand, we brainstormed on hypotheses of ways to drive them. (And of course we also included many ideas from the past too.) There were many great ideas! We then filtered to our favorites. Here’s the distillation of that, grouped according to three pillars: (I) Bottom-up, (II) Top-down, and (III) DeFi. Let’s elaborate on each&nbsp;pillar.</p><p>I. Bottom-up: Ocean Market users, developers, startups. Main activities:</p>  Drive growth of Ocean Market. Improve user experience (UX), including reducing gas costs. Further optimize incentive structure. Add virality. Help data publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers make money. Provide arbitrage opportunities.  Help people build with Ocean libraries. Improve developer experience (DX). Help teams make&nbsp;money.  Fund teams for building, outreach, unlocking data. Via OceanDAO (community-curated grants), Shipyard (core-team curated grants), and Data Economy Challenge (prizes). It’s especially important to grow OceanDAO, since it will decentralize Ocean further and position Ocean for long-term sustainability. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Integrations. Integrate more datatoken / service types: streaming data, oracles, etc. Deploy on more chains: Eth → many (<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">details here</a>). Integrate to more crypto apps: wallets, DEXes, DAOs, and more. Integrate to existing AI tools like scikit-learn, Anaconda, TensorFlow, OpenMined, and&nbsp;OpenML.  <p>II. Top-down: enterprises, governments. Main activities:</p>  Business development and services support, starting with POCs but leading to live deployments on massive scale. Help enterprises turn their data into value, including data “on their books” rather than as a liability. Help governments implement data policies with the help of&nbsp;Ocean.  Service partners. Growing a network of service partners to support these enterprise and government activities (to offload reliance on core&nbsp;team).  <p>III. DeFi. Main activities:</p>  Data Farming. It’s similar to liquidity mining but emphasizes consuming data (versus pure speculation). <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Details&nbsp;here</a>.  Work closely with DeFi projects. For each, get OCEAN as a first-class citizen, then follow up with datatokens. Conduct many experiments, from stablecoins to insurance, and double-down on what works&nbsp;best.  Data DeFi “snowballs”. Incentivize DeFi applications that make more money with more data, leading to a positive feedback loop on Ocean DeFi usage (“snowball effect”). This includes arb bots, trading systems, and yield farming tools that use AI for decision&nbsp;making.  <p>These traction pillars complement each other. All three have real-world use cases. All three involve users that have data, and want data. Bottom-up has low latency in feedback (hours or days), enabling rapid improvements in the products. Its exponential nature promises huge impact over the long term. Top-down demonstrates use cases on large brand names, typically has large numbers attached, and the added credibility helps influence policymaking around data. While top-down may not scale as well, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">doing non-scalable things</a> can really help traction in early days. DeFi has some of the best aspects of the others: like bottom-up it’s low latency and exponential in nature, and like top-down it has large numbers attached. And, it’s&nbsp;fun.</p> 2021 Ocean Product Roadmap, by&nbsp;Quarter <p>With the traction-oriented KPIs and traction hypotheses in hand, the Ocean core teams for product, ecosystem, etc did extensive planning. We reconciled this with the needs of our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>Below is what we arrived at, for our 2021 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support the three traction pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the KPIs. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving crypto environment.</p><p>The plans focus on Ocean products; dovetailing this there are extensive activities in ecosystem, enterprise, and communications towards the 2021 traction&nbsp;goals.</p> Q1/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2021. The highlight is fixing gas costs, and Compute-to-Data in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p>  Fix gas costs. Gas costs on Ethereum mainnet have become exceedingly high <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1358110993495318528">and may not abate</a>. We are addressing this by deploying Ocean contracts and running Ocean Market on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">&gt;1 chains</a>. <a href="https://www.purestake.com/news/moonbeam-and-ocean-protocol-partner-to-bring-a-new-data-economy-to-the-polkadot-ecosystem/">Moonbeam</a> and other chains are in the works. Each chain will include an OCEAN bridge to Ethereum mainnet. At least one will be ready by end of&nbsp;Q1.  Ocean Market: has <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/compute-to-data">Compute-to-Data</a>. This enables buying &amp; selling of private data from Ocean Market webapp&nbsp;itself.  Ocean Market: allow more than one pool for each datatoken. This helps migrating from one pool to another, and is a first step towards Ocean Market linking to other AMM pools, order book based exchanges, and&nbsp;more.  Ocean Market: fewer bugs, faster. This includes continued bug fixes, use TheGraph for Total Value Locked (<a href="https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi">TVL</a>), and&nbsp;more.  OceanDAO: streamline flow to reduce friction for people creating proposals and voting. Grow the amount of funding, while <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/On-ROI">ensuring quality projects</a>.  Ecosystem, enterprise and communications activities that dovetail the products. This includes experiments in DeFi initiatives using OCEAN or datatokens.   Q2/2021 Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q2/2021. The highlights are the first deployment of Data Farming, an OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market, and supporting more than one datatoken type.</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a>: first deployment. This program incentivizes data consume volume. We will start by allocating a modest amount of OCEAN, then allocate more in each cycle as data consume volume grows. As we learn, we will refine the&nbsp;program.  OCEAN-backed stablecoin in Ocean Market. Having prices and liquidity set (optionally) in a stablecoin reduces variance due to fluctuations in OCEAN. A stablecoin backed by OCEAN, like <a href="https://medium.com/opendao/ocean-opendao-uma-a-new-stablecoin-269241dd8c5d">$OceanO by OpenDAO</a>, helps align interests between Ocean Market users and the broader Ocean community.  Architecture for more than one datatoken type. This refactor includes smart contract changes and a security audit. It allows us to move metadata to the ERC20 contract itself, which we will also do. The added flexibility will make possible a variety of datatoken types, including more fine-grained permissions, fee rate flexibility, and&nbsp;more.  Multi-chain: improve support by deploying to more chains, and enabling Ocean Market users to see data assets across several chains at once. Over time (not necessarily this quarter) support bridges for datatokens and cross-chain liquidity by leveraging developments in cross-chain technology.  OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Q3/2021 Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. The highlights are ramping up Data Farming, fine-grained permissions, and supporting more data services.</p>  Ramp up Data Farming. We will build on the learnings from Q2 to further scale up the OCEAN allocated, to further catalyze data consume&nbsp;volume.  3rd Party Markets: fine-grained permissions using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a> (RBAC) while retaining datatoken ERC20 mental model. Helps marketplace instances to control which actors can publish assets in that marketplace instance, view assets, and consume data assets. This is for 3rd party markets; Ocean Market will remain as open-ended as possible.  Data Services: support two more data services as data assets. Possibilities include WebSockets (streaming data), Chainlink, TheGraph, Streamr, GraphQL streaming data, and more; we will prioritize as we&nbsp;go.  Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.  <p>Q4/2021 Targets</p><p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q4/2021. The highlights are better staking and helping the community to monetize&nbsp;better.</p>  Better staking. People can stake OCEAN in data pools without having to buy the data asset in the process. This will use Balancer V2. In general, it will better align the incentives of publishers, consumers, and liquidity providers / stakers / curators.  Help community monetize. For people running their own marketplaces (as dedicated apps, or in wallets, etc), enable potential for fees in publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming, with flexibility on setting the&nbsp;fees.  Market: trustless &amp; convenient urls, to retain Ocean Market’s current convenience while removing its having brief custody of&nbsp;urls.  Data Farming, Data Services, Multi-chain, OceanDAO, Ecosystem activities: continue growing and improving.   Conclusion <p>Up until the end of 2020, our goal was to get initial product-market fit for Ocean (0→1). Now that we have a foothold on that, our focus going forward is traction (1→N). This article presented our KPIs, our hypotheses of how to achieve those, and finally specific product plans towards implementing hypotheses.</p> Appendix: Roadmap with Dependencies <p>The following image illustrates the roadmap presented above, but adding dependency information.

  <p>Hi everyone and welcome to chapter 14 of 2020! It’s been a little while since we talked about standards for passwordless so we’re excited to tell you about some new enhancements and features in FIDO2 land that you'll start seeing in the wild in the next few months!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
 Specification Status 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Web Authentication API (WebAuthn) Level 2</a> specification is currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a> at the W3C. "Level 2" essentially means major version number 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version 2.1 of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html">Client to Authenticator Protocol (CTAP)</a> specification is a Release Draft at the FIDO Alliance. This means the spec is in a public review period before final publication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These new draft versions are on their way to becoming the next wave of FIDO functionality (as of the writing of this blog, we support Level 1 of WebAuthn and CTAP version 2.0). We think you might want to hear about what we think is especially fun about WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Enterprise Attestation (EA) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enterprise Attestation is a new feature coming as part of WebAuthn L2 and CTAP 2.1 that enables binding of an authenticator to an account using a persistent identifier, similar to a smart card today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO privacy standards require that "a FIDO device does not have a global identifier within a particular website" and "a FIDO device must not have a global identifier visible across websites". EA is designed to be used exclusively in enterprise-like environments where a trust relationship exists between devices and/or browsers and the relying party via management and/or policy. If EA is requested by a Relying Partying (RP) and the OS/browser is operating outside an enterprise context (personal browser profile, unmanaged device, etc), the browser is expected to prompt the user for consent and provide a clear warning about the potential for tracking via the persistent identifier being shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Authenticators can be configured to support Vendor-facilitated and/or Platform-managed Enterprise Attestation. Vendor-facilitated EA involves an authenticator vendor hardcoding a list of Relying Party IDs (RP IDs) into the authenticator firmware as part of manufacturing. This list is immutable (aka non-updateable). An enterprise attestation is only provided to RPs in that list. Platform-managed EA involves an RP ID list delivered via enterprise policy (ex: managed browser policy, mobile application management (MAM), mobile device management (MDM) and is enforced by the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spec reference:</p>
<p><a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.1-rd-20201208/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.1-rd-20201208.html#sctn-feature-descriptions-enterp-attstn">CTAP 2.1 - Section 7.1: Enterprise Attestation</a><br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#enum-attestation-convey">WebAuthn L2 - Section 5.4.7: Attestation Conveyance Preference</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Authenticator Credential Management and Bio Enrollment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credential Management is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows management of discoverable credentials (aka resident keys) on an authenticator. Management can occur via a browser, an OS settings panel, an app or a CLI tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of how the Credential Management capability is baked into Chrome 88 on macOS (chrome://settings/securityKeys). Here I can manage my PIN, view discoverable credentials, add and remove fingerprints (assuming the authenticator has a fingerprint reader!) and factory reset my authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking on "Sign-in data" shows the discoverable credentials on the authenticator and allows me to remove them. This security key has an Azure AD account and an identity for use with <a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/u2f-fido2-with-ssh/">SSH</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bio Enrollment allows the browser, client, or OS to aid in configuring biometrics on authenticators that support them. This security key has one finger enrolled. I can either remove the existing finger or add more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's an example of authenticator credential management via a CLI tool, <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/">ykman</a> from Yubico.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Set Minimum PIN Length and Force Change PIN 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CTAP 2.1 allows an RP to require a minimum PIN length on the authenticator. If the existing PIN does not meet the RP’s requirements, a change PIN flow can be initiated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An authenticator can also be configured with a one-time use PIN that must be changed on first use. This is an additional layer of protection when an authenticator is pre-provisioned by an administrator and then needs to be sent to an end user. The temporary PIN can be communicated to the end user out of band. We see this being used in conjunction with Enterprise Attestation to create a strong relationship between an authenticator and a user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Always Require User Verification (AlwaysUV) 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AlwaysUV is part of CTAP 2.1 and allows the user to configure their authenticator to always prompt for user verification (PIN, biometric, etc), even when the Relying Party does not ask for it. This adds an extra layer of protection by ensuring all credentials on the authenticator require the same verification method.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Authenticator DevTool 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is not tied to updates of either specification but we love it and wanted to share! Chrome and Edge (version 87+) now include a virtual authenticator as part of DevTools. It started as a Chromium extension back in 2019 and is now native! Oh, and the <a href="https://github.com/google/virtual-authenticators-tab">code is on Github</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a great tool for testing, debugging and learning! Try it with one of the awesome WebAuthn test sites: <a href="https://webauthnsample.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft WebAuthn Sample App</a>, <a href="https://webauthn.io/">WebAuthn.io</a>, <a href="https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration">Yubico WebAuthn Demo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access the tool, open Developer Tools ( <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">F12 or Option + Command</a><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/shortcuts">+ I</a> ), click the Menu icon on the top right (…) then More tools and WebAuthn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabling the virtual authenticator environment will allow you to create a new authenticator by picking a protocol (CTAP2 or U2F), transport (USB, Bluetooth, NFC or internal), resident key (discoverable) and user verification support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new credentials are created, you’ll see them listed and the sign count will increase as the credential is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Want to know more? Here’s an amazing blog by <a href="https://twitter.com/nsatragno">Nina Satragno</a> from the Chrome team over at Google who created this amazing DevTool!</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/webauthn-tab">How we built the Chrome DevTools WebAuthn tab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Wrap Up 
<p>That rounds out the major features we believe will have the most impact. Here’s a few other enhancements and features that are important to mention!</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-iframe-guidance">cross-origin iFrame usage</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-apple-anonymous-attestation">Apple’s anonymous platform attestation format</a> 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-large-blob-extension">Large blob storage extension</a> to support storing a small chunk of encrypted data with a credential to support use cases like SSH certificates 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d like to hear more about any of these enhancements/features (or anything else identity related, let's be honest), leave us a note in the comments.</p>

<p>Consumers can leverage their financial data to improve their financial health, gain access to financial services, and enhance control over their finances. In order to benefit from these financial outcomes, consumers provide access to their financial data to end users through data access providers. If data access providers truly want to empower consumers, they must protect that data and ensure that control of the data remains firmly in the hands of the consumer. And a commitment to protect data in word only isn’t enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data access providers that share financial data they have assembled for the purpose of lending, insurance, and employment, must adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). Operating as a Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA) is the best way to ensure a consumer-first lending approach that both protects and empowers borrowers. Anything less is just words.</p>
<p>Let’s look at this in greater detail.&nbsp;</p>
 The FCRA and Financial Data Sharing 
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/report-basics/fair-credit-reporting-act-fcra/">The Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. In order to maintain transparency and ensure accuracy, the Act also requires that consumers have access at any time to any personal financial data provided for credit or insurance eligibility decisioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While FCRA has historically applied to credit bureaus and certain specialty CRAs, like tenant screening and medical information companies, the Act has a broad scope of coverage and is not limited to traditional credit reporting or a narrow set of CRAs. Third-party data access providers that power financial data permissioning between lenders and consumers use a different type of data sharing model for which FCRA compliance provides an equally critical component of protecting consumers when they access credit and other financial services.</p>
<p>As it stands, the FCRA applies to consumer reports that<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit-reporting-agency.asp"> CRAs</a> provide to third parties for certain permissible purposes described in the FCRA, such as determining a consumer’s eligibility for credit or insurance. Consumer reports can only be provided and used for these permissible purposes. If data access providers, also known as data aggregators or data agents, are assembling a consumer’s financial data and sharing it for the purpose of credit or insurance decisioning, shouldn’t those providers be considered CRAs, and shouldn’t the FCRA apply to their data sharing?</p>
<p>In order to protect and empower consumers, we think so.</p>
 Empowering Consumers with Compliant Data Sharing 
<p>FCRA compliance is the only sure way to guarantee fairness, accuracy, and transparency when data access providers assemble consumer financial data and provide it to lenders or insurers to make credit or insurance decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A current regulatory interpretation of the FCRA suggests that an organization does not become a CRA when it forwards financial data to a third party at a consumer’s request because they are simply engaging in “permission-based sharing” on behalf of the consumer. Finicity believes this interpretation of the FCRA was meant to address different circumstances, such as where a mortgage broker forwards a consumer’s application and credit report to prospective mortgage lenders at the consumer’s request. This and other “conduit”-like functions fall outside the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do not believe, however, that this interpretation was intended to cover situations where a data access provider or other party “assembles” consumer data to provide to financial data users. Such a broad reading of the “permission-based sharing” interpretation would run counter to the purpose of the Act and undermine the protections the FCRA was created to uphold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can’t data access providers simply promise protections to consumers? Such assurances are of course important, but can vary from provider to provider. Consumers are best served when all data access providers are held to a common standard of consumer protection. Operating as a CRA requires that data access providers adhere to the FCRA and provide specific dispute and disclosure processes that enable consumers to access and view their data, dispute any errors, and understand how their data is being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a data access provider is delivering consumer data it has assembled to creditors for use in credit decisioning, and is not functioning as a CRA, it is not adhering to the FCRA and not protecting consumers as well as it could.</p>
<p>With open banking and digital financial services continuing to pick up speed, it’s more crucial than ever that the industry demonstrate that the consumer-permissioned data sharing process is conducted fairly, accurately, and with transparency for the consumer. Those positive outcomes follow when a data access provider, in appropriate circumstances, is functioning as a CRA and is legally required to adhere to the FCRA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only when such protections are in place can consumers reliably enjoy the empowerment and improved financial outcomes they deserve. And the financial services industry can similarly benefit from the growth and innovation that comes from the increased acceptance of leveraging consumer-permissioned financial data for the benefit of consumers.

<p>Finicity releases detailed analysis affirming that data aggregators should be deemed CRAs and subject to FCRA requirements</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY, Utah – February 11, 2021 – Finicity, a Mastercard company and leading provider of open banking solutions, has produced a detailed whitepaper with analysis showing why the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) should apply to providers of data aggregation services (“data agents”) in certain circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FCRA protects consumers by establishing and protecting the right for individuals to dispute inaccurate data in consumer reports and get those errors fixed. The growth of consumer-permissioned data sharing in lending, insurance, and employment means that FCRA compliance will become a critical component of consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As Open Banking puts consumers in control of their financial data and gives lenders a more complete view of consumers’ creditworthiness, it’s critical that the sharing of financial data is conducted fairly, accurately, and with the utmost transparency,” said Steve Smith, Co-founder and CEO of Finicity. “Leveraging the protections of the FCRA will provide a vital regulatory framework that gives everyone in the financial ecosystem confidence in all of these areas, as well as manageable, familiar compliance standards for the data agents behind growing aggregation capabilities for underwriting use cases.”</p>
<p>Lenders have increasingly relied on new forms of financial data, such as information about a consumer’s bank account transactions, which can enable better, more effective credit-decisioning for lenders. This data supplements the traditional credit score to expand the lenders’ view of a borrower’s financial health, and ultimately stands to increase financial inclusion. Not only does this financial data give lenders a more thorough credit review process, it also empowers consumers with control over their own financial data, which they can grant or revoke access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With the emergence of third-party data aggregators and their ability to provide financial data for the purposes of credit decisioning, FCRA compliance is essential to protecting the consumer,” said Chi Chi Wu, Staff Attorney with the National Consumer Law Center.</p>
<p>Finicity believes this new credit process also necessitates that it function in concert with fair reporting principles: data should be accurate, consumers should have access to their own data, and they should know when and how their data is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In December 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the federal banking agencies released an Interagency Statement on the Use of Alternative Data in Credit Underwriting. In the Interagency Statement, the agencies recognized the consumer benefits of considering cash flow data in credit decisions and noted how consumers “can expressly permission access to their cash flow data”—through data agents—to enhance transparency and consumer control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFPB is expected to propose new rules around consumer-authorized access to financial data in early 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity is releasing a detailed white paper “FCRA and Data Agents” with analysis of the mechanics and benefits of FCRA compliance for data aggregators. The full white paper can be downloaded at:&nbsp; <a href="https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/">https://info.finicity.com/fcra-data-agents/</a></p>

					 <p>Since launching the first production-grade platform for <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, we’ve seen over 1,000 innovators from all over the world build solutions leveraging the verifiable credential standard. These innovators collectively have deployed production verifiable credentials to over 80,000 people across five continents. These teams trust Trinsic to maintain a robust platform upon which they can depend. Today we’re announcing two new resources to support these and future production deployments: an API status page and a community Slack channel. </p>

					 <p>Dependability, or being as secure, scalable, and available as we can be, and transparency, or being open with our partners about our platform’s capabilities and limits, are two of our core values. The best way we know to demonstrate our dependability in a transparent way is to host a public API Status page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A status page has been a highly-requested feature for some time. You can find the new status page at: <a href="http://status.trinsic.id">status.trinsic.id</a>. We began testing the status page a few months ago using several tools that interact with various different API endpoints across our multiple APIs. This ensures that each kind of endpoint (for example, endpoints that access wallet storage and ones that write to the ledger) is sufficiently covered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>View historical uptime: Using the status page, you can see the last 90 days of uptime of all our externally-facing services. You can also inspect individual incidents and view incident reports.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be notified of incidents: By clicking the “subscribe” button in the upper-left of the screen, you can have any downtime or incidents trigger a notification to your email or Slack workspace.</p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications. But, changing business practices, hybrid IT, cloud and other aspects of digital transformation has meant that users of privileged accounts have become more numerous and widespread. One area in sharp focus is DevOps support which has become essential to many organizations looking to become more responsive and innovative. Application developers and other agile teams increasingly need privileged access to essential tools, and several PAM vendors are responding to this demand.</p>

<p>Press Release</p>



<p>J Cromack, Managing Director of MyLife Digital, has been named as one of DataIQ’s top 100 most influential people in data. Cromack was acknowledged for his ongoing dedication to protecting data rights.</p>



<p>The DataIQ power table, developed in partnership with data visualisation expert Tableau, has been used to track the rise of data scientists, data governance professionals, and chief data and analytics officers since 2014.</p>



<p>Cromack was recognised as a key influencer in the data space, ranking amongst the most prominent data enablers on the country’s first and only fully-curated list of the most powerful data and analytics practitioners. “As an enabler, my focus is on helping my clients maintain the utility of, and build, their first party data assets and ensure the data is fully compliant with global data protection regulations,” says Cromack of his role in data protection and privacy.</p>



<p>Together, both Cromack and MyLife Digital are fighting to change the way that consumer data is handled, advocating for greater transparency and control on behalf of customers. As part of this, MyLife Digital has created a scalable consent and preference management platform that empowers consumers to make smarter, more informed decisions over how their data is used, while also supporting businesses in their efforts to build stronger relationships and instil trust in consumers through secure data management.</p>



<p>He said, “I’m delighted to be included in the DataIQ 100, it is an incredible accolade and excellently reflects the amazing work that the team at MyLife Digital have been doing to help organisations adopt more ethical frameworks to use personal data. We’re very proud to have built great technology that helps businesses grow trust through data understanding while empowering consumers to make decisions on how their data can and can’t be used.”</p>



<p>The coveted spot on the DataIQ 100 list comes just months after Cromack’s nod at the 2020 DataIQ awards, where the data expert was named&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataiq.co.uk/articles/articles/dataiq-awards-2020---privacy-and-trust-champion-j-cromack-mylife-digital">Privacy and Trust Champion</a>&nbsp;of the year. He was recognised for his ongoing support in protecting individual data rights in the digital world, and for his appreciation of the importance of building trust between organisations and their customers. Cromack was also a runner up in the Data for Good category.</p>



<p>As one of the country’s top data influencers, Cromack is planning to use his status to better promote the importance of privacy UX and data ethics, which the MyLife Digital team predict will be hot topics throughout 2021. Data ethics is a key area of interest, and Cromack and his team are currently developing plans to educate businesses on this subject, shifting away from tracking technologies and moving closer towards authenticated journeys. MyLife Digital is on track to release a Data Ethics whitepaper in the spring.</p>

So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a Graduate or Junior UX/UI Designer for our Australian team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organisations to allow them to build privacy first solutions




 




We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship and build a new, more meaningful relationship. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




This is an exciting opportunity to start your UX career with a technology start-up working to improve the world! Meeco is a growing team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK and we are looking for a junior UX/UI designer to join our Adelaide based design team.




 




This role is ideally suited to someone who doesn’t necessarily have commercial experience in the UX field, but is excited and passionate about user experience and how design can help humanise technology.




 




You will be working closely with our Chief of Design, and you will be involved in the full design process. The following will help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Help to gather and evaluate user requirements  Conduct UX research  Brainstorm and workshop design solutions  Contribute to developing user personas, customer journey maps, storyboards and user flows  Contribute to wireframing and high-fidelity designs  Contribute to creating design-based prototypes  





 




We use a variety of industry standard tools including Figma. It is not a requirement that you have experience in using any of these tools, but a willingness to learn and self-directed education is required.




 





 About You 





 




We are looking for someone who is either studying or has recently finished a course in UX or similar fields. You will have worked on at least two UX projects that you are proud of and be willing to present them and explain your decisions (these can be personal projects or student projects).




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical or design solutions.




 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. An open mind, a desire to learn and being able to incorporate constructive feedback is essential.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




The following is our wish-list. It is not necessary that you have all this experience, butthe more you have or can pick up quickly will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  Be able to demonstrate a genuine interest in UX/UI, either through your study or personal projects  Experienced in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  You have experience in using design tools such as Figma, Sketch, Affinity or Adobe design suite  Keeping up to date with the latest UI/UX design and usability trends and techniques  Understand what a design system is  Understand and have experience with web development technologies such as Javascript and CSS  





 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office in Adelaide. Given the mentoring aspects of the role, we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and be self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 





 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 





 What We Have Achieved 




We&nbsp;are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. &nbsp;&nbsp;Search for Meeco on-line and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about our crazy, wonderful, roller-coaster start up journey check out this recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dtoy2wpKPFA">keynote at the MyData Conference in Helsinki</a>, or these recent podcasts such as <a href="https://howtobemoderatelysuccessful.buzzsprout.com/1400926/7158607-building-a-business-to-solve-the-personal-data-problem-with-katryna-dow-from-meeco-me">this on entrepreneurship</a> or <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=data-minimisation-meeco-katryna-dow">this on identity</a> featuring our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow">Katryna Dow</a>.




 




Awards: We have won&nbsp;eight&nbsp;international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands and Germany for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: In December 2019 we launched our secure data vault inside KBC’s (Belgium) banking app and&nbsp;next month&nbsp;we are launching a media platform&nbsp;for kids&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.miks-it.com/">mIKs-it</a>&nbsp;These are just two great examples of how enterprises and other start-ups are using our technology to developer better Privacy and Security by Design personal data solutions.




 




Innovation:&nbsp;Through&nbsp;2020&nbsp;we doubled our engineering team along&nbsp;with some really interesting&nbsp;blockchain/distributed ledger&nbsp;projects&nbsp;which we are currently&nbsp;productising&nbsp;to launch throughout&nbsp;2021.




 





 How to Apply 




By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you have to do is contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a>




 




Please include&nbsp;what you like about the role, why&nbsp;you&nbsp;may&nbsp;want to join,&nbsp;any questions along with your&nbsp;resume and&nbsp;confirmation of your Australian citizenship or residency.




 




Last time we advertised we had hundreds of applications. Whilst we were delighted it took us a few weeks to consider the long-list and juggle interviews between Australia and Europe. If you meet the criteria,&nbsp;we will be in touch with you&nbsp;as soon as possible.



We’re all looking forward to meeting you soon!&nbsp;

<p>Credible v0.1 pushed to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub</a> with its core functionality enabled, <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">documentation</a>, and is moving towards stability for white-labeling.</p><p>Today, Spruce is open-sourcing under the Apache 2.0 license an early developer release of Credible (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/credible">GitHub repository here</a>), a native mobile wallet for W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers built on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter">Flutter</a>. We were able to package the DIDKit library written in Rust into a Flutter application running on both Android and iOS, using C bindings and <a href="https://dart.dev/guides/libraries/c-interop">Dart’s FFI</a> capabilities. A special thank you to <a href="https://github.com/brickpop/flutter-rust-ffi">brickpop/flutter-ffi-rust</a> for paving the way in the use of this technique, which inspired our own implementation’s architecture.</p>DIDKit’s Architecture<p>We hope you enjoy this release, and if you would like an invitation to the iOS TestFlight or Android Play Beta store builds of Credible, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/hqgP9f">enter your email</a> to receive an invite&nbsp;soon.</p> Who this is&nbsp;for <p>We believe that there will be no “one size fits all” credential wallet because the user experience must be appropriately tailored to each use case. Workflows involving trusted information tend to be extremely sensitive to context, with vast differences in the kinds of information used, methods of verification, and user interfaces from situation to situation. For example, the following use cases will demand completely different interfaces:</p>  A hospital wants to allow its qualified medical staff and pharmacists to digitally sign and verify prescriptions, respectively.  A trading desk wants to set position limits based on a trader’s digital authorizations issued by the&nbsp;firm.  A user wishes to demonstrate their history of transactions with a merchant, granting them special status and benefits at another venue through a commercial partnership.  <p>Comparing just these three, there’s a lot of variety that no single user experience can truly satisfy. They all share a need to make important data verifiable and portable, but the difference in their user experiences shows how unlikely it is for one overarching “wallet interface” to rule them&nbsp;all.</p><p>Instead, we are striving to build a solid, general-purpose technological foundation suitable to be tailored for specific use cases and workflows. This is the wallet counterpart to the rich, growing toolkit supplied by DIDKit, the two pillars of a reference architecture for creating trusted interactions at&nbsp;scale.</p> Credible’s core technologies: VCs and&nbsp;DIDs <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> are a cryptographically-signed, contextualized, and highly portable data format used to represent beliefs about reality, such as someone’s educational certifications, employment history, and licenses. They can also be used to represent beliefs about non-person entities (NPEs) such as code repositories, IoT devices, and data sets. Credible brings the ability to receive with, safely store in, and present VCs from your smartphone, making them truly&nbsp;yours.</p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> are a kind of URI that can be universally resolvable across the Internet, public blockchains, and other data sources. They are used in conjunction with a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a> to establish public key-based control authority of a “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-controller">DID controller</a>” and enable service discovery of “service endpoints.” People may manage several DIDs each to keep different aspects of their life separate and private. DIDs may also be managed by non-person entities, such as software agents, industrial equipment, and computer servers. Credible currently supports the use of a single DID from your smartphone, with multi-DID support on the&nbsp;roadmap.</p><p>VCs and DIDs may be used together in powerful patterns, built from the fundamental issuance, storage, verification, and revocation workflow. DIDs can be used to cryptographically sign VCs, and because most DIDs can be resolved to their public keys, anyone can then verify the produced VC as authentic and tamper-proof, thereby increasing their trust of the information inside. Credible currently supports the use of DIDs to request, store, verify, and present VCs. Future versions of Credible will also allow for issuance and revocation.</p><p>Credible ships out of the box with support for the <a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">Tezos DID method</a>, which we have jointly authored with the Tezos ecosystem. The development of this DID method, as described in our <a href="https://sprucesystems.medium.com/didkit-v0-1-is-live-d0ea6638dbc9">DIDKit release post</a>, will be able to take full advantage of future <a href="https://www.tezosagora.org/period/40">protocol upgrades</a> on the Tezos public blockchain to provide best in class decentralized identity-specific support across the whole stack, down to the VM bytecode. We especially look forward to the use of <a href="https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/sapling-integration-in-tezos-tech-preview.html#:~:text=Shielded%20transactions&amp;text=In%20a%20shielded%20transaction%20the,to%20as%20the%20shielded%20pool.">shielded transactions</a> to increase privacy while retaining the availability of DID resolution, and the use of <a href="https://medium.com/tqtezos/tickets-on-tezos-part-1-a7cad8cc71cd">tickets</a> to allow for sophisticated on-chain permissioning while exercising DID document&nbsp;control.</p><p>Currently, the only server interactions that Credible will make are through URLs scanned from QR codes.

<p>As the first covid-related health pass certified by ID2020, we’re proud to offer our support to this initiative to create an interoperable blueprint for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=identitysolutions&amp;highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6765232832974487552">#identitysolutions</a>&nbsp;and restore our economies and lives.</p>
<p>Starting today, BLOK BioScience – as part of the BLOK Solutions family – will work towards building widely accepted, secure, privacy-first standards for health passes, in the good company of a growing number of leading global organisations.</p>
<p>Of the initiative, our CTO Areiel Wolanow says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several companies – including our own – have brought already health passport solutions to market, and many more are in the process of doing so.&nbsp;At the same time, most of the world’s countries are trying to figure out what they need from a health passport, or if they want one at all.&nbsp;With both requirements and solutions in such a state of flux – and likely to remain so – the key to having solutions that remain viable and actually help manage this pandemic is for those solutions to be interoperable.&nbsp;Most of the health passport solutions currently on the market claim to be interoperable — as long as you accept their own solution as the base framework for any such collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we really like about ID2020’s Good Health Pass is that it enables true interoperability, setting a basis for collaboration that is truly independent of any one solution while enforcing preservation of the values that led us to build a solution in the first place.&nbsp;We are very happy to endorse Good Health Pass, and commit its adoption to our product roadmap.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://medium.com/id2020/good-health-pass-a-new-cross-sector-initiative-to-restore-global-travel-and-restart-the-global-8b59eb1050a0">original release on the launch from the GHPC Medium channel </a>below.</p>
 Original Good Health Pass Collaborative release 
<p>Today,&nbsp;<a href="http://id2020.org/">ID2020</a>&nbsp;announced the launch of the&nbsp;<a href="http://goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass Collaborative</a>&nbsp;along with more than 25 leading individual companies and organizations in the technology, health, and travel sectors — including the&nbsp;Airports Council International (ACI),&nbsp;Commons Project Foundation,&nbsp;COVID-19 Credentials Initiative,&nbsp;Evernym,&nbsp;Hyperledger,&nbsp;IBM,&nbsp;International Chamber of Commerce (ICC),&nbsp;Linux Foundation Public Health,&nbsp;Lumedic,&nbsp;Mastercard,&nbsp;Trust Over IP Foundation, and others.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;is an open, inclusive, cross-sector initiative to create a blueprint for interoperable digital health pass systems that will help restore global travel and restart the global economy.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every segment of the global economy, but none as profoundly as<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/industries-most-and-least-impacted-by-covid19-from-a-probability-of-default-perspective-september-2020-update">&nbsp;travel and tourism</a>. Last year, airlines lost an estimated<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-11-24-01/">&nbsp;$118.5 billion USD</a>&nbsp;with related impacts across the economy in excess of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.unwto.org/impact-assessment-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-on-international-tourism">$2 trillion USD</a>.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the announcement, the Collaborative also released its first white paper, entitled,&nbsp;<a href="https://goodhealthpass.org/good_health_pass-a_safe_path_to_global_reopening">Good Health Pass: A Safe Path to Global Reopening</a>.</p>
 Collaboration Among a New Ecosystem of Players 
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s one thing the world agrees on — we need to address the health concerns today to support a return to normalcy,” said&nbsp;Ajay Bhalla, President of Cyber &amp; Intelligence at Mastercard. “Delivering a global, interoperable health pass system can only happen if we come together in a way that meets the needs of everyone involved. This Collaborative will be critical in helping to define how we connect the pieces that will bring travel back safely, spark job creation and jumpstart the world’s economic engine.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Various efforts are currently underway to develop digital health credentials systems — both vaccination and test certificates — for international travel. Yet, despite this race to market, it is unlikely that a single solution will be implemented universally — or even across the entire travel industry. Thus, it is critical that solutions are designed from the onset to be interoperable — both with one another and across institutional and geographic borders.</p>
<p>The Good Health Pass Collaborative is not intended to supplant existing efforts but rather to help weave them together, fill gaps where they may exist, and facilitate collaboration among a new ecosystem of stakeholders, many of whom have never worked together before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Fragmentation is a risk we simply cannot ignore,” said&nbsp;ID2020 Executive Director Dakota Gruener. “To be valuable to users, credentials need to be accepted at check-in, upon arrival by border control agencies, and more. We can get there — even with multiple systems — as long as solutions adhere to open standards and participate in a common governance framework. But without these, fragmentation is inevitable, and travelers — and the economy — will continue to suffer needlessly as a result.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Global Travel &amp; Digital Health Credentials 
<p>COVID-19 test results are already required for entry at some airports and at international borders. But existing paper-based certificates are easy to lose, unnecessarily expose sensitive personal information, and are prone to fraud and counterfeiting.</p>
<p>By contrast, digital health credentials can be printed (e.g., as a QR code) or stored on an individual’s mobile phone. They enhance user privacy and “bind” an individual’s identity to their test result or vaccination certificate, thus enabling real-time, fraud-resistant digital verification.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Our health data consists of the most sensitive personal information, deserving of the strongest privacy,” said&nbsp;Dr. Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security By Design Centre. “Release of our health data must be under our personal control. The Good Health Pass does just that: With Privacy by Design embedded throughout, you control the release of your digital health data, and to whom; all de-identified and decentralized. Privacy and functionality: Win/Win!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The&nbsp;World Health Organization&nbsp;recently convened the&nbsp;Smart Vaccination Certificate Consortium&nbsp;to establish standards for vaccination certificates, but no analogous effort currently exists for test certificates. Given that it is expected to take years for vaccines to be universally available globally, widespread testing will remain an essential public health tool — and one that must continue alongside vaccination to ensure a safe and equitable return to public life.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Good Health Pass Collaborative&nbsp;has defined four primary requirements that digital health credential systems for international travel must satisfy:</p>
 
 Cross-border:&nbsp;Solutions must work at airports, airlines, ports-of-call, and borders worldwide and comply with international and local regulations. 
 Cross-industry:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. 
 Secure &amp; privacy-protecting:&nbsp;Solutions will require the collaboration of the travel, health, governments, and technology sectors. Solutions must comply with all relevant security, privacy, and data protection regulations and must be able to bind the presenter of the credential to the credential itself at the required level of assurance. 
 Frictionless:&nbsp;Solutions must seamlessly integrate into testing and travel processes, thus enhancing and streamlining the experience for individuals and airlines alike. Solutions must not add new material costs for travelers. Optimally, validation processes will be contactless to maintain or enhance hygiene. 
 
<p>The Collaborative welcomes the participation of policymakers and representatives of government agencies; companies in the health, technology, and travel sectors; and civil society organizations who share a commitment to safely restoring international travel and economic activity while simultaneously ensuring that equity, privacy, and other civil liberties are protected.</p>

  Introduction 
<p>Cozy is a versatile open-source personal cloud used to gather your personal data in a safe place. You can <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/tutorials/app/">develop</a> any client-side application to manipulate existing data types, called <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/cozy-doctypes/">doctypes</a>, or simply create your <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-client/schema/">own</a>.<br>
As a result, many types of data can be stored in a single database instance. It is then crucial to be able to efficiently query data so the user can smoothly retrieve it.</p>
<p>Over the years, we witnessed many different use-cases of data manipulation at <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Cozy Cloud</a> and gained some experience about scalability issues and common traps developers might fall in when dealing with databases.</p>
<p>This article aims to give a short overview of the most common mistakes we saw (and - let’s admit it - sometimes made!) about data indexing and querying. The concepts we discuss here are rather generic and can be applied to many database engines, both SQL and No-SQL. In the following, our examples primarily assume a <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> database, as this is the one used in Cozy, but we provide pointers to the equivalent concepts for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, which are some of the best known database engines, respectively in SQL and document-oriented No-SQL.</p>
<p>Our example uses <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-client">cozy-client</a>, a Javascript library that provides an API to simplify the interaction with the  Cozy <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-stack">backend</a>, for authentication, realtime, offline, etc. And most importantly, it provides interfaces to query the database and deal with the indexes.</p>
 Indexes: the what and the why 
<p>Index: why?</p>
<p>Indexing data is useful as soon as your database grows and data cannot be retrieved in a reasonable time through full-scan queries, i.e. by scanning the whole database.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you don’t want to query all you data at once: you use filters to restrict the selected data. It is typically done through a <code>where</code> clause in SQL, a <code>find</code> method in MongoDB or a <code>selector</code> in CouchDB.<br>
You might also want to retrieve data in a particular order, by sorting it, or selecting only certain fields to be returned.</p>
<p>While it is possible to do such tasks on the client side, they are generally delegated to the database server to ensure scalability. After all this is its job!<br>
However, there is no magic here: you cannot expect a database to automatically deal with large amount of data in a perfectly suitable way for your needs.<br>
This is where indexes takes place: they are used to tell the database how to organize data in such a way that your queries can be efficiently run, even though the database contains millions of elements.</p>
<p>ℹ️ Index is obvisouly not the only thing to keep in mind when dealing with databases, but we focus exclusively on it for this article, for the sake of conciseness.</p>
<p>Index: what?</p>
<p>An index is a way to organize documents in order to retrieve them faster.<br>
To give a simple and non-database comparison, a recipe book might have an index listing all the recipes by their name with their page number. If the reader is looking for a particular recipe, this index avoids him to scan the full book to find it.</p>
<p>The principle is the same for database indexes: we want to avoid scanning the whole book (which can be a table, a collection, etc) each time we are looking for specific data: even though computers are way faster than humans to scan data, this task can be very time-consuming when dealing with thousands or millions of documents.</p>
<p>In more formal terms, time complexity of a query run on a database with <code>n</code> documents will be <code>O(n)</code> without index, as it requires to scan all documents sequentially.<br>
There are many types of indexes in the litterature. One of the most common index structure is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-Tree</a>: it is the default in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/indexes-types.html">PostgreSQL</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/">MongoDB</a>. This index structure performs in <code>O(log n)</code> in average, which guarantees a very fast access time even in large</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From a practical point of view, B-trees, therefore, guarantee an access time of less than 10 ms even for extremely large datasets.<br>
—Dr. Rudolf Bayer, inventor of the B-tree</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In CouchDB, the indexes are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree">B+ Trees</a>, a structure derived from the B-Trees.<br>
The indexed data are document fields. When indexed, it is called keys, and are organized as a tree, with the documents stored in the leafs nodes. So, finding a particular document means browsing the tree, from the root to the leaf.<br>
The keys are organized by their value: if we suppose a node with two keys <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code> and three children, the leftmost child node must have all its keys inferior to <code>k1</code>, the righmost child’s keys superior to <code>k2</code>, and the middle child’s keys between <code>k1</code> and <code>k2</code>.</p>
<p>In the Figure below, borrowed from the <a href="https://guide.couchdb.org/editions/1/en/btree.html">CouchDB guide</a>, you see that each node has three keys, but in the CouchDB implementation, a B+ Tree node can actually store more than 1600 keys.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This design is very efficient for range queries: in the example above, a query looking for documents having an indexed field between 1 and 3 will browse the tree to find the first document position (with a key of 1) and then get the next two contiguous documents.</p>
<p>ℹ️ In  the following, we refer about “B-Tree”, that can indifferently be applied to B-Tree or B+ Tree: the main concepts remain the same in both cases and their differences are not relevant in this discussion.</p>
<p>Traps with indexes</p>
<p>Indexing data is not as easy as it might look. There is not one way to index, which must depend on you data model and the queries you need to run for your application. But, as you will see in this article, keeping in mind how the indexes - here the B-Tree - work in background helps a lot!</p>
<p>ℹ️ Each database engine has its own way to index data with its own specificities. Therefore, we do not focus on the indexing itself but rather on the common traps that you might encounter when designing indexes for an application, which can be applied to most of the databases, as long as a B-Tree is involved.</p>
 Pagination 
<p>When there is too much data to handle at once on the client side, it is good to implement pagination. This consists of splitting a <code>Q</code> query into several <code>Qi</code> sub-queries so the client can progressively retrieve data and update the UI accordingly.</p>
<p>ℹ️ From a UX perspective, there are different strategies to implement pagination. Typically if you data is rendered as a list, you can either have a ‘Load more’ button at the bottom or automatically detect the need to fetch more data when the user is at the end of the list.</p>
<p>We focus here on how to split <code>Q</code> and the consequences on the performances.</p>
<p>A simple way to do it consists of combining a <code>limit</code> and <code>skip</code> parameters to the query.</p>
<p>💡 Those parameters are available in <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html">CouchDB</a>, as well as <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.skip/">MongoDB</a> or <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/queries-limit.html">PostgreSQL</a> (in SQL, <code>skip</code> is called <code>offset</code>).</p>
<p>Let’s assume <code>Q</code> retrieves 1000 documents. You can implement pagination by running <code>Q</code> 10 times by setting a <code>limit</code> to 100 and <code>skip</code>  the number of already retrieved documents.</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This pagination method does not scale and can be very bad for performances! Let’s see why.</p>
<p>This method actually breaks the B-Tree indexing logic: there is no way to efficiently skip a fixed number of data in such a tree, so skipping documents consists of normally running the <code>Q</code> query and then splitting the results starting from the <code>skip</code> number of documents, until the <code>limit</code>.<br>
Thus, instead of taking benefit from the tree traversal to efficiently start each <code>Qi</code>, the <code>skip</code> forces the query to start each query from the first document of the tree, and perform a sequential scan from there.</p>
<p>In the schema below are represented the scanned documents for <code>Q1</code>, <code>Q2</code>, <code>Q3</code>, assuming a <code>limit=2</code> to simplify the drawing.<br>
<code>Q1</code> needs to scan 2 docs, <code>Q2</code> 4 docs and <code>Q3</code> 6 docs.<br>
The boxes in grey are the documents scanned by <code>Qi</code>  and the boxes in green the documents actually returned. We can see that each <code>Qi</code> with <code>i &gt; 1</code> needs to scan useless documents, this behaviour being worse for each new query.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fortunately, there are simple and efficient ways to perform pagination.</p>
<p>In CouchDB, you can use <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#pagination">bookmarks</a>, that you can see as a tree pointer to indicate where to start the query. This is simply a string returned by each  <code>Qi</code> that you can pass as a parameter for the next query:</p>
<p></p>
<p>By doing so, each <code>Qi</code>  starts at the end of the previous query, avoiding unecessary scan:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 This bookmark system does not exist in MongoDB or PostgreSQL. However, you can still benefit from efficient pagination by using the last document key returned by the previous query. As the tree is organized by keys, <code>Qi</code>  will be correctly positioned in the tree, that is, at the end of the previous query. See this <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">article</a> for more details about a SQL approach and this article for a <a href="https://www.codementor.io/@arpitbhayani/fast-and-efficient-pagination-in-mongodb-9095flbqr#approach-2-using-id-and-limit">MongoDB</a> approach.</p>
 Non-contiguous rows 
<p>When designing indexes, it might help to keep in mind how the B-Tree are structured, notably when dealing with multi-fields indexes.<br>
Indeed, if you need to query several fields of a same index, you might perform sub-optimal queries if you are not careful.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example to illustrate how such situation could occur. <code>Q</code> is a query for a To-do application that retrieves tasks by their creation date and category, respectively <code>created_at</code> and <code>category</code>.</p>
<p>To do this, you first create an index on those two fields, in this order. Then, you perform a query, for instance to get all the tasks made in 2020 in the "work" category. With <code>cozy-client</code>, this can be expressed like this:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is represented a sample of the scanned index data: it starts from <code>2019-01-01</code> and stops at <code>2020-01-01</code> as the the data is sorted by its first row, the <code>created_at</code>.<br>
Then, for each scanned row of this interval, the entry is returned if it has a "work" category. The returned rows for the query are represented in green.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The problem here is that you might scan unnecessary rows: in the example above, you can see a “sport” task made the 2019-01-03. It is not a big deal if the "work” category represents the majority of the tasks, but it is a pity if there are only a few of them. Imagine you have 1000 tasks for this year, with only one being in a "work” category: you’ll have to scan the 1000 tasks to only find one element, so 99.9% of the scanning is actually unnecessary.</p>
<p>In order to make this query efficient, you need to make an index that will organize data in contiguous rows.</p>
<p>Let’s take back our example, but this time by changing the index order: you first index  <code>category</code> and then <code>created_at</code>.</p>
<p>The index data is now organized as follow:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now, the very same query can be efficiently processed: the "work” category is first evaluated in the B+ Tree, which return all the relevant rows, sorted by <code>created_at</code>. Then, the range is easily found now that all the rows are contiguous and only the returned rows are scanned.</p>
<p>💡 When creating an index, carefully think about how your data will be organized and which query will need to perfom. The performances can dramatically vary depending on your design, with several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>💡 When dealing with a query with both equality and range, you should first index the equality field. If you are interested about this, you can learn more <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/searching-for-ranges/greater-less-between-tuning-sql-access-filter-predicates">here</a> for a SQL approach.</p>
<p>However, it is not always possible to keep this design: you might need a more advanced concept called partial index.</p>
 Partial index 
<p>In the previous section, we saw that a query should be able to be run on contiguous rows in an index to maximize performances. However, this is not always possible when dealing with more complex queries.</p>
<p>We introduce here partial indexes. They are used to express predicates that will be evaluated at the indexing time. Data is then indexed only if it matches the predicates.</p>
<p>This can actually be useful in several situations:</p>
 
 Queries without contiguous rows 
 Queries with existence predicates 
 Queries with constant values 
 
<p>Let’s dig in these cases and see how it can be useful!</p>
<p>Queries without contiguous rows<br>
Let us consider a query looking for tasks created after 2019, that are NOT in the “work” category:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ The rows cannot be contiguous in the index because of the negative predicate, <code>$neq</code> (for not-equal). The index will have to scan all the rows to find those without the “work” category and filter out the ones without the correct date range.</p>
<p>By using a partial index with the negative predicate, this query becomes efficient as only the tasks without a “work” category will be indexed, by the <code>created_at</code> field.</p>
<p>The query is now:</p>
<p></p>
<p>💡 Note it is no longer necessary to index the <code>category</code> field: therefore, the index will be smaller, more efficient and will take less place on disk.</p>
<p>Queries with existence predicates<br>
The <code>category</code> field might be optionnal in your To-do application. In this case, it might be useful to check its existence:</p>
<p></p>
<p>⚠️ This query will typically return nothing in CouchDB. This is because a document will be indexed only if the indexed fields exists in the document. So a task without a set <code>category</code> will never be indexed.</p>
<p>A partial index solves the issue, as it will simply evaluate the existence of the field on indexing time:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Queries with constant values</p>
<p>You might need to retrieve documents based on a field value that you know will never change. For instance, you might have a <code>status</code>  field that is set to “ARCHIVED” when the task is archived.<br>
To retrieve these tasks, you can directly use a partial index:</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this case, a partial index is useful to reduce the index size as you avoid to index the <code>status</code> field.</p>
<p>💡 Lightweight indexes take less space on disk and are more efficient both for lookups and updates, so this optimization could be worth it if you have a lot of data to handle.</p>
<p>💡 Partial indexes are useful to keep contiguous rows in indexes, to use existence predicates and to decrease indexes size. Depending on your use-cases and data volumetry, you could benefit a lot from partial indexes!</p>
<p>💡 In SQL, you can create partial index simply by specifying a <code>WHERE</code> clause in the index definition. See how to do it with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/indexes-partial.html">PostgreSQL</a>. In <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-partial/">MongoDB,</a> the principle and syntax is quite similar to <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/api/database/find.html#find-partial-indexes">CouchDB</a>.</p>
 Cozy Contacts: a real-world use-case 
<p>Theory is great, but let us illustrate what we discussed by a concrete example and how the performances dramatically improved in our <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts">Contact</a> application, thanks to partial indexes.</p>
<p>In Cozy, there are several ways to import contacts: you can typically import them directly from a vcard file or use the <a href="https://github.com/konnectors/cozy-konnector-google">Google konnector</a> to automatically synchronize contacts with your google account. And, because Cozy is an open-source platform, anyone can come up with a new way to import contacts, potentially with their own contact format.<br>
Because of this, we implemented an asynchronous <a href="https://docs.cozy.io/en/cozy-stack/apps/#services">service</a> that periodically checks when new contacts are added, and migrate them in the expected format for the Cozy Contacts app.</p>
<p>However, because this service is asynchronous, we cannot expect to have all contacts migrated when the user opens the application. So, we ended up with two queries run to retrieve contacts:</p>
 
 A query to retrieve migrated contacts (<code>Q1</code>) 
 A query to retrieve non-migrated contacts (<code>Q2</code>) 
 
<p>Both those queries were checking the existence of a special document field for each contact to know if the contact is migrated or not. However, as we previously discussed, a missing field cannot be indexed in CouchDB. Therefore, <code>Q2</code> was actually making a full-scan index to evaluate the non-existence of this field. As a result, this query was taking a lot of time to complete, as soon as the user had a lot of contacts.<br>
And the worst part is that <code>Q2</code> actually returns nothing most of the time, as the contacts are migrated only once!</p>
<p>So, <code>Q2</code> was an excellent candidate for partial indexes: we implemented <code>Q2.1</code> that finds contacts with the missing field through the partial index: this way, the document is still indexed when the field is not here. You can find its actual implementation <a href="https://github.com/cozy/cozy-contacts/blob/f562ff661bf3957d6af807d520886c117f580c0d/src/helpers/queries.js#L70-L99">here</a>.</p>
<p>The diagram below show the performance impact by comparing the execution time of the three queries in the most common scenario: <code>Q1</code> returns 1000 contacts while <code>Q2</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> returns nothing.<br>
<code>Q2</code> complexity is <code>O(n)</code> with <code>n</code>  the total number of contacts, while both <code>Q1</code> and <code>Q2.1</code> are <code>O(log n)</code>. Note <code>Q2.1</code> does not even appear in the diagram because it only takes few ms to perform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, using a partial index improved the overall queries performances by a factor 2 for 1K contacts, and by a factor 8 for 10K contacts. Neat!</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We hope this little index tour gave you some insights about performances and data indexing.<br>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>The recent SolarWinds incident has shed a light on an area of cybersecurity that is not frequently in focus. Better said, it is “again has shed a light”, if we remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-heartbleed-bug-in-openssl-probably-the-most-serious-security-flaw-in-years" title="Hearbleed incident">Heartbleed incident</a> that happened back in 2014. Back then, my colleague Alexei Balaganski wrote in a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="blog post">blog post</a> that “software developers (both commercial and OSS) […] should not rely blindly on third-party libraries, but treat them as a part of critical infrastructure”.</p>
<p>What we need is a defined approach and consequent enforcement of what, in a slightly awkward manner, is called C-SCRM or Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management. This concept includes enforcing software security from the very beginning of its development cycle. It is not only about cloud services and COTS (commercial of the shelf) software but applies to any type of software that is procured or self-developed, including software in things and devices as well.</p>
<p>Consequently, we must extend the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/zero-trust-nowhere-near-the-end-of-the-story-yet" title="Zero Trust paradigm">Zero Trust paradigm</a> beyond networks, security systems, and identities and apply it to all types of software. Don’t trust software, period.</p>
 What does Zero Trust stand for? 
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/zero-trust-as-a-concept-for-trust-and-security" title="Zero Trust">Zero Trust</a> has been defined over 10 years ago as a concept that focused on removing implicit trust from network architectures and enforcing strict identity verification and access controls for every user or device. “Trust but verify” might be a popular saying, but the motto of Zero Trust has always been “Don’t trust. Verify”. This is the quintessence of the Zero Trust approach that has <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero_trust_paradigm" title="evolved since then">evolved since then</a> to other areas of security, beyond the network, including identity and device security.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is a paradigm, not a tool. It helps in architecting cybersecurity infrastructures and in defining concepts for operations. Given that security needs to be verified and enforced in multiple places – as the concept states – it involves a range of technologies to implement such a Zero Trust paradigm in an IT infrastructure.</p>
 What happened in the SolarWinds incident? 
<p>The <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds" title="SolarWinds incident">SolarWinds incident</a> was an attack that became public in December 2020 but had been running at least for several months beforehand. The installers for SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring platform had been backdoored. Unfortunately, that software is (or has been) running in many organizations, including major cloud data centers. Several other software vendors like Microsoft and FireEye have reported that they’ve been breached through the use of SolarWinds products.</p>
<p>What this attack demonstrated is that even large software vendors with strong cybersecurity background can be compromised due to the inherent software and cybersecurity supply chain risks. Unfortunately, most organizations trust the software they procure and use, instead of verifying its security. And, unfortunately, verification is not easy to do and has its limits. But it can be done, it must be done, and it results in increased security. However, some products you can purchase might go as far as explicitly demand that customers disable their antimalware tools before installing them. This is the complete opposite of the idea of Zero Trust.</p>
 What is Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management? 
<p>Before looking at the specifics of software security (secure software, securing software), this leads to the broader theme of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/resch/cscrm-is-essential-for-digital-business" title="C-SCRM">C-SCRM</a>. This discipline applies the broader Supply Chain Risk Management to software and IT services and addresses the inherent cybersecurity risks. This is not only about using SaaS services or COTS software, but also about software in connected devices and things such as sensors, machines, control devices, etc.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk Management looks at the risks regarding both the reliability of supply chains and risks and damages derived from suppliers, from misconduct (e.g. child labor) to quality issues.</p>
<p>C-SCRM tries to assess and mitigate the risks that come from IT, particularly software, specifically regarding the availability of IT and – as the name implies – security.</p>
 What does C-SCRM include? 
<p>Going into detail would be beyond the scope of this post. However, you may want to listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve2_2020_06_02_schuetze2" title="this talk">this talk</a> of my colleague Christopher Schuetze on the necessary components of an effective C-SCRM approach.</p>
 How to apply Zero Trust on Software Procurement 
<p>In essence, we can’t trust software, in whichever form we receive and use it without validating its integrity and security first. Software security must be consequently enforced and verified, including measures such as</p>
 
 Secure design and coding practices: While concepts like “secure by design” are being discussed for many years, they are still not implemented everywhere. Now is the latest time to start working on it. This also includes modern software testing principles. 
 Software composition analysis: Any reused code such as open-source libraries must be constantly tracked. Where is it used? Which version is in use? Are there known vulnerabilities and patches for them? Which coding practices are in use by the suppliers of this code? 
 Static and dynamic code analysis: There is a range of tools for static and dynamic code security, which can be used to identify security issues in code. These practices should be extended to areas like API design as well. 
 Organizational controls: This all must become part of the ISMS (Information Security Management System), with defined and enforced controls. 
 Security analytics: Last not least, security analytics can help to identify anomalies in software. While operational analytics has been a part of DevOps for years, it should be expanded to cover security telemetry and forensics as well – such integrated platforms are already available. 
 
<p>A good summary of this is provided by my colleagues Matthias Reinwarth and Alexei Balaganski in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a>.</p>
 How to check for Software Security 
<p>To quote Alexei Balaganski again, from <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident" title="what he wrote backin 2014">what he wrote back in 2014</a> as a recommendation following the Heartbleed incident:</p>
<p>“One of those approaches, unfortunately neglected by many software vendors, is hardening applications using static code analysis. Surely, antimalware tools, firewalls and other network security tools are an important part of any security strategy, but one has to understand that all of them are inherently reactive. The only truly proactive approach to application security is making applications themselves more reliable.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, code analysis tools […] don’t get much hype in media, but there have been amazing advances in this area since the years when I’ve personally been involved in large software development projects. “</p>
<p>There is a lot of solutions available to improve code security and mitigate risks in the software supply chain. It is about using these the right way, integrated into a holistic C-SCRM approach. You’ll find further information in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/post_solarwinds_security" title="episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast">episode of the KuppingerCole Podcast</a> on post-SolarWinds software security strategies.</p>
 The extended Zero Trust approach: Don’t blindly trust software 
<p>Zero Trust must be extended and cover software security, for software in any form (embedded, COTS, as-a-service) and regardless of whether it’s home-grown or externally procured. “Don’t trust. Verify” – this is as essential for software as for identity, devices, or networks.</p>

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on integrating Okta with popular infrastructure as a code solution. If you’re not into Chef, check out our <a>Ansible</a>, <a>Puppet</a>, and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>Chef cookbooks are a great way to manage infrastructure at scale. However, like other configuration management tools, Chef works best when cookbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish in typical server setup and configuration tasks like install Nginx and tweak conf file. However, it can get tricky with server managing server accounts and credentials as people join or leave your ops team and as you need to rotate server keys.</p>

<p>To tackle identity in servers with automation, Ops teams usually take two approaches: push SSH keys for every user or integrate servers with an LDAP or AD.</p>

<p>Pushing SSH Keys for every admin on every server has significant security implications and requires a lot of effort when an admin leaves the company or when keys need to be rotated. And that can go bad as soon as someone accidentally shares a secret key.</p>

<p>Integrating a large server infrastructure with LDAP or AD – usually done using PAM modules – requires a lot of work. LDAP and AD are monolithic – built to run on the intranet – and not good when you have servers in multiple places, requiring site-to-site VPNs, among other hoops. Do you want to run an HA middleware service blocking your ability to scale in the cloud? This is a pain point no Ops Engineer wants.</p>

<p>However, there’s a third approach: integrate Cloud SSO to secure servers. In this tutorial, we will do that by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Chef Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>chef-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure cookbook 

<p>In your terminal, navigate to your chef home and clone our sample cookbook:</p>

   <code>cd $CHEF_REPO/cookbooks
git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-chef-example.git
cd asa-chef-example
</code>   

<p>Optionally, review the cookbook contents:</p>

 
   The <code>recipes/install-asa.rb</code> is the default recipe of the cookbook. It:
     
       Installs the ASA server agent using the appropriate package for your distro (<code>node['platform_family']</code>) 
       Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
       Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
       Starts the ASA server agent 
     
   
   The <code>recipes/uninstall-asa.rb</code> uninstalls the ASA server agent from your machine. 
   The <code>kitchen.yml</code> provides specs for testing this sample cookbook in Chef’s Kitchen (with VirtualBox and Vagrant). 
   The <code>test/integration/default/default_test.rb</code> provides specs for validating the sample cookbook. 
   The <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file stores the enrollment token for registration in ASA. 
 

<p>Edit the <code>attributes/default.rb</code> file, replacing <code>ENROLLMENT_TOKEN</code> with the token from ASA:</p>

   <code>default['asa_enrollment_token'] = 'ENROLLMENT_TOKEN'
</code>   

<p>To confirm your configuration has no typos, enter <code>cookstyle attributes/default.rb</code>:</p>

   <code># cookstyle attributes/default.rb
Inspecting 1 file
1 file inspected, no offenses detected
</code>   

 Test cookbook 

<p>Now that we have the cookbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll use <a href="https://kitchen.ci/">Chef Test Kitchen</a> as a harness environment, and apply the cookbook to multiple Virtual Machines.</p>

<p>Tip: The sample cookbook has a script (<code>kitchen.yml</code>) that sets our test environment automatically using VirtualBox VMs managed with Vagrant.</p>

 Launch test kitchen 

<p>In your environment with Chef workstation, install VirtualBox and Hashicorp Vagrant. (If you have a mac and homebrew, you can run the commands):</p>

   <code>brew install virtualbox --cask
brew install vagrant --cask
</code>   

<p>Enter <code>VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name</code> to get your computer network interface name that will be used by the test VMs (ideally, a network interface with the internet. In my case, its en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort):</p>

   <code># VBoxManage list bridgedifs | grep Name
Name:            en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)
Name:            bridge0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-bridge0
Name:            llw0
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-llw0
Name:            en12: USB 10/100/1000 LAN
VBoxNetworkName: HostInterfaceNetworking-en12
</code>   

<p>Edit and save the <code>kitchen.yml</code> file:</p>

 
   In lines 25-29, define the list of servers/VMs you want to test. You can remove a specific server or distro by adding a comment (<code>#+ space</code>). Example: <code># - name: centos-7</code>. 
   In line 35, paste the network interface name that will be used to bridge network connections. For example: <code>- ["public_network", { bridge: "en0: Wi-Fi (AirPort)" }]</code> 
 

<p>To set up your kitchen, enter: <code>kitchen create</code></p>

<p>Chef Test Kitchen will download and launch all VMs in VirtualBox. This may take some time.</p>

<p>To confirm your kitchen is running, enter: <code>kitchen list</code></p>

<p>The list will show you the VMs with the last action Created:</p>

   <code># kitchen list
Instance                    Driver   Provisioner  Verifier  Transport  Last Action  Last Error
asa-chef-ubuntu-1804        Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-centos-7           Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-debian-107         Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-opensuse-leap-152  Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
asa-chef-oracle-82          Vagrant  ChefZero     Inspec    Ssh        Created      &lt;None&gt;
</code>   

 Run cookbook in the test kitchen 

<p>To install and enroll your servers on ASA, enter <code>kitchen converge</code>.</p>

<p>Chef will execute the cookbook and enroll all your servers in ASA.</p>

<p>In ASA, you will see your server enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To confirm the recipe worked, enter <code>kitchen verify</code>:</p>

   <code>-----&gt; Verifying &lt;asa-chef-oracle-82&gt;...
       Loaded tests from {:path=&gt;".asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"} 

Profile: tests from {:path=&gt;"/asa-chef-example/test/integration/default"} (tests from {:path=&gt;"asa-chef-example.test.integration.default"})

Test Summary: 3 successful, 0 failures, 0 skipped
       Finished verifying &lt;asa-chef-oracle-82&gt; (0m1.09s).
</code>   

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions in the screen.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS

asa-chef-oracle-82          linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-chef-ubuntu-1804
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

<p>Note: Wait… what Okta ASA does for the login?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolith LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the cookbook on your Chef Kitchen, you can use it in your Chef Infra. To do so, tweak the cookbook (i.e. store the enrollment token on chef-vault or a data-bag), upload (<code>knife upload asa-chef-example</code>), and add the cookbook to specific roles and environments within your infrastructure:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your cookbooks and allow provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

Before we dive into explaining this amazing opportunity, we don’t want to waste your time. So,&nbsp;if you don’t have Australian&nbsp;citizenship or&nbsp;permanent residency,&nbsp;or if you are representing a&nbsp;recruitment agency or an&nbsp;offshore/provider, then this&nbsp;is not for you. We understand you may be an awesome candidate, or have access to great candidates, but we will not consider such applications at this time.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is looking for a&nbsp;Technical&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Lead&nbsp;for&nbsp;our&nbsp;Australian&nbsp;team, where you can help shape the API-of-Me.




 




What is the <a href="https://dev.meeco.me/">API-of-Me</a> you might ask?




 




It is an emerging platform that enables the collection, protection and exchange of personal data. Our main objective is to provide a suite of developer tools and APIs to companies and organizations to allow them to build privacy first solutions.




 




A&nbsp;secure data enclave that allows&nbsp;people&nbsp;to keep their data safe and share information with&nbsp;the people and organisations they trust.&nbsp;We are passionate about building a new economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organizations enter a win-win relationship by building mutual trust in how data is collected, protected and shared.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a>&nbsp;to learn more.




 




Don’t hesitate to apply, no matter what your background is. We would like to build a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia and Belgium, and collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, each with a unique personal data story.




 About the&nbsp;Role 




We are a global team of 25 people based in Australia, Belgium and the UK.&nbsp;The platform team currently consists of 17,&nbsp;responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting several services that, all together, form the backbone of our platform.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of several Ruby on Rails, Elixir and Java components for the backend services.&nbsp;For&nbsp;frontend,&nbsp;we primarily&nbsp;use&nbsp;Javascript and Dart for smartphone and&nbsp;decentralised applications, based upon blockchain&nbsp;and distributed ledger&nbsp;technology.




 




We’re a company that embraces innovation, so it is likely that&nbsp;our&nbsp;technology stack will&nbsp;continue to evolve and&nbsp;change. We are not averse to adding other technologies if the need arises for specific services.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code that are a result of programming for more than two decades. Sometimes, we have even found ourselves going against the popular vote on several topics.




 





  We favour the explicit over the implicit  We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority  We embrace the relational database and its possibilities and as such treat it as a first order citizen.   





 




The following&nbsp;will&nbsp;help you understand what you’ll be doing on a day to day basis:




 





  Being a technical leader; mentoring, triaging problems, offering a guiding hand  Coming up with a detailed plan on how to approach high-level requirements including tasks and&nbsp;estimations  Supporting the team to allocate and distribute the work according to individual capabilites  Designing and implementing&nbsp;new services&nbsp;with business logic called from&nbsp;existing &amp; new&nbsp;endpoints  Investigating bug reports that inevitably occur, helping a colleague identify problems  Reviewing and approving Pull Requests  Implementing data integrations to&nbsp;enable end-users access public&nbsp;and&nbsp;private&nbsp;data, this might include open banking,&nbsp;social, health, wearable, weather, travel or IoT&nbsp;data  Working&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF</a>&nbsp;Standards&nbsp;for&nbsp;implementations for distributed ledger&nbsp;implementations including Verifiable Credentials, Distributed Identity including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>  Working on leading-edge payments solutions including micro-payments and tokens  Contributing to a more transparent, open and trust-based personal data eco-system.    





 About You 




We are looking for someone who has a deep understanding of how to write RESTful resources exposed as APIs, cares about clean code (a lot) and is ready to learn (a lot). It is a big plus if you have experience writing these web-based applications in Ruby on Rails and/or in building decentralized applications in blockchain technologies.




 




We build applications for the internet of tomorrow, a place where personal data is placed right at the center, protected start to finish. This means we often tackle questions that have no established technical solutions. Google won’t help you as much in this case as it requires a combination of existing tech and emerging solutions. One class of technology that we are exploring and see great potential is in the distributed ledger space. A good understanding and professional experience building decentralised applications or dealing with DLT is a big plus.




 




Meeco is an environment with more questions than answers. If you are drawn to original problems, which require imaginative solutions, you’ll feel right at home. This does require you to be open for and comfortable learning new things and develop proof-of-concepts on short timelines, identifying the tasks that matter the most.




 




In addition to established experience as a developer, we expect that you have&nbsp;at least&nbsp;2+&nbsp;years experience in steering a team. using an agile methodology, be it scrum or a derivative.




 




You&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;support&nbsp;our executive team (Technology, Product, Design and Commercial&nbsp;Officers) in&nbsp;writing&nbsp;up&nbsp;technical proposals, along with translating Meeco’s technical&nbsp;vision&nbsp;into practical goals that support the&nbsp;commercialisation of&nbsp;our&nbsp;products.&nbsp;




 




The&nbsp;following is our crazy wish-list. It is not&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;that you have all this experience, but the more proven competencies you have will increase your chances of success in the role:




 





  You have taken lead on directing and implementing solutions to complex, unbounded (technical) problems based on limited scope&nbsp;  You have a track record of setting direction for teammates  You know how to take steps in improving the quality of existing and future software  You are comfortable communicating your ideas both verbally as well as written. We love to create diagrams to describe future systems.  You have used more than one programming language to build software, which can&nbsp;of course include&nbsp;hobby&nbsp;and passion&nbsp;projects  We have a soft spot for functional programming, so maybe you have too  We build both&nbsp;backend&nbsp;and frontend&nbsp;applications, so&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;any relevant frontend programming experience, especially with JavaScript, TypeScript and/or Angularjs&nbsp;would be awesome  You have used languages with built-in concurrency models like Go, Erlang, or Elixir  If you have a language you love, tell us about it!  You have a good understanding of what goes on in a RDBMS, especially Postgresql. You are familiar with devops&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Azure&nbsp;would be a bonus.&nbsp;  You know how to use Docker and Kubernetes.  





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have a team to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming skills, natural leadership and to care about our mission is&nbsp;all you need.




 




You might have a&nbsp;computer science or related degree,&nbsp;or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




This is a job where we&nbsp;support&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;However, we do have an office at Stone &amp; Chalk at Docklands in Melbourne. Given the leadership and mentoring aspects of the role,– we would like you to be in the office at least three days a week.&nbsp;At other times&nbsp;you are free to work where you work best.




 




We have team members in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia, London (UK) and spread out in Belgium. An important reality is that this can often mean early mornings or long days.&nbsp;




 




We have flexible hours, so you can design your day around being an early bird or night owl. For six months of the year the time difference with Europe can feel brutal, and then the other six months when Europe is on summertime it is much easier. However, being able to work across time zones and self directed is a critical aspect of this role.




 




We value people who can work independently, are able to manage themselves, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed.&nbsp;We love you asking for help!




 What We Offer 




We pay a competitive start-up&nbsp;package&nbsp;based on your experience and seniority in line with the existing members in the team. As we are still building our foundation team, additional incentives such as Options are available for the right person.




 What We Have Achieved 




We&nbsp;are&nbsp;early&nbsp;pioneers&nbsp;in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012. You can read more on our achievements and announcements on our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.meeco.me/">blog</a>.&nbsp;




 




Funding; our founder bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products

 The GiD Report#146 — The Elon effect and the need for Trusted Communities <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-145-ripples-sec-response-and-signal-s-moderation-problem-4a51b3402a06">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  Elon ❤&nbsp;Bitcoin  Podcast highlights  This week in Big&nbsp;Tech  The need for Trusted Communities  Chart of the week (Big Tech&nbsp;profits)  Stuff happens   1. The news everyone is talking about — Elon Musk goes big into Bitcoin (with&nbsp;Tesla). <p>From <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">their SEC filing</a> (via&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a>)</p><blockquote>Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon&nbsp;receipt.</blockquote>Photo: Pewdiepie/YouTube<p>So not only are corporations and institutions leaning into Bitcoin and crypto, you’ll be able to buy a Tesla with&nbsp;BTC.</p><p>It’s another giant leap toward mainstream adoption.</p><p>My Wall Street had some thoughts on how such moves might impact potential regulation:</p><blockquote>I think the most bullish thing is to have at least one large public American company with significant holdings as the government undertakes writing regulations. It’s super bullish to have the government writing regs knowing that they don’t want to crush the market value of significant corporate holdings. It’s different if they think they’re just crushing drug dealers and money launderers.</blockquote><p>Makes sense.</p> 2. This week in Big Tech — podcast highlights edition. <p>Greg Kidd on breaking up Facebook, Lina Khan, and the best thing about&nbsp;America:</p> 3. This week in Big&nbsp;Tech: <p>Facebook v.&nbsp;Apple:</p><blockquote>Hoping to prevent users from being spooked by Apple’s upcoming privacy changes, Facebook is testing a notification that tells iPhone users how it uses their data to tailor ads to them, Axios’ Sara Fischer&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: The test is happening in light of upcoming changes to Apple’s privacy settings that will require iPhone owners to give apps — including those from Facebook — permission to collect data for ad targeting.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-companies-union-push-26b9029d-f451-4839-8410-7123f1095178.html">Tech workers take tentative steps toward&nbsp;unions</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/pandemic-labor-union-jobs-639e1ea4-1ca4-4546-a2a9-7c485e7e782a.html">Unions in the COVID era have been revitalized after decades of losing&nbsp;power</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mayak">/mayak</a>— <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/former-google-ceo-fears-chilling-effect-of-antitrust-probes">Former Google CEO Fears ‘Chilling Effect’ of Antitrust Probes</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-antitrust-reform-bill-50f50bd2-0534-4055-92d9-6cb6d58e94bd.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosprorata&amp;stream=top">Klobuchar introduces sweeping antitrust reform&nbsp;bill</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-booming-business-sinking-reputation-b7035f9d-0b8d-40e0-a98e-7fe0ff677362.html">Facebook’s booming business, sinking reputation</a>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/22827197.24685/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL2ZhY2Vib29rLXdhcm5zLWFkdmVydGlzZXJzLW9uLWFwcGxlLXByaXZhY3ktY2hhbmdlcy01MDE4YjkwMy1jMmFmLTQzY2ItYWZlZi00ZjUzY2U3YjBmMmEuaHRtbD91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB1f6b89b6">Facebook warns advertisers on Apple privacy&nbsp;changes</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>— <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/who-is-in-charge-tech-elites-or-the-digital-mob-317438">Who is in Charge?

Dynamics in groups often mirror those of peer-to-peer messaging apps: People share, spread, and receive information directly to and from their closest contacts, whom they typically see as reliable sources. To make things easier for those looking to stoke political division, groups provide a menu of potential targets organized by issue and even location; bad actors can create fake profiles or personas tailored to the interests of the audiences they intend to infiltrate. This allows them to seed their own content in a group and also to repurpose its content for use on other platforms.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-groups-are-destroying-america/">Facebook Groups Are Destroying America</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knew-calls-for-violence-plagued-groups-now-plans-overhaul-11612131374">Facebook Knew Calls for Violence Plagued ‘Groups,’ Now Plans&nbsp;Overhaul</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/technology/how-to-fix-facebook-groups.html">NYTimes: How to fix Facebook&nbsp;Groups</a>  <p>Discord has its own trust&nbsp;issues:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/discord-scammers-lure-users-to-fake-exchange-with-promise-of-free-bitcoin">Discord Scammers Lure Users to Fake Exchange With Promise of Free Bitcoin — CoinDesk</a>   5.

					 <p>It’s hard to overstate the importance of an organization’s culture. Culture is an organization’s instinct; it determines what an organization will do in response to a given situation.</p>

					 <p>Situations constantly evolve from internal execution, stakeholder interactions, external collaboration, and more. I’ve seen first-hand toxic cultures that drive talented people away and supportive cultures that retain incredible talent despite all odds. I’ve seen how cultures can lead to transformative innovation and stagnant inaction. I’ve seen individuals change because of the culture they’re immersed in, and I’ve seen individuals change the cultures they’re a part of for the better. Ultimately, an organization’s culture determines its destiny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, we’re addressing one of society’s hardest problems—establishing trust. It’s easy in person to prove who we are on, but digitally it’s impossible. That creates a trust deficit that costs our economy billions of dollars. We believe that as trust increases, the world and its useful services will be more accessible to people who need them. In order to tackle this, we need brilliant, passionate people and a culture where those people will thrive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At Trinsic, that culture is one of ownership, building, and friendship.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Ownership 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Owners are different than renters, borrowers, or hired guns¹. Owners are motivated intrinsically to make things happen and to solve problems. Ownership opens the mind to new possibilities, causes people to learn and grow faster than they otherwise could, and is extremely fulfilling. But it’s also challenging.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Owners know what they’re in charge of and are accountable for their work. Owners are ambitious and motivated by the mission. Owners seek to win together with their colleagues for the good of the mission, not to get credit for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic has equity in the company. That means everyone is literally an owner and is incentivized to act in the best interest of the firm as a whole. Everyone, from the founders to new interns, has meaningful decision-making authority over their domains of ownership which are transparent to everyone.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Building 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Builders are skillful craftspeople who take intentional care to create. We build for the long-term in an iterative, step-by-step fashion. We all take skillful, thoughtful action toward creating long-lasting results. We are calculated, action-oriented do-ers and keep our eye single to the mission as we build.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is an individual contributor. There will never be roles which are strictly management (at least, not for a very long time); engineering leaders will never stop writing code, and business leaders will never stop developing the business. Decisions are made quickly, and people are never blocked from taking action.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Friendship 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Friends are enjoyable to work with, and at Trinsic we’re friends with one another. We are eager to befriend new kinds of people because we believe humanity is beautiful, and different people and perspectives will make us better. Friends are inclusive, honest, ethical, and supportive. Friends are trustworthy and communicate clearly about work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone at Trinsic is encouraged to develop relationships with others on the team. As a remote team, we are intentional about developing these relationships in work and play. Deceit, harassment, intimidation, and other inappropriate behaviors are intolerable. We care about and root for each other, both professionally and personally.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Journeys 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Startups can be likened to other kinds of difficult journeys. There are obstacles and challenges along the way to a worthwhile outcome. Some kinds of journeys are challenging but predictable. Others are uncharted and require creativity and resilience to succeed.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Mountaineers embark on a journey to reach new heights; some of which are death-defyingly dangerous or require tactful execution to succeed. Many difficult mountaineering journeys are impossible to accomplish solo; they require a team of sophisticated and trusted allies to accompany.</p>

					 <p>Trinsineers are people who’ve agreed to take the journey to make the world more accessible to people everywhere. We’re a team of&nbsp;people who happen to be working together inside a legal entity called Trinsic. This journey is not a casual stroll, but an expedition. As Trinsineers, we’re developing a culture that is not only helping us accomplish our goals but bringing fulfillment and enjoyment along the way. Trinsineers are owners, builders, and friends.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>We’re looking for more Trinsineers to join our team. If ownership excites you, you’re passionate about building great things, you’re friendly &amp; like other friendly people, and want to work on something with a *huge* potential for impact, we’d love to talk with you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://work.trinsic.id/">Careers</a>&nbsp;page and get in touch. We look forward to taking the journey with you!</p>

					   Contemporary thinkers have made the distinction not as owner vs renter, but as <a href="https://svpg.com/missionaries-vs-mercenaries/">missionary vs mercenary</a>. But the principle is as old as the Bible’s passage about “<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">shepherds vs hirelings</a>“.

<p>Munich and Hamburg, February 9th, 2021 – IDnow (www.idnow.io), a leading provider for Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and M-TRIBES, end-to-end software provider for transportation companies, announce their strategic collaboration. As part of the partnership, M-TRIBES integrates IDnow’s digital, AI-based identification solution into its platform to provide legally required customer identifications – quick, reliable and user-friendly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M-TRIBES integrates IDnow AutoIdent into its M-TOOLS technology platform in order to enable companies, in the areas of car sharing, car rental, urban mobility (including free-floating sharing of scooters, e-scooters, e-bikes) or fleet management, to use legally verified identification of users. The digital identification component verifies users in the smartphone app or web application to ensure that they are who they say they are and authorizes the use of the service. IDnow AutoIdent can be used to confirm the customers age or validity of ID or driver’s license documents in a legally compliant manner. IDnow is a leader in digital identity verification with artificial intelligence (AI) trained with millions of data points to securely verify potentially 7 billion customers from 193 different countries. Through the collaboration, M-TRIBES ensures that the identity management component of the software platform can be deployed to customers in the international mobility industry.</p>
<p>“More and more business processes in the mobility and transport sector are taking place digitally. Innovative, customer-oriented mobility concepts and services require simple and reliable handling that guarantees maximum security for all parties. This is the only way to implement future projects economically, securely and for maximum customer satisfaction at the same time. Digital identification plays a central role in this context. We are very much looking forward to the partnership with M-TRIBES and believe that the interlocking of leading, highly specialized technologies creates future viability for modern concepts,” explains Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>“Access to best-in-class software enables transportation companies around the world to become digital champions. The seamless integration of IDnow’s AI-based identity verification into our M-TOOLS technology platform is a key building block to increase operational efficiency and improve the customer experience across a wide range of mobility offerings,” said Patrick Arle, CEO &amp; Founder of M-TRIBES. “Partnering with IDnow is another step in our strategy to integrate state of the art digital tools and capabilities into our technology platform.”</p>
<p>The solution is used, by mobility service providers such as EWE Go GmbH, a subsidiary of the energy provider EWE AG. “We were in need of a solution for the legally required process of identification that runs digitally, quickly and reliably. We have achieved this with the integration of IDnow / M-TRIBES. The service, not only delights our on-site users, but also our own operations team,” says Lukas Schneider, Business Development Manager at EWE Go GmbH.</p>

<p>Employers and consumers have embraced digital in the wake of the global pandemic.

Underpinning it all is digital identity, which ensures secure and more personalized, streamlined user experiences.<br> <br> But in this world, identity is far more intricate and risky than the little card in your pocket or the family name you inherited. It’s data, and that makes identity both powerful and vulnerable—especially when the amount of data collected is growing exponentially.<br> <br> Has identity security kept up during this historic rise of digital interactions? Ping Identity’s CEO, Andre Durand, recently joined me for an episode of <a>Hello User</a>, our podcast on how identity creates our world.

  <p>Congratulations to Jeff Bezos and the entire Amazon team on their incredible accomplishment of building the most highly valued company on the planet and revolutionizing the face of retail as we once knew it. I am confident that Jeff will successfully tackle even more interesting challenges and projects during the next phase of his career.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His announcement last week prompted me to reflect on Amazon’s pioneering work in the areas of ecommerce, cloud computing, supply chain and logistics. Who could have predicted an online bookstore would fundamentally change the world of retail by transforming the role of technology in our daily lives and that identity would play such an integral part?</p>

<p>I believe there is another, even more important reason why Amazon has become so successful.</p>

<p>Since its inception, the company adopted a radical approach to building exceptional digital experiences. Amazon set the standard for making it easy to shop online and create an experience where identity becomes nearly invisible. Thanks to Amazon, our expectation of a standard digital ecommerce experience is to click “buy” and find a Prime box on our doorstep the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a consumer, I appreciate that Amazon recognizes me whenever I log in, regardless of where I am or what device I’m using. They’ve removed so much of the friction inherent in the identity experience and purchasing processes that Amazon has become the first - and usually only – place I shop online. I rarely have to log into Amazon, and I can’t remember the last time I had to reset my password - a frustration I seem to encounter too often on other sites. The effortless experience at Amazon hasn’t meant I’ve had to compromise my security or privacy. The company has proven you don’t have to choose one or the other. For example, they recognize if I’m shopping from a friend’s mobile phone. To ensure it's me, Amazon completes a few quick security checks, and I’m back to making my purchases. That proactive outreach gives me peace of mind and allows Amazon to safeguard its customers.</p>

<p>So what can we all learn from Amazon? And how does identity play a role in delivering Amazon-like experiences?</p>

<p>At ForgeRock we don’t think anyone should have to settle. Our aim is to enable digital experiences that make <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">access smarter</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">more secure and more personalized</a>.&nbsp;Whether you’re at work, at home or on the go, getting stuff done online shouldn’t be a hassle. I envision a world where you never login again. That’s not a distant reality. The technology exists today to create online experiences that feel natural and let you get stuff done without passwords or usernames. Instead we’ll be identified by new and safer credentials, such as behavioral biometrics and other <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">passwordless authentication</a> methods. </p>

<p>There are two Jeff Bezos quotes I turn to often for inspiration when I need a reminder about why the ForgeRock Identity Platform matters:&nbsp;</p>

  “We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.”&nbsp; 
	 “The best customer service is if the customer doesn't need to call you, doesn't need to talk to you.” 
 <p>We’re dedicated to helping all organizations replicate Amazon-like experiences. I see it happening already with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/our-customers">customers</a> like the BBC, Allianz, Geico and so many others. At ForgeRock, we’re going to keep innovating and pushing the industry forward to ensure that Amazon is just one of many places where your digital identity gives you an easy button to getting things done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We're exploring a number of "Headless" combinations at Fission. The first one is with the Ghost Content Management System (CMS). We use Ghost to run this blog and want to start using it to integrate with and power our home page, so it's a great place for us to start.</p><p>The basic pattern of "Headless" is that your authors and editors login to a server based system with all the authoring and editing tools they are used to, but then the "head" – the usual template system and user facing website – isn't used. Instead, a modern front end framework is custom designed and built to take the published content of the CMS and host it. This fits great with the Fission app publishing platform.</p><p>After we've got the basics of a headless publishing workflow setup with Fission, we'll move on to using our Webnative framework to add personalization at the edge, but that will come in later posts.</p><p>Aside from Ghost, we're also looking at <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-wordpress/1448">Headless WordPress</a> and <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/headless-drupal/1513">Headless Drupal</a>. Let us know in the forum if you've got other Headless projects that you'd like to combine with Fission!</p> Build a Next.js Blog powered by Headless Ghost and Fission <p>Follow the tutorial below to get started with your own Headless Ghost, or <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">visit it on Github for the README version</a>.</p><p>You want to have a modern static website/app built with React, deployed to a CDN (even a <a href="https://ipfs.io/">distributed</a> one), and loading super fast for visitors and search engines.</p>
<p>You want to avoid the headaches and costs of managing and securing servers for traditional content management systems (CMSs) like Ghost and WordPress.</p>
<p>That's what static site generators (like Next.js, Gatsby, and <a href="https://staticgen.com/">others</a>) are for, right?</p>
<p>But, you don't want to have to retrain every writer and content creator on your team to use Markdown and Git. Ghost and WordPress are familiar, pretty, and usable. They have been iterated over years to be approachable by almost anyone.</p>
<p>What do you do? That's right you cut the CMS' head off 🔪</p>
<p>More politely, you decouple the interface used for authoring content from the systems used for rendering and distributing it.</p>
<p>With CMS and website decoupled, you can protect the CMS inside an intranet without exposing it to outside danger, or even use it as a desktop word processor running only on your machine, as I'll show you in this tutorial.</p>
<p>To make things easier we've made a template Next.js website that connects to Ghost and pulls content from it. Follow along and try it out. Feedback welcome :)</p>

<p>This starter template is based on the official <a href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter-typescript">blog-starter-typescript</a> from <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</a>.</p>
<p>We changed it only enough to make it possible to fetch and publish blog posts from the Ghost CMS, while keeping the ability to write Markdown files in the git repo. It's a purely additive change.</p>
<p>There's also a GitHub Action to build and publish the static website to Fission. It works automatically on pushes to the git repo, and can be triggered manually after updating the content on Ghost. (The default Ghost webhook isn't customizable to trigger a GitHub Action, but that can be added as a plugin.)</p>
<p>The Markdown blog posts are stored in <code>/_posts</code> as files with frontmatter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.</p>
<p>The Ghost blog posts are fetched using Ghost's Content API library.</p>
 ✨&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started 
<p>Let's start by making this starter yours:</p>
 
 
<p>Click Use this template at the <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost">starter page on GitHub</a></p>
<p>That will make a copy of the starter into a new repo under your account with a fresh git history. You can pick a different name for it too; in that case replace <code>nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost</code> with your chosen name below.</p>
 
 
<p>Clone the repo (replace with your own URL):</p>
 <code>git clone git@github.com:fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost.git
</code> 
 
 
<p>cd into the repo:</p>
 <code>cd nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost
</code> 
 
 
<p>Install dependencies</p>
 <code>yarn
</code> 
 
 
<p>All command-line instructions and directory paths from now on assume the current directory is the root of the cloned repo.</p>
 👻&nbsp;&nbsp;Setting Up Ghost 
 Public or Local Ghost? 
<p>Running a local Ghost instance is good for testing. But also, if you have no need for a Ghost instance running all the time out on the internet (for example, if you are the only author) you can do this for your production website, using Ghost locally for its nice interface if you prefer that to editing Markdown files. No servers to secure, no bills to pay.</p>
 Setting Up Local Ghost 
<p>If you have a Ghost instance running already somewhere, move on to the next step. If you don't, you can set one up on your own machine with Docker.</p>
<p>To create a local Ghost instance with Docker, run the following at the root of your repo:</p>
 <code>yarn ghost-local-create
</code> 
<p>Ghost data will be stored at <code>./ghost</code>, which is in <code>.gitignore</code> by default. In a private repo you can choose to commit that too and have your Ghost content versioned and available whenever you need it.</p>
<p>There are other scripts like <code>ghost-local-start</code>, <code>ghost-local-stop</code>, and <code>ghost-local-remove</code> which you might find handy to manage the Docker container.</p>
<p>After Docker downloads and sets up Ghost, it will be accessible on your browser at <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a>.</p>
<p>Next you need to create an admin account on your newly-created Ghost. To do that, visit the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> and follow the wizard.</p>
 Exposing the Ghost Content API 
<p>I'll use <code>http://localhost:3001</code> for the examples, but you can replace that with your Ghost URL if you have an instance already running somewhere else.</p>
 
 Go to the admin interface at <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost">http://localhost:3001/ghost</a> 
 On the left-hand sidebar, click on "Integrations" 
 On the Integrations screen, click on <a href="http://localhost:3001/ghost/#/settings/integrations/new/">+Add custom integration</a> 
 Give it a name, like <code>nextjs</code>, and click "Create" then "Save" 
 
<p>Now the important part:</p>
 
 On the same screen, you'll find two fields we need: Content API Key and API URL 
 Copy those into a new <code>.env.local</code> file, like this: 
 
 <code># .env.local
# replace values with your own
GHOST_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
GHOST_API_KEY=2a9356e4a5214c883ba886e58e
</code> 
<p>⚠️ This file is ignored by git by default. Don't commit <code>env.local</code> to git unless you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>Alright! Ghost part's done.</p>
 💻&nbsp;&nbsp;Running Next.js Locally 
<p>Next.js is the missing static website head to our headless Ghost. Let's stitch them together! This should be enough:</p>
 <code>yarn dev
</code> 
<p>Your blog should be up and running at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>! (If anything unexpected happens, please post an <a href="https://github.com/fission-suite/nextjs-blog-starter-typescript-ghost/issues/new">issue</a>.)</p>
<p>Now you can change the Next.js website code and the content on Ghost, and iterate quickly on them in the browser.</p>
<p>Note: live-reload works for Next.js code and Markdown files; to see changes to Ghost content you need to refresh the page.</p>
 🌐&nbsp;&nbsp;Deploying to Fission 
<p>When you're ready to publish, the first step is exporting your website to a set of static files:</p>
 <code>yarn build
</code> 
<p>That should create a directory at <code>./out</code> with all your ready-to-publish files.</p>
<p>Next we use the Fission CLI to send that out onto the internets.</p>
 🔰&nbsp;&nbsp;Fission CLI Install and Sign Up 
<p>To install the Fission command-line interface using brew, run:</p>
 <code>brew tap fission-suite/fission
brew install fission-cli
</code> 
<p>For more ways of installing the Fission CLI, please check the <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/installation">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't have a Fission account, you can create one without leaving the command-line by running:</p>
 <code>fission setup
</code> 
 🌱&nbsp;&nbsp;Register New Fission App 
<p>You can pick a subdomain or let Fission choose a random one for you.</p>
<p>To host the Next.js website at a random subdomain on <code>.fission.app</code>, run:</p>
 <code>fission app register
</code> 
<p>To choose your own subdomain, use the <code>--name</code> option like this:</p>
 <code>fission app register --name my-beautiful-subdomain
</code> 
<p>That will create a <code>fission.yaml</code> file. This one is safe to commit to git, and you should do that if you want to use the GitHub Action to build and deploy the website for you. Make sure there is a line saying <code>build: ./out</code> in it. That's the directory where Next.js puts the exported website files.</p>
 🚀 &nbsp;&nbsp;Aand... Launch! 
<p>One last step:</p>
 <code>fission app publish
</code> 
<p>And you're done! Your website should be up at a random URL returned to you by the Fission CLI or at <code>my-beautiful-subdomain.fission.app</code> if you used the <code>--name</code> option. Yay!</p>
 🤖&nbsp;&nbsp;(Semi-)Automatic Deployment with the GitHub Action 
<p>If you don't want to run the build locally and deploy to Fission every time you make a change to the Next.js code or Markdown files (who does?), this starter comes with a GitHub Action that automates that for you.</p>
<p>To get it working you need to set up 3 secrets for your repo. To do that, go to the "Settings" &gt; "Secrets" screen on your GitHub repo, then create a "New repository secret" for each of these:</p>
 
 <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> 
 <code>GHOST_API_KEY</code> 
 <code>FISSION_KEY</code> 
 
<p>The values for the <code>GHOST_API_</code> fields are the same ones you used for the <code>.env.local</code> file above.</p>
<p>The <code>FISSION_KEY</code> was created and stored locally for you by the Fission CLI when you set it up. Here's how you get it:</p>
 <code>cat ~/.config/fission/key/machine_id.ed25519 | base64
</code> 
<p>With all 3 secrets set up, you can trigger the <code>deploy</code> action manually by clicking on "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow", or see it in action after your next <code>git push</code>.</p>
 
<p>Note:</p>
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;To fetch the content from Ghost, the GitHub Action must be able to access the URL entered in the <code>GHOST_API_URL</code> secret.</p>
<p>If you are running a local Ghost instance on your machine, <code>http://localhost:3001</code> won't be visible to the outside.</p>
<p>A simple way of exposing your local Ghost instance to a publicly-accessible URL is by using one of the <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling">open source alternatives to ngrok</a> or <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> itself.</p>
<p>With ngrok you do something like this:</p>
 <code>ngrok http 3001
</code> 
<p>⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;This is great for testing, but not secure. Look into using <code>https</code> if you're going to rely on this and don't want your Ghost API key and data to leak.</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>Why "(semi-)" automatic then? 🤔</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glad you asked. The GitHub Action can detect when you push to the GitHub repo because there's a built-in "on push" event that can be used to trigger it.</p>
<p>But when you create a new post on Ghost or update an existing one, GitHub needs a way of finding out about it so it can run the deploy action. There's no <code>git push</code> event happening, so the trigger is usually a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/actions#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event">webhook</a> (i.e. a POST request you send to a GitHub API URL.)</p>
<p>🙂&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, Ghost comes with the built-in ability to send webhooks when content changes happen.</p>
<p>🙃&nbsp;&nbsp;Unluckily, though, Ghost doesn't let you customize the payload that goes in the webhook requests it sends, and GitHub requires a certain field to be present telling it which <code>ref</code> (usually a branch) you are referring to.</p>
<p>Bottom line: after changing things on Ghost, you need to trigger a build manually.</p>
<p>You can do that via the GitHub interface ("Actions" &gt; "Continuous Deployment" &gt; "Run workflow" &gt; "Run workflow"), or by running the handy script we added to this starter:</p>
 <code>GITHUB_USER=your-username GITHUB_REPO=your-repo GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token trigger-github-deploy-action.sh
</code> 
<p>Here's how you can get an <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token">auth token</a>.</p>
<p>This situation is definitely not ideal, and can be solved with Ghost plugins, but we wanted to stick to the basic install.</p>

<p>One of Jolocom’s founding principles is its mission to forward the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. As such, we are very happy to have our team member <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaichristianwagner/">Kai Wagner</a>, serving as an active board member of <a href="https://inatba.org/">INATBA</a> (the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications) as well as being the co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group.</p>



<p>It was in this role that Kai chaired a recent INATBA event, a roundtable discussion based on the organization’s position paper, <a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>, published in late 2020. Joining Kai were four fellow stakeholders, each with their own view on where decentralized identity is at present and how it should take shape over the months and years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sitting around the virtual table with Kai were <a href="https://twitter.com/thekaryl?lang=en">Karyl Fowler</a>, CEO of Transmute, a software company working within the sector and active member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation’s (DIF) steering committee. Also from the US came <a href="https://twitter.com/aniltj?lang=en">Anil John</a>, technical director of the US government’s Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Silicon Valley Innovation Programme.</p>



<p>Joining them was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loretta-anania-2765898/">Dr. Loretta Anania</a>, scientific officer at the European Commission’s DG Connect who, through funding, helped get INATBA off the ground and was there in her capacity as project officer of eSSIF-Labs. And finally, from Belgium came <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielduseuil/">Daniël Du Seuil</a>, convener of the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework and the national Belgian self-sovereign identity (SSI) project leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The paper, written over the course of a year by six key authors, was produced by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations for an open and innovative market in decentralized identity. It analyzes the current state of SSI developments and opens up discussion of the next steps, taking a clear stance on how INATBA would like to see development continue, making demands of the key stakeholder groups and setting goals for the future of SSI.</p>



<p>Answering the paper’s core question of what’s at stake, it gives three essential scenarios:</p>



  Ideal – full convergence of SSI technology with interoperability by default.  Functional – partial convergence resulting in detached ecosystems.  Dysfunctional – no convergence and isolated, locked-in ecosystems.  



<p>With an awareness that the INATBA paper’s ideal position might be seen by some as “utopian”, Kai then went round the table to gauge the participants’ initial responses to it.</p>



<p>Responding first was Karyl, who agreed wholeheartedly with the INATBA position both from her perspective as a member of DIF and as a business person. Without achieving interoperability, she said, we “risk implementing a solution that further locks individuals out of mobility – socially and otherwise – as well as locks businesses out of future business agility.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl added: “We don’t want to implement innovation that takes two steps back.”</p>



<p>Anil, having told the audience of his earlier doubts that blockchain was the universal panacea some of its champions believed it to be, went on to say, “I tend not to buy into the techno-utopianism of self-sovereign identity.” Despite this, Anil also said, “I do believe in personal agency and control.”</p>



<p>This, he explained, was the starting point for work he was funding to try to create a competitive ecosystem of services, noting, “As a US government agency, we have often been walked into a corner by vendors and told this is the only magic thing that will solve your problem.”</p>



<p>“We are not interested in being locked into another platform. If you want to go down that path, you need to ensure that there exists a competitive ecosystem of service providers that actually interoperate at a base level on the security and privacy side. That is the motivation for us.”</p>



<p>With 30 years of experience funding Internet research for the European Commission and time spent at MIT before that, Loretta explained that this, the funding of research, was core to her perspective on prioritizing investments. Specifically, with eSSIF-Lab she is supporting the strategic planning for the next generation Internet and laying the foundations for the proposed new European digital ID. To do this, Loretta said, we need to discover “how to put more trust in the network, a more decentralized trust framework and more permissionless autonomy to safeguard accountability and cherish&nbsp; free speech on the Internet.”</p>



<p>“Open is easy to say and hard to do,” she added. However, with the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade one of twin transition, putting green and digital into everything it does, Loretta noted that, although this will be difficult, it is also a beginning and that, especially when standards are being set, “It’s important to be there,&nbsp; involved at the beginning.”</p>



<p>Daniël, coming from a perspective of wanting to empower citizens, made it clear he thought the INATBA paper addressed important questions about the evolution of the technology and its adoption. “It’s not that easy,” he said. Both public and private sectors need to know the best ways to migrate from the current centralized to new, decentralized systems.</p>



<p>SSI, he argued, could be the answer to what the new call for a European digital ID is looking for. If the European digital ID is all about empowerment, privacy and new models of data sovereignty, it needs to be technology neutral. In the end, Daniël noted, the question is always the same: How can we empower the citizens?</p>



<p>With Kai tying up the common threads between the panelists’ first responses, he noted a clear difference between the US and European approaches. While in Europe the exploration and funding of research into digital identity technology and SSI came from a perspective of data sovereignty for citizens, in the US there was a broader requirement. Here, there was a desire for no system lock-in for all types of exchanges – such as the provenance of goods and information as well those of private identities. As such there was a difference in the motivation behind the funding of projects on either side of the Atlantic. However, as these were essentially similar if not the same problem, how could we ensure that the solutions that emerge were compatible?</p>



<p>Here, Loretta was quick to come in, arguing that use cases were key, both in making sure that we’re not trying to solve problems that don’t exist and that we are solving those that do. But, she went on to say, Loretta didn’t believe that the core problem was seamless compatibility, rather it was one of waste. And that the answer is data minimization. “The internet of waste is about unsustainable pollution, consuming resources at a time when the green transition is our biggest problem.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that it’s an impossible task,” she said. But, for now, we should look to the use cases, “start small and use the best possible solution.”</p>



<p>In his experience, said Anil, “Everybody talks interoperability but seems to have a different idea of what it is.” He went on to argue that true interoperability requires two things. Firstly, that there are standards and specifications baked into the implementation of the technology, which is proven by publicly open, interoperable test suites that are developed and available to make sure that anything is conforming to the standards. And secondly, you need to do end-to-end matrix testing between implementations. Only then can you ensure both conformity to standards and genuine interoperability at product and vendor level. These two principles were something that all the participants generally agreed with.</p>



<p>In the light of this, Anil explained that the Department of Homeland Security had decided that interoperability test suites themselves could not be developed and owned by the companies being funded by them and carrying out the research. They should be owned and available independently – under the WC3 umbrella. “It makes sense for global collaborations,” he argued, “to work for the common benefit of our citizens.”</p>



<p>Agreeing, Karyl also put forward her belief that the way business owners or individuals come to the conclusion that interoperability is important is very use case-dependent. It’s easier to see in public sector applications. “We have to acknowledge that for each of these use cases, there are existing standards,” she said, addressing the fact that switching technologies is a costly affair and not one that businesses can take on lightly. “In many cases, what we’ve found is that a lot of these processes are not standard across regions or even within industry itself… Technology is not a silver bullet. If we implement it on a process that is fundamentally not serving the way that we’re interacting in the 21st century, we’ve just created more problems.”</p>



<p>Returning to the issue of standards, Daniël suggested that we need to think both of domain standards and technology ones. With a new technology, he argued, you need stability. You don’t need lots of new initiatives all the time and, at the moment, the technology is not mature enough to say that interoperability can be arranged in one way or another. We all know what the end goal is, Daniël said, but getting there isn’t going to be easy.</p>



<p>At this point, Kai took the opportunity to put a final question to the panelists. “If we actually want to get closer to some kind of proper interoperability,” he asked, “what is the kind of interaction we want to enable, irrespective of the use case, that should then serve as a basis for further work?”</p>



<p>A passionate Anil leapt in to answer this, saying that the hardest part when it comes to interoperability is following what he called the three Ps: “Pipes, payloads and policies.”</p>



<p>Pipes, he said, are the protocols you need to agree on. Payload is the data format of what’s moving through the pipes. Everything else is the policy construct that you put in place to make sure that everybody’s talking about the same thing.</p>



<p>He also argued, in agreement with Karyl’s earlier comments, that “rip and replace is not a strategy or path to success,” saying you can’t expect any sector to tear up its existing infrastructure just because something “bright and shiny” turns up. Technologists need to understand where people are and meet them there, providing something that reuses the technology those people have already spent a lot of time and money setting up. What we need to do is “provide connectivity to the new.”</p>



<p>Karyl addressed matters from the perspective of an American seeing how things are progressing in the EU, and recognized how productive having the public sector buying into the need for interoperability and standards was. This, she said, was liberating as it would redefine what was pre-competitive and where a business’s value lay. As a business, working with your competition rather than against it could only be productive as you could tackle problems together rather than in parallel. It was liberating for innovation.</p>



<p>However, Karyl also recognized that regulation and policy are, in use cases, the things that will define what is pre-competitive. It will look different when considering education, or global trade, or identity – be it an individual’s, an enterprise’s or an organization’s.</p>



<p>Agreeing with Anil, Loretta said that, in the EU, “We build on what works.” In her experience, standardization takes decades. “Do not underestimate,” she said, “the amount of effort that the EU had to put in to get a passport that’s recognized in one country to be also recognized in all the others.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, standards were not the right place to start, Loretta argued. “I don’t start with standards,” she explained. “I start with people who have good ideas, who are innovative.”</p>



<p>“I totally agree that standardization is a long process,” said Daniël, going on to argue that for him, interoperability is next to security in its importance. However, regulation is also essential as openness will not come easily. “It’s not something that emerges naturally,” he noted.</p>



<p>With that, and the clock running out, Kai called for the panellists closing thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sadly, Anil had already had to leave the table. Karyl meanwhile suggested that eventually interoperability and the development of standards are key to driving adoption. Without that, she argued, we would be locking businesses out of a more agile future and locking individuals into limited mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coherence with common standards will come, thought Loretta, and that ultimately people will vote with their feet. However, reiterating her earlier point, it will take time, she said. “But I’m patient.”</p>



<p>Striking an optimistic final note, Daniel said he thought that this is an interesting time. Right now, both industry and the public sector are interested in decentralized identity and what it can offer them. Now, he argued, we need to prove that this technology really works. If we collaborate in an open way then interoperability will come.</p>

   Unpacking the Realities of Identity Assurance Level (IAL) and Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) to Make Compliance Easier&nbsp; 

<p>No matter how much security and interoperability it brings, the thought of ‘compliance’ always brings a resigned sigh. Yet, from the U.S. Federal Government (Fed) to state and local governments and educational institutions (SLED), complying with guidelines and standards is a must not only for security but for interoperability and cost reduction.</p>

<p>Digital identity is at the heart of addressing many government specifications and guidelines. In this post, we’ll unpack two assurance levels, identity assurance level (IAL) and authenticator assurance level (AAL), within the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST’s SP 800-63-3</a> Digital Identity Guidelines. For more detailed information on implementing IAL and AAL using ForgeRock Intelligent Access, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s begin.</p>

<p>In the current revision (revision 3) of SP 800-63, NIST replaces the idea of a single level of assurance (LOA) with three different types of assurance, each with three levels:</p>

  Identity assurance level (IAL) 1-3 
	 Authenticator assurance level (AAL) 1-3 
	 Federation assurance level (FAL) 1-3 (I’ll write about FAL at a later date) 
 <p>Each assurance type is so specific that NIST provides an 80+ page special publication to each, 800-63A, 800-63B, 800-63C, respectively.</p>

<p>Why are there three levels of assurance for each assurance type? Simply put, the levels of assurance are directly related to the potential damage caused if data is compromised.</p>

  Assurance level 1 covers less sensitive data such as publicly available information. 
	 Assurance level 2 considers sensitive data such as for official use only, or personal data. 
	 Assurance level 3 includes highly sensitive data such as financial data, or personnel data. 
 <p>Before we dig in further, let’s clear up the relationship between identity proofing and authenticators, as this distinction is important. Identity proofing is required during account creation and, in some cases, periodically throughout the lifecycle of the identity. Once a claimant’s identity has been proved, and while still in the account creation process, the claimant registers the authenticators (such as username and password, biometrics, etc.) These authenticators are used to access the account in the future. In general, an applicant proves his identity once but repeatedly authenticates.</p>

<p>Back to the task at hand: IAL and AAL.</p>

<p>Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63A Enrollment and&nbsp;Identity Proofing</p>

<p>To achieve an identity assurance level, an applicant proves he, she, or it (e.g., a computer or a thing) has a real-life identity. This proofing process extends from self-asserted proof in IAL1 to highly scrutinized physical evidence in IAL3, where proofing requires the physical presence of both the applicant and a trained and authorized representative of the authorizing agency.</p>

<p>By far, most agencies seek IAL2 proofing of an applicant and use trusted sources to help prove someone is who they say they are. Examples of trusted sources include issuers of smartcards (such as CAC and PIV), driver’s licenses, student IDs, teachers union credentials, and first responder credentials.</p>

<p>Other than self-asserted proof, IAL proofing sometimes involves a third party that specializes in identity proofing, such as PII matching, biometric analytics, credit verification, demographic matching, etc. This may sound complicated, yet agencies find a quick path to IAL compliance at any assurance level using ForgeRock’s Intelligent Access toolset combined with third-party identity proofing technologies from our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">partner network</a>. Details are provided in the paper <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>.</p>

<p>Authenticator Assurance Levels (AAL) as Described in NIST SP 800-63B Authentication and Lifecycle Management</p>

<p>SP 800-63B covers ‘authenticators’, or the mechanisms used to access an account. Authenticators are as simple as username/password or as complex as a multifactor cryptographic challenge-response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also covered within SP 800-63B are ‘authentication factors’, which include: something you know (password, PIN, etc.), something you have (a one-time password fob, etc.), and something you are (such as biometrics like your thumbprint, iris, or face pattern).</p>

<p>Authenticator assurance levels determine how confident we are that the claimant possesses and controls the authenticators tied to their account. There are three AAL assurance levels. Each assurance level requires one or more distinct authentication factors.</p>

  AAL1 is the lowest assurance level and only requires a single authentication factor and an authenticator such as a simple username and password. AAL1 is used to access publicly available information like commissary prices, open courses, or public services. 
	 AAL2 is more stringent than AAL1 in that it requires two distinct authentication factors, such as a username and password (something you know) and a one-time-password pushed to a device (something you have). AAL2 is used to secure accounts with access to sensitive information such as personal data, agency internal but not classified data, the claimant’s student or financial data, etc.&nbsp; 
	 AAL3, the highest assurance level, extends AAL2 by requiring:&nbsp; 
   Hardware-based authenticators 
	 An authenticator that provides impersonation resistance (such as biometrics) 
	 Proof a cryptographic key is in the claimant’s possession.&nbsp; 
 <p>AAL3 is used to secure an agency's most sensitive data, such as a facility security officer’s duties, a university registrar, or any other function that requires access to the most sensitive information held by an agency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support authenticators, both hardware and software, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations require a flexible, yet robust, identity platform to orchestrate all AAL compliance levels. This is where ForgeRock comes in.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, government and publicly funded non-federal organizations leverage <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-reports">industry-leading authentication and identity features</a> in conjunction with hundreds of pre-integrated identity proofing and authenticator options made available through our partners in our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/trust-network">expansive Trust Network</a>. Because of ForgeRock’s comprehensive functionality, you can build an authentication journey that meets or exceeds all 800-63A and B compliance requirements. Additionally, if you require<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/federation"> federated single sign on</a>, there are ForgeRock modules to help you quickly achieve any 800-63C assurance level. In short, you can orchestrate all 800-63-3 assurance levels (IAL1-3, AAL1-3, FAL1-3).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more details on how ForgeRock can help you achieve NIST’s SP 800-63-3 specifications, read <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/forgerock-nist">ForgeRock and NIST Special Publication 800-63-3</a>. And stay tuned for additional blog posts on this topic.</p>

  <p>Rockstar is a Chrome extension that adds features to the Okta dashboard. What sort of features, you might ask? The most popular ones include:</p>

 
   Exporting Okta data like Users, Groups, and Apps 
   Debugging SAML 
   Exploring the Okta API 
   The ability to assign admin privileges to a user from the user page 
 

<p>You’ll need to be an Okta administrator to use rockstar. If you don’t already have an Okta account where you’re an administrator, you can <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up for a free developer account from Okta here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you’re logged in to your Okta account, you can follow along with the rest of this blog post to learn how to use rockstar!</p>
 CSV Export for Okta Users, Groups, and Apps 

<p>While Okta can import users from a CSV, it doesn’t have the ability to export them in that same way.</p>

<p>The ability to export data from Okta is one of the most used capabilities in rockstar. While there are several other methods of exporting data from Okta, rockstar has some unique capabilities that set it apart from other solutions.</p>

<p>To export data from Okta in a CSV format, you’ll need to navigate to the location in the Okta that has the data you want to export. For example, to export the users from Okta, do the following:</p>

 
   From the Directory menu, select People 
   In the hovering rockstar menu, click “Export Users” 
 

<p></p>

<p>You should now see a window that looks like the one below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this window, you can select the columns that you want to have exported to CSV. For example, in the image above, the columns “User Id”, “Status”, etc are selected to be exported.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can filter the things that Okta will export to CSV using a query filter. Because the query box is just a thin wrapper around the Okta API, it requires a specific format in order to do the searches - i.e. <code>q=</code>, or <code>filter=status</code> … etc.</p>

<p>To export all of your users from Okta, just leave the query box blank.</p>

<p>Once you are ready to export users from Okta, click the “Export” button. When you’ve done this, rockstar will start exporting data from Okta, taking care to respect the concurrent and per-minute rate limits that Okta sets on the APIs that rockstar uses for exporting data.</p>

<p>Once your export is completed, you should see a downloaded file in Chrome with a name that looks like <code>Exported Users YYYY-MM-DD HH-MM-SS.csv</code></p>

<p>Note that rockstar is able to export more than just users, groups, and apps from Okta. Rockstar can also export other types of data like group members, group rules, directory users, apps, app users, app groups, app notes, network zones, YubiKeys, mappings, admins, and more.</p>

 Exporting Apps 

<p>For another example of exporting data from Okta using rockstar; here is how you can use rockstar to export a list of your Okta apps. This is useful when you want to have a holistic view of what apps are currently being used, what type of sign-on Method they’re using (SAML, OIDC, SWA, etc), and whether the app is active. On a deeper level, you can see what the template of the user name is.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Having an overview of the apps in your Okta tenant allows for easy auditing and management.  Because the file is exported in .CSV format, you can manipulate it to make it easy for you to read and use.</p>

 SAML Debugger 

<p>If a SAML application isn’t working as expected, the typical approach is to use a tool like “SAML Tracer” to decode the SAML Assertion that Okta is sending to another application. However, there are two issues with using SAML Tracer to debug SAML:</p>

 
   The extension requires that you give it permission to inspect data from every website you visit 
   Once you have a decoded SAML Assertion from SAML Tracer, it can be tricky to find the parts of the SAML Assertion that matter. 
 

<p>Rockstar addresses both of those concerns:</p>

 
   It only requests permission from Okta-related domains (okta.com, oktapreview.com, etc) 
   The SAML Assertion that rockstar displays comes with helpfully highlighted sections, as seen above 
 

<p>To use the SAML debugging capabilities in rockstar, visit the end user dashboard, and in the rockstar menu, select “Show SSO”. Doing this will add a “Show SSO” link below your apps. To see the SAML assertion that a SAML app would generate, click on the “Show SSO” link for that app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you click on the “Show SSO” link, rockstar will fetch a SAML assertion for that app from Okta and then display it in a window, helpfully highlighting the most important parts of the assertion. It will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

 Exploring the Okta API 

<p>Learning a RESTful API like the Okta API can be daunting, especially if you haven’t spent time with a RESTful API before. The usual way to learn an API is to use a tool like Postman, or maybe even open a terminal on your computer and use a command-line tool like <code>curl</code>.  However, doing either of those things requires setting up your environment, putting in variables, your API keys, client secret, client id, etc. And for someone starting out, that is a very intimidating thing to do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, because tools like Postman and <code>curl</code> depend on an API key, that API key will expire after 30 days of non-use. This means that you’ll often find yourself needing to regenerate an API key, usually when you’re in a hurry and would rather be doing something else.</p>

<p>By using rockstar, you can quickly start exploring the Okta API. This is because rockstar will make use of your existing Okta session. Because of that, you’ll never need to worry about generating an API key, or having an API key expire.</p>

<p>Inside of rockstar, you get a list of dropdown commands that will allow you to see what type of GET commands are available for you to choose from. Then, you will be able to see the response directly below; all within the Chrome window.</p>

<p>To open the API explorer, simply click on the “API Explorer” link in the rockstar window. This will open a window that gives you a simplified interface to make API requests to Okta. If you haven’t yet memorized every single Okta API endpoint, rockstar helpfully lists the most commonly used endpoints for you!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Here are some examples of using rockstar to explore the Okta API:</p>

 Getting a list of users 

<p>To get a list of users, open the API Explorer, click on the URL endpoint box, select <code>/api/v1/users</code> from the menu, then click the Send button. You should see a list of users, like in the screenshot below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you might have noticed, every Okta API endpoint returns data in the JSON format, but for some kinds of data, JSON can be unwieldy to look at visually. Because of that, when possible, rockstar will helpfully format some JSON data into a table, while still returning the JSON underneath as well. You can see the original JSON response by clicking on the “JSON” link in the output:</p>

<p></p>

 Getting information on a single user 

<p>To get detailed information on a particular user, navigate to that user in the Okta interface, and then click the “Show User” link in rockstar</p>

<p></p>

<p>Clicking that link will provide you with the API response for that user, which contains a detailed list of attributes for that particular user.</p>

<p></p>

 Getting group membership for a user 

<p>To make an API request that fetches the group membership information for a user, navigate to a user in the Okta interface, click the “API Explorer” link in rockstar, then select the <code>/api/v1/users/${userId}/groups</code> URL. You will now see a list of groups that your user is a member of:</p>

<p></p>

 Easier assignment of admin privileges to users 
<p>In Okta, assignment of admin privileges is a multi-step process, requiring you to open the Security menu, select Administrators, click the “Add Administrator” button, enter in the user you want to grant privileges to, select which privileges you want to grant the user, then clicking the “Add Administrator” button. I’m feeling exhausted just typing all of that!</p>

<p>With rockstar, we address this by directly granting the user administrator privileges directly from within the user’s individual profile page!</p>

<p>To do this, navigate to the user you want to grant administrator privileges to, then in rockstar click the “Administrator Roles” link:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Assuming that you are logged into Okta as an administrator, you will be presented with a list of admin privileges that you could be assigning to this user. Click on any of the links to grant the user that particular administrator privilege. For example, to grant a user “Read Only Administrator” privileges, click on the “Grant Read Only Administrator” link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In addition to granting permissions, rockstar also allows you to instantly revoke admin privileges; reducing the need to dive deep into the Admin console.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Simpler and quicker workflows make rockstar a very handy tool to have when administering a large set of users in Okta. Reducing the need to deep dive into the product menus is continuing to prove to be a beneficial feature for Okta admins out there.</p>

 How do you get it? 

<p>Now that you have an idea of some of the things that you can do with rockstar, it’s time for you to install it and try it out for yourself! Here’s how:</p>

 
   Visit the <a href="https://gabrielsroka.github.io/rockstar/">home page for rockstar</a>. 
   Click on the “rockstar” link that will send you to the Chrome Web Store 
   Follow the instructions on the Chrome Web Store to install the extension. 
Note: You’ll need to grant the extension permissions to read data from Okta domains like *.okta.com and *.oktapreview.com 
 

<p>Once you have rockstar installed, you can learn more by visiting the <a href="https://gabrielsroka.github.io/rockstar/">website for rockstar</a> or by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNTThKVjztc&amp;list=PLZ4_Rj_Aw2Ym-NkC8SFB6wuSfBiBto_6C">the YouTube videos</a> that cover some of the features that rockstar has.</p>

<p>By Li Jun, Founder of Ontology &amp; <a href="https://protocol.sagamarket.io/">SAGA Protocol</a>. Originally posted in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/data-regulation-in-2021%3A-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-2021-02-04">NASDAQ</a>.</p><p>We are living through an activist period of data regulation that will dictate how our economies function for generations to come. Most industries have precedents for regulation that go back centuries, in the case of banking, pharmaceutical, and industrial relations, or at least decades in the case of environmental regulation and telecoms. Even antitrust, that other great set of regulatory concerns facing big technology companies, seems to be based on theories that were formulated around the turn of the twentieth century.</p><p>Data regulation is being designed from first principles before our very eyes. It draws from notions of individual privacy, and is heavily influenced by world events from national security regulation following 9/11 to a reckoning on data collection in the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election. Technical considerations are also feeding into regulation, in particular the ability of machine learning technology to help with medical treatment or predict crime using ever larger data&nbsp;sets.</p><p>Where previously data regulation has been a knee-jerk response to high-profile events, both the tech and government sectors have matured enough to move beyond hard cases making bad law. The introduction of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018 set a new, unprecedented global standard for data protection, while the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) came into play on New Year’s Day last year. This brought data regulation much closer to what we see in Europe, and with California the home of US tech, this arguably amounts to de facto regulation of the whole country. Similar laws have also been passed in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, China, and South Africa, bringing with them a new global age of data regulation.</p><p>With 2020 firmly in the rearview mirror, how will the industry evolve over the next 12 months to meet growing needs? This could be the year where data privacy legislation finally gets road tested and we are provided some case law by which to assess their effects. In 2020 the pandemic put a dampener on enforcing non-compliance GDPR penalties, as many prominent UK fines that had been announced were postponed and reduced. British Airways had to <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/british-airways-fined-20m-over-gdpr-breach">pay £20 million</a> of a fine originally set at £183 million, while Marriott Hotels <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlypage/2020/10/30/marriott-hit-with-184-million-gdpr-fine-over-massive-2018-data-breach/">had to pay £18.4 million</a> out of £100 million. The economic hardship played a big role, as both companies operated in sectors that were decimated by the pandemic, but regulators will not want to be seen as a soft touch. We can expect the honeymoon to end and an increase in fines issued during 2021, as European regulators establish themselves again and their international equivalents flex their muscles for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>While much of the conversation around data regulation focuses on privacy, data localization is another trend we can expect to see more of this year. This refers to a legal requirement that data be stored within specific regional or national borders, forcing multinationals to create local storage facilities to house data sourced from a given country. In 2020 this issue became international news when the Trump administration threatened to force the sale of TikTok’s US business in the name of data localization, or data sovereignty. For the government to interfere with a private company to this extent caused some to talk about a new Cold War, fought with proxy companies rather than proxy states. In the process, it elevated data localization to an urgent consideration for data lawyers and lobbyists. This issue is not going away, and international governments are likely to mirror the US approach and demand special treatment for their citizens’ data. This is also expected to put considerable pressure on international tech companies dealing with non-democratic regimes.</p><p>In the wake of the extended trade negotiations surrounding the UK’s decision to leave the EU, and the growing consternation between the US and China, it will be no surprise to see data sovereignty become an issue for nationalist politicians. Just as trade restrictions are touted in order to protect jobs, data restrictions will be suggested to protect citizen information and intellectual property. Countries that have created artificial intelligence companies in particular will become more inclined to see data as an asset that is important for economic success and national security. A growing interplay between individual privacy and nationalism with economic and national security components will define the politics and regulation of data in&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Finally, empowering the growing data-driven economy by connecting data in a decentralized way will be key if the industry is to evolve. We are beginning to see emerging technologies such as blockchain adopted in data sharing and this too will have a major impact on regulation. Most recently in Britain, two hospitals are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-blockchain/british-hospitals-use-blockchain-to-track-covid-19-vaccines-idUSL4N2JQ3FD">using a distributed ledger</a> to keep tabs on the storage of Covid-19 vaccines and the distribution of doses. As real-life use cases become increasingly common, this could be the catalyst for further regulation, most likely driven by the EU or US. President Biden’s pick to lead the SEC has previously stated that <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/a-cryptocurrency-a-security-depends">cryptocurrencies are under regulated</a>, and the first mover in 2021 could shape global regulation, just as GDPR did for privacy. Technology and data are defining our economy and culture, and they will in turn be defined by how they are regulated. 2021 may be the year where we finally see how this plays&nbsp;out.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/data-regulation-in-2021-more-small-steps-or-a-giant-leap-f62f018e91ea">Data Regulation In 2021: More Small Steps Or A Giant Leap?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Coinspeaker: Many companies and initiatives had spotted the potential for blockchain to solve real-world challenges. But like anything of value, it takes time to build, test, and iterate. Jelurida, the Swiss software firm behind the Ardor platform, has a team that’s been around in blockchain and systems development long enough to become very familiar with this cycle. Two of Jelurida’s co-founders were involved with the Nxt blockchain, which launched in 2013. Jelurida took over the operation of Nxt, which still runs today, in 2016. However, Ardor has been the firm’s flagship platform since its launch in January 2018. All tech innovations aside, what’s impressive about Ardor is the fact that over the three years since it launched, it’s become a go-to platform for projects looking to apply the features of blockchain to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Julian Hayes from Veneto Privacy shares some tips and tricks for businesses considering organisational controls around data protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why are organisational controls so important? 
<p>Organisational controls are often an underestimated part of data protection compliance but critically important in order for organisations to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p>It’s really important that your organisation is set up with a framework around data protection and security. Beyond legal obligations, it makes good business sense, allows for proper control and utilisation of data, and can even help streamline process costs.</p>
<p>With a few simple process measures, some enthusiasm and the right tools, organisations can still thrive with their data processing activities safe in the knowledge that structures are there to keep them on the right track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data management programme 
<p>A data management programme is a living project with continuous cycles enabling organisational activities that support good data privacy practices. Standard components of a good programme would feature:</p>
 
 Data Protection Training &amp; Communications plan for the year. 
 Data Privacy Management Group, managing data retention, security and access controls and Data Protection Impact Assessment reviews. These assessments require expert knowledge in data protection and security in order to establish the legal basis for the processing, what security measures are required, establishing whether a balancing test of legitimate interest is required and having oversight of the full extent of the processing. 
 Data Curation, ensuring data integrity, utility and interoperability within the organisation and its other data processes. 
 Data Governance, an integral part for the programme with key decision makers appointed where high-level decisions are made on data protection and security risks. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Privacy Culture 
<p>It’s always good to capitalise interest in data protection from colleagues within your organisation and let them assist you with your data protection programme objectives, with meetups, information sharing and privacy representation for their departments. At Veneto Privacy, we’ve implemented formal and informal data privacy working groups and have seen first-hand that this privacy culture can grow compliance maturity for organisations making the Data Protection function, with the support of these advocates as a more integrated and trusted unit.</p>
<p>In setting up a Data Privacy working group, it’s always good to set out clear objectives for all stakeholders and what their responsibilities are in their participation. Some items the group can help the Data Protection function manage include:&nbsp;Product &amp; Service plans for the forthcoming quarter; reconciling the Register of Data Processing (Article 30 GDRP) for data processing activities in their business unit; co-ordinating on investigations or regulatory enquiries; and of course cascading changes in the data protection landscape that may impact on the business. These advocates can be the eyes and ears of data protection for you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Training and Knowledge 
<p>Your business can have the best internal processes for reporting data protection breaches, but these are worthless when staff have not been trained to be able to react or even identify a data breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Data Governance 
<p>Who does the buck stop with?&nbsp; Who is responsible for the management and ownership of data? Without a governance structure and clear accountability within defined roles (CTO, CEO etc.) your organisation cannot say it has implemented ‘organisational measures’ under Article 32 of the GDPR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Does our business need a Data Protection Officer? 
<p>Yes, if your organisation processes large amounts of personally identifiable data or the processing involves large scale systematic processing of such data. Importantly, the Data Protection Officer needs to have independence in some decision-making processes and should not be conflicted when it comes to determining privacy risks.</p>
<p>Further, organisations based outside of the EU that offer services within the union must by law appoint an EU Representative based within the territory, who can be contacted by consumers and data protection authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Policies 
<p>Having policies in place internally that support both security and data protection are critically important for organisational compliance, and even more important is that these are communicated to all levels of the organisation, whether it’s big or small. Policies allow colleagues to understand the ‘dos and don’ts’ when it comes to handling data and are the go-to resources to identifying an escalation path when they come across an issue.</p>
<p>Basic policy structures usually comprise of the following items:</p>
 
 Information Security Policy –&nbsp;Setting out minimum security requirements for handling data in the organisation and often including a data classification procedure based on the information’s sensitivity. 
 Data Protection Management Policy – Establishing what steps need be made in protecting personally identifiable data, where a Data Protection Impact Assessment may be required, how to contact the Data Protection Officer and defined ownership of data within the organisation. 
 Data Breach Management Policy – This is a critical policy which ideally would be co-owned with your Information Security team in order to have a solid policy established that enables identification of alleged data breaches, triage, deep-dive investigation and whether notification to the authorities of impacted parties is required.

  <p>Tip: This tutorial is part of our series on how to integrate Okta with popular Infrastructure as a Code solution. If you’re not into Ansible, check out our <a>Puppet</a> and <a>Terraform</a> tutorials.</p>

<p>I love using Ansible to deploy and manage configuration at scale. However, like any other configuration management solution, Ansible works best when playbooks don’t change often. This is easy to accomplish when you manage only server artifacts and binaries, but it can get tricky if your playbooks manage user accounts and credentials that will change quite often as people join, change roles, or leave your team.</p>

<p>To overcome this, admins would typically look at distributing SSH keys or using some sort of 3rd party LDAP/AD for login.</p>

<p>Distributing SSH Keys has major maintenance implications since it requires a lot of work anytime you need to rotate keys. If you use SSH keys for user logins, the recommendation is to rotate keys often – to reduce risks in case the keys are compromised – plus every time an admin leaves the company.</p>

<p>Integrating your infra to an AD/LDAP server – usually using a PAM module – may be even more challenging, since this type of server is usually monolithic and hosted on-prem. Getting a robust integration here is a tall order. From site-to-site VPNs (making your AD available everywhere) to adding additional servers (keeping compatibility across a variety of server distros), this is the kind of pain no Ops Engineer would like to sign up for.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will overcome both issues by seamlessly injecting Okta into your Ansible Infrastructure as Code to effectively <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2019/07/shift-identity-left-secure-devops-automation-with-okta/">Shift Identity Left</a>:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note: To follow this tutorial, you need to have an Advanced Server Access (ASA) team provisioned from your Okta Org. If you don’t have an existing ASA team, you can sign up for free <a href="https://app.scaleft.com/p/signupV2">here</a>, which requires an Okta Administrator to <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/setup/getting-started.htm">configure</a>.</p>

 Create a project and get an enrollment token in ASA 

<p>In Okta ASA, projects work as a collection of servers that share the same access and authorization controls. In a project, you define which users and groups from Okta can access your servers, when they can do so, and what they are allowed to do in the server (i.e. run only certain commands). Any changes in your project (users, group assignments, authorization) are periodically updated in your servers (providing idempotency for identity and access management).</p>

<p>Servers enroll in your project to apply the same security configuration using an ASA agent with a project enrollment token. The ASA agent periodically checks for updates in Okta to update the server configuration.</p>

<p>To get your servers running with Okta, let’s create a project and get an enrollment token:</p>

 
   Access Okta ASA as Administrator. 
   Click Projects and then select or create a new project. 
   Click Enrollment &gt; Create Enrollment Token. 
   Enter a name (i.e. <code>ansible-token</code>) and click Submit. 
   Copy the enrollment token: 
 

<p></p>

 Download and configure playbook 

<p>Clone our sample playbook <code>git clone https://github.com/okta-server-asa/asa-ansible-example.git</code></p>

<p>Optionally, review the <code>asa-playbook.yml</code> contents.</p>

<p>The playbook installs the Okta ASA server agent binaries. It supports multiple Linux distros using the server distro family to identify the ideal installation tasks:</p>

   <code>  tasks:     
    #INSTALL
    - name: Install Debian
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-debian.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Debian"
    
    - name: Install RedHat
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-redhat.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "RedHat"
    
    - name: Install Suse
      include_tasks: asa-samples/install-suse.yml
      when: ansible_facts['os_family'] == "Suse"
</code>   

<p>After installing the agent binaries, the playbook:</p>

 
   Defines the name of your server in ASA (canonical name) 
   Enrolls your server into the ASA project using the enrollment token you got in the previous section 
   Starts the ASA server agent 
 

<p>Edit the <code>asa-ansible-example/asa-playbook.yml</code>. On line 3, replace <code>&lt;hosts&gt;</code> with the hosts you want to enroll in ASA:</p>

   <code>-
  name: Install SFT
  hosts: &lt;hosts&gt;
</code>   

<p>If you have SUSE Linux servers, install the Ansible Galaxy module for zypper: <code>ansible-galaxy install community.general.zypper</code></p>

 Test playbook 

<p>Now that we have the playbook set, let’s see it in action. To do this, I’ll apply the playbook on a few servers to see how it works.</p>

<p>Enroll servers using the ansible-playbook command <code>ansible-playbook asa-playbook.yml -i &lt;inventory&gt; --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;token&gt;"</code>.</p>

<p>Replace:</p>

 
   <code>&lt;inventory&gt;</code>: with your inventory file (or any list of servers) 
   <code>&lt;token&gt;</code>: with the enrollment token from ASA 
 

<p>Ansible will run and register your servers, and return the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In ASA, you will see the servers enrolled in your project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>At this moment, your servers are enrolled in ASA. That means you can access your servers with users and groups from Okta associated with your project.</p>

 Test access to servers with Okta 

<p>Now that all servers are enrolled in Okta, let’s access the servers as a user:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Adv_Server_Access/docs/sft.htm&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610060131465000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1omaR8RXzvDBwm3OddiJVk">Install the ASA agent in your workstation</a> (required to access servers as a user): <code>brew install okta-advanced-server-access --cask</code></p>

<p>To set up the ASA agent, enter <code>sft enroll</code> and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>To see your servers, enter <code>sft list-servers</code>.</p>

   <code># sft list-servers
Waiting on browser...
Browser step completed successfully.
HOSTNAME                    OS_TYPE  PROJECT_NAME         ACCESS_ADDRESS
asa-ansible2-centos         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.101
asa-ansible3-centos         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.102
asa-ansible4-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.103
asa-ansible5-suse           linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.104
asa-ansible4-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.105
asa-ansible5-ubuntu         linux    Frederico_Servers    192.168.0.106
</code>   

<p>To ssh into your server, enter <code>sft ssh &lt;name-of-your-server&gt;</code>:</p>

   <code># sft ssh asa-ansible4-ubuntu
/home/frederico_hakamine #  
</code>   

 Wait, I have questions 

<p>What is Okta ASA doing?</p>

 
   Okta ASA secures access to Linux and Windows servers in SSH and RDP connections using the server agent (the same one that enrolled the server in your project earlier). 
   The ASA server agent, in addition to subscribing your server to a project, also works alongside native OS features such as sudo, users, and openssh to control access during runtime and to capture any login events for audit inspection. 
   Because the agent is light and does not require firewalls and monolithic LDAP or privileged access servers, it can be easily distributed across any infrastructure (IaaS, VM, or physical) and embedded in your DevOps tools. 
   To grant users access to servers, ASA operates a programmable Certificate Authority service as part of its SaaS, that issues ephemeral SSH Client Certificates for each authenticated and authorized request. The keys are issued only after ensuring both user and his/her device complies with the organization’s security policies. 
   The use of ephemeral keys provides many benefits. It eliminates the use of static keys and credentials for server access, ensures that both users and machines are audited before any new ssh connection, simplifies access revocation, eliminates the risk of “super account overuse”, and simplifies access audit. 
 

<p>Can I use this playbook with other Ansible provisioning modules?</p>

<p>Yes. You can use this sample with any other module available in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index.html">Ansible</a> or the Ansible Galaxy. This includes provisioning modules to IaaS providers and Hypervisors, such as <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws">AWS</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/vmware">VMWare</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/google/cloud">GCP</a>, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud">OpenStack</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/azure/azcollection">Azure</a>. To do this, use the inventory plugins available with these modules to capture the inventory of servers and tags to apply the playbook.</p>

 What’s next? 

<p>After testing the playbook on some hosts, you expand it to more servers. To do so, tweak the playbook. You can, for example, store the enrollment token in <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/vault.html">Ansible’s vault</a>, and also secure access to the Ansible controller with ASA using the same playbook. – i.e. update your <code>asa-playbook.yml</code>, changing the hosts to <code>local</code>, and then run the playbook pointing to local:</p>

<p><code>ansible-playbook  -c local -i localhost asa-playbook.yml --extra-vars "asa_enrollment_token=&lt;local&gt;"</code></p>

<p>You can also turn on additional features in Okta ASA, such as setup sudo grants, time-based access, use of bastion hosts, and SSH session capture just to name a few. All these features reduce the load on your playbooks and provide consistent account configuration across multiple servers.</p>

<p>Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data, discusses that while investors are integrating ESG factors into investment decisions, data privacy still remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>*NOTE* <a href="https://www.globalbankingandfinance.com/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority/">originally published in Global Finance &amp; Banking&nbsp;Review</a></p><p>Investors are increasingly integrating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors into investment decisions in the hope that sustainable businesses offer less risk and long-term return on investment. Against this backdrop, data privacy and data management remains one of the most pressing issues facing organizations today.</p><p>Just recently, BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/26/blackrock-calls-for-climate-change-disclosure-expects-sustainable-investing-to-continue.html">predicted</a> a “tectonic shift” among investors towards sustainability-focused companies, which he believes is accelerating at an even greater speed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the largest money manager in the world, BlackRock has immense power in driving markets, however they are not alone: most large investment banks believe investing in sustainable companies is the future, a move that also helps to mitigate risk in uncertain times.</p><p>With sustainable investment surging, the risk of privacy and data breaches grows higher, as these relatively nascent investments may not have effective data management protocols in place. It is for that reason that the next big trend to join sustainable investing will be data privacy and data management.</p><p>When investors analyse companies they are thinking of investing in, they conduct thorough reviews of the companies’ finances, internal and external processes, hiring procedures, data management protocols, market position adherence to regulations such as GDPR and CCPA; the list is endless. At a time when cyber attacks and data breaches are happening more frequently than ever before, ensuring effective data management safeguards are in place is crucial to a company’s performance, especially one that is likely to receive increased investment. Investment firms must discern how the organization safeguards its system against an attack or fraud. How an organization safeguards its data against such attacks could set it apart as a waste of an investment, or a high profit deriving enterprise with sustainability at its&nbsp;core.</p><p>By integrating new measures such as Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET) and decentralized identity solutions, organizations can stay ahead of the curve and, in doing so, increase attractiveness, competitive advantage, and revenue streams. These benefits can undoubtedly be enjoyed by sustainable companies, but also by those looking to enhance their market position while playing catchup with the now more popular than ever ESG-focused companies. The popularity of sustainable investments may soon outweigh that of companies that cannot put sustainability at the forefront of their business objectives, meaning that these companies must now find other ways to remain competitive and attractive to prospective investors. Maintaining industry leading data management processes can greatly assist with&nbsp;this.</p><p>Ensuring comprehensive data management procedures is also financially beneficial for companies seeking an edge over their competitors: according to a <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/">report completed by the American Ponemon Institute</a> in 2020, the average cost of a data breach was $3.86 million. This cost, in tandem with the impact on a companies’ share price, could be devastating for many companies seeking to maximize their position. Safeguarding these procedures also makes it easier to ensure adherence to regulations such as GDPR, breaches of which bring with them significant financial implications. For example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/technology/google-europe-gdpr-fine.html">Google was fined $57 million in 2018</a> for a breach of GDPR, forcing the company to amend their data management processes. The bottom line is that effective data management makes a significant difference not only to the profitability of a company, but also to the reputation. This is similar to the reputational concerns wrought upon companies that disregard sustainability: reputational damage costs&nbsp;money.</p><p><a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325397/idc-expect-175-zettabytes-of-data-worldwide-by-2025.html">IDC predicts</a> that by the year 2025, 175 trillion gigabytes of new data will be created around the world. With more and more people working from home, away from the often greater data protection offered by physical servers in-office, company data will be at a far more significant risk than before in years to come. As hybrid working and cloud computing become the norm, vulnerabilities will emerge and with them, hackers too. Research has shown that the greater the amount of data at stake, the greater the number of hackers that exist. Bad actors will remain a feature of the data ecosystem, but preventative measures are actionable and achievable. Companies in every industry; from sustainable investments and investment banking, to blockchain, healthcare,and commerce, can enhance their market position by adopting privacy-enhancing technology and decentralized identity solutions to ensure the risk of data breach is minimized.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-privacy-should-be-esg-investors-next-big-priority-4f5f15a5a986">Why Privacy Should Be ESG Investors’ Next Big Priority</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Intake<p>At Spruce, we’re building a product suite to manage all aspects of the data supply chain. Here’s the latest from our development efforts</p> Intake <p>Intake is a smarter onboarding tool for businesses via secure document collection and processing. These artifacts can then be used as evidence to generate and issue credentials to the counterparty that originally uploaded&nbsp;them.</p><p>The focus on development has been on three&nbsp;areas:</p>  Frontend styling, specifically for creating forms, and for users receiving information requests.  Event logging to give a complete picture of every action a counterparty has taken from opening a request to submitting information.  We have set up CI/CD towards end-to-end testing and continuous feature deployments.   DIDKit <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">DIDKit</a> is a cross-platform toolkit for working with W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>  <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">ssi</a> library released under Apache License, Version 2.0. Tagged release version&nbsp;0.1.0.  Implemented <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>  Implemented linked data proof type for Tezos DID method (<a href="https://did-tezos-draft.spruceid.com/">did:tz</a>).  Built DIDKit CLI and HTTP server as Docker&nbsp;images.  Improved DID resolution support.  Adjusted API to allow for multiple DID methods derived from&nbsp;keypair.  DID method implementations modularized, making it easier to support more DID&nbsp;methods.  Updated Rust interfaces to use asynchronous I/O.  Documentation website launched: <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/</a>  Added more example shell&nbsp;scripts.  Added a CHAPI wallet implementation example.  Added a Spring Boot example application with sign-in powered by the previously mentioned CHAPI wallet example implementation using&nbsp;DIDKit.  Added Makefile targets to build static DIDKit library files for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  (Unmerged) Added WASM build support using `wasm-pack`.  (Unmerged) Added Node.js build support using `neon-bindings`.   Credible <p><a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/credible/">Credible</a> is Spruce’s native credential wallet for the consumption, storage, and presentation of Verifiable Credentials on Android and&nbsp;iOS.</p>  Updated to make use of the official `v0.1.0` release of&nbsp;DIDKit.  Credible has now been built on iOS for the first time after DIDKit was updated, to build for `aarch64-apple-ios` and `x86_64-apple-ios`.  The settings were updated to include a personal profile page and pages with various notices (privacy, terms and conditions, licenses, etc).  There is now a DID sharing option available for&nbsp;users.   did-doge <p>As a quick experiment to demonstrate method interoperability, we’ve put together a <a href="https://did-doge.spruceid.com/">draft specification</a> for a <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/did-doge">DID Method</a> for the Dogecoin blockchain. Additionally, we plan on making a light rust implementation that integrates with&nbsp;DIDKit.</p><p>Our specification draws heavily from the work on <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/didm-btcr/">did:btcr</a> due to structural similarities. We managed to further improve upon the did:btcr spec with new privacy-preserving benefits.</p><p>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact">leave us a message</a>, and we will respond within 24&nbsp;hours.</p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems">Twitter</a></p><p>Follow us on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc">LinkedIn</a></p>

				 <p>This article is part of a growing set of articles called Pattern Breakers. This series helps highlight how the world’s pattern breakers change the world around them. The articles provide tactical and strategic approaches to breaking the patterns that are holding back your novel technologies. Each of the articles in the series will be adjusted and updated over time.&nbsp;</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Let’s imagine you have created something that changes the world. Your approach to solving problems is radically different and far more effective and efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can describe how your technology can be used to solve really hard problems – making them easy.&nbsp;You know it truly changes the world.</p>
<p>But you can’t make progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of the world beating a path to your door, you’re pushing harder and harder to make minimal progress.</p>
<p>Your marketing, business development, and sales teams talk about all the excitement in the field. But your tech doesn’t create blowout projects. You give your kit away, you pay for organizations to use it, you get paid to deploy.</p>
<p>…but the momentum doesn’t come. In fact you’re feeling like you haven’t moved at all – or moved backwards.</p>
<p>Your API is amazing and developers rave about how easy it is to use and how thoughtful it is. Your SDK works on iOS and Android and is a thing of beauty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means it likely isn’t your technology – though there are most certainly pieces in the technology that can be improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your big problem is that you are breaking an existing pattern.&nbsp;Patterns help people understand complex things. They are there to simplify things – including the change required to get to a given state. If you’re asking to break a pattern you’re breaking the comfort with the existing pattern.</p>
<p>Being a Pattern Breaker is hard. You’re facing many obstacles.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inertia – Your potential customers are either solving their problems a different (harder, less efficient) way and it is working; or they have put the problem in a “too hard to solve” bucket. 
 Hysteresis – Organizations are like organisms. Changes in one area cause things to shift and the organism works to bring things back to its known state. 
 Early Adopters – they aren’t what you think you need. 
 Old Way Works Well Enough – this is partly momentum and partly messaging. 
 Don’t Grok It – You think they understand what you’re presenting but they don’t. (hint: if your customer groks the word “grok” you’re probably talking to the wrong person. 
 Momentum – more physics here – you need momentum to overcome the inertia in existing systems. 
 Incremental Change Isn’t Exciting – incremental change where percentages point improvements are all you can see are hard to convince. Tweaking the old ways is how we look to solve this kind of problem not big change. 
 
<p>Over time the bullets above will be fleshed out with discrete articles – with strategies and tactics that help you look at the situation better. This is the framework that we use with our clients. They have been applied for over a decade with success in some of the hardest organizational areas. While some approaches are simple, it is the subtle use and application that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep being awesome.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Darrell</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/themes/custom/ultrafico/assets/UltraFICO_Infographic_Consumer_Cobranded.pdf">FICO</a>, “79 million people in the U.S. have [credit] scores below 680, a common lender threshold of acceptable credit.” And “53 million people in the U.S. do not have enough data in their credit files to generate a FICO® Score.” With low scores or no scores, these tens of millions of Americans don’t have access to loans to help them take the next step in their financial journey. Additionally, many Americans don’t have access to other financial products and services that could help them be more financially stable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These consumers aren’t seeing the benefits of <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview">financial inclusion</a> or, as the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/financialinclusion/overview">World Bank</a> puts it, “access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs—transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance—delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.”</p>
<p>While these consumers may not have credit in the traditional sense or access to financial services, many have money flowing in and out of their accounts and may be perfectly <a href="https://www.finicity.com/financial-inclusion-cash-flow-analytics/">capable of repaying their debts</a>. So how can financial inclusion improve to include those who would be excellent candidates for financial products and services, even if their credit scores are low or nonexistent? Here are two crucial ways to improve financial inclusion:</p>
 
 Financial institutions need to look at the whole picture of financial health—not just the traditional measures of creditworthiness or simply the propensity to repay. 
 Consumers need to have access to financial services and products in place of high-risk, nontraditional lenders or accounts. 
 
<p>Keep reading to learn why these are important and how to make them happen.</p>
 A Holistic Picture of Financial Health 
<p>Currently, lenders gauge creditworthiness by looking at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/five-c-credit.asp#:~:text=The%20five%20Cs%20of%20credit%20are%20character%2C%20capacity,capital%2C%20collateral%2C%20and%20conditions.">the five Cs of credit</a>:</p>
 
 Character. What is reflected in the applicant’s credit history? 
 Capacity. What is the applicant’s debt-to-income ratio? 
 Capital. How much money does the applicant have? 
 Collateral. Does the applicant own an asset that can back the loan? 
 Conditions. What is the purpose of the loan? What is the amount involved? And what are interest rates like? 
 
<p>While these five Cs are definitely good indicators to take into account, financial institutions miss out on lending opportunities when these are the only criteria they look at. Lenders should look at the whole picture of financial health, which includes indicators besides good credit. These can include bank account health, responsible spending behavior, and bill payment history.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sharecare.com/health/financial-planning-health-care/article/5-steps-to-a-healthier-bank-account">Bank account health</a> is a great indicator that consumers are responsible with their finances:</p>
 
 They are prepared for financial crises. They don’t overspend and they have started a retirement account. 
 They have both a savings account and an emergency savings account. 
 They <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/banks/articles/how-much-money-should-you-really-keep-in-checking-account/">stay above the minimum balance requirement</a> for checking accounts. 
 
<p>When consumers demonstrate responsible spending behavior, they avoid <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111813/five-rules-improve-your-financial-health.asp">lifestyle inflation</a> and stick to a budget. Their expenses do not exceed their income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bill payment history not related to credit may include utilities, internet and phone, and subscriptions. If consumers are paying all their bills and paying on time, they’re likely a good candidate for financial services.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when financial institutions look at the whole picture of financial health and not just the traditional measures of creditworthiness or simply the propensity to repay.</p>
 High-Risk Loans 
<p>Currently, consumers with low or no credit typically have access only to <a href="https://www.netcredit.com/high-risk-loans">high-risk loans</a>. These loans often charge high fees and interest rates, may require big-ticket items for collateral, and may put a cosigner on the hook if the loans are not repaid. Payday lenders, for example, can legally charge annual interest rates of up to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loansharking.asp">400 percent</a>. Clearly, high-risk loans are not a responsible or sustainable way for consumers to improve their financial situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the best loans out there are typically available only to people with high credit. While interest rates are currently very low, “borrowers will likely face stricter lending standards as lenders try to protect against the coronavirus downturn,” writes <a href="https://loans.usnews.com/personal">Zina Kumok for U.S. News</a>. While these loans are great options for those who qualify, standards for qualification are high and unattainable for many borrowers.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when borrowers have access to financial services and products in place of high-risk, nontraditional lenders or accounts.</p>
 Bridging the Gap between Financial Exclusion and Financial Inclusion 
<p>To bridge the gap between what is currently available and what could be available, consumers and lenders need to have access to alternative data. This data can be provided through transactions and account details via open banking connections.</p>
<p>Two examples of this solution are Experian Boost and UltraFICO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.experian.com/consumer-products/score-boost.html">Experian Boost</a> is a service that can do the following:</p>
 
 Raise FICO® Scores quickly 
 Give credit for paying non-credit-related bills 
 Give consumers free access to their Experian credit report and FICO® Score 
 Provide Experian credit monitoring and alerts 
 
<p>An <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/">UltraFICO</a> Score aims to enhance consumers’ FICO® Scores by taking sound financial behavior into account. If consumers consistently have cash on hand and their accounts maintain a positive balance, their UltraFICO Score may actually be higher than their FICO Score. According to <a href="https://www.fico.com/ultrafico/themes/custom/ultrafico/assets/UltraFICO_Infographic_Consumer_Cobranded.pdf">UltraFICO</a>, there are “15 million people in the U.S. who can receive an UltraFICO Score, even if [they] don’t have enough credit history to generate a FICO Score.”</p>
<p>An UltraFICO Score is generated instantly, giving you access to good credit decisioning as soon as you need it. With the ability to improve or create traditional credit scores, consumers have greater access to traditional loans and lower interest rates, giving them a boost towards their financial goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200925171922/Finicity-Lend.pdf">Finicity Lend</a> data services are another resource to improve financial inclusion. Made possible by our open banking platform, Finicity Lend gives consumers the power to permission data access and gives lenders access to the data they need to make credit decisions. With Finicity Lend, lenders can make decisions that benefit them and consumers, and consumers are empowered to be fully involved in the process.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are currently financially excluded, so improving financial inclusion is crucial to help them reach their financial goals. When financial institutions look at the whole picture of financial health, and when consumers have access to responsible financial services and products, financial inclusion improves and everyone benefits.</p>

<p>Vanaf vandaag, 4 februari, accepteert ook Woonnu brondata via Ockto bij het beoordelen van hypotheekaanvragen. Hierdoor versnelt het hypotheektraject doordat er 2 documenten minder aangeleverd hoeven te worden, de gegevens in één keer goed zijn en ze gemakkelijk digitaal kunnen worden opgehaald en aangeleverd bij Woonnu. Het gaat om data van UWV, Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl en MijnOverheid.nl. Dat betekent dat het handmatig aanleveren van de werkgeversverklaring en Mijnpensioenoverzicht (MPO) voor de hypotheekaanvraag overbodig is. Een flinke stap in de digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag bij Woonnu.</p>



 Snel een volledig klantbeeld 



<p>Intermediairs kunnen met Ockto hun klanten op een eenvoudige, veilige en efficiënte manier gegevens laten aanleveren die zij nodig hebben voor het maken van het hypotheekadvies, de inventarisatie. Niet alleen van het UWV en Mijnpensioenoverzicht.nl, maar ook van MijnOverheid.</p>



 Hypotheekacceptatie op basis van brondata 



<p>Woonnu en hypotheekverwerker Quion zetten met het gebruik maken van brondata via Ockto een stap in het versnellen van het hypotheekacceptatieproces. Op deze manier hoeven er minder documenten los aangeleverd te worden, wat de foutkans verkleint. Bij Woonnu gaat het om de werkgeversverklaring en het pensioenoverzicht, daarbij hoeft het legitimatiebewijs pas bij het bindend kredietaanbod aangeleverd te worden. De stukkenlijst geeft vervolgens aan welke documenten nog wel aangeleverd moeten worden.</p>



 Toekomstbeeld: documentloze hypotheekacceptatie 



<p>Woonnu streeft naar een zo volledig mogelijke digitalisering van de hypotheekaanvraag. Dit is een eerste stap in deze richting. Op termijn zullen er meer gegevens op basis van brondata gevalideerd kunnen worden. Het doel is te komen op een hypotheekacceptatie zonder losse documenten.</p>



 Over de Ockto en de Brondata Service 



<p>Steeds meer partijen bieden mogelijkheden aan om digitaal informatie te delen, maar vaak ieder op zijn eigen manier. Daarom heeft Ockto samen met diverse ketenpartners de <a href="https://www.ockto.nl/hypotheekacceptatie/">Brondata Service</a> ontwikkeld. Met deze nieuwe standaard kan de consument zijn data veilig delen met verschillende partijen binnen de hypotheekketen.</p>



 Over Woonnu 



<p>Woonnu B.V. is een Nederlandse hypotheekaanbieder opgericht in 2020 en is een zelfstandige dochter van Nationale-Nederlanden Bank N.V. (NN Bank). Woonnu biedt eigentijdse hypotheekoplossingen voor de aankoop en/of verduurzaming van woningen en beloont duurzaam wonen met een duurzaamheidskorting op de hypotheekrente. Met Woonnu speelt NN Bank in op de toenemende vraag naar platformen waarbij institutionele investeerders in de Nederlandse hypotheekmarkt kunnen stappen. Het is een hybride regie platform, waarbij financiering niet alleen komt vanuit investeerders. Ook NN Bank zelf is investeerder. Als platform biedt Woonnu hiermee investeerders de mogelijkheid om samen de vergroening van de Nederlandse woningmarkt te financieren.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oh, how time flies! It seems that the whole story of Zero Trust as a revolutionary concept for designing computer networks began just yesterday, but it’s been over a decade already. In fact, the very idea that was later somewhat awkwardly named “de-perimeterization” was being discussed nearly 20 years ago. Back then, in the early 2000s, years before the era of the cloud and ubiquitous presence of smart mobile devices, organizations were already feeling the pressure to reorganize their networks for the digital transformation – establishing communications to their partners, contractors, and even customers, building API-based public interfaces to their data siloes and embracing the early ideas of Internet-scale computing.</p>
<p>In 2009, John Kindervag, back then with the analyst firm Forrester, has come up with the idea that networks should be designed without implicit trust, enforcing strict identity verification and least-privilege access policies for every user, device, or application, regardless of whether they are located in the former local area network or somewhere on the Internet. The deceptive simplicity of the idea and the catchy name appealed to both industry experts and the public, and for over a decade Zero Trust has been one of the hottest buzzwords in IT.</p>
 Zero Trust: so close and yet so elusive 
<p>Alas, it seems that Zero Trust has been also one of the most elusive buzzwords as well. Back in the same 2009, Google has introduced BeyondCorp, a security framework created as a result of a sophisticated cyberattack on their internal infrastructure and aimed to prevent similar breaches in the future. BeyondCorp shifted access controls from the perimeter to individual devices and users. In a sense, it was a reference implementation of Zero Trust that the company has deployed internally. Now everyone wanted to be like Google!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, being like Google turned out to be somewhat complicated to achieve. Most organizations were looking for off-the-shelf solutions that would completely replace their existing network infrastructures: they were planning on “buying Zero Trust”. Turned out, Zero Trust doesn’t work this way. The very foundational principles of the concept show that Zero Trust is not a product or even a technology – first and foremost it requires a major paradigm shift in many aspects of IT and even core business processes of an organization. The only sensible way to achieve Zero Trust is a long journey where every step solves a specific problem and also strategically brings you a bit closer to the “holy grail”.</p>
 The gift that keeps on giving 
<p>On the bright side, however, even if the concept itself turned out to be quite hard to get hold of, it has created entirely new markets for innovative security, compliance, and IAM solutions. Without Zero Trust, we would not have software-defined networking and microsegmentation, no cloud access security brokers (CASB), and definitely no Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) platforms. And when the COVID pandemic radically changed our society, the solutions that evolved from the original concept have made our lives a bit easier and safer.</p>
<p>Almost exactly a hundred years before Zero Trust, Vladimir Lenin once said: “The electron is just as inexhaustible as the atom, nature is infinite…”. Well, it seems that this idea is just as applicable to the notion of Zero Trust: over a decade after its conception, it keeps on giving…</p>
<p>But why am I writing this post anyway? Well, two things. First, last week Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise">BeyondCorp Enterprise</a>, the direct descendant of their original Zero Trust solution. Some of the new features include agentless design (in fact, Google Chrome will be the platform’s agent, but you probably have it already), integrated threat and data protection, and simplified deployment. It seems that after 12 years in development, Google believes that Zero Trust has finally reached the product stage. Is it too ambitious a claim?</p>
 Come to the Zero Trust side 
<p>Hopefully, we’ll find out soon how BeyondCorp Enterprise fares against competitors – after all, the Zero Trust market is already pretty crowded, with both large companies like Microsoft, Cisco, or Akamai and more specialized vendors like Okta or Pulse Secure already have their own solutions to all your Zero Trust needs. When it comes to the potential ease of deployment and agentless operations, one could, for example, argue that Microsoft's ubiquitous presence on desktops (with Windows), in data centers (with Active Directory), and in the cloud (with Azure AD and Office 365) would make it an even <a href="https://aka.ms/ztguide">more enticing choice</a> for customers.</p>
<p>After all, the key obstacle to adopting Zero Trust beyond just standalone “quick win” deployments is the need to make the model work in every layer of your IT, from devices and networks to applications and data. Without a carefully planned strategy, it may end up wasting enormous efforts and resources. But how to avoid a Zero Trust disappointment?</p>
<p>Well, here comes a great opportunity to find it out yourself! KuppingerCole is planning an online event on Zero Trust on February 17th, with a focus on “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/zero-trust-reality">Making Zero Trust a Reality</a>”. We’ll be discussing a broad range of topics and technologies that enable or are enabled by Zero Trust and show how they can solve the very tangible challenges your company is facing during these difficult times.</p>

<p>Crypto News Flash: Development activity is the raisin d’etre for blockchain platforms. Those projects that manage to attract developers often find it a snowball effect, where a few successful launches serve as a showcase of the platform’s potential, which attracts more developers. One example of where this is visible is in the Ardor blockchain, which launched in early 2018. Over the last three years, Jelurida, the Swiss software development company that operates Ardor, has been working hard to attract developers. As Ardor now supports a multitude of real-world use cases, the work has paid off, with more activity on the way in 2021. Achieving a balance between ready-made features and near-limitless customization options has paid off for Ardor. The platform has become a hub of development activity, with numerous applications gaining traction</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>Here’s a quick update on KILT’s plans for the next few months as we get closer to mainnet launch. We’ll continue to update you on milestones and partnerships via this blog, our <a href="http://twitter.com/kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> channels and our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/newsletter/">newsletter</a>. But first, a brief overview.</p><p>KILT provides a base layer for verifiable credentials in the Web 3.0 world. We’re building a permissionless trust infrastructure for real-world business cases like our <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/fractal-kilt-protocol-and-polkadex-collaborate-to-provide-decentralised-kyc-solution-for-exchange-d9d0f8c18163">DeFi</a>, <a href="https://thelosangelestribune.com/2021/01/20/degenics-com-aims-to-provide-anonymous-personal-genetic-testing-through-a-decentralized-blockchain-platform/">genetics testing</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-france-gaia-x-cloud-platform-eu-tech-sovereignty/">cloud computing</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/energy-web-insights/dena-selects-energy-web-to-build-prototype-identity-registry-for-germanys-energy-market-2580f53b2d20">energy</a> partnerships. We’re also exploring collaborations in climate change and&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>Why does KILT need a parachain?<br>The opportunity to launch on Kusama and iterate with other fast-moving Polkadot projects is very attractive. A Kusama parachain could provide core functionality for KILT including:</p>  The ability to finalise blocks and thus secure our network, even while KILT is backed by a relatively small collator network. This provides extra security to the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would be able to provide its DIDs (Decentralised Identifiers) and Verifiable Credentials through the Relay Chain to other parachain projects inside the ecosystem.  This would provide enormous network effects for the KILT Blockchain.  KILT would soon be able to utilise functionality from other parachains, such as smart contract systems and&nbsp;oracles.  <p>We aim to go live with a Kusama parachain as soon as possible, because many ecosystem projects intend to use KILT functionality and we want to provide this at the earliest possible&nbsp;time.</p><p>Consequently we will participate in the first Kusama parachain auctions, and aim to start our mainnet on Kusama shortly after securing a parachain slot. We also anticipate the development of a Kusama to Polkadot bridge, which would enable us to provide the KILT functionality to Polkadot parachain projects.</p><p>For this reason we decided to switch around the launches of KILT and Polimec. KILT mainnet will now launch first. Later we plan to launch an upgraded version of Polimec that already incorporates KILT functionality.</p><p>What’s scheduled next</p>  KILT secures parachain slot on Rococo (29 January&nbsp;2021)  Parity team launches Kusama parachain auction&nbsp;timeline  KILT wins auction to secure parachain slot on&nbsp;Kusama  KILT implements mainnet, PoS migration and governance  Polimec upgraded version&nbsp;launches  KILT roadmap — how we plan to roll out KILT Protocol (click to enlarge or view on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/parachains/">kilt.io</a>)<p>With the Kusama parachain, KILT shall gradually go live as a fully decentralised protocol. We’re excited about the new possibilities for our partners, builders and the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>Later KILT may bid for a Polkadot parachain slot and move the KILT Parachain to the Polkadot network. This possible upgrade is one of the decisions to be made by the KILT community, via the protocol’s future governance model.</p><p>Initial KILT Collator Programme</p><p>And as we move from testnet to mainnet, KILT plans to start the Initial KILT Collator Programme in February. If you are interested in running a KILT collator node, please email us at collators@kilt.io.</p>

 January Edition <p>Welcome to our monthly roundup — January edition, as always I’m bringing you the scoop of the month. If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there!</p><p>If you’re wondering what exactly we’ve been working on at Holo and Holochain this past month — the wait is over! Let’s jump right&nbsp;in.</p> New Year, New&nbsp;Energy <p>The first Dev Pulse of the new year is going to be a short one. That’s not because nothing’s happening — in fact, it’s partly because there’s a lot going on, and I need to get back to it. Holochain RSM is growing up, and it’s time for both veteran and new devs to start developing on it. (That means that new developer documentation is coming&nbsp;soon!)</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 88 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/new-year-new-energy/">New Year, New&nbsp;Energy</a></p> Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers) <p>The big focus of the last couple weeks has been testing Holochain, by way of testing Elemental Chat on HoloPorts. We’ve narrowed down the scenarios where performance decreases, and we’re doubling down on making Holochain work well in those scenarios.</p><p>I’ve also got a grab bag of news for developers — tools, promises of tools, and breaking changes in Holochain that should make your life a bit&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Read Holochain Dev Pulse 89 — <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/testing-testing-testing-and-some-goodies-for-developers/">Testing, Testing, Testing (and some goodies for developers)</a></p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new changes. <a href="https://holo.host/roadmap/">Check it out on our website where you will find more&nbsp;details</a>.</p> Holochain RSM Migration Guide <p>while there’s not a lot of code samples in the guide, it does point out ways that we’ve been able to learn things over the past couple years. We’ve been able to leverage Rust in better ways for the SDK, which means app devs are able to cut their code 50–60% and write more ergonomic code in the process. We’re also taking advantage of advances in concurrency libs from the Rust ecosystem to remove deadlocks and race conditions and generally make this crazy distributed computing thing more efficient.</p><p>So the migration guide + the HDK docs (not available online, unfortunately), plus the new holochain codebase might be interesting for other RiB devs to explore. <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/blog/holochain-rsm-migration-guide/">Check out evolving Migration Guide from Redux to&nbsp;RSM</a></p> Regular Holo Dev Updates on&nbsp;Twitter <p>If you are curious about the — hot from the press dev updates — those can be found on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_">Twitter</a>.</p> Low Code&nbsp;Zone <p>A series focusing on simple hApp dev solutions for real humans.

One such signature scheme is known as CL signature that is named after its <a href="https://jan.camenisch.org/">Jan Camenisch</a> and <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/alysyans/">Anna Lysyanskaya</a> in a series of papers from 2001 to 2004 [CL01, CL02, CL03, CL04]. CL signature popularized Anoncreds, and it also served as a cryptographic building block in Identity Mixer (Idemix) and Hyperledger Indy projects.</p><p>Here, we first discuss two important concepts for understanding CL signature—the discrete logarithm problem and cryptographic commitment—and then outline subprotocols of CL signature. Finally, the application of CL signature on selective disclosure is discussed.</p> Discrete Logarithm Problem <p>Given real numbers y and a, the value of m from an expression y=a^m can be calculated by evaluating a logarithm of y to base a, i.e. m=log_a(y). The term m = log_a(y) can be easily calculated when all a,m,y&gt;=0 are Real numbers. However, when y and a are members of a sufficiently large discrete group G, finding m becomes extremely difficult. This is known as the discrete logarithm problem, which serves as the foundation of many modern cryptographic protocols, including CL-signature.</p> Cryptographic Commitment <p>A commitment scheme is a cryptographic protocol that allows one to commit to a message while keeping it hidden to other parties, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. A commitment scheme that is considered here is known as the Pedersen commitment. In its simplified version, a commitment c of a message m is simply c = a^m where a is a member of a large discrete group G. The commitment c can be sent to another person, called the receiver, and the receiver will not be able to calculate m due to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.</p><p>At a later time, the message m can then be revealed to the receiver. The receiver then verifies that the message m is really the one that was committed by checking that the expression a^m is really equal to&nbsp;c.</p><p>A more detailed discussion on Pedersen commitment can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/ped">here</a>.</p> CL signature <p>Originally, CL signature is based on the strong RSA (SRSA) assumption. As a result, its key sizes are very long to provide sufficient security against ever faster prime factorization algorithms and computers. There has been an improvement on this issue by using paring-based cryptography.</p><p>Here, for simplicity, we discuss the signing algorithm base on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_RSA_assumption">strong RSA (SRSA) assumption</a>. We consider two parties, namely an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. The issuer signs a signature on blocks of messages (or attributes) for the holder, and the holder then shares the messages together with the signature to the verifier. We assume that the holder has L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L. The CL signature scheme consists of 3&nbsp;steps:</p>  Key generation  Signature generation  Signature verification   1. Key generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates two random numbers {p,q} that form a secret key. From the private key p and q&nbsp;, the issuer calculates</p><p>and then generate L+2 random numbers from a quadratic residue modulo&nbsp;n</p><p>The variables a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n form a public key for the&nbsp;issuer.</p> 2. Signature generation (Issuer) <p>First, the issuer generates a random prime e and random number s&nbsp;. Given input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L, the issuer computes the value v such&nbsp;that</p><p>The variables(e, s, v) forms the signature of the input L messages m_1, m_2, m_3,&nbsp;…, m_L&nbsp;.</p> 3. Signature verification (Holder and Verifier) <p>Given the signature (e,s,v) of messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L the holder can use the issuer’s public key a_1, a_2, a_3,&nbsp;..., a_L, b, c, n to verify that the signature is generated correctly by checking that the LHS and RHS of the following equation are&nbsp;equal.</p><p>After the holder is in possession of the signature, the holder can then share the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L and the signature (e,s,v) with the verifier. The verifier can then use the issuer’s public key and follow the same signature verification algorithm to verify&nbsp;that</p>  the signature is really signed by the&nbsp;issuer  the messages m_1,&nbsp;..., m_L have not been changed or tampered with since the moment the signature is generated.  <p>This process allows the messages to be tamper-proof.</p> Selective disclosure <p>In the signature generation and signature verification algorithms above, the holder has an option to&nbsp;either:</p>  directly send a message m_i to the signer/verifier, and the signer/verifier can then compute (a_i ^ m_i) mod n;&nbsp;or  compute (a_i^m_i) mod n, which is the commitment of m_i, and sends it to the signer/verifier.  <p>Given the hardness <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm">discrete logarithm problem</a>, the signer/verifier will not be able to compute the holder’s m_i from the commitmenta_i^m_i mod n. Therefore, the holder can selectively disclose which message(s) (or attributes) are revealed to the issuer/verifier. As a result, the issuer is capable of generating a valid signature without full knowledge of all messages. Similarly, the verifier is capable of verifying that the holder really possesses the messages even if the verifier does not gain full knowledge of all messages.</p><p>For example, the holder possesses 3 messages m_1, m_2, m_3. The holder could reveal m_1, m_2 and send a_3^m_3 mod n to the issuer to sign. Once the holder obtains the signature from the issuer. The holder can reveal m_2 and sends a_1^m_1 mod n, a_3^m_3 mod n together with the signature to the verifier. The verifier can finally verify that the holder possesses valid m_1, m_2, m_3—that have not been tampered with—even without the knowledge of m_1,&nbsp;m_3.</p><p>These capabilities laid the foundation for realizing and popularizing Anoncreds. In the final part of <a href="https://medium.com/finema/anonymous-credential-part-3-bbs-signature-26797721ca74">this series</a>, we discuss a sophisticated signature scheme for Anoncreds, which is known as the BBS+ signature.</p> References <p>[CL01] Jan Camenisch and Anna Lysyanskaya.

<p>After completing many major milestones in 2020, the Dock team is looking forward to another year of building innovative solutions, driving adoption, and engaging with our community.</p><p>Today we’re excited to share our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">updated roadmap</a> for 2021, which aims to take further steps for removing inefficiencies and centralized control from the issuance and management of credentials. In addition to working toward this goal, we will continue our efforts to increase adoption of the Dock offerings through enhanced features and user experience.</p><p>Below are high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones:</p><p>Smart Contract Deployment (Q1)</p><p>We are leveraging <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/frontier">Parity’s frontier project</a> to integrate Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with the Dock mainnet. Once this task is completed, it will be possible to deploy smart contracts written in Solidity on Dock and interact with them using existing Ethereum libraries such as Web3. This will also enable us to integrate Dock with <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> and price our network services in USD (further discussed below). As part of the milestone, we will be sharing an example of deploying a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on the Dock network as well.</p><p>Ledger Wallet Support (Q1)</p><p>The team has been hard at work to enable users to store the new Dock mainnet token on <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s">Ledger Nano S</a> hardware wallet. At the time of writing, we have submitted a new app for DOCK support to the Ledger team and are waiting for the review process to be completed. We will keep the community posted on our progress and release detailed instructions once this milestone is completed.</p><p>Delegatable Credentials (Q1)</p><p>We are currently working on a feature that will enable credential issuers to delegate, to other entities, the ability to issue and revoke verifiable credentials. We expect this feature to serve many important use cases in which a central entity (e.g., government) allows other groups (e.g., private test centers) to manage verifiable credentials (e.g., professional license) on its behalf.</p><p>Chainlink Oracle Integration (Q1)</p><p>Dock is integrating <a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a> to our mainnet using its <a href="https://data.chain.link/">price feeds</a>, so that the services on the network can be priced in USD. Read our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-integrating-chainlink-to-price-credential-services-in-usd/">earlier blog post</a> to learn more.</p><p>Dock Token Migration Ends (Q1)</p><p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-token-migration-part-4-the-migration-begins/">earlier post</a>, the Dock token migration will end at midnight (GMT) on March 7, 2021, and all token holders must swap their ERC20 tokens to the new, native tokens before then.</p><p>Proof of Stake (Q2)</p><p>During the second quarter of 2021, we will further decentralize and democratize the Dock network governance by transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus protocol and allowing token holders to vote on key decisions. More details are available <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/gov-pos">here</a>. This phase will also provide the community with one of our most requested features, <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">staking</a>.</p><p>Dock Server and Wallet (Q2)</p><p>We’ve received lots of valuable feedback from the community over the past year, and many users have requested that we provide a wallet with which they can easily store and manage Dock tokens and credentials. As a starting point for this effort, we will build the cloud version of the Dock wallet, run on the Dock server.</p><p>Dock App v0.1 (Q3)</p><p>In Q3 of 2021, we will deliver a cross-platform app that serves as the mobile version of the Dock wallet. The app will allow users to store Dock tokens, send and receive tokens, as well as present verifiable credentials from their devices. The first version of the app will be launched as a private alpha, and as discussed below, tested intensively before being evolved into a beta version.</p><p>Dock App v0.2 (Q4)</p><p>Once the first version of the app is completed, the team will invite a select group of community members to try it and provide feedback. We will then build a new iteration, version 0.2, based on the user feedback. We plan on performing extensive penetration testing on the app at this stage as well, and distributing the new version to a wider audience once completed.<br></p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these exciting milestones and continuing to grow Dock’s offerings. We will, as always, keep the community updated through our blog (to which you can subscribe below) and social media channels.</p>

			<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/viewContent.action?key=Ec8teaJ9VaqgJXpiSpeTQMxgHJMKLFEppVpbbVX%2B3OXcP3PYxlq7sZUjdbSm5FIetvAtgf1eVU8%3D&amp;nav=FRbANEucS95NMLRN47z%2BeeOgEFCt8EGQ0qFfoEM4UR4%3D&amp;emailtofriendview=true&amp;freeviewlink=true">Luxembourg’s regulator, the CSSF, adopted a bill</a> that explicitly recognised the possibility of using distributed ledger technology for the dematerialisation of securities.</p>
<p>The regulation is moving quickly across Europe: Tokenized securities now fall under the same rules and regulations as traditional financial instruments in many other European countries including <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/content/dam/cliffordchance/briefings/2020/10/security-token-offerings-a-european-perspective-on-regulation.pdf">France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain and the UK</a>.</p>
 What will this new bill in Luxembourg mean for tokenized securities?&nbsp; 
<p>The Bill is a continuation of the law passed in 1 March 2019. Perhaps unsurprisingly, after it was introduced we saw a surge in demand from financial institutions in the region. Curiosity was sparked in Luxembourg and in wider European markets. Most importantly, it gave market actors the confidence they needed to start utilising the technology operationally. In the coming months, we expect the same to happen across the industry due to this recent regulatory development.</p>
 How can market actors adopt the technology? 
<p>For market actors to adopt the technology and benefit from the automation and transferability improvements, they need to do so in a compliant manner. Control and regulations still needs to be enforced. Therefore, proven and open-source security token standards like the <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/">T-REX protocol</a> are essential as they allow assets to be represented on the blockchain compliantly. They enable agents appointed by the issuer to exercise control over assets and ensure the securities can only be held by eligible investors.</p>
 What do we expect to happen in the year ahead?&nbsp; 
<p>We believe the regulation will give even more confidence to the financial services sector in Luxembourg and beyond. So far, Luxembourg has been one of the most proactive jurisdictions in Europe with its first law in 2019. However, this needed to be developed and last week’s law will bring more clarity and more confidence to asset owners. Real estate closed-end funds are currently the asset class that benefits the most from this new form of securities and we expect this to accelerate in 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/weinvest-leverages-blockchain-technology-to-increase-its-real-estate-funds-value-proposition/">WeInvest</a>, <a href="https://www.finimmo.com/">Finimmo</a>, and <a href="https://tokeny.com/digibrixx-democratizes-real-estate-via-tokenization/">Digibrixx</a> are already tokenizing real estate assets in Luxembourg, showing the way for digitization to other fund servicers.</p>

  <p>Without question, comparing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">workforce identity and access management (IAM)</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/identity-governance-administration-iga">identity governance and administration (IGA) </a>providers is a massive undertaking. The stakes are high to meet digital transformation requirements, support and secure a remote workforce, and be prepared for future disruptions. And, sadly, ramifications of a poor IAM and IGA purchase decision live long.</p>

<p>You need to evaluate IAM and IGA providers not only for their ability to meet your current requirements, but also those to come. But, what are they? And, how do you know you’re asking the right RFP questions for your unique needs?</p>

<p>We’re here to help with a highly informative <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a>. The guide starts with a review of what to look for in an IAM and IGA solution in order to address <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/modernizing-workforce-iam">today and tomorrow’s workforce demands and trends</a>. For example:</p>

  Enabling remote work with trusted internal apps that can be accessed anywhere 
	 Giving users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps while constantly verifying that access at scale 
	 Opening externally to third-party systems, apps, and identity-driven API ecosystems 
	 Securing digital workplace IoT “things,” such as robotics and sensors, as well as their associated data and system integrations 
	 Enabling a seamless migration of identities across systems to support evolving needs, such as reorganization or mergers and acquisitions 
	 Decreasing the strain on IT departments, resources, and administrators 
 <p>The guide also discusses that, in order to achieve all of the above and more, an IAM and IGA solution should include a series of strategic identity components that go beyond the basics of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">single sign on</a> <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/sso">(SSO)</a>, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/tag/multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a>, authorization, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in order to ensure that you give users secure and appropriate levels of access to resources, systems, and apps and constantly verify that access at scale, you need a solution that takes the basic identity components ‘identity management’ and ‘identity governance’ to the next level. This includes integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) with your current identity systems. Using AI and ML, you can quickly collect and analyze identity data such as accounts, roles, and entitlements to identify security access and risk blind spots, as well as assist managers and approvers who conduct access reviews and approvals. The result is not only improved remote workforce security and operational inefficiency, but reduced costs as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet, how would you know to ask providers about this capability if you don’t know it exists?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asking the right IAM and IGA questions in your RFPs has long term consequences for your organization. The right purchase decision can result in:</p>

  An empowered and efficient workforce 
	 Reduced risk and fraud 
	 Accelerated legacy modernization and digital transformation 
	 Improved regulatory compliance 
	 Reduced costs 
 <p>So, now that you are aware of AI- and ML-informed IGA here are several RFP questions you should ask providers:</p>

  Does the provider offer AI and ML capabilities to extend the governance functionality? 
	 Can the AI engine consume data from other sources?&nbsp; 
	 Is the solution flexible enough to work with other IAM solutions and data sources, or is it limited to the provider’s platform only? 
 <p>ForgeRock has a fannatical commitment to our customers’ success. We wrote the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">Workforce IAM Evaluation Guide</a> so you can be sure you cover all your bases when evaluating and comparing identity solution providers. It includes a list of basic and strategic IAM and IGA components, definitions (written in layman’s terms for those on your team unfamiliar with identity), as well as RFP questions to help make your selection process easier and comprehensive.</p>

<p>If you’re in the process of evaluating workforce IAM and IGA providers, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/workforce-iam-eval-guide">download our guide</a> and please let us know how we can further assist.</p>

  <p>When you’re using a REST API, especially one that incurs costs or has usage limits, you need to use an API key to access the API in question. For example, if you’re creating a user account with the Okta API, you’ll need to include your API key in that request for it to succeed. Because API keys grant access to API calls which may change important data or incur significant charges. It is therefore important that the keys are not used by unauthorized users. There are a number of common mistakes that developers make that expose API keys to the outside world.</p>

<p>Today, we are going to create an API key for three different APIs. We will show, with examples, the common mistakes that developers make that expose these keys. You’ll see specific vulnerabilities and learn the best ways of avoiding these mistakes. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>PS: The code examples for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/api-key-best-practices-and-examples">GitHub</a>.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use an Okta API Token 

<p>Okta provides APIs for authenticating users and validating tokens. To use Okta APIs you need to have an Okta account. If you don’t have one already, <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up for a free Okta account</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s how to create an API token in Okta: Select API &gt; Tokens. Then, hit Create Token. Give the token a name such as <code>Okta-API</code>, then hit Create Token. A dialog will be created containing the token. Copy it and store it in a safe place as you won’t be able to obtain it again. If you lose the token simply create a new one.</p>

<p>When making an API call, the token needs to be added in an Authorization HTTP request header. The token type must be <code>SSWS</code>, which is the proprietary authentication scheme used by Okta. Replace <code>00...3</code> with the actual token.</p>

   <code>Authorization: SSWS 00...3
</code>   

<p>An API call using the API token can be made using <code>curl</code>. Replace <code>${OKTA_API_KEY}</code> with the API token and replace <code>${OKTA_DOMAIN}</code> with the domain obtained from the developer console. Do not use the domain containing the string <code>-admin</code>.</p>

   <code>curl -s -H "Authorization: SSWS ${OKTA_API_KEY}" https://${OKTA_DOMAIN}/api/v1/meta/types/user
</code>   

<p>After running this command, you should see a JSON string containing one or more user details.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use an Open Weather Map API Token 

<p>OpenWeather provides an API for obtaining weather data. To use the API, you need to sign up at <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">Weather API</a>. You can create a free account or pay a subscription to get access to more features. Once you have signed up and validated your email address, you will be sent an API token. You have to wait for up to a few hours for the token to be activated.</p>

<p>The API token needs to be sent with each API request. The token determines which APIs can be accessed and applies limits on the number of API calls that can be made per minute. The API can be tested by visiting this URL with your web browser, replacing <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key: <code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&amp;APPID=API_KEY</code></p>

<p>Notice that the request is over HTTP, not HTTPS, and the API key is a query parameter.</p>

 How to Obtain and Use a Google Maps API Token 

<p>Google Maps has an API for embedding maps and location-oriented services in web pages and mobile applications. This service is billable, but you get $200 free usage per month, which is enough for most applications.</p>

<p>First, you need a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. There is a free trial <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gcp">Google Cloud Platform</a> which gives new customers $300 of free credit, valid for 12 months.</p>

<p>Next, you need to create a project. Log into the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com">Cloud Console</a>. From the hamburger menu in the top left select APIs &amp; Service &gt; Dashboard. Select + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES. Next, select Aps JavaScript API. Click on ENABLE and after a short wait, you will be taken to the Google Maps Platform page.</p>

<p>From the hamburger menu in the top left select APIs &amp; Service &gt; Credentials. Next, hit CREATE CREDENTIALS &gt; API Keys. A dialog will pop up displaying the API key. Copy it and store it safely. You will see a warning: Restrict your key to prevent unauthorized use in production. This is important. Hit RESTRICT KEY.</p>

<p>Each key can be restricted to one application type. We are going to use the key for a website so, select HTTP referrers (websites). A Website restrictions section will appear. Select ADD AN ITEM. Enter your website domain in the form <code>*.example.com/*</code>. Hit DONE.</p>

<p>Next, select Restrict key. Then select Maps JavaScript API. Hit SAVE.</p>

<p>The API key must be included in every Maps JavaScript API request, replacing <code>YOUR_API_KEY</code> with the actual key.</p>

   <code>  &lt;script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&amp;callback=initMap"
  type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

 Issues with API Keys Compiled into Mobile Applications 

<p>Many Android and iOS mobile applications obtain data from API calls. This means that the API keys need to be sent with each API request. Consider the following Swift code which is part of the file <code>Weather/WeatherModelBad.swift</code>:</p>

   <code>class WeatherModel : ObservableObject {
    private let apiKey: String
    private let apiUri: String
    @Published var weatherData: WeatherData
    
    init(location: String) {
        apiKey = "a1b2c33d4e5f6g7h8i9jakblc"
        apiUri = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;appid=" + apiKey
        updateWeather()
    }
}
</code>   

<p>So, what is wrong with this code? There are several things which are bad practice.</p>

<p>First of all, it is bad practice to hard code things that can change such as URLs. They should always be stored in property files.</p>

<p>Much more seriously, the API key is hardcoded (the value given in the example is not an actual key). This means that the key will get compiled into the application. So, what are the consequences of this?</p>

<p>First of all, the code will get checked into a repository such as GitHub. This means that anyone with read access to the repository is able to see and use the API key. This is even worse if the developer wants to share the code and checks it into a public repository.</p>

<p>PS: GitHub scans public repositories on commits for secrets such as API keys. If a secret is detected it will raise a security alert and the owner of the repository will receive warning emails.</p>

<p>Next, say that the developer runs into a problem and posts a question on StackOverflow. The question will often include the problem code. If that code contains an API key, then anyone who reads the question can see and use the key!</p>

<p>One solution is to put the key into a property file. An obvious, but very poor choice would be to put it into the <code>Info.plist</code> file. This is a poor choice because <code>Info.plist</code> will almost certainly get checked into a repository, which may be public.</p>

<p>A better option is to create a separate property file, in our example <code>Weather/Open-WeatheMap-Info.plist</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;API_KEY&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;a1b2c33d4e5f6g7h8i9jakblc&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, change the code to use the property file:</p>

   <code>class WeatherModel:ObservableObject {
    private let apiKey: String
    private let apiUri: String
    @Published var weatherData: WeatherData
    
    init(location: String) {
        guard let filePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "Open-Weather-Map-Info", ofType: "plist") else {
            fatalError("Couldn't find file 'Open-Weather-Map-Info.plist'.")
        }
        let plist = NSDictionary(contentsOfFile: filePath)
        guard let key = plist?.object(forKey: "API_KEY") as? String else {
            fatalError("Couldn't find key 'API_KEY' in 'Open-Weather-Map-Info.plist'.")
        }
        apiKey = key
        apiUri = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;appid=" + apiKey
        updateWeather()
    }
</code>   

<p>Finally, and most importantly, add the property file to <code>.gitignore</code> so that the property file never gets checked in:</p>

   <code>*.xcodeproj
Open-WeatheMap-Info.plist
</code>   
<p>Although this approach prevents the API key from being checked into GitHub, the key is still present in the compiled application. It can easily be extracted from the application binary. The most secure approach is to use a proxy server so that the key is not required in the application.</p>

 Issues with API Keys in JavaScript 

<p>JavaScript is code downloaded from a server and run on a client machine. There are inherent security risks to running arbitrary code which is why web browsers run JavaScript in a tightly controlled sandbox. Many websites need to obtain data by making API calls from JavaScript. This typically requires passing an API key with each request.</p>

<p>Calling an API from JavaScript means that any API key needs to be in the JavaScript code. This makes the key easily visible by viewing the page source. We have already seen that Google requires the API key to be embedded in JavaScript. We have also seen that Google strongly recommends that you restrict the API key. The restrictions mean that the key can be made public without compromising security.</p>

<p>The API key restrictions have two parts. First of all, the key is restricted by domain. Only JavaScript from one of the allowed domains can make a successful API call. Secondly, the key is restricted to specific API endpoints. Each key should only be able to call the API endpoints that are required, for example just the Google Maps API endpoint.</p>

 Issues with API keys in Other Applications 

<p>API calls can also be made from applications written in languages such as Go and Python. Again, it is an important security principle not to hard code configuration values, particularly secrets such as API keys. A good way of doing this is to pass configuration values through environment variables. These are read at run time by the application. This also means that different environment variable values can be passed to configure for development, staging, and production environments.</p>

<p>The following example shows the contents of <code>Okta.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    apiKey := os.Getenv("OKTA_API_KEY")
    domain := os.Getenv("OKTA_DOMAIN")

    uri := "https://" + domain + "/api/v1/users"
    client := &amp;http.Client{}
    request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", uri, nil)
    request.Header.Add("Authorization", "SSWS "+apiKey)
    response, err := client.Do(request)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error " + err.Error())
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()

    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)

    var users []map[string]interface{}
    json.Unmarshal(body, &amp;users)

    for _, user := range users {
        profile := user["profile"].(map[string]interface{})
        fmt.Println(profile["firstName"].(string) + " " + profile["lastName"].(string))
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The Go code makes the same API request that was used to test the Okta API key. The API key and the domain are read from environment variables. The code then constructs the URI, sets the Authorization header, and makes the REST call. The response is decoded to extract the users’ names. The code can be run by first setting the environment variables to valid values:</p>

   <code>export OKTA_DOMAIN=dev-123456.okta.com
export OKTA_API_KEY=0...3
go run Okta.go
</code>   

<p>You do of course need to set the environment variables. This is often done using a script such as <code>~/.profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Be careful not to check the script into a repository such as GitHub.</p>

 How to use a Proxy Server for SPAs 

<p>Another means of protecting API keys is to use a proxy server. A proxy server implements a subset of the required API. All requests are forwarded to the real API using the API key. As client applications make API calls through a proxy, they do not need to know the API key. Access to the proxy server can be restricted by requiring the client to authenticate.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to build a proxy server for the Google Maps API. The reason for this is that the API is very tightly coupled with the JavaScript embedded in the web page. Google goes to lengths to restrict the API key, so a proxy server adds an unnecessary complication.</p>

<p>We are going to build a single page application (SPA) that accesses the Open Weather API via a proxy server. The SPA consists of an HTML page and JavaScript that makes requests to a proxy server. A simple Go web server will serve this static content. The proxy server is another Go web server that extracts the API key from the environment and forwards the request to the real API.</p>

<p>First, create the web page <code>WeatherSPA/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Weather&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
        &lt;script src="control.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1 id="name"&gt;Weather&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div class="centred"&gt;
            &lt;img id="icon" src=""/&gt;
            &lt;p id="weathermain"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;form id="weatherForm"&gt;
                &lt;label for="location"&gt;Location&lt;/label&gt;
                &lt;select id="location" name="location"&gt;
                    &lt;option value="berlin,de"&gt;Berlin, Germany&lt;/option&gt;
                    &lt;option value="chicago,us"&gt;Chicago, USA&lt;/option&gt;
                    &lt;option value="paris,fr"&gt;Paris, France&lt;/option&gt;
                &lt;/select&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get Weather" onclick="onlocation()"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The page has a form that allows a location to be selected. It also has placeholder elements where the weather data will be displayed.</p>

<p>Next, create a JavaScript file <code>WeatherSPA/control.js</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>function onlocation() {
    fetch("http://localhost:8000/api/weather", {
        method : "POST",
        mode: 'cors',
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("weatherForm"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('name').innerHTML = data.name;
        var weather = data.weather[0];
        document.getElementById('weathermain').innerHTML = weather.main;
        seticon(weather.icon);
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('weathermain').innerHTML = error;
    });
}

function seticon(icon) {
    document.getElementById("icon").src = "http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/" + icon + "@4x.png";
}

seticon("10d");
</code>   

<p>The function <code>onlocation()</code> is called when the form is submitted. It makes a POST request to the proxy server http://localhost:8000/api/weather, passing the form data. The response JSON object is decoded and the placeholder elements are updated with the response data.</p>

<p>The web servers will be written in GO. We, first of all, need to load the dependencies:</p>

   <code>go mod init apikeys
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/gin-gonic/static
</code>   

<p>Next, we need a web server to deliver the static content. We will use a simple Go and Gin server. The Go code is in <code>WeatherServer/main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "github.com/gin-contrib/static"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./WeatherSPA", false)))
    r.Run(":8080")
}
</code>   

<p>This code creates a Gin server instance and configures it to serve static content from the <code>WeatherSPA</code> directory. It then starts the server listening on port 8080.</p>

<p>Next, we create the proxy server in the file <code>WeatherProxy/main.go</code>:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
    "io/ioutil"
    "net/http"
    "os"

    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func Weather(c *gin.Context) {
    location := c.PostForm("location")
    uri := "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + location + "&amp;APPID=" + os.Getenv("OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN")
    response, error := http.Get(uri)
    if error != nil {
        c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{"error": error.Error()})
    }
    defer response.Body.Close()
    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
    c.String(http.StatusOK, string(body))
}

func main() {
    r := gin.Default()
    r.POST("/api/weather", Weather)
    r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>This creates a Gin server listening on port 8000. It responds to POST requests to <code>/api/weather</code> by calling the <code>Weather()</code> function.</p>

<p>The <code>Weather()</code> function extracts the location from the form data. It then constructs the URI for the actual API call using the location and the API key which is extracted from the environment variable <code>OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN</code>. Next, it makes a GET request to the API and extracts the JSON string from the response. Finally, it sets the CORS header to allow the client browser to allow the request and returns the JSON string in the response body.</p>

<p>We can now test the application by starting the two servers from two command prompts and point a browser at http://localhost:8080.</p>

   <code>go run WeatherProxy/main.go &amp;
go run WeatherServer/main.go
</code>   

<p>The web page should be displayed. Select a location and hit the <code>Get Weather</code> button to see the current weather at the location.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Secrets such as API keys are potentially dangerous if they get into the wrong hands. They can be used to change and delete data. They can also access expensive services which can incur large costs. Many APIs require an API key to be sent with each request. This means that client applications such as websites and mobile applications need to have access to API keys.</p>

<p>Developers are on the front line when it comes to information security. Simple mistakes, laziness, and worse time-saving hacks can have serious and potentially expensive consequences.</p>

<p>Never hard code API keys into source code. The only exception to this is JavaScript APIs, such as Google Maps, where the key is tightly restricted. It is quite common to store API keys in files. In which case ensure that the file is in the <code>.gitignore</code> file and verify that it will not be checked in on the next commit.</p>

<p>When posting questions or answers to websites such as StackOverflow, it is common to post code examples. Make very sure that the code does not contain any secrets.</p>

<p>It is important that developers always follow best practices. Always consider using environment variables, proxy servers, and secret stores when working with secrets such as API keys.</p>

				 <p>Selon une étude menée par Sucuri, 90% des CMS piratés en 2019 étaient des sites WordPress. Dans la majorité des cas, le piratage était dû à une mauvaise gestion des accès administrateurs.</p>
<p>À la suite d’un piratage, les conséquences peuvent être dramatique… Sécuriser efficacement son site web sans non plus devenir «&nbsp;parano&nbsp;» est donc essentiel.&nbsp;D’autant plus au travers du contexte sanitaire actuel, où le nombre d’entreprises évoluant vers la digitalisation augmente de jour en jour. Ce phénomène induit par conséquent une croissance considérable des risques de piratage.</p>
<p>L’objectif de ce Webinar est tout d’abord de vous faire prendre conscience des risques encourus à cause de quelques maladresses, et de vous montrer comment sécuriser simplement votre site web afin de garder une longueur-d’avance sur les cyber-attaquants.</p>

Ripple’s response to the&nbsp;SEC: <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-over-xrp-sales">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ignoring that the XRP cryptocurrency has utility, fintech startup Ripple alleged in its response to a securities complaint filed by the regulatory agency.</blockquote><blockquote>In a Friday filing, Ripple Labs pushed back against the SEC’s allegations, which claim the San Francisco-based firm violated U.S. securities laws for over seven years by selling $1.3 billion worth of XRP&nbsp;tokens.</blockquote><p>But wait, there’s more. Ripple also filed a Freedom of Information Act Request with the&nbsp;SEC.</p><p><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/29/ripple-bitcoin-ethereum-sec-documents/">Fortune</a>:</p><blockquote>The cryptocurrency company Ripple has taken the unusual step of filing a Freedom of Information request with the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking the agency to release documents concerning its determination that Bitcoin and Ethereum — the two most popular digital currencies — are not securities.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>In a letter, Ripple asked for any correspondence between the agency and those who helped create Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin and Joe Lubin. It also asks for letters between former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, agency staff and members of Congress.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>For its part, the company says it has never claimed that owning XRP amounts to an ownership claim in Ripple, which has long tried to persuade banks and financial institutions to use its software — and XRP — as facilitate global money transfers. The company also asserts that the price of XRP is not correlated to Ripple’s business activities, and notes that other agencies, including the Justice and Treasury Departments, have characterized XRP as a currency not a security.</blockquote><blockquote>In this context, Ripple’s demands for SEC correspondence about Bitcoin and Ethereum appear to be an attempt to portray the agency’s lawsuit as arbitrary and unfair. In particular, Ripple is likely to focus on the SEC’s 2018 conclusion that Ethereum is not a security — even though the Ethereum conducted a so-called “Initial Coin Offering” that gave outside buyers an opportunity to buy into the project&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1355750510200901632">Greg Kidd</a>:</p><blockquote>Forcing the [SEC] to reveal why it’s picking winners and losers rather than putting out clear guidelines and sticking to its mission.

In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</blockquote><blockquote>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the&nbsp;world.</blockquote><blockquote>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look&nbsp;like.”</blockquote><blockquote>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after&nbsp;all.</blockquote> 5.

 Background Context 



<p><a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/workflow/stories/IDunion.md">https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/workflow/stories/IDunion.md</a></p>



<p>The IDunion consortium (formally known as SSI for Germany) is a public private partnership of companies and institutions, which implement and govern the IDunion utility.<br>The IDunion utility is intended to serve organizations that desire to participate in the digital trust ecosystem and require an enterprise grade governance framework that will:</p>



  Establish an European Association as governing entity.  Establish a dualistic structure with a management and supervisory board to enable separation of powers.  Enforce permissioned-write access with contractual instruments that will conform to privacy regulations with focus on GDPR.  Enable use-cases with a substantial level of assurance as specified in eIDAS.  Maintain financial sustainability of the governing entity by membership fees and other potential income sources, which are currently evaluated.  Require adherence to specified open standards and protocols.  



<p>In this context it is important to note that the network is operated as a test environment. While the whole environment is intended to have a productive character including the necessary legal contracts, the interactions with the ledger currently have limited legally binding obligations and consequences for the parties involved.</p>



 Stakeholders / Persona 



<p>The following subjects are stakeholders to story:</p>



  The consortium members are: Main Incubator GmbH, Robert Bosch GmbH, Bundesdruckerei GmbH, esatus AG and the Technical University of Berlin.  The consortium includes several associated partners including: The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees of Germany; Ministry of Commerce, Innovation, Digitalization and Energy of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia; BWI GmbH; Berlin Senate Department for Economics, Energy and Public Enterprises; Deutsche Börse AG; regio iT gesellschaft für informationstechnologie mbh; Verband der Vereine Creditreform e.V.; Commerzbank AG; Deutsche Bahn AG; The City of Cologne; ING Germany; Telekom Innovation Labs (Deutsche Telekom AG); Siemens AG; Bank-Verlag GmbH; GS1 Germany GmbH, Festo SE &amp; Co KG;.  Further partners will join the consortium for the next phase of the project, however the necessary contracts still have to be signed.  The project is supported and funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Energy of Germany. More information can be found <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Redaktion/DE/Standardartikel/SchaufensterSichereDigIdentProjekte/sdi-projekt_ssi.html">here</a>  



 This utility story is convened by: 



<p>Adrian Doerk (Convener): Head of Communication at the IDunion consortium, employed at the consortium leader Main Incubator GmbH.<br>Helge Michael (Convener): Head of the IDunion project, employed at the consortium leader Main Incubator GmbH.<br>Dr. André Kudra (Convener): CIO at the esatus AG, Chair of the Utility WG at ToIP.<br>Anna Kathrina Pfeiffer (Convener): Head of legal / regulatory audit at the IDunion consortium, data protection officer (DPO) at the esatus AG.</p>



 User Stories 



  The companies and institutions mentioned above share a common business need for a public identity utility and decided to collaboratively explore the viability of a utility with a strong focus on the regulatory requirements of the European Union.  The consortium was selected for a government grant for the innovation competition “Showcase secure digital Identity” by the German government.  The consortium members established legal agreements for their collaboration, the use of software licences as well as for the roles within the network (Trustee, Steward, Endorser, Transaction author)  The stakeholders come together in several working groups according to the defined deliverables to work on the technical implementation, governance framework, regulatory aspects, communication, security, usability and use-cases.  The consortium members started a test network to implement the first use-cases.  



 Utility Foundry Workflow 



<a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/utility-foundry-wg/blob/master/workflow/img/workflow-swimlanes.png"></a>



 Learn 



  The used international standards and frameworks were examined independently by several consortium members between 2017-2019.  Several consortium members independently determined Hyperledger Indy to be the most suitable open-source framework for the implementation of a public utility.  While the concept of SSI offers multiple benefits for companies, institutions and individuals alike, the concept needs to be evaluated according to its suitability with European values and existing regulatory frameworks.  Evaluation of existing governance structures such as the Sovrin Governance Framework (SGF) and the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) among others.  



 Convene 



  The IDunion consortium is convened by the research and development unit of Commerzbank AG, the Main Incubator GmbH, which conducts research and development of SSI solutions since 2017.  The Main Incubator GmbH already worked closely together with other consortium partners within the Lissi project before and a continued collaboration for the application of the government grant was a natural fit.  The consortium had a kick-off event with all consortium partners and associated partners at the beginning of June 2020 and continues to hold regular meetings in the different working streams.  The application for the German innovation competition <a href="https://www.digitale-technologien.de/DT/Navigation/DE/ProgrammeProjekte/AktuelleTechnologieprogramme/Sichere_Digitale_Identitaeten/sichere_digitale_ident.html">Showcase secure digital identities</a> serves as guidance for the deliverables and working streams for all members.  



 Define 



  Definition of the roles required to run the network (Trustees, Stewards, Endorser, Transaction Author)  Creation of a report regarding the examination of the legal compatibility of the solution with GDPR, eIDAS and other German regulatory requirements (Telemediengesetz (TMG), Telekommunikationsgesetz (TKG) , IT-Sicherheitsgesetz (ITSiG))  The IDunion governance body requires a legal entity. Several possibilities were examined and compared with the support of an external legal advisory firm. A european cooperative was selected to be the most suitable type to fit the needs of the diverse stakeholder group and to convey European values.  Definition of the open-source framework hyperledger Indy for the implementation of the public utility.  Creation of a report on interoperability with other European solutions. The report outlines how interoperability with other identity networks (e.g., MeineSichereID, Findy or Sovrin) can be ensured. Open source projects, such as Hyperledger Indy and Aries, are also highlighted, which are strongly intertwined with the intended network of the overall project.  Identification of crucial regulatory topics, especially the conformity to GDPR and eIDAS. While the utility is believed to be GDPR compliant, there are several details, which still need to be confirmed with regulatory authorities.  To be allowed to act as an node operator within the IDunion test network, a legal entity is required to:  Join the consortium as an associated member with the associated legal contracts  Pay for all expenses of the operation of the node on their own behalf.  The approval has been granted by the consortium members on a case-by-case basis.    Defining critical cybersecurity issues by analyzing used standards, protocols, methods and algorithms as well as their implementation.  IDunion relies on international standards to build the identity network and agent software. The following standards are core components:  Verifiable Credentials as specified by the W3C  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as proposed by the W3C with the usage of anywise and peerwise DIDs.  DIDcomm Messaging Protocol as specified by DIF for the communication between Agents. These standards are especially oriented towards interoperability between future identity solutions.    



 Create 



  Planning of the creation of an European cooperative. For this purpose, appropriate contracts are currently set up and under review of specialized law consultancies (as of October 2020).  Established workflows for the governance of processes, policies and technical matters previously defined.  Policies defining the rights of the different roles have been formalized in an authorization map.  Different business model options have been evaluated. A final decision has yet to be made.  



 Implement 



  A technical working stream was started to determine the technical components required to establish a test-network with several node operators.  The consortium members already had experience with running nodes for distributed public utilities based on Hyperledger Indy, however to set up an own network required further exploration and communication.  A launch ceremony was held to start the test network. The genesis file includes nine nodes. Further nodes were added the following weeks. The event was captured as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLP16uoywd8">Video</a> and as <a href="https://www.snet.tu-berlin.de/menue/news/2020/2020_08_28_ssi_for_germany_consortium_starts_decentralized_identity_network/#Identity">press-release</a>.  Node operators either choose a third-party cloud provider or run the node within their own IT-infrastructure.  The governance model is further developed and consists of multiple documents.  Endorser contracts were formulated so third-parties, which are not (associated) members of the IDunion consortium, can write on the permissioned ledger.  Hyperledger Indy block explorers were set up to monitor the network. One is hosted by the <a href="https://idunion.esatus.com/home/IDunion_Test">esatus AG</a> and one by <a href="https://idu.cloudcompass.ca/">British Columbia</a>.  More than 30 different use-cases are currently explored as pilot projects. The use-cases are clustered in different ecosystems: eCommerce, eGovernment, industry, eHealth, finance, identity and access management (IAM), IoT and mobility.  



 Maintain 



  The test-network will be continuously used to run pilot use-cases and experimentations.  The start of a productive implementation is planned for 2021

<p>A 2019 study from the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews School of Management</a> gave financial management apps to participants and measured how having those apps affected the participants as compared to a control group. At the end of the study, the proportion of those who were confident about loan repayments to those who weren’t was <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">17.2 percent</a> higher in the test group than in the control group. With a little information and guidance, the participants became more confident about their finances—and that is key to financial inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when consumers have access to and control over their personal financial data. At Finicity, our open banking platform puts consumers in control of their data, which in turn leads to better financial literacy, inclusion, and outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how access and control improve financial inclusion, giving consumers better opportunities to make and reach their financial goals.</p>
 Access through Open Banking 
<p>In the past, and even still today, consumers’ access to their financial data has largely been limited to monthly paper or PDF statements. But recent innovations have improved consumer access, allowing consumers “to access and consolidate statements electronically and to <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">better understand their financial situation</a> through personal financial management and budgeting tools.”</p>
<p>How does this increased access help consumers? With data and fintech apps and services at their fingertips, consumers become more financially literate. It’s a simple equation: knowledge plus basic skills plus financial motivation equals better financial behaviors.</p>
<p>In the same <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews study</a> cited above, the authors found that using fintech apps was a gamechanger for the participants: “[The participants] expressed greater confidence in their understanding of loan repayments and demonstrated improved financial literacy…. Those receiving the smartphone apps proved more resilient when subject to a financial shock and were more likely to keep track of their income and expenditure.”</p>
<p>To help improve financial inclusion, financial institutions can give consumers access to their data through open banking connections and provide fintech apps that help consumers become more financially literate. The standard to aim for is “account ownership equals data ownership.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does this look like in practice? It looks like consumers being able to give third-parties permission to access their financial data on their behalf. It looks like the ability to see and access their data easily within their financial institution’s web portal. It looks like consumers reaping the benefits of big data on an individual and household basis.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion improves when consumers have access to their financial data in standardized, meaningful ways. That way, “individuals and families across the socioeconomic spectrum [have] access to financial tools once reserved for the wealthy. Whether it’s personal financial management tools, the ability to contribute data to credit scoring, or participating in peer-to-peer payment platforms, <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">access to personal financial data</a> changes lives.”</p>
 Control through Consumer-Permissioned Data 
<p>Once consumers have access to their data, control is the next crucial ingredient for financial inclusion. Historically, consumers haven’t had much control over how their data is used, who has access to their data, how frequently their data is accessed, or how long their data is retained. Without control, access doesn’t mean much.</p>
<p>Today, consumers have more control over their data than ever. Consumers are now able to “opt-in” their financial data, which can help streamline the loan-application process, give them access to better loan terms, and improve their generic credit scores. This level of control is possible through <a href="https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/oauth-connect/">OAuth connections </a>that provide tokenized access so consumers can permission and revoke these tokens at any time from the financial institution. Tokens also keep account details with the financial institution enhancing security and lowering risk.</p>
<p>With this relatively high level of control, what should be next to improve financial inclusion? Informed consent is a good place to start. Consumers need to have intuitive navigation experiences using language that is easy to understand. It’s not informed consent if consumers don’t understand the information!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make informed consent possible, financial institutions should provide a standardized permissions interface. <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200630022703/The-Finicity-Perspective-1.pdf">Consumers should be able</a> “to easily view, modify, add, and revoke permissions across their library of financial services. When permissions are buried out of reach, consumers do not have the control they deserve. Power only exists when control can be exercised and managed.”</p>
 Access and Control in Practice 
<p>At Finicity, we aim to help financial institutions and consumers improve financial inclusion through consumer access and control. To improve consumers’ access to and control over their financial data, we’ve connected financial institutions and payroll providers via financial data APIs, enabling consumers to permission their data for use in third-party applications or solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, our <a href="https://prod-finweb-frontend.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20200925171922/Finicity-Lend.pdf">Finicity Lend</a> solution gives consumers and lenders access to the following data:</p>
 
 Assets 
 Income 
 Employment 
 Cash flow 
 Transactions 
 Statements&nbsp; 
 Scoring attributes 
 
<p>This data can be used for everything from personal loans to small business loans. It’s real-time data that consumers can grant third parties access to in order to speed up the loan process. Its usefulness doesn’t end there, though. This data can also be used in just about any financial app, from budgeting to accounting to investments to account initiation and payments. The data is also FCRA-compliant so consumers can see the data used and dispute any inaccuracies.</p>
<p>Apps and services like these help improve financial inclusion. As the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/business/rbf/workingpapers/RBF19_012.pdf">University of St. Andrews study</a> found, people with access to this kind of information experience</p>
 
 improved “financial knowledge, understanding and basic skills,” 
 a greater likelihood to plan for the future,

<p>Erik van der Mars is per 1 februari gestart bij Ockto als Director International Operations. Hij gaat zich richten op het vormgeven van de Ockto dienstverlening in Europa en het opzetten van de internationale organisatie.</p>



<p>Ockto stelt consumenten in staat om veilig persoonsinformatie te delen met dienstverleners die deze informatie nodig hebben. Nederlandse klanten zien de Ockto dienstverlening ook graag in het buitenland beschikbaar komen. Hier speelt Ockto met de internationalisatieplannen op in. Dit is onder andere mogelijk met de introductie van Europese wetgeving zoals de AVG, PSD2, EIDAS en de nieuwe EU Data Governance Act.</p>



<p>Robert Harreman, CEO van Ockto: ‘We zijn al enige tijd aan het broeden op het internationaliseren van onze dienstverlening. Natuurlijk moesten we daarvoor eerst in Nederland een goede basis leggen. Nu is het voor ons het moment om de eerste stappen richting het buitenland te zetten. We zijn blij dat we Erik daarvoor hebben kunnen aantrekken.’</p>



 
 
<p>De afgelopen 15 jaar is Van der Mars actief geweest binnen de fintech sector. De laatste jaren waren zijn werkzaamheden vooral gericht op het laten groeien van platformen in de e-Invoicing en Payments markten.</p>



<p>Van der Mars:&nbsp;‘Ik kijk er naar uit om de innovatieve dienstverlening van Ockto te introduceren in landen als Duitsland en Frankrijk; zowel voor de consument als de financiële dienstverlener digitaliseren en vereenvoudigen we met het Ockto platform de gegevensuitwisseling voor diverse financiële processen. Denk hierbij aan het afsluiten van een hypotheek, of het verbeteren van KYC-processen. Niet alleen Nederlandse consumenten en dienstverleners zijn hier blij mee, ook in de landen om ons heen willen ze af van het zoeken in schoenendozen en rondschuiven van papier.’</p>

<p>Is Compliance the Next Wave for&nbsp;DeFi?</p><p>If 2020 was the year that crypto reached a turning point in mass adoption, 2021 will be the year of compliant decentralized financial products. Last year, we saw crypto develop financial products into what we call decentralized finance; yield farming, staking, and other financial mechanisms showed that cryptocurrencies can be used for more than holding or as means of payment. 2020 will be remembered for more than stronger mass adoption, it was also the year that international regulatory bodies and local regulators took a much more aggressive stance, especially in the field of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a stack of applications running on blockchain technology with the aim of creating multiple types of financial services and products. These applications have been promoted as a means of empowering users and developers to create unique peer-to-peer experiences which normally, would seldom happen in the traditional finance sector due to stringent regulations.</p><p>DeFi apps have brought an improvement on FinTech by introducing the concept of staking. Therefore, the DeFi ecosystem allows users to take out a loan on one platform, leverage a trade on another platform, and exchange it back to the base asset through a decentralized, blockchain-enabled exchange. Through this aspect of staking, DeFi has a wide range of use-cases, hence outperforming traditional financial services.</p><p>Although DeFi has enjoyed huge success since its inception, the industry is facing some risks and challenges which might affect users and its adoption by mainstream organizations. For instance, data collection methods in DeFi are still being developed and there have been many hacking instances. Also, there is a shortage of regulatory compliance experts offering support in order to solve regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Regulatory scrutiny in this industry is crucial in order to inject trust and attract more mainstream organizations and investment from high net worth individuals. Regulatory oversight ensures the availability of information that links users and transactions on these applications, which can be retrieved when the need&nbsp;arises</p><p>For more on the FATF’s Travel Rule: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/what-does-the-fatf-travel-rule-mean-for-crypto-users-9db7fb8bf68e">What does the FATF Travel Rule mean for Crypto Users? | by Shyft Network |&nbsp;Medium</a></p> What is compliant DeFi <p>Compliance in the DeFi sector means that the participants adhere to the same rules as traditional financial services. The laws that are set out for capital markets and the entire financial sector differ across states and governments, but they are classified into Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti Money Laundering (AML), and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>The selling point in DeFi is its association with blockchain technology which advocates for decentralization. Therefore, DeFi activities are also permissionless which is different from the traditional system that requires potential users to traverse a myriad of regulatory verification systems before being able to participate in the global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>DeFi projects have had issues with compliance, as they allow users to join and leave at their leisure. They are also censorship-resistant, further complicating the possibility of compliance.</p><p>The need for compliance in the DeFi space means that the applications should adhere to KYC, AML, and CFT guidelines, which can influence users and allow for collaboration with traditional financial organizations. Additionally, compliance to traditional financial regulatory guidelines can lead to mass adoption and serve a greater number of&nbsp;people.</p><p>The nature of DeFi applications obstruct any steps towards compliance, hence the need for bodies such as the Shyft Network that provide greater&nbsp;support.</p> Potential Solutions <p>DeFi’s challenge is not unprecedented, traditional finance met these not too long ago; since financial operations, including payments and settlements, retail investment, etc., regulators have been trying to curb illegal operations, i.e., money laundering. Some of these solutions require creative engineering so they can fit decentralized models without exposing users’ personal information.</p><p>Our Co-Founder, Juan Aja, explained potential solutions to the DeFi regulatory challenge in an op-ed piece on Cointelegraph, (read: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-s-time-to-mature-we-need-compliant-decentralized-finance">It’s time to mature: We need compliant decentralized finance (cointelegraph.com)</a>). Among those solutions, the following stand out because of their ease of implementation, and their feasibility in terms of adapting existing structures to a decentralized regulatory compliant framework, like the Shyft&nbsp;Network:</p>  Whitelisted addresses. A list of items/IP addresses that once they receive an initial validation are granted access to a certain system or protocol. In the case of DeFi, we could have one or two trusted anchors that could validate an address and conduct Know Your Customer diligence on the user. Once the user has been validated, all other projects within the same trust channel — i.e., a group of virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, that have agreed to follow the same set of rules and to collaborate within a well-delineated platform — can give that user access to products and services without having to redo the entire KYC process. <br>The advantage here is twofold: The user only shows private documents to one or two entities, thus reducing the surface area of attack for any potential data hacks, and the VASPs can have access to a larger user pool without having to increase compliance costs. A system like this could also enable individuals and entities who are excluded from traditional banking, savings and trading ecosystems due to geopolitical reasons to invest in yield-bearing products, alternatives to lending and high-interest accounts. DeFi is an alternative for these citizens and business owners to save, earn and transact.  AML- and GDPR-compliant systems. Institutional capital markets are strictly regulated and supervised by local and international regulatory bodies; the goal is to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorist operations. With an attestation framework, projects can verify and comply with existing AML regulatory requirements and attract institutional capital while protecting users’ privacy by not requiring them to create copies of their personally identifiable information.  Audited codebases and third-party certifications. There are plenty of blockchain projects out there that are not built under minimum acceptable standards, and it’s difficult for every user to go through the codebase and verify that the code is doing what it is meant to do. By having third-party validators go through the code — attesting to its integrity, functionality and reliability — the bar would be raised, making these projects more competitive and safer for investors.  <p>The Shyft Network Solution to Compliant DeFi: Shyft Network’s solution does not entail any fundamental changes to the DeFi sector but rather will augment the industry making it more secure and efficient with minimal&nbsp;risk.</p>  Veriscope GDPR/AML Compliant Discovery Mechanism. A key focus for Shyft Network has been the creation of Veriscope, an identity and data exchange network that helps VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) like crypto exchanges, adequately comply with the FATF Travel Rule for virtual assets and service providers. Veriscope is a decentralized solution that will enable VASPs and other projects sanctioned by regulatory authorities, the opportunity to comply with regulations while protecting user data and continuing to remain decentralized.  Whitelisted Addresses and Proof of Identity. Shyft Network enables both decentralised and centralised entities to continue operating seamlessly meaning they will be lending, staking, and providing liquidity without fear of falling victim to bad actors. DeFi participants will be required to provide proof of their identity that will be used to whitelist their addresses. Whitelisted addresses will be able to interact with both the decentralised finance providers and mainstream institutions freely as they bear a higher level of&nbsp;trust.  Risk Assessment Mechanism for all DeFi Projects. Shyft Network will also continually monitor all wallet addresses interacting with DeFi smart contracts and regularly query them for risk assessment purposes. The result of these queries will be used to generate reports and score addresses on a set risk evaluation scale to establish the trust levels of various participants. The Shyft Network will make this information readily available for DeFi platforms interested in making assessment of various participants. Most importantly, addresses found to be in violation of the set guidelines will be blacklisted to protect others from potential nefarious actors.

 Primo ad essere attivato in Italia, il servizio diminuisce drasticamente i tempi di permanenza degli utenti nei centri vaccinali, azzera i rischi di errore procedurale e riduce i costi di gestione. 



 



<p>Roma, 2 febbraio 2021 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione a livello europeo, ha avviato con successo una collaborazione con la ASL Roma 1, una delle più grandi aziende sanitarie italiane, per digitalizzare la procedura di raccolta del consenso informato di tutti coloro che, nell’ambito territoriale coperto dall’azienda sanitaria, hanno aderito e aderiranno alla campagna vaccinale anti Covid-19.</p>



<p>La ASL Roma 1 è la prima azienda sanitaria italiana ad aver attivato questo servizio, partito lo scorso 28 dicembre presso l’Hub vaccinale del Santa Maria della Pietà – in concomitanza con l’avvio ufficiale della campagna vaccinale in Italia – e disponibile anche presso gli altri centri vaccinali gestiti dalla ASL: l’Ospedale Santo Spirito, l’Ospedale San Filippo Neri e la Casa della Salute Prati-Trionfale.</p>



<p><a>La raccolta del consenso informato dei vaccinandi è obbligatoria e richiede necessariamente che essi lo sottoscrivano con firma autografa. Grazie alla ProxySign Interactive Trust Platform di InfoCert, l’intero processo è stato digitalizzato attraverso una procedura semplice e pienamente conforme alle normative: dopo il riconoscimento del vaccinando attraverso la sua tessera sanitaria, il personale dell’ASL procede ad effettuarne l’anamnesi e ad inserire tutti i dati al terminale. A seguire, il titolare dei dati – cioè il vaccinando – appone sul tablet dell’operatore due firme grafometriche (Firme Elettroniche Avanzate – FEA), che vengono immediatamente recepite e verificate dal sistema: tutto in pochissimi minuti e senza nessun passaggio cartaceo.</a></p>



<p>In tal modo viene reso più rapido, sicuro ed efficiente il processo operativo, diminuendo i tempi di permanenza degli utenti all’interno del centro vaccinale, azzerando i rischi di errore procedurale e riducendo significativamente i costi di gestione a carico dell’ASL.</p>



<p>“In un momento così difficile come quello che stiamo vivendo, ci rende davvero orgogliosi essere riusciti a contribuire concretamente e in tempi estremamente rapidi alla semplificazione dell’operatività di una campagna vaccinale di portata storica”, dichiara Danilo Cattaneo, Amministratore Delegato di InfoCert, Tinexta Group. “In questa collaborazione con la ASL Roma 1, a beneficio dei cittadini della Capitale, abbiamo messo a frutto l’esperienza già maturata in tutti quegli ambiti nei quali il rispetto delle rigorose normative di settore è un fattore chiave”.</p>



<p>La soluzione di InfoCert consente di gestire qualsiasi tipologia di documento PDF che necessiti di raccogliere informazioni in modalità interattiva, ha tempi di implementazione rapidissimi, garantisce piena compliance normativa ed è già predisposta per la conservazione digitale dei dati sensibili, come previsto dalla legge.</p>



<p>“La campagna vaccinale anti Covid è la più grande iniziativa di sanità pubblica mai realizzata nel nostro Servizio Sanitario e soltanto nel nostro territorio coinvolgerà un milione di persone. Occorre quindi un’organizzazione molto efficiente e al tempo stessa sicura – commenta Angelo Tanese, Direttore Generale della ASL Roma 1 – Questa collaborazione con InfoCert consente di fornire un servizio migliore ai cittadini ed è anche il segno tangibile della possibilità di generare innovazione attraverso una partnership virtuosa tra pubblico e privato.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The goal of customer identity verification is to give your business the confidence that a user interacting with your brand is a real-life human and truly the person they claim to be.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Customer identity verification is most frequently employed during the first interaction with a new customer. These interactions might include registering for a service, submitting an application or opening an account. The ability to verify identity during this initial engagement is key because the potential for fraud is high.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>2020 is behind us and yet still so present in our daily lives at the beginning of 2021.</p>
<p>This will undoubtedly be the year of rebuilding our economies, of accepting remote work and distance learning with increasingly data-intensive digital tools, and also the year that will perhaps finally usher in this collective awareness of the challenges of digital security and sovereignty. The companies we work with on a daily basis are clearly demanding better control over their customers' data, so that it can be used for more purposes. Europe's political decision-makers are getting restless with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/proposal-regulation-european-data-governance-data-governance-act">recent publication of the Data Governance Act</a>, which finally foreshadows the end of the era where the citizen is the product.</p>
 A look back at our 2020 highlights 
<p>We have taken incredible steps this year with your support:</p>
 
 Two new applications have been integrated in your Cozy to offer you more uses and control: <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Pass</a>, a French and open source password manager and <a href="https://cozy.io/en/">Notes</a>, a collaborative text editor 
 Nearly 70,000 data-conscious individuals have already adopted a personal cloud 
 A partnership that we are really proud of was created with CEMEA and the support of Secours Populaire Français, the Afnic Foundation, the Samu Social de Paris and Framasoft to fight against digital exclusion 
 A partnership with <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/en/gandi-a-new-hosting-provider-for-your-cozy/">Gandi</a> allows their customers to create a Cozy space on their own domain. You will stay because you can leave. 
 Cozy Cloud has been rewarded by the <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/en/award-cozy-cloud-as-a-mydata-operator/">NGO MyData as MyDataOperator</a> 
 Cozy was chosen as the data platform for its energy savings service offered at the Data Challenge thanks to Métropole Grand Lyon 
 Cozy Cloud is not the only alternative to offer personal data store as Sir Tim Berners Lee has published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/tim-berners-lees-startup-inrupt-releases-solid-privacy-platform-for-enterprises/?guccounter=1">new version of Solid, personal data store for businesses</a> 
 The European Commission published Data Governance guidelines that provide for a regulated trusted third party status 
 Our projects in the education field will continue in 2021 with even more features to accompany <a href="https://blog.cozy.io/fr/education-cloud-personnel/">distance learning for students and teachers of the Academy of Rennes</a>. 
 
<p>All these events contribute to the achievement of our mission: democratizing the digital home.</p>
 Our last developments 
 
 A password management application <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#pass">Cozy Pass</a> 
 A text editor Cozy Notes 
 New banks and the possibility to create recurring operations in <a href="https://cozy.io/en/features/#bank">Cozy Banks</a> 
 Connectors developed by our community 
 Constant improvements and optimizations for the synchronization application with your computer. 
 A simpler and more intuitive design in Cozy Drive to encourage content sharing and the remote work 
 
<p>We continue to believe that it is possible to manage your personal data with a single tool. This is why we are constantly working to make our solution more complete and simple to use.</p>
 What we are planning for yoU 
<p>As there's a first time for everything. Here is our roadmap for the first months of 2021:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving your Cozy<br>
From now on, you can move your Cozy to another provider at any time without losing data.<br>
Moving your Cozy is more than a data export, you can take it with you in one click :</p>
 
 all your data (so you don't forget anything) 
 your applications and configurations (so you don't have to reconfigure anything) 
 your shares and contacts (so you don't lose your network) 
 more than data portability, service portability! (everything without exception) 
 
<p>Drive: Certified document management<br>
Today, your Cozy allows you to retrieve your documents such as invoices and contracts from the client area of your online site. We go further by offering you to certify all the documents coming from the official website. A guarantee of security and conformity for all your administrative procedures!</p>
<p>Notes : An editor enriched with images and other collaborative features*.<br>
At the beginning of 2020, we launched a Cozy Notes text editor that was acclaimed by our users but remained in its beta version. We decided to add value to it by adding collaborative features.</p>
<p>Desktop: Selective Synchronization<br>
You have been waiting for it... for a long time and it finally arrives! Soon, you will be able to choose which folders in your Cozy will be synchronized with your computer.</p>
<p>Mobile: Augmented pdf viewer<br>
The idea is to give you a new experience when you open a pdf from your web or mobile application.</p>
<p>Security: Access protection by pin code, touch ID and face ID.</p>
<p>Office suite: Integration Only Office<br>
Do you have an office suite?, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite, I can't leave Google Drive if you don't have an office suite... Good news: you will finally leave Google (for real) thanks to the integration of the <a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/fr/">Only Office suite</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have big plans for you in 2021. Some of them will be tested in the next few days, so get ready to discover them.</p>
 To conclude...but it is just the beginning 
<p>We wish you all a wonderful year. Thank you for your time during this crazy year, your support, your encouragement and your enthusiasm for the announcement of the new applications. Enjoy every moment.<br>
From far away on our cozy cloud.</p>
<p>The Cozy Cloud team.</p>

   Identity and Access Management Improves Digital Experiences 

<p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is the United Kingdom’s largest government department. The organization is implementing an identity-based digital transformation in order to reduce fraud, keep costs down and help citizens more easily and securely access benefits. I had the pleasure of speaking with James Randall, the Lead Identity and Trust Architect for DWP, who gave us a peek into the department’s strategy and execution.</p>

<p>Q. DWP is the UK’s largest public service department and largest distributor of benefits. Who are you serving and at what scale?</p>

<p>We are responsible for welfare, pensions and child maintenance policies for more than 20 million customers. Through our welfare systems such as Universal Credit, we encourage people to be financially independent by providing assistance and guidance to help them back into employment. We also administer the UK state pension service as well as a range of other benefits including child maintenance and support for people with ill-health.</p>

<p>Q. Tell me about your role within the organization.</p>

<p>My role is to design and execute our digitization strategy. I work within the DWP Digital Group - a team of people who manage the DWP’s digital estate and all the electronic services. Specifically, I’m the lead architect for identity trust and my focus is on identity verification and identity-based access. We are using technology to combat fraud while fostering accessibility and ease-of-use for our citizens. The citizen is the focus of our work: We are tasked with providing a personalized experience while also protecting citizens’ privacy. We also want to keep costs low, driving value for money in order to protect the public purse.</p>

<p>Q. What role does identity play in your digitization strategy?</p>

<p>Identity is at the center of our strategy. It is imperative that we allow citizens easy access to the information we hold while protecting their privacy. We need to determine that people are who they say they are on multiple channels including face-to-face, chat, phone, web, etc. Once identified, we need to authenticate users quickly and easily in order for them to securely interact with the services we provide.</p>

<p>But identity can be tricky, particularly in the UK. In Estonia, for example, they have a national identity card which citizens can use to establish their identity across government, health and banking sectors easily and it works really well; their citizens can move smoothly through government systems without having to constantly reaffirm their identity. In the UK this is not the case. As a society we have a different view on the use of government-issued ID cards and that’s OK, it just means that the identity challenge is more complex in countries like the UK; of course, that’s also what makes it so interesting!</p>

<p>We have tried to solve this problem before, of course, with GOV.UK Verify -- a bold attempt to establish a government identity approach that would facilitate better citizen interaction with government systems. We learned a great deal from Verify and it was heavily used by the DWP, specifically on our Universal Credit service. But it was not perfect and we found that it was often very hard for some of our more vulnerable citizens to use. That’s why we are now building our own service, which is known as the Dynamic Trust Hub. We are taking loads of learning from Verify and we are working across government to ensure our internal approach can complement, reuse and support other departments wherever possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. What more can you tell us about the Dynamic Trust Hub?&nbsp;</p>

<p>We created the Dynamic Trust Hub, which is based on the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a>, with help from Accenture and we have deployed it into AWS. The Dynamic Trust Hub will allow individuals access to the department’s numerous digital services, reusing a single identity that they should only have to prove once. The ‘dynamic’ nature of the Trust Hub relates to the way it will manage the citizen journey based on what they are trying to do, reducing complexity where possible but ensuring, when necessary, effective identity and security controls are put into place to protect citizens’ data. The Dynamic Trust Hub implements a policy-based approach so it can support federated credentials and mandate multi-factor authentication and govern access to citizen data held across different benefit lines. It will do so in a way that will provide for a joined up and, hopefully, a more pleasant experience for all our citizens.</p>

<p>Q. Many agencies globally are facing threats of fraud. Is that an issue at DWP?</p>

<p>Reducing fraud and error is a massive consideration for DWP so we’re always looking for ways to reduce that. With the Dynamic Trust Hub, we are implementing solutions to combat identity fraud and inappropriate access. The department already operates a sophisticated fraud service and the Dynamic Trust Hub will allow us to incorporate that intelligence into every customer transaction. We’re running risk solutions that identify patterns and risk engines that flag issues to agents and systems before they become truly problematic.</p>

<p>Q. Does combating fraud conflict with usability for consumers?</p>

<p>It can be difficult to install safety protocols that don’t hinder the user experience. The Dynamic Trust Hub will support the development of risk profiles based on an individual’s behaviour. With ForgeRock, we can put speed bumps into place that alert agents and systems to potential fraud. But we can also remove those speed bumps for a citizen who exhibits less risky behavior for a smoother experience. ForgeRock helps to make it easy to deliver a personalized customer journey. We can say, “Yes, we know that person and that person is safe.”</p>

<p>Q. Tell us about your identity journey.</p>

<p>We have a significant number of legacy systems as well as an increasing number of modern solutions supporting specific benefits, but we knew we needed to update our capabilities that center on identity. But identity thinking at the complex level required by the department was relatively new to us; We took about six months to investigate and fully understand our needs and the technology that could assist us. From there, we identified the capabilities and outlined our specific needs. We decided we needed Identity and Access Management to create a real-world identity store and a transaction risk management solution that builds up a citizen’s credibility over time.</p>

<p>We then sent a Market Analysis paper to various identity vendors, we narrowed the candidates down to six and then eventually to two with whom we tested and built fully operational prototypes. We found that ForgeRock had the most comprehensive capabilities like delegated access, user access and risk execution. We also like the modular nature of ForgeRock’s products. I have confidence that ForgeRock is future-proofing our architecture, bringing good things to bear down the road.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect DWP? Did you believe you were prepared?</p>

<p>I am not sure anyone can truthfully say they were prepared for the pandemic and obviously it has had a profound impact on DWP not only as a large, complex organization but, more importantly, on our operations teams with a substantial increase in demand for the national services we provide. Speaking from the perspective of our team in Identity and Trust, I think we handled the situation extremely well. We not only moved overnight to a 100% home working environment but also managed to accelerate some of our inflight activity to support the significant increased demand on our wider operations, without which some of our major benefit lines would not have been able to support citizens as well as they have through this crisis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Q. Any future plans you can share?</p>

<p>Just that we have very ambitious plans to continue to roll out new services that allow people to more quickly and easily get the help they need.&nbsp;</p>

 Setting up a dynamic raft based Quorum network for development and testing using&nbsp;Helm.  Motivation <p>Following <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/build-a-minimal-quorum-network-90c59ec22226">this</a> informative article provided by my colleague <a href="https://medium.com/@turfa">Majd</a>, in which you can learn the basics about Quorum and how to set up a minimal Quorum network using docker containers, we decided to take things a bit further and use our knowledge to provide a dynamic Quorum setup deployable to Kubernetes. In our <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template">GitHub repository</a>, we provide a Helm chart and some scripts which aim to make developing and testing on Quorum a lot faster and easier. This article will provide some insights regarding the setup and the functionalities of the&nbsp;project.</p> Tooling &amp; Prerequisites <p>For our setup, we need a running Kubernetes cluster and Helm. Helm enables us to deploy a preconfigured network to a running cluster using the concept of charts. This, in combination with some scripts, gives us the ability to dynamically add and remove nodes to and from the&nbsp;network.</p> Minikube (Kubernetes) <p><a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">Minikube</a> is one of the multiple tools which you can use to spin up a Kubernetes cluster locally. Other viable options are <a href="https://k3s.io/">k3s</a> or <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/">kind</a>. Those tools are widely used to develop and test applications on local infrastructure, before deploying them to the target infrastructure.</p> Helm <p><a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/kubernetes-helm-charts/">Here</a> is a pretty good explanation of what Helm does and how it is connected with Kubernetes:</p><blockquote>In simple terms, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the K8s equivalent of yum or apt. Helm deploys charts, which you can think of as a packaged application. It is a collection of all your versioned, pre-configured application resources which can be deployed as one unit. You can then deploy another version of the chart with a different set of configuration.</blockquote> Dynamic Nodes <p>Now that we know the technical requirements we can take a closer look at the actual <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/quorum-raft-helm-template">repository</a>. The intention for this setup was to use Quorum on Kubernetes. As we did not find any solutions for this besides <a href="https://github.com/ConsenSys/qubernetes">Qubernetes</a> — the officially supported way to deploy Quorum to Kubernetes — we decided to create our own deployments using Helm. This in particular has the benefit of being more flexible than the officially supported way where Kubernetes deployments get generated once and have to be regenerated and redeployed everytime you need another setup. Using our dynamic approach you will be able to keep the network running while adding or removing&nbsp;nodes.</p> Quorum Configuration <p>The following code shows the values.yaml file in which most of the action will take place. Those values are used to dynamically fill a set of templates which you can then reuse for the number of nodes you want in your network. The setup also allows you to modify some additional configurations regarding the deployment such as input parameters for Quorum and&nbsp;Geth.</p><p>The values file additionally takes input for the nodes which are going to be deployed to the cluster. Some of those values are needed for adding a node to a raft based Quorum cluster and others give some additional functionality like enabling or disabling endpoints.</p><p>Under endpoints, RPC, as well as WebSocket endpoints, can be turned on and off. This in particular is used for communication inside the cluster. Additionally — if needed — you can enable the ingress controller to easily access nodes from outside the cluster. If you have Ingress enabled you can access the nodes at http://&lt;cluster-ip&gt;/quorum-node&lt;n&gt;-rpc or http://&lt;cluster-ip&gt;/quorum-node&lt;n&gt;-ws. Nodekey and enode represent the key material for a raft node, they can be generated using the bootnode command provided by Geth. The key value is a Geth Keystore file which holds the account credentials for a Geth account. Only with the combination of bootnode credential and Geth account, the node will be able to function properly. Note that example credentials as provided in the repository should never be reused in any production environment.</p> Reusing Templates <p>The above values will then be used to fill in the provided templates. Those templates usually take values for exactly one node/deployment.</p>templates needed to deploy a single&nbsp;node<p>By looping through the nodes object of the values file at the top of each template, we can reuse these for every new node added to the values file. Here's an example for a PersistentVolumeClaim:</p> Deploying and Updating the&nbsp;Chart <p>Now, let's start with deploying the network to a running Kubernetes infrastructure.</p><p>Upgrades, after changing the configuration of your network can be installed by&nbsp;using:</p> Adding New&nbsp;Nodes <p>Besides adding and removing nodes by modifying the values file manually, we also implemented a more convenient way to do this. For this, we provide multiple scripts that allow us to add and remove specific as well as multiple&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>In the following, I will use the addNodes.sh script to dynamically add new nodes to a running&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>The addNodes.sh script now allows me to decide how many nodes I want to add to the cluster. I choose to add 2 additional nodes and the script automatically generates the corresponding credentials, adds them to the values file, and upgrades the deployed Helm&nbsp;chart.</p><p>Note the additionally generated value raftId. This value is required for every additional node as it enables the flag “ — raftjoinexisting &lt;raftId&gt;” which is needed to properly add a new node to the initial 3 nodes&nbsp;cluster.</p><p>After updating the chart you can see that the new nodes have been added to the cluster. To confirm that the cluster is running and is properly synchronized you can run the following command, which will open a shell to Geth running inside the container. You can then use this open shell to inspect the state of raft (see below) or execute different geth commands. If the resulting nodeActive value is true, the node is properly synced with the cluster and ready to&nbsp;go.</p> Conclusion <p>All in all this project should help people to improve testing and development of Quorum networks running on Kubernetes infrastructure. Besides that, it is also a simple and convenient way to gather some experience using Quorum and experiment with various settings, especially if you have problems figuring out the right configuration for your cause.

AERGO has committed to awarding Blocko 500,000 AERGO tokens each quarter for a total award of 2 million AERGO tokens. The blockchain based CCCV service aims to prevent online fraud and false influencer credentials. AERGO mainnet will be used to record verified personal certifications and credentials.</p> Overview <p>As mobile and social network platforms become more common, the number of accounts we have to manage in our daily lives, keeps increasing. CCCV is a distributed identity management service that helps anyone easily manage various accounts and identities based on BLOCKCHAIN DID. CCCV provides management technology that can add trust to social network accounts without a central certification authority. Social network influencer’s credentials are verified and recorded on the AERGO Mainnet for authentication. CCCV’s goal is to someday provide services like Credit Bureau (CB) through social networks and social identities.</p> Features <p>CCCV acts as a gateway to various SNS information and links through short link address service. Various SNS channels can be aggregated into one address, giving followers one page to view all available SNS accounts. Create and manage various one-time links, such as surveys, voting, donations, event pages, shopping malls, and pop-up&nbsp;stores.</p><p>CCCV displays the owner’s certification badges and links that prove their identity and credentials. Credential badges provide various certification management functions to prevent various frauds that prevail on social networks and websites. To receive a credential badge, CCCV users submit their credentials for verification. CCCV team certifies the submitted credentials and the results are recorded on the AERGO&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>CCCV is more than a user credential verifier, CCCV strives to create a trust culture where the community members trusts one another and verifies the validity of that&nbsp;trust.</p> Response <p>Currently, the service has gone viral due to the influx of influencer-centered users, showing a steep rise in user&nbsp;traffic.</p>&lt;google analytics. Jan&nbsp;2021&gt; Future <p>In the future, CCCV will provide highly tailored financial products and services, using the user’s verified information, such as occupation, annual income, and assets. Compared to current user tracking advertisement platforms, CCCV will provide user relevant advertisements.</p><p>Revenues generated from these products will be reinvested to the platform contributing to the expansion of the ecosystem.</p><p>Some consumers and influencers are having difficulty establishing credit cards. CCCV plans to collaborate with credit card companies to enable credit card issuance or loans through social network certification and evaluation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-to-award-the-first-incubation-investment-to-cccv-63794ccfd96">AERGO to award the first incubation investment to CCCV</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>GitHub reconnaissance is a tactic that attackers use to gather information about their targets. Attackers analyze organizations’ GitHub repositories and check for sensitive data that has been accidentally committed or information that could lead to the discovery of a vulnerability.
For this tutorial, let’s build a scanner that automates the GitHub recon process! We will be scanning your GitHub repositories using the method mentioned in the “Tightening Up Your GitHub Security” post.</p>

<p>You will be working with Python, the GitHub REST API, and the GitPython Library. You will need to obtain a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">GitHub personal access token</a> and <a href="https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html#installing-gitpython">install GitPython</a>. 
Make sure that your GitHub personal access token has these permissions: <code>public_repo</code>, <code>read:org</code>, <code>read:packages</code>, <code>read:user</code>, <code>repo:status</code>
Before you dive into the code, here are the imports you need:</p>

   <code>import requests, tempfile, shutil, re

from git import Repo
from git import NULL_TREE
</code>   

 Finding Repositories 
<p>First, you will crawl through your organization’s account to find repositories to analyze. You need the GitHub API for this. The GitHub API endpoint is located at <code>https://api.github.com</code>.</p>

<p>You can set the “Accept” header to “application/vnd.github.v3+json” to specify that you are using the REST API v3. And you can provide the access token through an “Authorization” header.</p>

   <code>GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN = "{Insert your token here!}"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "token {}".format(GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN),
    "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json",
}
api_host = "https://api.github.com"

orgs = ["okta"]  # list organizations to analyze
users = ["vickie"]  # list users to analyze
</code>   

<p>List the organization and individual usernames that you want to analyze. Include the usernames of your organization as well as the usernames of your organization’s employees. Then, you’ll start by looking for additional usernames associated with your organization by querying the GitHub API for organization members.</p>

   <code>def requests_page(path):
    resp = requests.Response()
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url=path, headers=headers, timeout=15)
    except:
        pass
    return resp.json()


def find_members():
    """Find usernames associated with the organizations."""
    resp = []
    for org in orgs:
        path = "{}/orgs/{}/members".format(api_host, org)
        resp = requests_page(path)
    for user in resp:
        users.append(user["login"])
</code>   

<p>Optionally, you can look for contributors to your organization’s projects. You can also update your <code>users</code> and <code>orgs</code> list manually as you go.</p>

   <code>def find_contributors(org, repo):
    """Find the contributors of found repos and add to users list."""
    path = "{}/repos/{}/{}/collaborators".format(api_host, org, repo)
    resp = requests_page(path)
    for user in resp:
        users.append(user["login"])
</code>   

<p>Next, you scan the usernames for repositories and clone the repo into a temporary directory for analysis. You might have to figure out some permission issues with the GitHub API during this step. Make sure that your access tokens have the proper permissions!</p>

   <code>def find_repos():
    """Find repositories owned by the organization and users."""
    usernames = orgs + users
    usernames = set(usernames)  # dedupe the usernames
    for username in usernames:
        path = "{}/users/{}/repos".format(api_host, username)
        resp = requests_page(path)
    for repo in resp:
        if repo["fork"] == False:
            scan_repo(repo["git_url"])


def clone_repo(repo_url):
    """Create a temporary directory to hold the repo that we are analyzing."""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    Repo.clone_from(repo_url, temp_dir)
    return temp_dir
</code>   

 Building a Wordlist 

<p>You can also build a list of keywords that might indicate vulnerabilities or an information leak. Add search terms based on your needs. You can incorporate regex patterns as well to scan for access tokens or keys with a known format.</p>

   <code>search_terms = {
    "hardcoded secrets": [
        "key",
        "secret",
        "password",
        "encrypt",
        "API",
        "CSRF",
        "random",
        "hash",
        "MD5",
        "SHA-1",
        "SHA-2",
        "HMAC",
        "api_key",
        "secret_key",
        "was_key",
        "FTP",
        "login",
        "GitHub_token",
        "-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----",
    ],
    "sensitive functionalities": [
        "auth",
        "authentication",
        "password",
        "pass",
        "login",
        "input",
        "file_input",
        "get",
        "user_input",
        "URL",
        "parameter",
        "read",
    ],
    "dangerous functionalities": [
        "import",
        "resources",
        "dependencies",
        "input()",
        "eval()",
    ],
    "development side effects": [
        "todo",
        "deprecated",
        "vulnerable",
        "vulnerability",
        "fix",
        "completed",
        "config",
        "setup",
        "dev",
        "removed",
        "HTTP",
        "HTTPS",
        "FTP",
    ],
    "weak crypto": ["ECB", "MD4", "MD5"],
}
</code>   

 Scanning Repositories 

<p>Now, let’s start scanning your repositories for keywords! You can use the GitPython library to iterate through the commits of each repository and scan for the strings in your dictionary. Finally, it displays the filenames and commit numbers that might be leaking information.</p>

   <code>class colors:
    FILENAME = "\033[1m"
    NORMAL = "\033[0m"
    WARNING = "\033[93m"


def find_strings(diff):
    print("{}{}{}".format(colors.FILENAME, diff.b_path, colors.NORMAL))
    blob_text = diff.diff.decode("utf-8", errors="replace")
    for category in search_terms:
        for term in search_terms[category]:
            if re.search(term, blob_text, re.IGNORECASE):
                print(
                    "Found term {}{}{} in this file. You should check if there are {}{}{} exposed.".format(
                        colors.WARNING,
                        term,
                        colors.NORMAL,
                        colors.WARNING,
                        category,
                        colors.NORMAL,
                    )
                )


def scan_repo(repo_url):
    temp_dir = clone_repo(repo_url)
    repo = Repo(temp_dir)
    branches = repo.remotes.origin.fetch()
    prev_commit = NULL_TREE
    # Searching commits for keywords
    for branch in branches:
        branch_name = branch.name
        for commit in repo.iter_commits(branch_name, max_count=100):
            print("=" * 25)
            print(
                "{}Searching commit {}.{}".format(
                    colors.FILENAME, commit.hexsha, colors.NORMAL
                )
            )
    diffs = commit.diff(prev_commit, create_patch=True)
    for diff in diffs:
        find_strings(diff)
        prev_commit = commit
    # remember to remove the tempfile
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_members()
    find_repos()

 Eliminating GitHub Security Holes 

<p>In this post, you built a simple GitHub scanner that finds secrets accidentally committed to your organization’s repositories. If this is something that interests you, here are some related project ideas.
You can build a more powerful scanner! For example, you can build a tool that scans for the “Issues” section of GitHub to find vulnerabilities faster, or to find vulnerabilities that are not indicated by keywords. You can also build a larger and more diverse wordlist with regex patterns— what regex pattern would indicate credentials in a URL? Additionally, you can improve on the reporting of the current tool: give yourself the ability to filter by vulnerability type, or highlight the tokens and token types found in the commits.</p>

<p>After you’ve identified your GitHub weaknesses, here are a few steps that you can take to tighten up your GitHub security. First, every piece of sensitive data exposed through a public GitHub repository should be considered leaked. Therefore, you should rotate every credential found in your repositories. Next, fix or patch vulnerabilities that you have found via code analysis of these files. Again, these weaknesses should be considered public information and you should remediate them ASAP. Finally, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository">remove any additional sensitive information</a> from the repositories and commit histories!</p>

<p>Today’s consumers expect more than just empty brand promises — they want <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessibaker/2021/01/27/why-impact-proof-will-eat-brand-purpose-for-breakfast-in-2021/?sh=137995294c0f">proof</a> and your credibility as a company depends on it! Consumers are demanding better, but unfortunately we still see companies perpetuating bad practices and finding themselves in sticky situations. From human rights violations, like forced labour in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/23/thai-seafood-industry-report-trafficking-rights-abuses">Thai seafood industry</a>, to environmental destruction from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html">palm oil deforestation</a>, it is clear that we still have a long way to go. However, for companies that uphold their values through positive practices, we believe that supply chain transparency is the key to&nbsp;success.</p><p>Protect Your Reputation</p><p>The first, and most obvious, reason to adopt supply chain transparency is to lower reputational risk. If you aren’t involved in anything unseemly, then there shouldn’t be anything to hide. While there are some costs involved with adopting supply chain transparency, the long-term gains of avoiding a scandal are well worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>A <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/what-supply-chain-transparency-really-means">study</a> from MIT Sloan School of Management found that consumers are willing to pay 2% to 10% more for products that provide transparency. Being forthcoming in your practices will build consumer trust and respectability. <a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/footprint-chronicles-fall-2010-update/story-19223.html">Patagonia</a> is a great example of a company that has strengthened customer trust by putting their values into practice.</p><p>Create a&nbsp;USP</p><p>Transparency keeps existing customers happy and creates a unique selling proposition that helps attract more conscious consumers. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyTLvzRu6fs&amp;feature=emb_logo">ad</a> from Standard Chartered shows how they are using transparency to create some really cool marketing material.</p><p>Improve Efficiency</p><p>You may be experiencing some hesitancy, but using blockchain technology to track your supply chain will ultimately streamline your processes. Documents are no longer lost along the way and business processes become easier for all actors involved — especially during audits or product&nbsp;recalls.</p><p>Comply with Regulations</p><p>Lastly, transparency is an essential tool to help you comply with regulations. After so many environmental and human rights violations, governments have put regulations (like the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill.asp">Dodd-Frank Act</a>, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/in-focus/conflict-minerals-regulation/regulation-explained/">EU Conflict Minerals Regulation</a>, and more) in place to hold companies accountable. Being proactive about supply chain transparency and traceability will help you to easily comply with current regulations and prepare for future developments.</p><p>We believe that transparency is a competitive advantage, and we have the technology to help you get there. Our MIMOSI Connect platform uses blockchain technology to help you gain visibility across your entire supply chain. MIMOSI Connect is customizable to fit your needs and can easily integrate with your existing systems. Our intuitive user interface is easy to use and is easily adoptable by your upstream suppliers. Let us help you create powerful connections with your customers and uphold your values. Responsible supply chains make stronger&nbsp;brands.</p><p>Learn more at <a href="http://www.peerledger.com/supply-chain">www.peerledger.com/supply-chain</a>.</p>

 Leadership &amp; Org Update&nbsp;#24   Introducing the new HoloFuel App&nbsp;Design  Progress on Many&nbsp;Fronts  Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap   Introducing the new HoloFuel App&nbsp;Design <p>Last year we released the HoloFuel hApp to our community testers on a previous version of Holochain. The testing we did then, although focused on the Holochain infrastructure, allowed us to observe and listen, and for testers to provide incredibly valuable feedback. It set us up to reimagine HoloFuel as an application. So that our alpha test community can have an idea of what to expect, today we are sharing the new&nbsp;design.</p><p>HoloFuel will work both installed locally and also as a hosted application on Holo for use by any web user. We’ve spiffed it up and it now has a proper logo, a simpler UI, and a more intuitive UX. Here’s a quick&nbsp;tour.</p><p>HoloFuel will have a dashboard where users can see their balance, initiate transactions and respond to incoming notifications.</p><p>HoloFuel enables recipients to accept or decline transactions. The Transaction History can be filtered, sorted and searched.</p><p>Sending and requesting transactions is simple and easy with the new HoloFuel workflows.</p> Progress on Many&nbsp;Fronts <p>As you can see, we’ve been hard at work on design but design is not the only place we have been making progress.</p><p>If you have been reading the regular updates we share in Telegram or Twitter, you probably already know that we’ve now got a working Elemental Chat application and that we are hard at work preparing the Holochain and Holo infrastructure so that we can release it to all hosts. We are almost&nbsp;there.</p><p>However, it may be a bit harder to see how all the other details that get shared in those messages are having us progress towards the other milestones on our roadmap. Here are some specific accomplishments from the past several&nbsp;weeks.</p>  DNAs for Holo Hosting have been initially built or migrated to RSM including:<br> -Holo hosting DNA<br> -Service Logger<br> -HoloFuel<br> -Holo Registration  UI design has been started for all apps and is nearing completion for&nbsp;some  Our KYC partner has been selected and we’re working to complete registration flows inclusive of a new registration hApp  Hosting infrastructure has been internally demonstrated — the main feature left before full integration testing is to ensure that signals can work end-to-end in the hosted&nbsp;context  An early version of the HDK (Holochain Developer’s Kit) has been created for RSM with testing and feedback from community app developers  An automated testing framework that uses HoloPorts to test Holochain apps instead of services like AWS has been recently built. We’re using that right now to do the behavioural load testing for Elemental Chat.  <p>All this progress has had us take a fresh look at our roadmap and make a few&nbsp;changes.</p> Moving HoloFuel up on the&nbsp;Roadmap <p>Yes, you read that right! We are actually ahead of where we expected to be in some ways. While it is taking a while to complete infrastructure testing because that is one of the most complex aspects of our work, we have been able to move many other activities forward. Because of that we decided to shift the HoloFuel application up in the roadmap. Here is what it looks like with the new&nbsp;changes.</p><p>More importantly however is getting a sense of how much of the work is done. Below are our estimates of work completed for a few of the milestones that follow our infrastructure releases.</p><p>The past month has not only been a month of progress towards our milestones for Holo and Holochain. It has also been a month of social unrest and we’ve engaged in deep consideration of our place in the future of technology and how we want to contribute to society. As a team we’ve reflected on the concentrating tendencies of power and the responsibilities that come with inherently centralised technologies. We’ve also delved into a profound discourse about how Holochain is fundamentally different from Holo. The ways that these two technologies work together but are divergent will be a theme of exploration in our writings over the course of the next year. We look forward to the&nbsp;journey.</p><p>In closing, I want to again appreciate all of those in the app ecosystem and in the community of testers who continue to contribute their time and energy and who are a key part of the success of this project. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holofuel-app-design-energises-our-progress-dfa29c97dccd">HoloFuel App Design Energises our Progress</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Introduction 
For many of us, this has been an exceptional year with lots of ups and downsides. This report will try to give you some insight into the achievements and obstacles of our small, but dedicated team. Let's start with our obstacles so that we can finish boasting about our accomplishments.

Similar to most of you, we had to switch those nice and efficient one-on-one meetings for endless hours of video calls. But the main obstacle stemmed from the bureaucracy imposed upon us from the same system that we try to disrupt. The delays caused by the administration and paperwork due to government institutions were endless. Additionally, legal departments reduced their work time due to the health crisis, so even the things that should go smooth took more time.

Nevertheless, by the end of 2020, we are proud of our achievements and our agility to take up challenges effectively. We hit all our goals for this year and now we can look back to a successful year with a lot of improvement to the IOP Stack(tm). Of course, this is not an argument of being content with the current state. Instead, we can motivate ourselves to do even better and disrupt even more by looking back at our accomplishments of 2020.
 Accomplishments 
 
 [] We have grown the IOP Stack to a remarkable size 
 [] The IOP Stack is production-ready 
 [] We have designed the first SDKs in Typescript and Flutter. 
 [] We have expanded the Hydra Blockchain with SSI and DNS features 
 [] We have released the innovative and convenient Hydra web wallet
 
 [] We have added Keystore file generation/authentication to the web wallet

 [] The whole infrastructure automatically builds and deploys which improves the quality of our updates 
 [] We have completed the full SDK in Typescript 
 [] We have developed a keyvault, which will become a very important piece of the future stack
 
 [ ] With some minor adaptions, this can be made blockchain independent 
 
 
 [] We have hired a promising developer, David De Troch, who is committed to become a new core developer in the IOP Project 
 [] We have released the first part of the developer introduction videos that explain our stack 
 [] We have integrated DID/SSI into the blockexplorer - Claims made and DIDs created can be publicly verified 
 [] We have integrated DNS into the blockexplorer - Schemas and domains can be registered and publicly verified 
 [] Last, but not least: we have published a<a href="https://developer.iop.global/"> developer portal</a> that contains the (SDK) documentation plus tons of tutorials 
 
 Pipeline(next few Months) 
 
 [ ] Enterprise API Portal: IOP Console 
 [ ] Launch a new product concerning digital asset ownership 
 [ ] An official joint venture with a German company 
 
We announce them as soon as we can. We need to wait until everything is complete and thoroughly tested. Concerning the joint venture, we have to ensure that all the details are finalized. Until then, stay tuned and watch our <a href="https://t.me/IoP_news">telegram channel</a> for news soon!
 IOP reporting for duty 
We are proud to announce that the underlying SSI/DID infrastructure is production-ready.<br> We arrived at a point where businesses can start to build apps and services on top of our stack. Projects with concrete ideas about a KYC or an identity solution should check out our technology.<br> Compare our possibilities and costs with other platforms and we are confident about (y)our future!<br> On top, you can apply for building a common joint venture or request for support how to integrate the stack to your ecosystem. Just get in touch with us!

A common problem with today's crypto is usability. This is improving at a steady pace. At IOP we integrated a <a href="https://letstalkbitcoin.com/blog/post/decentralized-dns-intro">decentralized DNS system</a>, which enables high-reputation actors to name wallets or record the data formats and workflows they use to increase discoverability, transparency and gain trust in the ecosystem.<br> In English: Wallet addresses, DID contracts can become human readable names like a website address is being read from a browser.

This year we are going to work with Morpheus on an open-source flagship app that incorporates our state-of-the-art features. This makes it easier for teams to start implementing solutions. They do not have to start from ground zero, instead, they have a worked-out example to go by. Additionally, we will gain experience with what we built and gain ideas for further features and improvements.

If you work in identity and access management and you are trying to transform to Industry 4.0, you should talk to us and try our framework out! We are helpful and glad to support everybody with knowledge transfer or joint ventures.
 New Year's resolutions 
Building the whole IOP Stack will take time. In the meantime, the goal is to become profitable with our existing portfolio, so that we can ensure the future of our business and lead in the privacy space. This can only happen with healthy and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is time for IOP to leave its comfort zone and look for applications that provide concrete value to its customers and partners alike.

Currently, <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFT) are becoming a hot topic in crypto. Our goal is to combine it with our existing stack and DeFi to create a completely new ecosystem. One year should be enough to try to make this unique combination ready for prime time in 2021 Q4.&nbsp;

Our dedicated team currently consists of experts, veterans, and one newcomer on the block. Behind the team, there is huge support from the community and the delegates. So we thank you all for keeping us company during our ups and downs! As our previous points have laid out, our ambitions are as high as ever. Therefore, another resolution is to expand our team with more fresh blood and energy. This is a necessary step for us to grow and achieve our goals. Ideally, this should also be reflected in the community. We would like to reach out to you! Spread word about our mission to find potential partners, business ideas, or new members for our community. We are confident that this will benefit all!

   Strong Identity Governance can Protect Your Business and Increase Productivity 

<p>The risk of identity breaches to global organizations cannot be overstated. Cybercriminals continue to attack organizations across the enterprise and numerous verticals. As noted in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/2020-consumer-identity-breach-report">2020 ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, unauthorized access (40%) is the number one attack method by cybercriminals in 2020. It’s no wonder there has been a 78% increase in compromised consumer records over the previous year. The point here is clear: organizations that are dependent on access predictions based on limited data and visibility are exposing their business to unnecessary risk. They need to evolve their current thinking and approach in order to better manage and control unauthorized user access.&nbsp;</p>

 The Silent Access Challenge: Entitlement Creep&nbsp; 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">Digital transformation</a>, securing the remote workforce, and growing regulatory compliance requirements like SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA are putting global organizations under increasing pressure to achieve compliance – not just annually, but continuously. With so many new types of identities – customers, partners, workforce, citizens, machines, devices, bots’ APIs, applications, and microservices – security and IT teams are overwhelmed. Today’s identity governance solutions cannot keep up because they are based on manual, human reviews and fulfillment. As a result, organizations are blind to potential risks such as growing employee entitlement creep across the enterprise.</p>

<p>An employee’s roles, groups, and responsibilities can change dramatically over the course of their employment. When these changes are dealt with manually, it is easy to forget to remove some or all access from a previous role. This leads to entitlement creep, where employees gradually accumulate unnecessary permissions over time. As a result, when a user leaves an organization, he or she might have more access than IT knows about, so the user retains access to those overlooked or orphaned accounts.</p>

   &nbsp; 

 Organizational Blindspots Accelerate Entitlement Creep&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Access Compliance&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staying compliant requires a lot of effort – especially when people change jobs, work on special projects, or leave your organization. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> helps by automating the work it takes to enforce and demonstrate compliance. By implementing access policies, your organization can be confident that the right people are accessing the right information for the right reasons. And, it lets you quickly review and certify access for any user at any time.</p>

<p>Whether it is helping to comply with regulations such as SOX, HIPAA, GDPR, FISMA or CCPA,&nbsp; compliance is foundational to reducing your organization’s security risks. A failed compliance audit or lack of access controls can lead to users accumulating more entitlements or unnecessary permissions over time. This, in turn, can lead to inappropriate access privileges and potentially to larger issues as well, like unauthorized user access, or even a data breach.</p>

<p>Operational Inefficiencies&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity governance solutions are meant to automate access requests, approvals, and certification reviews. Unfortunately, the reality is that IT and security teams are buried in access requests, approvals, and certification reviews. As a result, they can end up manually approving access requests and rubber-stamping access certifications. This results in the overprovisioning of user access privileges – in this case, excessive or unnecessary entitlement assignments.&nbsp;This can lead to unauthorized user access to systems, applications, and proprietary business information, like personal identifiable information (PII), business strategies, competitive intelligence or company revenue projections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Business Enablement&nbsp;</p>

<p>Governing user access to applications and systems across an entire enterprise is a critical component to any security strategy. But it often presents one of the greatest challenges faced by security professionals. As employees, contractors, or temporary staff join the company, change jobs, take on different assignments, or eventually leave the company, organizations must constantly update access entitlements and policies to ensure that users only have access to what they need, while removing access they don’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many organizations today address this with manual processes executed by different people and different systems. Manual processes are not effective at addressing the issue for a number of reasons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Employees must wait to get the access they need to do their job.</p>

<p>2. They are more prone to errors.</p>

<p>3. Policies do not cover all needed access types and are often applied haphazardly.</p>

<p>4. They are &nbsp;much more costly than automated processes.</p>

<p>Eliminate Entitlement Creep with AI-Driven Identity Analytics&nbsp;</p>

<p>How do you prevent entitlement creep in your organization? The answer lies in artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">(AI)-driven identity analytics</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Identity analytics leverages AI and machine learning algorithms to consume and analyze vast data volumes to map out the user access landscape across the entire enterprise. By detecting user access patterns – both good and bad – identity analytics can quickly highlight excessive or unnecessary entitlement assignments and over-provisioned user access privileges. In turn, AI-driven identity analytics can automate the removal of high-confidence and low-risk access rights, lowering the risk of unauthorized users access across your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my next blog, I’ll explain how your organization can eliminate entitlement creep with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a>.

<p>Shyft Network was designed as an interoperable standard for use cases that require multiparty trust and validation. In order to enable more use cases across public and permissioned protocols, standards are required to extend the tools and options available for new user groups, institutional use cases, and traditional systems.</p><p>The use cases Shyft Network focuses on are ones where you don’t necessarily have 3rd party obligations or require counterparties to create trust across each other in order to be successful. Traditionally, solutions to this are done through legally binding agreements or established regulatory and legal requirements. In the context of decentralized systems, adding in legal processes and cross entity rules are both challenging and in many cases destructive to the openness of the system&nbsp;itself.</p><p>The role of Shyft Network’s infrastructure is to maintain openness and decentralization across any protocol, while enabling standard processes that allow for counterparty rule creation and consent to be combined in order to solve trust and counterparty obligation issues that are required in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>To put it simply, the transactions and interactions we engage in every day are largely based on trust and associations or validation of information and assets by other parties. The role of Shyft Network is to act as this trust layer, to bridge the gap between the traditional world and decentralized, in order to unify these ecosystems and further enable mass adoption and real-world interoperability.</p><p>The following explainer is meant to describe the use of SHFT, the native currency of the Shyft Network, and to outline only some of the major use cases of the currency and protocol standard.</p><p>Shyft Network Blockchain</p><p>In order to pay for services across intermediaries, DApps and participants, SHFT is used to both pay for the cost of security and operations, as well as a payment mechanism for the transmission of data and assets. This is similar to how existing blockchains function as Layer&nbsp;1’s.</p><p>Shyft Network Smart Contract&nbsp;suite</p><p>The goal in Shyft Network’s design is to act as a multi-layer protocol depending on the needs and requirements of its users. Rather than competing with other layer 1’s like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, Algorand, and more, Shyft Network was designed primarily as a very large smart contract infrastructure set. By taking this approach, the protocol can focus on cross-chain use cases and ways of unifying layer 1’s in order to build out a cross-protocol trust and compliant data&nbsp;layer.</p><p>Shyft Network runs three different core infrastructure stacks:</p>  A federated layer 1 (The blockchain): A public system for use cases that have a particular set of needs and requirements. This is primarily for enterprises and institutions (ie. Governments) who would rather focus on data origination and require a different trust model at the base protocol&nbsp;level.  Shyft Network Smart contract suite: The primary standards logic to enable all use cases, intermediary interactions, and tools for developers to build applications against Shyft&nbsp;Network.  Byfrost Bridge: An asset-staked bridging infrastructure for cross-protocol data and asset transmission. Byfrost was designed with the smart contract suite. The goal of Byfrost is to bridge the Shyft network smart contract suites together across protocols. Through this process, all of the history, use cases, and users that sit on Shyft Network can be utilized across other protocols, thereby unifying everything into a cross-chain data and asset availability layer.  <p>The rest of this post will focus on the use cases of Shyft Network and the SHFT currency within them rather than a technical deep dive into the primary infrastructures.</p><p>SHFT is a means of payment, a mechanism for bonding value, and an instrument for governance value capture. SHFT, depending on the use case, can be utilized in a multitude of ways which includes a monetary instrument and value capture system, as well as an authorization system for long-term validation.</p><p>SHFT is a currency for identity and data transmission, as well as a governance mechanism for coordination across ecosystems that enables entity-to-entity governance, compliant asset creation, and a system for compliant defi and other applications. Enabling a new side of the existing ecosystem will drastically expand the size of market participants and increase the size of asset participation across all decentralized projects, protocols, and marketplaces.</p><p>Identity, Counterparty Discovery &amp; User coordination</p><p>We believe that the next phase of progress for decentralized systems is in the creation of identity, reputation, and enhanced methods of entity creation and coordination. Users, entities (Dapps, Defi, institutions, enterprises, etc.), assets and data are primary interactions in everyday life. Shyft Network enables complex creation of these verticals to build a base standard for cooperation and transaction coordination.</p><p>Identity is very broad and extends to nearly every facet of life, which means defining initial use cases must be derived from critical issues and problems that we face and feel everyday. In creating Shyft Network, the contributing early participants and teams brought in problems and pains they had felt from the early days of the crypto ecosystem and worked towards solving&nbsp;them.</p><p>Identity</p><p>The SHFT token is used to pay for security and operations on the Shyft Network, as well as to enable data market payments across intermediaries involved in identity systems. The simplest example of this is the current project being developed on Shyft Network in collaboration with the Government of Bermuda. The Perseid project is the first national identity project aimed at leveraging a public blockchain protocol to create a national data market place and identity ecosystem. SHFT is the currency used to enable identities across the country, and pay for data services across institutions engaging in user-consent based identity.</p><p>Compliant DeFi &amp; Global Regulations: A global opt-in compliance and trust&nbsp;Layer</p><p>In order to ensure that the ecosystem continues to grow in cooperation with new regulations, we need systems that can bridge the gap and enable opt-in infrastructure to allow for regulated intermediaries and rules to be built across permissionless networks. This does not mean forcing people into compliant systems, but rather providing more options to allow for new user groups to be able to participate in the ecosystem. The future of institutional adoption requires compliance requirements and primitives to be a part of market infrastructure in order to actually utilize these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This not only protects the ecosystems growth but allows us to tailor to the liquidity that exists outside of the ecosystem today. Compliant participants and liquidity in the traditional financial system is many orders of magnitude larger than the crypto economy, and being able to provide open infrastructure to these parties enables onboarding and regulatory clarity. Shyft Network was designed to enable these use cases, creating a cross-protocol environment for compliant liquidity, identity passporting and data transmission.</p><p>The FATF travel rule was the first global regulatory requirement placed on the ecosystem in June of 2019. Some of the largest crypto platforms, DeFi projects, and stablecoins including Binance, Bitfinex, Huobi, Aave, Tether, joined together to create Veriscope atop of the Shyft Network. These exchanges today are utilizing Veriscope to ensure user consent, data security, exchange to exchange verification and counterparty discovery. Regulations are inherently designed to centralize functions of systems, but through the design of our system, Shyft Network is the only solution that globally allows Bitcoin and other crypto ecosystems to maintain openness and decentralization while allowing users to comply with cross-jurisdictional requirements like the travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>The SHFT currency is used to ensure spam prevention, prevent data attacks against exchanges and global users of the system, create payment and bonded asset channels for untrusted counterparties (a form of data market transaction) and over the long term helps maintain the governance system currently being directed and developed by the global coalition of digital asset companies.</p><p>The SHFT token is used to pay for the security of validation for crypto transactions that occur across participants in Veriscope. When a digital asset is withdrawn and sent from one platform to another, SHFT is used to request information from other platforms and to complete data transactions. With this, Shyft Network through Veriscope becomes a data side chain to public networks, currencies and tokens globally, and acts to ensure security and privacy are maintained across our open ecosystem.</p>

<p>Also known as “Data Privacy Day” outside of Europe.</p>



<p>2021 follows hot on the heels of one of the most disruptive years we have known in our lifetimes and, if the analysts are to be taken seriously, looks set to be a game-changer for the world of Privacy Tech. Possibly, a theme enhanced by the need to share data on mass due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of Privacy Tech has been creeping up over the last few years but to date has not hit the mainstream. Organisations have not had an incentive to counter their mass data accumulation and often can’t see beyond more is; well, more and therefore better?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year is the 40th anniversary of the introduction of Convention 108, the first legally binding instrument relating to data protection. With the treaty being in place for so long, we would like to believe that the concept of data protection is familiar to society at large. Unfortunately, the rate at which technology has evolved means that it is not always apparent what happens when you share your data and has left most people in the dark. 2021 marks the 15th annual Data Protection Day and aims to educate society on data protection issues and rights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MyLife Digital believes that many positives can come from collecting, sharing, and using people’s data ethically. Products and services should be designed to deliver benefits to individuals, society, and organisations equally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is going to make the difference in 2021?</p>



<p>There are several forces coming together that will make significant changes to how society views and treats data protection.</p>



  Technology is still evolving – but demonstrating a change to reflect the human-centric needs of society. Tim Berners-Lee’s Solid project is one example of the change needed to give people control of their data  Regulation is evolving. GDPR introduced a step change and is seen as the benchmark for global data protection standards. The number of countries that have introduced or updated their data protection regulations in the last few years has increased significantly.  Regulators are learning how to act. Adtech is an elusive dark art, individuals’ data is regularly shared and used to create profiles to improve advert displays without individuals realising.&nbsp;  Activists are making noise. More advocates are challenging dark patterns relating to data protection. Individuals and groups have raised many challenges with regulators to ensure data protection is done right. Raising awareness and ensuring laws change to meet the needs of the people they protect.  People are becoming aware of data protection rules. Individuals are noticing that advert following them around the internet and starting to challenge this stalking behaviour.  



<p>What do the analysts say?</p>



<p>Gartner suggest a proactive approach to privacy and data protection helps organisations increase trust.</p>



<p>Privacy is becoming a reason for consumers to purchase a product, in the same way that “organic,” “free trade” and “cruelty-free” labels have driven products sales in the past decade.</p>



<p>“Privacy-first products are likely to follow this trend,” says Bart Willemsen, Vice President Analyst, Gartner. “To increase customer trust, executive leaders need to build a holistic and adaptive privacy program across the organisation, and be proactive instead of responding to each jurisdictional challenge.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-forhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-for-the-future-of-privacy-2020/%20-the-future-of-privacy-2020/">https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-forhttps://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-predicts-for-the-future-of-privacy-2020/ -the-future-of-privacy-2020/</a></p>



<p>——————</p>



<p>Forrester too, predict that Privacy will become an imperative in 2021.</p>



<p>2021 will be a year of transition. As communities, consumers, and businesses leave the pandemic behind, they will embrace a new normal.</p>



<p>Three privacy-related trends will underpin this transition: 1) an ever-increasing appetite to collect, process, and share sensitive personal data from consumers and employees; 2) despite the recessionary economy, values-based consumers will increasingly prefer to engage with and entrust their data to ethical businesses; and 3) regulatory and compliance complexity in relation to data privacy will increase further.</p>

<p>__________</p>



<p>CMOs should be considering Consent and Preference Management</p>



<p>With both Forrester and Gartner predicting 2021 will be the year Privacy becomes an imperative, this following article in ITPro addresses why CMOs should be considering Consent &amp; Preference Management as a core component of the marketing stack.</p>



<p>“They must look for solutions that help them design and implement privacy as continuous engagement. This includes designing and orchestrating privacy touch-points and building portals that allow consumers to adjust their data sharing preferences,” says Iannopollo, a senior analyst at Forrester.</p>

<p>Initiative Will Build Upon Fractal’s Growing Base of 140,000&nbsp;Users</p><p>28 January 2021, Berlin, Germany and Tallinn, Estonia — Fractal, KILT Protocol and Polkadex today announced a partnership to create a decentralised KYC system for exchange customers. Polkadex and Fractal will use the KILT Protocol as the underlying infrastructure for managing the KYC credentials required by Polkadex, to simplify and streamline the onboarding experience.</p><p>KILT Protocol will integrate Fractal’s user-centric KYC/AML platform, which is built for compliance with global, regulated industries. BOTLabs GmbH (the company behind KILT Protocol) will provide a wallet as a browser extension for customers to hold their credentials, and make the wallet available to Polkadex for verification. Fractal and Polkadex will integrate KILT’s SDK to build out the platform.</p><p>The onboarding flow will be as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Fractal will automatically issue KILT-Credentials to Fractal’s current user base of 140,000 users who have previously KYC’d  Polkadex will ask new users for credentials  If the user has no credentials, they are directed to download and set up KILT’s&nbsp;wallet  If a user is not verified, Fractal guides them through identity verification and attests the KYC credentials when&nbsp;complete  When the user’s identity is verified, Fractal stores the credential hash on the KILT blockchain.   Decentralising the KYC&nbsp;Process <p>Polkadex is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the DeFi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot. To solve the problem of order matching with identified individuals, Polkadex uses a zero-knowledge proof of identity obtained from the KILT blockchain.</p><p>KILT Protocol stores customer data in a distributed manner, without giving any provider undue advantage through data aggregation. By integrating KILT, Polkadex does not need to store or access customer data or compromise their privacy to identify&nbsp;people.</p><p>“We envision a world of financial inclusion, creating bridges that transfer value from traditional money markets to a decentralised store of value and trust, thereby preparing the world for a tokenised future. KILT is a great way to achieve that without compromising the core principles of decentralisation,” said Gautham J, CEO of Polkadex.</p><p>KILT is an open-source fat blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable credentials that enable trust business models in a Web 3.0 marketplace. Built on Substrate, the protocol has multiple business applications and KILT is currently exploring partnerships in the energy, genetics, gaming and finance&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>“The alliance with Fractal and Polkadex is the first of many turnkey solutions the KILT ecosystem will offer for exchanges and DeFi projects. We’re proud to be part of substantive ecosystem collaborations with Substrate and Polkadot builders,” said Ingo Rübe, CEO of BOTLabs GmbH and Founder of KILT Protocol.</p><p>KILT and Fractal have collaborated for the past three years. Fractal has been utilised by many exchanges and ICOs, and is now developing an advertising marketplace that replaces the tracking cookie and gives control back to users. Fractal’s open-source protocol provides a standard for a fair and transparent exchange of ad information that will enable a data commons while ensuring data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>“We are excited to see decentralised identifiers being used beyond the concept stage. It will be a great user experience and hopefully a kickstart for a more decentralised web,” said Julian Leitloff, Co-founder and CEO of&nbsp;Fractal.</p> About Fractal <p><a href="https://www.trustfractal.com">Fractal</a> is an identification company. We are replacing the ad cookie to give users back control over their data. Fractal wants to create a data commons that will enable fair competition against a market duopoly with valued users and trusted ads. Fractal was founded in 2017 and is trusted by 140k verified crypto&nbsp;users.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io">KILT</a> is an open-source fat blockchain protocol for issuing claim-based verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials for Web 3.0. It allows users to claim arbitrary attributes about themselves, have them attested by trusted entities, and store the claims as self-sovereign credentials. The protocol offers a simple JavaScript SDK so useful applications can be built without requiring any blockchain development skills.</p> About Polkadex <p><a href="https://www.polkadex.trade">Polkadex</a> is a fully decentralised, peer-to-peer, orderbook-based cryptocurrency exchange for the Defi ecosystem built on Substrate, the same framework that powers Polkadot. It enables high-speed trading, high liquidity, and lightning-fast transaction speed for supporting Defi applications and services.</p> Press Contacts: <p>Pooja Kadia – pooja@fractal.id</p><p>Christine Mohan – christine@kilt.io</p><p>Deepansh Singh – deepansh@polkadex.trade</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is the talk of the day in much of Europe. As an example, in Finland there was a recent case in which a private psychotherapy centre’s database was hacked and a considerable amount of sensitive client information was stolen. After this, the attackers made attempts to extort money from the victims by threatening to release the information to the public. </p>
<p>Cases like this are caused by compromised customer credentials, weak authorisation, and poor access control implementations. Solutions that were valid a few years ago might not be up to today’s challenges. It can be difficult for companies to protect their valuable customer data, especially if you rely on in-house built IAM (Identity and Access Management) solutions that nobody updates periodically. Ubisecure’s Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) easy to use solution lets you rapidly embed strong, proven CIAM (Customer IAM) capabilities into your applications. It allows you to improve security while letting your developers concentrate on your core business. In this blog, I tell you how to try these capabilities for yourself, in a no-commitment <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/">IDaaS free trial</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Identity-as-a-Service? 
<p>IDaaS offers cloud deployment options of Ubisecure’s Identity Platform solution, including both identity management and access management tools. These are used to manage your company’s external identities, including your customers, partners, remote workers, subcontractors and other external stakeholders. </p>
<p>In short IDaaS is a CIAM system delivered as SaaS (Software-as-a-Service).</p>
<p>There are two main options for Ubisecure IDaaS deployment – private cloud and public cloud. The public cloud option is a single- or multi-tenant solution that offers core CIAM functionality and is fully deployed and operated by Ubisecure. The main focus of public cloud IDaaS is on the access management side, such as single sign-on (SSO), identity providers (IdPs) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).Private cloud IDaaS is a single-tenant solution that offers full IAM functionality – including more advanced identity management capabilities like Delegated Authority – and is deployed by the customer or a certified Ubisecure System Integrator partner. The platform is operated by Ubisecure. Ubisecure also provides on-premises and hybrid deployment solutions of its Identity Platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Ubisecure’s IDaaS free trial? 
<p>We offer everyone a chance to test a limited set of Ubisecure’s IDaaS capabilities for a 30 day trial period. You get free access to use the system during this trial period to give you a chance to ‘test drive’ the solution for yourself. The IDaaS free trial includes identity management and access management tools, and clear step lists to instruct you with each task. No previous experience of CIAM systems is required and you will learn how to do basic identity management tasks and how to register new applications with easy to use tools and graphical user interfaces. Find the registration link here on our website: <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/">www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to use the IDaaS Free Trial 
<p>This free edition of Ubisecure IDaaS allows you to test some of the core capabilities of a CIAM solution. The trial includes user registration, identity management with self-service and administration user interfaces, and a trial console tool for application integrations using the OIDC (OpenID Connect) protocol. You don’t need to bring a test application for testing the integration; it’s provided to you as a part of the trial. </p>
<p>Next, we will take a look at the main use cases of the IDaaS free trial. In the example case below, Max Mustermann from Drive Tag Inc. registers an IDaaS trial account, operates both self-service and administration views of the identity management, and registers a test application with an IDaaS trial access management tool called Trial Console.&nbsp;</p>
 Registering for the IDaaS free trial 
<p>The first step in the IDaaS trial is the main user registration. Max clicks the registration link found from the Ubisecure <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/free-idaas/">website</a>. He then fills in the simple registration form, including a confirmation code sent to his email, and he becomes the main user of a new organisation. Then he can add and invite new users from his organisation to join the trial account.</p>
 <p>Max Mustermann from Drive Tag Inc. registers an IDaaS free trial account.</p> 
 Identity Management self-service view 
<p>Once Max has sent the registration form, he will receive an account registration confirmation email with a link to the Identity Management self-service view. </p>
 <p>Max receives a registration confirmation email with a link to the Identity Management self-service view.</p> 
<p>Max clicks the link, which forwards him to the IDaaS free trial sign-in window. Here, he can choose from different options including Identity Management, Access Management, OpenID Connect Tester Tool, Trial Documentation and sending an email to discuss with Ubisecure experts. He can also reset his forgotten password, in which case he’ll receive a link to his email to proceed with the operation. Max signs in to the Identity Management self-service view.</p>
 <p>Max signs into Identity Management.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;In the self-service view, Max can view, add, modify and delete his identity attributes (in the trial version, only mobile phone number can be configured) and change his password. Also, he can view his role information which is used to define the level of access rights to different applications integrated to the Ubisecure Identity Platform. At a later phase, Max will integrate a test application using the Trial Console Access Management tool.</p>
 <p>Max can view, add, modify and delete his identity attributes, change the password and manage his roles.</p> 
 Administration view 
<p>Next, Max switches to the Administration view, which is only available to main (administrator) users. Normal users can access only the Identity Management self-service view. Here, Max can manually add new users to his organisation or send registration invitation emails to them. Max can also view, add, modify and delete other users’ identity attributes, reset their passwords and manage their roles. </p>
 <p>Max deletes user ‘John Doe’ in the IDaaS trial Administration view.</p> 
 Application Integration 
<p>One of the main use cases of the Ubisecure Identity Platform is application integration. For this, the IDaaS free trial has a special access management tool called Trial Console. This tool simplifies the integration work and helps new users to register applications to the Identity Platform. </p>
<p>When registering an application, you only need to enter the redirect URI of your application. Trial Console then generates client credentials for your application to use with the OpenID Connect authorisation code flow.</p>

<p>For those who want to experience an OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration without coding we have a browser based tool, OpenID Connect Tester. This tools lets you view the OIDC flows and decoded claims within the ID token in detail.</p>
<p>In this example, Max Mustermann has clicked the Access Management link in the sign-in window (see picture 3) to open the Trial Console window. He then registers a test application to the Identity Platform. Open the IDaaS Trial Documentation section (see picture 3) to view clear steps on how to do the registration.</p>
 <p>Max Mustermann uses the Trial Console to register the OpenID Connect test application to the Ubisecure Identity Platform.</p> 
<p>Max registers the OIDC Tester tool with the Trial Console tool. The Trial Console is an IdP (Identity Provider) and the OIDC Tester is a client. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Max configures OpenID Connect Tester to be a client for the Trial Console (Identity Provider).</p> 
<p>Once the OIDC Tester application has been registered, Max can use the tool to monitor the OIDC protocol flows. Generally speaking, these flows are used to exchange information between the user’s browser, the application the user wants to access and the Identity Platform. With the OIDC Tester, Max can view authorization-, token- and introspection requests. Also, he can view the ID token and decode it to see the claims inside the token. To get more information about the protocol flows, see my colleague Petteri Stenius’ blog article on “<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/education/differences-between-saml-oauth-openid-connect/">The differences between SAML, OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>”. </p>
 <p>Max can choose requests to monitor or decode an ID Token.</p> 
 Conclusion 
<p>IDaaS is the fastest way for you to introduce identity and access management capabilities into your web, mobile and desktop applications. According to Gartner, one of the leading research and advisory companies, by 2022 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-steps-to-implement-single-sign-on/">IDaaS will be the chosen delivery model for more than 80% of new access management purchases globally</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get familiar with IDaaS is to register for Ubisecure’s IDaaS free trial session and to start testing some of the core features of the solution. It is completely free and you can launch a test instance 24/7 from Ubisecure’s website. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>  2020 Channel Partners of the Year: ProofID and Versent  <p>The Channel Partner of the Year awards go to our channel partners who exemplify, no matter the circumstance, the best of Ping. They have a positive impact on Ping’s business through growing our customer base, furthering beneficial alignment and engagement with our field, and making strong pipeline contributions to our company.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>I’m pleased to announce not one but two recipients of the Channel Partner award—the North America Channel Partner of the Year and the International Channel Partner of the Year.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First I’d like to congratulate <a href="https://proofid.com/">ProofID</a>, our 2020 North American Channel Partner of the Year. &nbsp; ProofID saw outstanding success in 2020, selling Ping Identity products and bringing value-added services to customers to help transform their digital business initiatives. Together with Ping, they sold and implemented into several enterprise accounts. They continuously go above and beyond to meet and exceed the complex requirements of some of our most strategic customers.&nbsp;</p> <p><br> The other award goes to <a href="https://versent.com.au/">Versent</a>, our 2020 International Channel Partner of the Year. Championing the needs of the enterprise customer while professionally partnering with vendors is the Versent way. Being customer-first was certainly true in 2020 when it came to our joint success, as Versent worked together with Ping's Asia-Pacific team to successfully migrate many customers, including FlyBuys, Service New South Wales and Land Services South Australia, to cloud-based identity solutions. Their commitment to partnering with Ping Teams and delivering quality, transformative digital solutions are the reasons why Versent is pivotal in accelerating the new era of intelligent identity access management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>DIDKit v0.1 pushed to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">GitHub</a> with its core features, <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/">documentation</a>, and interfaces intact.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> is a lightweight set of Rust libraries containing a command-line interface and an HTTP interface. Both interfaces expose the core Verifiable Credential-handling capabilities of Spruce’s <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi">ssi</a> library. Both ssi and didkit are being open-sourced this week to allow “early access” to the core source code, for review and consideration in advance of a substantial third-party audit.</p><p>But what exactly are “VC capabilities,” or for that matter, “DID capabilities”? Why is it so hard to find pluggable libraries that bring them to your&nbsp;project?</p> What is novel about&nbsp;DIDKit <p>Ambitious end-to-end DID/VC systems like the “agent frameworks” of the Hyperledger Aries project invite developers to build out a whole new kind of cloud architecture rather than integrating to today’s clouds, browsers, and enterprise ecosystems. This has channeled the energies of countless early adopters and experimenters and created a fascinating ecosystem, but it does not provide developers new to the space with architecturally un-opinionated, readily pluggable libraries.</p><p>Most other options are subtly locked to a specific blockchain and its particularities, which <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/primer">a self-sovereign identity (SSI) novice</a> is unlikely to notice until months into a project based on it. A <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-java">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/jsonld-common-java">open-source</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-spec-extensions">libraries</a> <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-common-dotnet/branches">exist</a> to sidestep this infrastructural lock-in, but these are more like primitives for assembling an SSI toolkit than ready-to-go, developer-friendly libraries. DIDKit, on the other hand, is ready to start processing real-world VCs with non-repudiable signatures right out the box. It’s licensed under Apache 2.0, and we will soon accept contributions under&nbsp;CLA.</p><p>Like most SSI systems that strive to be developer-friendly and performant above all else, we are tuning our projects to function optimally with one specific DID method: did:tz, which we are finalizing in parallel within the Tezos core developer ecosystem. We pride ourselves, however, on having built our module system in the most infrastructure-agnostic way possible, strictly conformant to the letter and the spirit of the DID core specifications.</p> DIDKit’s unique superpowers, and those of&nbsp;did:tz <p>This differs markedly from many wallets and SSI systems built for a specific blockchain ecosystem. Rather than conforming our core ssi libraries to the idiosyncrasies of did:tz and interpreting the core DID specifications accordingly, we designed the did:tz method to be the substrate for the most performant, formal verification friendly, and widely-interoperable verifiable data registry yet. We believe a DID method should organically earn traffic by being well engineered for important use cases, not by being in the right place at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>DIDKit, importantly, was designed to be modular and un-opinionated about anchoring and smart-contract-level concerns, at an arm’s remove from the did:tz design process. The core LD-Proof signing and verification engine that DIDKit wraps was designed from the beginning to work as securely and performantly as possible, regardless of which DID method drivers are compiled along with it or what kinds of DIDs and VCs it is consuming.</p><p>Our goal is for DIDKit to be a general-purpose, white-label engine at the core of almost any credential-handling data flow. We want it to be lightweight and flexible and performant enough for the widest possible range of contexts and topographies. This means that shell scripts, sysadmins, cross-application automations, and even web servers can start issuing verifiable W3C-conforming JSON-LD credentials to log events, store data, and send and receive signed, trustworthy messages.</p> Who needs this (and doesn’t know&nbsp;it) <p>If you’re new to SSI, and want to see close up how all the parts work, there’s no better way to get up to speed than building a prototype around DIDKit. DIDKit can be the server or command-line tool at the heart of your prototype, but you can also write a <a href="https://spruceid.dev/docs/didkit/example--core-functions-in-bash">batch generation script</a> in under a minute that gives you a huge corpus of dummy-data credentials to help you test or benchmark that prototype. And after you’re done building a working prototype, pop the hood and take a look at the inner workings, even if you’re new to cryptography and protocol-level work. (Don’t be scared off by it being written in Rust — anyone proficient in JavaScript should be able to parse it well enough, with a few <a href="https://www.codegram.com/blog/rust-for-js-developers/">pointers</a>.)</p><p>If it’s not a prototype you’re wrangling but a live, mission-critical legacy system, you are likely to prioritize flexibility. DIDKit, integrated via a Java or C foreign function interface, could be used to bring legacy systems and their data into the 21st century, seamlessly and reliably emitting VCs from deep in the racks of an on-premise mainframe or a server farm you need a security-clearance to&nbsp;patch.</p><p>More agile webs of “API businesses” and VC-powered marketplaces for services and cloud-native widgets have their own integration needs and dependency policies. DIDKit is lightweight enough to run on an IoT device, or in a microservice architecture, or in any number of next-generation API-to-API business contexts. Indeed, trustworthy and encrypted verifiable credentials might just be the quantum leap that enables a whole new level of cloud-native businesses, that can securely and confidentially process sensitive data in a zero-trust architecture.</p> Core Feature-set in&nbsp;v0.1 <p>DIDKit’s core feature-set is expanding steadily over time and we are committed to doing this development in the open, so feel free to engage with the repository directly on <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit/issues/new/choose">github</a>.

 OceanDAO — Round Two Deadline Approaching  Call for proposals and voting in OceanDAO — Round&nbsp;Two  Introduction <p>Hello Oceaners!</p><p>As the Web3 world continues to push the frontier of innovation, the protocols that can arrive at self-sustainability will be the robust cornerstones supporting this movement. Ocean Protocol’s vision of being the key to a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">self-sustainable</a> data economy continues. We’re excited to continue our community curated funding towards this future with OceanDAO Round&nbsp;2!</p><blockquote>OceanDAO is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community.</blockquote><p>Below will cover the Round 2 changes* and the OceanDAO&nbsp;process.</p><p>All subsequent information on Ocean’s community curated funding process and how to get involved can also be found with more detail on the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki">OceanDAO&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Learn more about OceanDAO Round One results&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-one-grant-results-c9e586ddb6a">here</a>.</p><p>Thank you to all of the participants, voters &amp; proposers. We are excited about the growth of Ocean Protocol in 2021 &amp;&nbsp;beyond!</p> Highlights  Proposals <p>OceanDAO Round Two proposal submission deadline is February 1, 2021, at midnight&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>Submit your proposal to the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-2/58">Round 2 forum</a> by the submission deadline by following the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Grant-Proposal-Template">proposal template&nbsp;guide</a>.</p><p>Upon deadline, proposals that meet the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/project-criteria">Project Criteria</a> (*minimum $OCEAN requirement lowered from 5000 to 2000 $OCEAN) will be migrated to the OceanDAO <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/oceandao">snapshot</a>, and a new voting ballot will be initiated.</p><p>The top nine highest voted grant proposals in Round Two (*increase from round one) will be selected to receive 10000 $OCEAN to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p><p>Funds will be disbursed to the grantees’ proposal wallet within 24 hours after voting&nbsp;ends.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas">Proposal Category&nbsp;Types</a>:</p><p>• Build / improve applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean</p><p>• Outreach / community (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)</p><p>• Unleash&nbsp;data</p><p>• Build / improve core Ocean&nbsp;software</p><p>• Improvements to OceanDAO (*new category)</p> Voting <p>Voting opens on Feb 2,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Vote with your OCEAN Tokens. 1 OCEAN = 1&nbsp;vote.</p><p>For your vote to count, you must have the OCEAN already in the non-custodial wallet you plan on voting with before the vote opens (before February 1 at 23:59 GMT). This is so your existing OCEAN balance can be counted. Voting from exchanges is not supported.</p><p>Your wallet address can only vote on one proposal. If you would like to vote on more than one proposal, you will need to fund your multiple wallet addresses with the respective amount of OCEAN before the voting&nbsp;opens.</p><p>You can only vote with the OCEAN tokens in your wallet. You will be unable to vote with OCEAN that is deposited as liquidity in Ocean Market, Bancor, or otherwise. It is your choice if you would like to remove liquidity, vote, and re-add the liquidity back later. Risks come with removing liquidity (impermanent loss, etc.). This is up to you to manage. We plan on addressing this in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Voting ends Feb 4, 2021, at 23:59&nbsp;GMT.</p> Future Rounds <p>Future OceanDAO Funding Rounds are monthly. We host a weekly <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/OceanDAO-Town-Hall">OceanDAO Town Hall</a> you can join to share and learn&nbsp;more!</p><p>• Project proposal due deadline: on the 1st day of the month at 23:59&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>• Voting wallet balance snapshot: on the 1st day of the month at 23:59&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>• Voting closes: 4th day of the month at 23:59&nbsp;GMT.</p><p>• Funding: funds are dispersed within 24h of voting&nbsp;ending.</p><p>In each round, there may be variations in: the amount of funding, # teams funded, and action steps themselves.

 The GiD Report#144 — How the Biden administration will reshape tech/crypto policy <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis.

Joe Biden is president of the United States of America — with the Democrats controlling the House and the Senate. In other words, this administration is set up to shape policy going forward during a period of accelerated change. Some leading/potential candidates: Photo: Gade&nbsp;Skidmore<p>Treasury Secretary — Janet&nbsp;Yellen</p><p>Really, the fact that Bitcoin and crypto were one of the first talking points for Yellen really says it all. And while initially taking an aggressive verbal stance, she quickly walked back her words to a more balanced position:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/janet-yellen-says-cryptocurrencies-are-a-concern-in-terrorist-financing">Yellen Calls Terrorist Financing Using Crypto a ‘Concern’ — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/janet-yellen-offers-senate-a-more-nuanced-take-on-crypto">Janet Yellen: Crypto Can ‘Improve’ Financial System — CoinDesk</a>  <p>SEC Chief — Gary&nbsp;Gensler</p><p>Gensler knows crypto — a focus of his teachings at MIT. He’s also known to be a bit of a regulatory cop who’s historically been tough on Wall Street — Elizabeth Warren is a big fan. The optimistic take is that he’ll bring plenty more clarity to the space in contrast to the uncertainty of the Clayton&nbsp;era.</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-old-foe-of-banks-could-be-wall-streets-new-top-cop-11610773211">An Old Foe of Banks Could Be Wall Street’s New Top&nbsp;Cop</a>  <p>OCC Chief — Michael&nbsp;Barr</p><p>Brian Brooks, who had a brief but impactful tenure, could be replaced by Barr.

					  Impacts on the Digital Identity Landscape in 2021 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the five years that OWI has analyzed the evolution of the Digital Identity Landscape, we’ve found innovation to be a consistent linchpin; a reliable indicator of what the future might hold. In 2020, though, the pandemic’s impact was unprecedented. It forced enterprises, institutions, and governments to transform, prioritizing Digital Identity and placing it squarely in the sights of investors and end-users alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than innovation, 2020 was the year of consolidation. Through the year, the rate of investment didn’t slow: a total of $247B was raised by 14,000 companies. The pandemic brought with it a need to offer a suite of Digital Identity offerings instead of a single solution or product. It created the potential for infinite regress in an already partnership-heavy market. Today, the market includes over 3,000 companies and is worth a staggering $210B, growing at a 19% CAGR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Digital Identity Landscape&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The OWI Digital Identity Landscape is a tool and framework we’ve developed to help provide an in-depth look at how Digital Identity applications are evolving and how intersections across solution segments are shaping next-generation strategies. Below is an example of one of the many framework overlays we use to assess the Landscape – click through the honeycombs to learn more about each segment. We will be publishing more landscape framework overlays and assessments throughout 2021.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Our unique honeycomb design provides a roadmap through the different solution segments within the space, showcasing not only their relationships and hierarchy but also identifying how they come together to address unique Digital Identity challenges.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These challenges can include data, technology, business models, or other issues that arise within Digital Identity. The design also helps to identify use cases that drive demand in the space. With this knowledge, companies can understand what technology is available, what solutions segments have become mission-critical, where investments are flowing, and the spaces that require more innovation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As with every year, our Digital Identity Landscape provides insight into a dramatically shifting industry. What’s unique about this year is the adoption of Digital Identity awareness, interest, and use cases from a largely secondary set of users: The consumer. It’s a shift that moves the importance of Digital Identity – including privacy and security – from the back rooms of corporate offices and into people’s homes. In the maturation process of the industry, it’s a seismic opportunity, providing the potential for new lines of businesses and opening entirely new markets for the right strategies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Consumer-Driven Demand For Digital Identity&nbsp; <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pandemic forced consumers and businesses alike to adopt more digital tools. This encouraged industry to improve procedures and make them easier for consumers to understand and handle. From the Landscape above, it’s clear that the adoption of Digital Identity tools has more room to grow in the form of digital credentials and eSignatures, Digital Identity Wallets, and Mobile Identity applications, among other segments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty of this trend is the lack of understanding, patience or time from the consumer side. The Digital Identity industry hasn’t done enough to quell many of these concerns. Take some of the most common issues identified within the consumer space:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Consumers feel the brunt of industry fragmentation. The average internet user in the US manages, on average,150 online accounts requiring a password, a number expected to double by 2022  Friction remains a massive problem. About 25% of all financial services applications are abandoned due to friction in the Know Your Customer (KYC) process, in part because current Identity Verification (IDV) procedures fail users  Consumers demand privacy and control. Nearly 80% of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about how companies use their data, according to a 2019 survey by Pew Research&nbsp;  The consumer education gap hasn’t narrowed. One in four consumers consider themselves uninformed about cybersecurity, while more than half say they could do more to protect their personal information online  Fraud and theft still exist. Identity theft and fraud cost 15.4 million consumers over $16 billion last year  <p>Two very important takeaways come from these consumer insights. First, consumers don’t want to have to pay to solve these problems. They don’t understand the issues involved and even fewer know the best way to circumnavigate the hurdles. It’s becoming a competitive advantage for enterprises that incorporate these fixes and solutions for the consumer, which led to a significant shift towards consolidation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it creates an opportunity for forward-thinking organizations that offer a way to solve these issues for the consumer, more directly. This moves the identification industry from one that has focused on B2B or B2B2C designs, to one that can operate in B2C as well. This shift has homed in on taking current tools and technologies and presenting them more for the at-home customer rather than building specific tools unique to a consumer.</p> &nbsp;  Areas That Shifted In 2020 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, Digital Identity continued to build on the shifts we have been charting since 2016. We’ve had the opportunity to measure the influence each segment has over its adjacent segments and refine our strategy offerings to more accurately predict trends. The result is a landscape with four new segments, mostly focused on cybersecurity, and a few consolidated segments, primarily centered in martech.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We often use our landscape framework to identify Golden Cog opportunities. These opportunities are extremely valuable as integrated partners because they are required to enable platform solutions. Golden Cogs can be found within the center of the framework (<a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/2019-identity-landscape/">learn more about our Golden Cog Methodology here</a>). We used our framework and Golden Cog Methodology to correctly predict the expanded influence of Identity Proofing, Identity Resolution, and Mobile Identity as Golden Cog opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve consolidated the Identity Graphing and Identity Resolution segments into one unit, as a result of an increase in consumer demands. This played out with companies like <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/deal-book/friday-dealbook-11-20-2020/">Experian acquiring Tapad</a>. While we remain very bullish on the Identity Resolution market (they remain a Golden Cog Opportunity, after all), the bulk of companies didn’t make the appropriate shifts this year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>COVID-19 also greatly impacted the landscape, as the world went from in-person to remote. Identity Proofing and Verification segments were the big winners on this front, shifting from enabling solutions within a stack, to becoming platform solutions of their own. &nbsp;Investors have supported this claim by buying into third-wave companies like Passbase, Persona, Berbix, and Veriff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the biggest movements this year occurred in the eSignature and Certs space, which shifted towards the Identity of Things solution segment. Certs, in particular, have an opportunity in the ID IoT platforms, which further prompted this move. Additionally, we saw an increase in the area of influence for Consent Management and Master Data Management platforms, splitting each of those out into their own segments, respectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Moving Through 2021 <p>&nbsp;</p><p>We expect to see many of these trends to continue through 2021. Expect consumer rights to expand, forcing companies to shift towards privacy-by-design, offering new opportunities for large B2C enterprises looking to enter the Digital Identity space. At the same time, Digital Identity companies will grow, merge, and acquire each other, forming integrated identity solutions instead of single point-solutions. To support this, private equity and strategic enterprises will continue investing in the space.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’re only at the beginning of this journey. There’s a lot of work to do, but one thing remains clear: The opportunity for those who focus on building Digital Identity products and services remains enormous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> If you would like a briefing on the landscape or learn more about how to use it for your own growth strategy, we want to hear from you! <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/contact-us/">Click here to get in touch.</a>
