<p>The state cabinet of Bihar is expected to approve a recent proposal that will make it the first state in India to use biometric technology in its upcoming rural polls in an effort to reduce voter fraud.</p>



  



<p>According to reporting by <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/bihar-set-to-use-biometric-tech-to-prevent-electoral-fraud-in-upcoming-rural-polls-for-first-time-in-country">Swarajya</a>, the proposal was the work of the region’s panchayati raj department — a grassroots system of local self-governed villages in the rural parts of India — and, if it is approved, the effort will take place over ten phases throughout October and November later this year.</p>



<p>Biometric authentication by way of a photograph and thumbprint will be used to verify the identities of voters before they are able to cast their vote, with any biometric data collected stored in the cloud in a central and permanent database.</p>



<p>In the case of any suspected fraudulent activity, voters will be required to further authenticate their identity using their government-issued Aadhaar card or other official identifying documents.</p>



<p>“This will lead to immediate detection of bogus or multiple voting,” said Bihar additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena. “For instance, if a voter goes to another booth to cast his vote after having already exercised his franchise in one, an immediate alert will be flashed.”</p>



<p>Concerns over the new system resulting in a prolonged voting process in Bihar’s rural areas where internet coverage is generally poor were dismissed by Meena, who noted that the biometric devices that will be used don’t require fast internet speeds.</p>



<p>The pilot project is expected to cost roughly $3.7 million (US), and will be conducted in a partnership with Broadcast Engineering Consultants India Limited, a public sector company. It is expected that if the project is deemed a success, it will be replicated to other polls in the state, with a possible expansion across the country in the future.</p>



<p>This is the latest example of India´s rapid adoption <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tablet-biometric-attendance-teachers-306144/">of biometric technology</a> at all government levels. While in this case the panchayat proposal represents a local embrace of the tech, the nation’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-supply-more-fingerprint-readers-aadhaar-032501/">massive Aadhaar program</a>, established in 2009, is the largest national digital registration program on the planet, with more than 1 billion ID holders.</p>

<p>The Czech Ministry of the Interior has officially begun issuing the country’s new citizen identity cards that feature a contactless chip that carries the biometric data of the cardholder.</p>



  



<p>The new cards — which were issued as of August 2nd — are a part of the effort to ensure that the Czech Republic is compliant with new European Union regulations that require member nations to introduce biometric data in their national ID cards, with the aim of the initiative being to make counterfeiting more difficult while increasing the ease of free movement between EU citizens and their family members.</p>



<p>“Identity cards will now be more secure and we will still be able to travel around Europe with them, without having to carry a passport,” Interior Minister Jan Hamáček said.</p>



<p>In a move that will likely appeal to some privacy advocates, the Ministry of the Interior has stated that biometric data will only be kept in the registration system’s database for a maximum of 90 days. Furthermore, while the data is stored in the Ministry’s system it can only be used to authenticate the cardholder’s identity when the cardholder is crossing state borders.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.expats.cz/czech-news/article/new-czech-citizen-s-id-cards-being-issued-with-biometric-data-on-a-contactless-chip">reporting from Expats</a>, had the new ID cards been issued without biometric data onboard, they would only be valid for use within the Czech Republic, and could not be used to travel between other EU member nations.</p>



<p>This move makes the Czech Republic the latest in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/guinea-uses-mosip-tech5-technology-new-national-id-program-062207/">rapidly growing list</a> of countries that are including biometric capabilities in their national ID programs. The use of contactless biometric chips in the cards is also a further indication of the increasing popularity of biometric smart cards, though the main area of growth for that market seems to have been in the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-argues-there-no-more-barriers-biometric-payment-cards-060205/">secure payments market</a> in recent months.</p>



<p>Though the new biometric ID cards are now officially rolling out, anyone with an older ID card will still be able to use it for several years more, possibly until August 3, 2031, when the most recently issued non-biometric cards expire. Older cards can be exchanged for the new ones, but the holder is subject to a fee if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>US Customs and Border Protection’s biometric border control program continues its expansion across the country. The Department of Homeland Security agency has announced that ‘Simplified Arrival’ is now operational at Kansas City International Airport (KCI).</p>



  



<p>Simplified Arrival uses facial recognition to match travelers to images from their official identity documents – namely passports and visas – replacing the manual screening process that would normally take place at the airport, or at land or sea border checkpoints. The CBP has been deploying its Simplified Arrival system across a growing network of airports, with the solution having recently landed in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbps-simplified-arrival-system-reaches-guam-062908/">Guam, Denver, and Honolulu</a>, among other locations.</p>



<p>The CBP says that since September of 2018, 86 million travelers have been processed through Simplified Arrival, and that the system has helped to catch nearly 850 imposters as they tried to illegally enter the United States using the identity documents of others.</p>



<p>The CBP initially embarked upon its biometric border screening project as a security effort, at least in part to fulfill a mandate from Congress to implement the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-to-expand-mandatory-biometric-border-screening-to-americans/">biometric screening of foreign nationals</a>. Security remains a key objective, but in announcing the KCI deployment, officials emphasized Simplified Arrival’s utility in streamlining passenger processing.</p>



<p>“Their technology continues to make arrival in Kansas City as fast and easy as possible, while giving travelers options,” said Kansas City Director of Aviation Pat Klein. “Simplified Arrival is quick and touchless with the CBP officer doing the work, and Mobile Passport Control still exists for travelers who wish to be more hands on.”</p>



<p>The CBP’s announcement also emphasized the sophistication of its technology and the privacy safeguards in place, perhaps to address the concerns of civil rights groups, such as the ACLU, that have voiced opposition to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-aclu-sues-government-agencies-over-use-facial-recognition-airports-031603/">the expansion of Simplified Arrival</a>.</p>



<p>“Simplified Arrival pairs one of the industry’s highest ranked facial comparison algorithms (as assessed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology) with trained CBP officers who are skilled at verifying the authenticity of travel documents,” the agency said, adding later that travelers are allowed to opt out of the biometric screening process, and that new photos of participating American citizens will be deleted within 12 hours.</p>

<p>We’ve been testing the Holo hosted version of Elemental Chat for two weeks now, and so far everything is working well. Most messages arrive quickly, even as new participants join and post messages.</p><blockquote>At time of writing, there are 245 participants who’ve posted 5405 messages in 94 channels!</blockquote><p>We are seeing some performance issues; messages sometimes take a while to arrive in the browser. But we knew we’d see things like this. What we are not seeing is big slowdowns as more people join and write more messages.</p><blockquote>The 245th participant is getting pretty much the same experience as the first. In fact, performance and reliability have been better than we expected so far.</blockquote> Speed improvements coming soon with sharding <p>Currently Holochain is operating in ‘full-sync’ mode, which means that every node gets every message. This is not that different from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain (except that there's no costly consensus step), and it means there’s still room to make things faster.</p><p>If you’ve followed the Holochain project for a while, you’ll know that this isn’t the final design. Holochain intends to become fast and cheap enough for everyday applications by splitting the data processing burden up into manageable chunks or ‘shards’ (also known as ‘neighbourhoods’) of participants. We call this rrDHT. (If you want to know more about how rrDHT works and why we built it, you can read this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/#rrdht-a-relaxed-agent-centric-distributed-hash-table">tech deep dive</a>.)</p><p>Once sharding is implemented in Holochain, we expect performance to be a lot faster, even as thousands of participants join. The good news is that this work is already complete and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">ready to be merged</a> and tested!</p> What’s next? <p>Elemental Chat is still in pre-release testing, and we should begin inviting the public to use it once the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a> starts. We’ve already been taking email addresses for pre-registration; <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">register</a> if you’d like to try it out too!</p><p>Once the Holochain team has finished testing sharding, it’ll be included in a new Holochain release, deployed on a small set of HoloPorts, and tested by our pre-release testers. Once it passes that round of testing, it’ll be deployed on all HoloPorts.</p> Holochain v0.0.102 released (breaking changes) <p>Holochain has seen another update. The biggest item is a breaking change for validation callbacks: the <code>must_get_*</code> host functions have finally landed, which means <code>get</code> and friends can no longer be used in validation callbacks. You can read more about this change in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-holo-networks/#breaking-changes-in-develop-decryption-function-and-must_get">last Dev Pulse</a>.</p><p>Holochain now compiles on Windows too! Damien, a hApp developer and Holo alumnus, contributed a patch that fixes a compatibility bug in the Lair keystore. You can now use the Windows-native Rust toolchain to build Holochain and your DNAs. This doesn’t mean we’re officially supporting Windows yet, but it does look like you can use it as your primary development OS now.</p><p>There are also some performance improvements, bug fixes, and added/changed conductor API endpoints. Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.102/CHANGELOG.md#holochain-00102">changelog</a> for details.</p> What’s next?   <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834#pullrequestreview-721386771">Sharding code</a> is finished and being tested. I expect there’ll be a bit of performance tuning and bug fixing before it’s released, but the core dev team is planning to include it in release v0.0.103.  The HDK is about to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/886">parallelise</a> all sorts of expensive functions — getting entries, getting links, and making zome calls to other peers, zomes, and cells. This should make those functions a lot faster if there’s a lot to do — no more looping over calls in serial. This is already in <code>develop</code> and should be included in the next release as well.  The HDK is also about to support <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/868">countersigning as a built-in feature</a>. This set of host functions and entry types will abstract away the complexity that makes countersigning difficult to do well. At first you’ll need to solicit and gather countersignatures in your code, either synchronously or asynchronously, but eventually there will be affordances to make this process even simpler. The first iteration will likely come in the release after sharding.   Thanks to Documentation Drive participants! <p>I’m grateful to everyone who joined in the community-led Holochain Documentation Drive.

More about that&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">here</a>.</p> On Governance <p>Governance is a seemingly innocuous term, one that can seem to mean everything and nothing simultaneously. According to Alain Deneault in “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20822679-gouvernance">Gouvernance — Le Management Totalitaire</a>”, the word governance evolved in 15th century France, with the meaning of “behaving well”. Its meaning and use has been appropriated in different ways over time and today is a term that we tend to associate with ‘those in power’. It seems lofty and authoritative, rather than a question for all of us, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Over the last year, we’ve looked at what it means to consider governance not as something separate to our day-to-day, but as a system of many interconnected parts — from individual behaviours to organising systems to structural deep codes — which together make up how we collectively behave. The question is: how can all of those interconnected parts work together towards a just, livable future? Not in theboardroom but everywhere, every&nbsp;day.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll share some of the headline factors that we notice to play a key role in a system of governance. We’ll explore how these are connected to many other parts, and invite you to consider how they show up in your own setting. The factors we focus on here are accountability, responsibility, risk-holding, power and autonomy.</p><p>We are finding that looking at how these factors are balanced and distributed across a system can help to reveal how (in)justly and/or (in)effectively governance might play out in a system, enabling us to see more clearly the parts that are connected and how these could show up in a different way.</p><p>Balance: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability in one&nbsp;actor</p><p>The understandings we apply when we use those terms&nbsp;are:</p>  Power ‒ the ability to shape conditions  Autonomy ‒ the freedom to do things in a way that you deem&nbsp;fit  Responsibility ‒ the burden/ability to take&nbsp;action  Accountability ‒ the burden to justify your&nbsp;approach  Risk-holding — bearing consequences of the&nbsp;results  <p>Power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability show up as distinct, but deeply interconnected factors in a system that provide balance to one another. Power and autonomy, we might consider as enablers — factors that convey ability, ease and freedom. Accountability and risk-holding, we might consider as burdens — factors that place an onus on the actor (noting that this language just tries to convey whether the factor creates a freedom/ability or an onus; an enabling factor can still feel or be perceived as a burden and burdens may be embraced as an enabler, gift or honour). Responsibility can be both an enabler or/and a burden — it might be a freedom I choose to exercise; it might involve duties/actions that I need to fulfil. Where we experience an imbalance between the enablers and the burdens that actors may hold in a system, we see an environment conducive to corruption, inefficacy and/or injustice; conditions that erode trust and indeed our collective belief in that&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, I might have the power to shape the outcome of, say, a COVID-19 procurement process, without risk-holding or accountability for the outcome ‒ this would be an imbalance in governance, in a way that allows for the prioritisation of personal interests over collective benefit.</p>An imbalance in governance conducive to corruption<p>Or I might have responsibility to, say, support somebody to secure work, without autonomy to provide that support in a way that I think would be genuinely effective and tailored to them. This would create a form of imbalance in governance which results in the loss of potential in my ability to innovate and improve things, resulting in that as a system we lose the chance to learn and&nbsp;grow.</p>An imbalance in governance undermining creativity and innovation<p>As someone facing illness, I might bear the consequences (risk-holding) of a failing health system, with minimal power or autonomy to influence whether I can receive the treatment that I need; an imbalance of governance leading to injustice.</p>An imbalance in governance leading to injustice<p>Conversely, when these factors come into balance, we can see how more fair, creative, effective and just conditions can become possible.</p><p>For example, where I have responsibility to design a programme intended for collective benefit, and also autonomy to do it in the way I see is best, I can innovate freely and bring my creativity and understanding to the challenge. This position may give me power in that system (ability to shape conditions). Where I also have risk-holding (I will directly bear consequences of negative results) and also accountability for the approach that I take, I am likely to consider risks and take informed and responsible directions. Thus, where I have a balance of power, responsibility, autonomy, risk-holding and accountability in a system, I am most likely to be able to take customised approaches that care for efficacy and plausibility of the&nbsp;result.</p>A state of balance for full&nbsp;agency<p>Distribution: the balance of power, autonomy, responsibility, risk-holding and accountability between&nbsp;actors</p><p>We also need to consider how these governance factors out between actors in a&nbsp;system.</p><p>Let us consider this in the context of an imagined charitable structure, for example, to help to illustrate what we mean by distribution. This table tries at a very headline and rough level to map out how power, accountability, power, autonomy and responsibility might lie across different actors in an example&nbsp;case.</p> Example of how governance might show up in a Charity by&nbsp;role <p>Power is spread somewhat across this structure but has particular accumulation in actors such as Trustees and senior executives. If these actors are not also the people who the charity is set up to support, we might find a scenario where power is concentrated in people who are furthest from the specifics and realities of the matter. Risks, meanwhile, may have a certain spread across the system, but since charities are by nature set up to support people who are already holding risks in the wider system — risks which can be exacerbated in the case of malfunction by the charity — the highest risk-holding may well be held by people that the charity is set up to support. Indeed, this may be more the case where that charity provides a critical function to people (for example, if a food bank is mismanaged and a result is that I can’t access food that I need, the consequences I bear could be significant. If a sports charity is mismanaged and my sports class is cancelled, the direct consequences to me might be disappointing but less&nbsp;severe).</p><p>When we look at the balance and distribution of governance in this structure we might consider:</p>  How can we better distribute the power across the system so that those closest to the details and specifics of the matter have the most power to shape direction and execution?  How can we design the system so that risk held by people who the charity is set up to support is reduced or mitigated, and more evenly&nbsp;spread?  <p>These are questions that nowadays charities are often expected to address in their fundamental governance set-up. What is clear is that trying to truly address these imbalances requires more than just some tweaks to the existing structure. Indeed, if the structure in place exists within the logic of traditional line management, rank and the bounded division of duties, this imbalance is coded into the architecture.</p><p>And yet, when we think about the huge transition that we have ahead of us for a just livable future to be possible, it is clear that we need to unleash the agency of every one of us to be able to take on responsibility, create with autonomy, be accountable, to take on risks and assume power — each uniquely, in ways that we determine — towards that&nbsp;future.</p><p>So if this rebalance in governance is critical and we truly want to address it, what sort of questions do we start to consider?</p><p>You might, say, start with a review at the structure of the organisation, starting perhaps with the Trustee Board, which — rather than holding a function of strategy and decision-making — could play a more valuable role as a governance auditor for the system. They could hold to account the integrity of the organisation’s governance to its mission, auditing the balance of power, accountability, autonomy, responsibility and risk-holding in the organisation and whether the organising methods are appropriate for&nbsp;it.</p><p>This would allow the strategic decision-making of the organisation to be concentrated in people closest to the questions they need to make decisions about. These people may be supported with information, protocols &amp; considerations from a central team. Rather than ‘line managers’, central teams could actively work to compound learning within the ecosystem and across other partners and actors; who navigate the necessary compliance and regulation that the organisation sits within; and who actively consider how we carve pathways towards justice in the way that they approach the day to day&nbsp;work.</p><p>As we begin to unravel the traditional lines of fixed hierarchy, we start to consider what this means for how we approach pay. We begin to question what pay rewards or incentivises or what function it plays in a system. By linking pay to rank in a system we create a series of incentives to accumulate power and responsibility in a system even where it may not be our place; when we start to unpack this and<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/Framing-Provocation-Reimagining-the-Wage-1d2140e1fb1d42efa55a00cd3bbd2f57"> reimagine its role</a> it reveals questions about fairness, purpose, process, market norms, regulation and more for us to work&nbsp;through.</p><p>Decision-making, in turn, becomes a critical question, requiring us to reimagine who can take decisions and by which process in this more distributed system.</p><p>And as we start to think about shifting the processes, mechanisms and structures across an organisation or system, we quickly begin to reveal the deep codes that shape the scope of that change. The regulation, which — for example — prescribes what work a charity can engage in and the way that it must be reported and assessed. Accounting, which invites us to consider our financial progress according to profit and reserves rather than the value created for different actors in the system. Contract Law, Intellectual Property and many other codes that shape and constrain how and where we can reimagine how we show&nbsp;up.</p><p>Meanwhile, our charity does not exist in a vacuum, but rather in response to existing issues that often sit at a larger socioeconomic level. The weaker the collective infrastructure, the more risk is concentrated in particular individuals in a system. Having in place social infrastructure from universal healthcare, universal mental healthcare and universal basic income, can significantly mitigate the risk-holding that falls on individual shoulders. We begin to touch upon socioeconomic questions and what infrastructure we need to really enable a balanced governance in our&nbsp;systems.</p><p>This invites us to look at our mental models, narratives and our behaviours in this system, particularly the mental models that have underpinned structural systems of oppression — of class, gender, sexuality, health, race, ethnicity and more — that fundamentally undermine a chance at real justice. These might be mental models and narratives of stratification, white supremacy, extraction, command, control and separation.</p><p>Structural (and intergenerational) privilege facilitates actors to have more time, capacity, confidence, trust and safety, all of which in turn enable a person to accumulate (and sometimes hoard) power, autonomy, responsibility in a system over time. These inequalities aren’t just linear, but also geological; they are not behind us, they are embedded in the layers of rocks we are standing&nbsp;on.</p><p>All of these factors heavily shape the frameworks within which individual choices and their implications are shaped, all in different ways for each of us. Despite the constraints, human history is a story of constant resistance, re-imagination and reform. We can make the commitments — each in our own ways — to step into power (even where it is not welcomed), to step away from power (especially when it is not deserved), to hold oneself accountable (including when not externally mandated), to exert autonomy (including when not permissioned) and to take on or to mitigate&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Whatever the approach, one of the key threads through our enquiry is that how we show up at a personal level deeply influences how these patterns in governance shift, be that interrogating our mental models, conditions, trends, behaviours; embracing rest, joy, celebration, love; resisting, reimagining, committing and/or persisting.</p> About Beyond the&nbsp;Rules <p>In researching these question in #BeyondtheRules over the last year, we have been humbled to speak to individuals, groups and people from social organisations, movements, grantmaking bodies and others who have gradually been unpicking these questions — shifting the way they approach pay, incorporated lived experience into their decision making, taken a more distributed approach to power and accountability, reimagined the grantmaking relationship, campaigned for regulatory reform and more. Individuals and groups that, by acutely focusing on one piece of the jigsaw or looking holistically at many, have been moulding the forces at&nbsp;play.</p><p>As a group of partners in this project, we have been seeking to unravel and make sense of the interconnections between the many factors at play and how they interact, their histories and stories, who is working on them and what they are learning&nbsp;. We are currently writing up our findings to share with the hope that it might add a brick to the collective deep democratising that we need&nbsp;ahead.</p> Reflection: governance in your&nbsp;setting <p>As you head into this time over August, a period where you might have the ability to step back and listen more deeply, to breathe and have moments of silence, we invite you to reflect on some questions with us in relation to the governance in your own settings, wherever these may be (although we should note that these questions are more tailored to social organisations, movements or grantmakers than, say, public services):</p><p>On risk-holding, accountability and&nbsp;power:</p>  Who faces risks and who accrues benefits in the work that you&nbsp;do?  What type of consequences, and to what&nbsp;degree?  Who is currently asked to justify their approach and who is&nbsp;not?  <p>Bear in mind that risk-holders and accountable actors in these situations may bear consequences affecting various factors, such as physical health, mental health, finances/wealth, relationships and social capital, time and energy, reputation, and/or current and future opportunities. They may be human or non-human actors, present-day or in the&nbsp;future.</p>  How (and how much) do structural factors (relating e.g. to regulation, social security, the economic market etc) influence how risk manifests in your&nbsp;system?  How much is within your system’s scope to influence?  What does it really mean for there to be a balance between who shapes the conditions of your work and who bears the potential consequences of&nbsp;it?  <p>Consider how these questions leak into wider structural matters and how you are incorporating these factors into your work. Where are you focusing your sites of influence and are you thinking about how all of the issues interconnect.</p><p>Look to dig into ideas with curiosity. For example, somebody bearing consequences of a system may not always be well placed to have power over all parts of an action that affects them. For instance, I as a patient would bear the consequences of a poorly executed medical procedure, however it does not mean that I should carry out the procedure myself. I would, however, want to be free to decide whether I wanted that procedure, and would want to be able to trust that the person carrying it out has the sufficient knowledge and expertise to do it. I might also want patients like me to have been involved at some point in shaping some of the processes itself.</p><p>Where direct representation might not be possible, why is this (/has this been) the case, and what are the checks and balances needed to how conditions are&nbsp;shaped?</p><p>When thinking about representation, consider that groups of people are not homogenous. A woman can adopt a patriarchal ideology. A person of colour can internalise or even uphold ideas of white supremacy. A gay cis man can be unaware of his transphobia as much as anybody else outside the 2SLGBTQ+ umbrella. A working class person can be convinced to see immigrants as the economic problem in their country. So when we consider the important role of lived experience in governance, we can also ensure that decisions are shaped by people who bear or have borne consequences as well as the insights relating to the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>On responsibility and autonomy:</p>  How much autonomy is given to corresponding types of responsibility?  How do you pay people for the types of responsibility taken? Does (if so, how?) structural privilege link to the roles that you reward the&nbsp;most?  What other benefits do different people accrue as a result of the types of responsibility they hold (reputational, benefits, networks, opportunities…?)  <p>People will likely have different types of responsibility that they hold. When you hold a meeting, who takes minutes, who makes coffee, who sets the agenda. Who holds responsibility for the overall integrity of the work. Who takes responsibility to communicate, to make relationships.</p><p>Reflect on how different types of responsibilities are incentivised or rewarded and how systems of oppression may influence the frameworks of choice that we have when considering to take on these different types.</p><p>If you can, draw what you see. Step into it. Embody it, or depict it. What comes to you as the fundamental changes that you may need to be considering. What do you see and&nbsp;feel?</p><p>After a year looking at ways that many people have approached answering these kinds of questions, we are excited to share with you some of our findings and to hear what is coming up for&nbsp;you.</p><p>We will be hosting a conversation on 2nd September at 2pm (UTC+1) to share more and to invite your contributions; we hope that you can join us. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/beyond-the-rules-open-house-tickets-166296690879">Quick registration here</a></p><p>This blog was authored by Annette Dhami with support from Thomas Theodore, Himanshu Rohilla and Jonathan Lapalme of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> (graphics by Sharmada Nagarajan) with the input and support from Natalie Creary of <a href="http://blackthrive.org/">Black Thrive</a>,<a href="https://www.yorkmcn.org/"> Catherine Scott of York MCN</a>,<a href="https://www.demsoc.org/"> Alex Zur-Clark of Democratic Society</a> and Joe Doran of<a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/"> Lankelly&nbsp;Chase</a>.</p>

<p>The government of Liberia is hoping to have a biometric voter registration system in place for its General Election in 2023. To that end, the country recently sent a delegation to Nigeria to consult with that country’s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>



  



<p>The leader of the Liberian delegation was National Elections Commission (NEC) chairperson Davidetta Brown-Lasanah. The other members were Floyd Oxly Sayor and James Dogbey. The former is the Chairperson for Liberia’s 2023 election, while the latter is the agency’s Director of Information Technology. The three-person team spent four days with the INEC in Abuja, Nigeria.</p>



<p>The INEC introduced biometric voting technology back in 2015, and has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/archive/nigerias-inec-satisfied-with-new-voting-systems-23156/">boasted about the success of the program</a> despite some <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/archive/nigerias-new-voting-technology-endures-bumpy-rollout-23103/">hiccups with the initial rollout</a>. The meeting with NEC-Liberia was aimed at advancing the interests of the Regional ECOWAS Network of Electoral Commissions (ECONEC), which encourages member states to share electoral knowledge and resources with other countries in the region. The goal was to ensure that all 15 members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would have the ability to run safe and fair elections.</p>



<p>To that end, the Liberian Elections Management Body has expressed interest in a biometric voter registration system. The organization is hoping to conduct a pilot, and has indicated that it could use technology similar to the technology that the INEC is using in Nigeria.</p>



<p>The trip took place almost a year after the Executive Director of&nbsp;Liberia’s National Identification Registry (NIR)&nbsp;asked the government to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/liberian-id-agency-seeks-funding-expand-biometric-program-091407/">set aside more funds</a> to improve the country’s biometric registration capabilities. Several African countries have now <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ipsidy-zimbabwe-election-503162/">conducted successful elections</a> with biometric registration tech, though some of the limitations of biometric systems were exposed after <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-voter-machines-fail-after-ugandan-president-shuts-down-internet-during-election-011407/">voting machines failed</a> when the Ugandan President shut down the country’s internet during an election earlier this year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.snowsoftware.com/">Snow Software</a> has released a new report that suggests that many large organizations simply do not care much about cybersecurity. <a href="https://www.snowsoftware.com/blog/study-hybrid-work-here-stay-bringing-its-own-mix-complexities">According to the company’s survey</a>, only 40 percent of IT professionals identify cybersecurity as a primary concern for their organization, placing it behind considerations like competitive differentiation (57 percent), reducing IT costs (55 percent), and digital transformation initiatives (54 percent).</p>



  



<p>That remains true despite the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/forgerock-breaches-involving-passwords-shot-up-450-percent-061401/">significant uptick in cyberattacks and breaches</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic. In that regard, the Snow survey is somewhat alarming because it indicates that large businesses are so focused on growth that they are refusing to <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/yubico-finds-covid-19-encouraged-more-businesses-adopt-mfa-security-practices-042804/">take the steps necessary to prevent security breaches</a>, even when resources are made available for IT improvements. The vast majority (84 percent) of the respondents believe that they will get a budget increase. However, they would prefer to spend that money on hiring IT staff (37 percent), Software-as-a-Service applications (18 percent), and cloud infrastructure (17 percent), with only 10 percent indicating that they would like to invest more money in cybersecurity tools and training.</p>



<p>That suggests that many businesses are being quite cavalier with the information in their possession. Unfortunately, that finding is <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/many-organizations-not-prepared-phishing-ransomware-attacks-report-071204/">consistent with other reports</a> that indicate that businesses have been <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/survey-data-details-ongoing-reliance-on-weak-password-security-050304/">slow to update their cybersecurity posture</a>.</p>



<p>Having said that, the Snow survey does show that businesses are at least willing to support the new hybrid work environment. Thirty-four percent of the respondents listed it as their biggest priority for the next 12 months, with 35 percent already offering a hybrid system and another 57 percent planning to&nbsp;make the leap. Forty-four percent also believe that the future of work is remote, insofar as they believe the implementation of a remote system is a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>Some respondents are worried that new technology purchases will cause unforeseen disruptions to workflows and corporate infrastructure, though those IT concerns do not seem to be slowing the rate of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/digital-transformation-in-the-enterprise-month-covid-19s-impact-909109/">digital transformation</a>. The findings in the actual survey are based on the responses of 400 IT leaders from organizations with more than 500 employees.</p>

  <p>ASP.NET Web Forms framework has been the cornerstone technology of .Net for web development since the release of .Net Framework in 2002. ASP.NET Web Forms includes a layer of abstraction for developers so that you don’t need to care about HTML, JavaScript, or any other front-end technology. It provides a development flow similar to building desktop apps, a way for developers to build a web page by drag and drop, an event-driven programming model, and stateful controls thanks to the built-in state management. These features incurred lots of complexity, but it was worthwhile when web development was still in its infancy.</p>

<p>Web development has evolved a lot in recent years. Browsers have become more powerful and implement various standards that allow access to users’ devices. Client-side frameworks such as React and Angular simplify client-side development and have become increasingly popular. These frameworks and other benefits are available only if you can write the front-end JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Maintaining the back end and front end in two different languages comes with a cost. There isn’t much code reuse, tools and frameworks are different, and it’s challenging to keep up with constantly evolving technologies.</p>

 Introduction to Blazor 

<p>WebAssembly and <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> come into play to address the challenge of managing front-end and back-end development effectively. WebAssembly is a new open standard of byte code for the Web that runs in every modern browser. Blazor is a C# based client-side UI framework that runs directly in the browser via WebAssembly. It can also run on the server-side and process user interaction over a real-time connection with the browser.</p>

<p>Blazor and ASP.NET Web Forms have a lot in common: They are both component-oriented, event-driven, and provide a stateful programming model. If you are an ASP.NET Web Forms developer, Blazor will feel familiar.</p>

<p>In this article, I will describe how to migrate a simple ASP.NET Web Forms project to Blazor.</p>

<p>To continue, you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Overview of the Web Forms Project 

<p>The project that I will migrate is a simple web app where I can track my daily intake of calories and calories burned by exercise. The project looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Web Forms markup and underlying code looks like this:</p>

   <code>&lt;asp:Content ID="BodyContent" ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server"&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
 &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
   &lt;h1&gt;Daily consumed and burned calories&lt;/h1&gt;
   &lt;br/&gt;
   Showing data for:

         &lt;/ItemTemplate&gt;
       &lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
       &lt;asp:CommandField ShowDeleteButton="True"&gt;
         &lt;ItemStyle Width="100px" HorizontalAlign="Center"&gt;&lt;/ItemStyle&gt;
       &lt;/asp:CommandField&gt;
     &lt;/Columns&gt;
   &lt;/asp:GridView&gt;
   
   &lt;h3&gt;Total Consumed: &lt;asp:Label runat="server" ID="totalConsumedLabel" &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt; Total Burned: &lt;asp:Label runat="server" ID="totalBurnedLabel" &gt;&lt;/asp:Label&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

</code>   

<p>Now, let’s migrate the project to Blazor. First, I will create a new Blazor project.</p>

 Create a Blazor Project 

<p>Fire up Visual Studio, create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project, select Blazor App, and click Next. Name the app CaloriesTracker.Blazor and click Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the next window, select Blazor Server App. Now, click Create, and Visual Studio will create a new server-side Blazor project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new blazorserver -o CaloriesTracker.Blazor
</code>   

<p>Blazor Server hosts Razor components on the server in an ASP.NET Core app and handles UI updates over a SignalR connection. The Blazor runtime sends events from browser to server and applies UI updates to the components that the server sends back. This strategy is similar to the approach used by the ASP.NET AJAX <code>UpdatePanel</code> control that handles partial page updates in response to trigger events. The main difference is that Blazor Server maintains an active connection to the server, and all the UI state stays on the server instead of <code>ViewState</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s see what you get when you create a new project:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Since the Blazor Server is hosted in the ASP.NET Core project, <code>Startup.cs</code> and <code>Program.cs</code> serve the same purpose. Specifically, <code>Startup.cs</code> configures services and the app’s request pipeline. The Pages folder contains <code>_Host.cshtml</code>, which hosts the Blazor app. The <code>razor</code> files in the Pages folder are the Blazor pages that comprise the app. Similarly, the Shared folder contains shared layouts such as the app’s main layout and reusable components such as the navigation menu. You can think of <code>MainLayout.razor</code> as a <code>Site.Master</code> file in the WebForms project and <code>NavMenu.razor</code> as some <code>ascx</code> component.</p>

<p>Click F5 in Visual Studio or run <code>dotnet run</code> to run the project. You should see:</p>

<p>NewProject Run</p>

<p>Next, I will migrate Entity Framework Core configuration and <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> to the Blazor project.</p>

 Migrate Entity Framework Core to Blazor 

<p>Migrating non-UI-related code is pretty straightforward. I will use SQLite in the Blazor project, too, so first, add the necessary package to the project:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
</code>   

<p>Now, copy the <code>Model.cs</code> file from the WebForms project to the Data folder in the Blazor project. Next, I need to create an initial migration and apply the migration, so I will run:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef database update
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
</code>   

<p>This code creates CaloriesTracker.db database in the root of the folder.</p>

<p>Finally, copy <code>CaloriesTrackerService.cs</code> to the Data folder as well. The code works without making any changes to it, but I will go ahead and use C# 8.0 syntax to save a couple of lines:</p>

   <code>public class CaloriesTrackerService
{
    public List&lt;Food&gt; GetFood()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Food.ToList();
    }

    public List&lt;Exercise&gt; GetExercises()
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        return caloriesContext.Exercises.ToList();
    }

    public void AddFood(int foodId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary()
        { 
            AddedAt = date, 
            FoodId = foodId 
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void AddExercise(int exerciseId, DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();

        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Add(new CalorieDiary
        {
            AddedAt = date,
            ExerciseId = exerciseId
        });

        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public void DeleteRecord(int id)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Remove(new CalorieDiary { Id = id });
        caloriesContext.SaveChanges();
    }

    public List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; GetDailyList(DateTime date)
    {
        using var caloriesContext = new CaloriesContext();
        var list = caloriesContext.CalorieDiaries.Where(diary =&gt; diary.AddedAt == date)
                        .Include(d =&gt; d.Food).Include(d =&gt; d.Exercise)
                        .OrderByDescending(diary =&gt; diary.Id).ToList();

    return list;
    }
</code>   

<p>Finally, I will register <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code> with the DI in <code>Startup.cs</code>. In the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method add the following line:</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton&lt;CaloriesTrackerService&gt;();
</code>   

<p>Now you are ready to migrate the UI portion of the project to Blazor.</p>

 Migrate Web Forms Markup to Blazor 

<p>First, right-click on the Pages folder, click Add, select Razor Component and call it <code>CaloriesTracking</code>. You can also create the page by running:</p>

<p><code>dotnet new razorcomponent -n CaloriesTracking -o Pages</code></p>

<p>The top section of the page will contain the markup for this page, and the <code>@code</code> section contains the code that handles events of various components on the page.</p>

<p>Now, add a <code>@page</code> directive at the top of the component, set URL to caloriestracking, and inject an instance of <code>CaloriesTrackerService</code>:</p>

   <code>@page "/caloriestracking"
@using CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Data
@inject CaloriesTrackerService CaloriesTrackerService
</code>   

<p>Next, add the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component to the menu in <code>NavMenu</code> component:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="@NavMenuCssClass" @onclick="ToggleNavMenu"&gt;
  &lt;ul class="nav flex-column"&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="" Match="NavLinkMatch.All"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-home" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Home
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="caloriestracking"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-plus" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Calories Tracker
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Run <code>dotnet watch run</code> in a command shell and navigate to the page by clicking on Calories Tracker in the navigation menu. Leave the app running, and every time you save a file, the app rebuilds, and the browser reloads the page.</p>

<p>Go back to the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> file and add the following markup:</p>

   <code>@if (!initialized)
{
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Food&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddFoodValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.FoodId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in food)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-md-6"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Add Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="addItemModel" OnValidSubmit="@HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit"&gt;
        Select Food:
        &lt;InputSelect @bind-Value="addItemModel.ExerciseId" style="width: 150px"&gt;
        @foreach (var value in exercises)
            {
            &lt;option value="@value.Id"&gt;@value.Name&lt;/option&gt;
            }
        &lt;/InputSelect&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-secondary"&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>In the code section, add the following code:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();

    initialized = true;
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, DateTime.Today);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(DateTime.Today);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s go through the markup and the code. First, check if the data has been loaded. If data hasn’t loaded, display a Loading text in the browser.</p>

<p>Once the list of foods and exercises loads, the markup renders two forms: a food intake form and an exercise form. Both forms display a <code>select</code> element that shows items from a list of foods or exercises. The <code>select</code> value is bound to either the <code>addItemModel.FoodId</code> or the <code>addItemModel.ExerciseId</code> property using the <code>bind-Value</code> attribute. Both forms are bound to the <code>addItemModel</code> model, and when the form is submitted, it will invoke either the <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> or the <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> method.</p>

<p>The <code>OnInitialized</code> method runs when the component initializes, and I use it to load data for the food and exercise elements. If you need to perform asynchronous initialization, override the <code>OnInitializedAsync</code> method instead. After the data is loaded, and <code>initialized</code> is set to true, Blazor will re-render the component. The <code>HandleAddFoodValidSubmit</code> and <code>HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit</code> methods handle the form submission and saving of the selected food or exercise items to the database. Switch to the browser, and you should see the two select boxes:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, let’s add a grid to show the records from the database and switch between different dates. Add the following markup at the start of the <code>else</code> code block:</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Daily consumed and burned calories&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    &lt;EditForm Model="@changeDateModel" OnValidSubmit="@FilterByDate"&gt;
    Showing data for:
    &lt;InputDate @bind-Value="changeDateModel.FilterDate" /&gt;
    &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Show&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/EditForm&gt;

    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;

    @if (dailyList.Count != 0)
    {
    &lt;table class="table"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;Calories&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        @foreach (var item in dailyList)
        {
            &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(item.Exercise?.Name ?? item.Food.Name)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;@(-item.Exercise?.Calories ?? item.Food.Calories)&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;&lt;button @onclick="@(e =&gt; DeleteRecord(item.Id))" class="btn btn-danger"&gt;Delete&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Total Consumed: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Food?.Calories) Total Burned: @dailyList.Sum(d =&gt; d.Exercise?.Calories)&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        &lt;h3&gt;No Records Found&lt;/h3&gt;
    }
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The EditForm shows input for selecting a date, and the grid renders the records returned from the database. Just like the other forms, it is bound to <code>changeDateModel.FilterDate</code>, and the <code>FilterByDate</code> method loads data from the database:</p>

   <code>private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>When you click the Delete button in the grid, the <code>DeleteRecord</code> method will receive the ID of the record that you want to delete:</p>

   <code>private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}
</code>   

<p>The final code for the <code>CaloriesTracking</code> component looks like this:</p>

   <code>private bool initialized = false;

private List&lt;Food&gt; food;
private List&lt;Exercise&gt; exercises;
private List&lt;CalorieDiary&gt; dailyList;

AddItemModel addItemModel = new AddItemModel();
ChangeDateModel changeDateModel = new ChangeDateModel { FilterDate = DateTime.Today };

protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    food = CaloriesTrackerService.GetFood();
    exercises = CaloriesTrackerService.GetExercises();
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);

    initialized = true;
}

private void DeleteRecord(int id)
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.DeleteRecord(id);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void FilterByDate()
{
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
}

private void HandleAddFoodValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddFood(addItemModel.FoodId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.FoodId = -1;
}

private void HandleAddExerciseValidSubmit()
{
    CaloriesTrackerService.AddExercise(addItemModel.ExerciseId, changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    dailyList = CaloriesTrackerService.GetDailyList(changeDateModel.FilterDate);
    addItemModel.ExerciseId = -1;
}

class AddItemModel
{
    public int FoodId { get; set; }
    public int ExerciseId { get; set; }
}

class ChangeDateModel
{
    public DateTime FilterDate { get; set; }
}

<p>Go back to the browser, and you should be able to track your calories:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that I have finished migrating the code from WebForms to Blazor, I will secure the app so that no one except me knows how much sweets I eat 😃.</p>

 Securing Your Blazor Application 

<p>In this tutorial, I will use Okta to quickly secure the API in order not to have to roll my own identity provider and deal with all the tricky details. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, and all OpenID Connect flows out of the box. These features take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>I will use <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> to manage my Okta account and register a new application for this project.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta start</code> if you don’t have an Okta account, or run <code>okta login</code> if you already have one.</p>

<p>Once you configure Okta CLI with your account, run <code>okta apps create</code> to create a new Okta application. I will use CaloriesTracker again as the name of the app.</p>

<p>On the Type of Application step, enter 1 to select Web, and on the next step, enter 4 for Other.</p>

<p>I will use <code>https://localhost:44360/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the suggested URL for Post Logout Redirect URI for the redirect URI. When you hit enter, the Okta CLI creates a new app and saves the configuration to your home directory in <code>.okta.env</code> file:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go back to Visual Studio and add <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Next, open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file, add a new section <code>Okta</code> below the <code>Logging</code> section, and put in your app’s details. Copy <code>clientId</code> and <code>clientSecret</code> from the <code>.okta.env</code>:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this code in <code>ConfigureServices</code> method:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
})
.AddCookie()
.AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
{
    OktaDomain = Configuration["Okta:Domain"],
    ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"],
    ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"]
});
</code>   

<p>Also, add the following line to the <code>Configure()</code> method after the <code>app.UseRouting();</code> line:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
</code>   

<p>Next, let’s create <code>login</code> and <code>logout</code> pages. As Blazor uses SignalR for the client and server-side communication and Okta uses the OpenID protocol that relies on HTTP, you need to perform authentication outside of the Blazor app.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, I will create two Razor pages for these endpoints. Run the following commands in a command shell:</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Login -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
dotnet new page -n Logout -na CaloriesTracker.Blazor.Pages -o Pages
</code>   

<p>This code will create <code>Login.cshtml</code> and <code>Logout.cshtml</code> pages in the project’s Pages folder.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Login.cshtml.cs</code> and change the <code>OnGet</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet(string redirectUri)
{
    await HttpContext.ChallengeAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties
    {
        RedirectUri = redirectUri
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>HttpContext.ChallengeAsync</code> method starts the authentication process with Okta based on the configuration I did in the <code>Startup</code> class.</p>

<p>Similarly, replace the <code>OnGet</code> method in <code>Logout.cshtml.cs</code> with this:</p>

   <code>public async Task OnGet()
{
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme, new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/" });
    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);
}
</code>   

<p>This code ends the Okta session and signs out the user.</p>

<p>Now, let’s plug these pages into the Blazor app.</p>

<p>Open the <code>App.razor</code> file and replace it’s content with this:</p>

   <code>&lt;Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly"&gt;
    &lt;Found Context="routeData"&gt;
        &lt;AuthorizeRouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)"&gt;
        &lt;Authorizing&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Authorizing please wait...&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/Authorizing&gt;
        &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Sorry&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You're not authorized to see this page. You need to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;/AuthorizeRouteView&gt;
    &lt;/Found&gt;
    &lt;NotFound&gt;    
        &lt;p&gt;Sorry, there's nothing at this address.&lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;/NotFound&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeRouteView</code> component ensures that you can see only the pages that the user is authorized to visit.</p>

<p>After this, open the <code>CaloriesTracking.razor</code> component and add <code>@attribute [Authorize]</code> at the top of the code so that only authorized users can view it.</p>

<p>Finally, you need a way to authenticate users. I will create a new component, <code>AccountControl</code> in the <code>Shared</code> folder and add in the following code:</p>

   <code>@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Hello, @context.User.Identity.Name!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;a href="logout"&gt;Log out&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;a href="login?redirectUri=@(NavigationManager.Uri)"&gt;Log in&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>AuthorizeView</code> view will either display a Log out link for the user or a Log in link for authentication. The <code>AuthorizeView</code> component exposes a <code>context</code> variable, which I use to get the information about the logged-in user.</p>

<p>Put the component in the <code>MainLayout.razor</code> file above the About link and run the app. When you click the Calories Tracker you will see a message that you don’t have access to this page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Log in link, and the app will redirect you to Okta for authentication. When you log in, Okta sends you back to the app, where you’ll be able to access the page that only authenticated users can see:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s it! You have now finished migrating a WebForms project to Blazor and secured it with Okta.</p>

<p>A series of boycotts is throwing the legitimacy of Iraq’s upcoming election into doubt. The election was originally supposed to take place in June, but was pushed to October 10 due to low registration numbers.</p>



  



<p>Unfortunately, the extension does not seem to have raised the public’s confidence in the electoral process. Five parties have dropped out of the election in recent weeks, citing concerns about fraud and violence against parties that oppose the sitting government.</p>



<p>“These elections are supposed to bring change, not reproduce the same political class,” said Raed Fahmy, the head of the Iraqi Communist Party’s political bureau. “We will not participate in elections in light of the threats to activists, voters and candidates by armed factions.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sitting government has tried to quell concerns about fraud, insisting that the technology being used for the election is secure and will prevent malfeasance. To that end, the country is planning to use a new biometric identification system that is putatively resistant to outside interference. However, opponents have expressed doubts about the people running the system, suggesting that 4 million cards have been forged ahead of the election. Meanwhile, President Barham Salih has suggested that those with older, non-biometric voter cards might not be allowed to vote if they do not update their registrations.</p>



<p>The cards also become irrelevant if opposing parties are too scared to go to the polls. More than 600 protesters have already been killed since October of 2019, and dozens more are believed to have been assassinated. The extrajudicial militias responsible for that violence are yet to face consequences of any kind.</p>



<p>Iraq’s current election system was implemented following the US invasion in 2003, but activists have been pushing for a newer system that will better reflect the interests of the country’s various factions. Three hundred twenty-nine parliamentary seats will be up for grabs in October, with more than 3,243 candidates representing 267 parties and 44 coalitions signing up to run for those seats.&nbsp;The Sadrist movement, the Communist Party, the Iraqi National House, the Iraqi Platform, and the National Dialogue Front are the parties that have withdrawn from the election.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/gemalto-biometric-voter-id-philippines-election-505134/">several countries</a> have already conducted <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/credence-facilitates-biometric-voter-registration-papua-new-guinea-101506/">biometric voter registration drives</a>, the pushback in Iraq demonstrates that biometrics alone is not enough to assuage fears about corruption. That’s especially true if those being accused of corruption are the people with access to the biometric registration system. There still needs to be a baseline level of trust between the government and its people, and people may be reluctant to hand over their biometric data and participate if they don’t think their voice will be heard.</p>



<p>Of course, Iraq is not the only country that has struggled with biometric buy-in. Uganda’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-voter-machines-fail-after-ugandan-president-shuts-down-internet-during-election-011407/">biometric identification machines stopped working</a> after the President shut down the internet during an election in January. Brazil also <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/brazil-suspend-biometric-voter-registration-upcoming-election-over-covid-19-fears-071601/">suspended biometric voter registration</a> due to health concerns associated with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Amazon’s naked payments system is now being used at 50 locations in the US, and the company is looking to get more customers signed up by offering a $10 credit incentive.</p>



  



<p>The company first <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/amazon-unveils-naked-payments-terminal-with-biometric-access-ambitions-909292/">unveiled the Amazon One</a> last autumn. It’s essentially a payment terminal with a built-in biometric palm scanner. A customer who links a payment account to their palm biometrics can make a purchase simply by waving their hand over the device.</p>



<p>The Amazon One is part of an emerging trend in payments innovation, with other, smaller rivals taking a similar approach with alternative biometric modalities. FinGo, for example, has been <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometric-payments-specialist-looks-extend-reach-via-mastercard-payment-gateway-services-76202101/">making a name for itself</a> with a naked payments system that lets customers link payment accounts to their fingerprint biometrics.</p>



<p>The aim is to let customers make a purchase without the need for any kind of physical payment token or hardware – no cash, card, or smartphone required.</p>



<p>Amazon’s solution has the benefit of being touchless, which could prove to be more appealing to customers in the wake of the pandemic. Earlier this year, when Amazon was starting to roll out the solution to select Whole Foods stores, the company indicated that thousands of people had already signed up for Amazon One accounts.</p>



<p>Now, it’s offering a $10 promotional credit to new Amazon One registrants. Customers need only to sign up at a participating store and to link (or create) an Amazon account in order to receive the credit.</p>



<p>The promotional campaign is already being met with unease by some privacy advocates, with the executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project describing it as “horrifying” to TechCrunch, which broke the news about the promotional offer. Amazon has provoked some considerable skepticism among civil rights groups with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/shareholders-call-investigation-into-amazons-rekognition-system-060201/">its other biometric effort, Rekognition</a>, a facial recognition system that the company has sold to law enforcement agencies. With respect to Amazon One, there are concerns about how Amazon will use customers’ data.</p>



<p>For its part, Amazon says that it stores participating customers’ data in a “highly secure” part of the cloud, and that customers can ask the company to delete their Amazon One data if they want to stop using the service. The data will also be deleted automatically if a customer doesn’t use Amazon One for a period of two years, Amazon says.</p>

<p>Enterprise-focused identity solutions specialist Ping Identity has issued its Q2 update for 2021, showing a rise in both revenues and costs.</p>



  



<p>For the three months ended June 30, 2021, Ping Identity recorded revenues of $78.9 million, up 34 percent compared to the company’s revenues of just under $59 million in Q2 of 2020. Subscription-based revenues accounted for 93 percent of total revenues in the latest quarter, and SaaS revenues increased 51 percent year-over-year.</p>



<p>While those numbers point to growth, Ping Identity also saw its overall operating expenses rise to about $71.6 million in Q2 of 2021, compared to expenses of just under $48.5 million in the corresponding period of 2020. Its loss from operations deepened from a loss of just over $6 million in Q2 of 2020 to a loss of just over $15 million in the latest quarter.</p>



<p>Ping Identity’s net result for the latest quarter was a loss of just under $10.98 million, compared to a net loss of about $3.27 million in Q2 of 2020.</p>



<p>Commenting on the Q2 update, Ping Identity CEO Andre Durand described it as “an active second quarter,” during which the company established important deals and “exceeded expectations across all of our key metrics.” Durand highlighted the company’s Annual Recurring Revenue, which increased by 19 percent year-over-year, as a reason for being confident about delivering “strong execution during the remainder of 2021.”</p>



<p>In its update, Ping Identity highlighted several notable business developments that took place during the latest quarter, including the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ping-identity-acquires-behavioral-biometrics-specialist/">acquisition of SecuredTouch</a>. The latter specializes in behavioral biometrics technology, and its acquisition represented Ping Identity’s biggest move in the biometrics space since its launch of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ping-identity-unveils-biometric-selfie-onboarding-system-72202101/">a selfie-based onboarding solution</a>, dubbed “PingOne Verify”, during the first quarter of the year.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to the next quarter in its latest report, Ping Identity set a revenue guidance range of $65 million to $70 million for Q3 of 2021. For the full 2021 fiscal year, Ping Identity anticipates revenues in the range of $278 million to $285 million.</p>

<p>FaceTec’s business continues to skyrocket amid heightened demand for selfie-based onboarding solutions, and excitement about the company’s sophisticated 3D face authentication and liveness detection technology in particular.</p>



  



<p>In its latest quarterly update, the private company is reporting a 293 percent year-over-year jump in revenues. That illustrates a continuation of the solid upward trajectory seen in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-sees-321-revenue-jump-in-q1-update-705191/">the company’s Q1 update</a> in May, when it reported a 321 percent year-over-year revenue increase.</p>



<p>FaceTec’s success reflects a broader trend of growing interest in remote identity verification technology, and particularly solutions based on selfie biometrics, which match pictures of end users to their official identity documents. It’s an approach that has been especially popular in the financial services sector; but part of FaceTec’s unique success can be attributed to its popularity across a breadth of areas beyond that area.</p>



<p>“Our customers represent virtually every use case for remote identity verification, face authentication, and age estimation; from dating apps to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, from mobile payments to voting by Canadian Parliament, and everything in between,” explained FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy.</p>



<p>Another factor in FaceTec’s success is undeniably the sophistication and robustness of the company’s biometric technology. Unlike most face authentication solutions, FaceTec’s uses three-dimensional imaging to establish a more detailed biometric profile, and uses highly advanced liveness detection technology to guard against presentation attacks in which artefacts like 2D images and even face masks are used to fraudulently mimic genuine user credentials. </p>



<p>The company has gone so far as to establish a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-raises-biometric-spoof-bounty-to-100000-total-908051/">spoof bounty program</a> with payouts totalling $100,000 to hackers who are able to fool its authentication system. That has helped to shore up confidence in FaceTec’s solution as the market appetite for strong remote identity verification has intensified.</p>



<p>“Organizations across the spectrum are realizing that legacy in-device authentication, such as PIN numbers, passwords, fingerprint, 2D face, or their multi-factor combinations, are not proving to be secure,” explained FaceTec SVP of North American Operations Jay Meier, adding later that IT security decision makers must recognize the need for “tech that can positively verify and authenticate the biological users, not just the device.”</p>



<p>In addition to its success in further propelling revenues during the second quarter of 2021, FaceTec noted in its update that it added 10 new organizations to its global partner network during the quarter, bringing the total to 74. The new partners range from <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/onfido-facetec-sophisticated-face-authenticate-solution-705251/">the United Kingdom’s Onfido</a> to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/smartosc-fintech-partnership-to-extend-facetecs-reach-in-asia-707283/">Vietnam’s SmartOSC</a> to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-partners-with-mobile-id-specialist-scytales-705263/">Sweden’s Scytáles</a>.</p>

<p>Open banking is rapidly growing and responding to the call for greater consumer empowerment,&nbsp; giving people and businesses across the globe easy and secure access to their financial data so they can better manage their money, secure loans, and make payments. Finicity’s connections cover 95% of direct deposit accounts in North America. Today, our signed data access agreements with most of the nation’s largest financial institutions, credit card companies, and wealth management institutions cover 63% of our open banking platform traffic with direct API access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect that our direct-API Data Access Agreements will increase coverage of our data traffic to over 80% by the end of 2021.&nbsp; Direct-API connections greatly reduce the use of user credentials in the financial services market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have clearly set the industry bar and expect to continue to lead the market with direct data access.&nbsp;</p>
 Finicity’s Continued Leadership in Financial Data Access 
<p>Signing data access agreements has always been an integral part of keeping the consumer first by enhancing simplicity, control, and security. In Q2, Finicity has continued to build strong partnerships by signing DAA’s with leading financial institutions such as <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/resources/articles/security/securing-your-financial-data.html">Navy Federal Credit Union</a>, <a href="https://ir.jackhenry.com/news-releases/news-release-details/jack-henry-finicity-partner-empower-community-financial">Jack Henry</a>, and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/green-dot-data-access-agreement/">Green Dot</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity’s integration to Jack Henry’s&nbsp; <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3152246-1&amp;h=494671961&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fbanno.com%2Fdigital-toolkit%2F&amp;a=Banno+Digital+Toolkit">Banno Digital Toolkit</a> enables community financial institutions to provide consumers with the freedom to control, access, and share their financial data, creating a real-time picture of their financial health. The more than 400 community financial institutions using the Banno Digital Platform will be able to deliver this holistic financial experience to consumers through secure API access to third-party financial institutions, fintechs, and financial partners of their choice at zero lift and zero cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greendot.com/">Green Dot</a> and <a href="https://www.navyfederal.org/">Navy Federal Credit Union</a> will connect their customer’s bank accounts to Finicity’s open banking platform so they’ll be able to link their accounts to third-party apps to connect, manage, and move their money securely, manage how and what personal data is accessed by those third parties, revoke that access when desired, and have more transparency as they use their data.</p>
<p>These new relationships, on top of the ones that have been fostered since 2017, help expand the reach of our open banking platform and pave the path for evolution in the financial industry. With a greater network, more data can be attained providing higher quality products and services.</p>
 Finicity’s Commitment to Data Stewardship 
<p>Open banking has improved innovation, accessibility, and convenience and has changed the way people and financial institutions experience money. In the United States, Finicity is leveraging its best-in-class data connections as we continue to add direct API connectivity for financial institutions.</p>
<p>To provide access to real-time information, the network of data is expanding and providing more opportunities. Data Access Agreements (DAAs) are put in place to provide access to financial data to expedite the financial experience in the digital age, allowing for innovative services that benefit both the financial institution and consumer. The agreements also set the stage for how the parties involved will communicate and exchange financial data based on consumer consent.</p>
<p>Finicity’s commitment to responsible data practices is defined by the CATTS principles – control, access, transparency, traceability, and security. Adherence to these principles serves as the backbone for how consumer-permissioned data is treated by both parties involved in the DAA, providing the trusted safety needed in the current financial landscape.</p>

<p><a href="https://fortress-identity.com/">Fortress Identity</a> has unveiled a new biometric payments solution that would allow customers to verify transactions through face or voice recognition. The FortressPAY platform is not yet widely available, but the company is allowing interested parties to get in on the ground floor with an early bird sign up program.</p>



  



<p>In its announcement, Fortress suggested that FortressPay will have lower transaction fees than other payment platforms. The company said that it can offer better rates to merchants because of its use of secure biometric technology, which mitigates the number (and cost) of fraudulent transactions. It also gives both parties a higher level of confidence in each interaction. According to Fortress, the payments platform will enable a frictionless one-step checkout process for those making purchases through the web and on mobile devices.</p>



<p>In other news, Fortress released updated versions of its Fortress ID and FortressBA solutions. Fortress ID is a document verification service that allows organizations to confirm the authenticity of a government ID through the web, while FortressBA is a biometric authentication platform with face and voice recognition capabilities. Both solutions help companies meet their Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer obligations.</p>



<p>The enhanced Fortress ID introduces better backend integration and data aggregation features, and also improves the platform’s transaction dashboard, alerting, and case reporting utilities. The new FortressBA, meanwhile, will boost the performance of its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fortress-identity-platform-biometric-liveness-detection-072007/">Passive Facial Liveness feature</a>, which initially debuted in July of 2020.</p>



<p>Fortress is hoping that the updates will help drive the company’s US and Latin American expansion through to the end of 2021. The company also offers identity verification and authentication services to customers in Europe. </p>



<p>This is not Fortress’ first foray into the realm of biometric payments. The company’s technology previously appeared in Muxi’s <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometrics-news-muxi-fortress-identity-develop-biometric-payments-system-100107/">muxiPAY naked payments scheme</a> back in 2019.</p>

 Julia Reinhardt, Privacy and AI Governance Professional, on data policy, GDPR, and its impact on&nbsp;SMEs <p>In the latest episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we spoke to Julia Reinhardt. She is a San Francisco-based expert in Artificial Intelligence governance and privacy and public policy consultant. As a Mozilla Fellow in Residence, Julia assesses the opportunities and limitations of European approaches on trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Silicon Valley and their potential for U.S. businesses and advocacy. During our conversation, Julia spoke about the different facets of GDPR's impact on Silicon Valley and the challenges of upcoming AI regulation. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast.</p> Impact of GDPR on Silicon&nbsp;valley <p>GDPR has had notable and immediate impacts worldwide. It has also brought awareness to Silicon Valley that privacy is important to people in Europe and other world regions. It’s a human right that in the US, many had not considered significant. The global conversation around privacy has shifted in the past three years since 2018 and so have the laws. As a direct result of GDPR in Europe, countries like Japan, Brazil, India, and China are in the process of passing GDPR inspired privacy laws. In addition, California has a new privacy law, which went into effect in 2020 due to&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>GDPR has also shown Silicon Valley that one of their biggest markets, Europe has its own set of rules, and the US has to follow them to be a player there and earn money in the region. And as a result, many US-based organizations that process personal data of people worldwide have decided to apply GDPR and extend all the rights that go with it to their customers who don’t need to be European residents and live outside of Europe. It gives them an edge in global compliance, and it’s easier for them to handle complaints and requests. In addition, GDPR offers them a legal framework and a set of standards.</p><p>“I need to mention that a disappointing factor with the GDPR laws is the enforcement. Even when tech companies do get hit with billion-dollar fines, for them, it’s a tap on the wrist. And so far, GDPR hasn’t changed the underlying business models, the way money is made on the internet, and surveilling people’s behavior. So it’s not just the business model of a company; it is the economic model on which the entire internet is based — that doesn’t have privacy, top of mind. Changing that requires fundamental and probably painful adjustments to the way things have been structured. That’s something that GDPR so far hasn’t been able to achieve. And that is definitely a bit disappointing.”</p> AI regulations in Europe and their global challenges <p>Julia worked as a German diplomat for almost 15 years, managing bilateral relations, navigating crisis, communication, heading up high-level protocol, participating in EU negotiation processes, and promoting innovation and outreach in the Western&nbsp;US.</p><p>As part of her work today, she mentions that she intends to make sure that the upcoming AI regulation from Europe does not again cause that lagging behind for small players because in the field of AI — size matters. “The more data you can gather, the better your AI system works. We’re already pretty far down the road to monopolization because big players in the market have access to an impressive range of data. They can also afford to gather high-quality data, which then enables them to build better-performing AI. And for small-scale providers, what’s most important is the clarity of the guidance. The draft that the European Commission tabled also has been a very long time in the making. It’s the most ambitious and the most comprehensive attempt at reining the risks linked to the deployment of AI that we have seen so far across the globe. It’s a bold new step.” You can read an analysis of the AI regulation proposal&nbsp;here.</p><p>Now in 2021, we’re at the stage of transforming these principles into practical rules and regulations. The rules that the European Commission proposed wouldn’t cover all AI systems. For instance, they do cover systems deemed to pose a significant risk to the safety and fundamental rights of people living in Europe. It’s a risk-based approach, and it has several layers. And those layers have different rules for different classes of AI systems; some are prohibited, some are considered high risk, and some follow specific rules only. And then others where, you know, they just say you have to be more transparent.</p> Going deeper into regulations: Code testing for Algorithms <p>You have to know in which category your AI system falls. For some uses of AI, the commission proposes an outright ban and says it’s an unacceptable threat to citizens. For example, an AI system causes physical or psychological harm by manipulating people’s behavior or exploiting their vulnerable abilities, like age or disability. Other examples are social scoring systems where people collect points and facial recognition in public spaces by law enforcement authorities — not all facial recognition is banned but those used by police in public areas. Although, there are exceptions.</p><p>Most of the regulatory draft focuses on AI, which is considered high risk, and what is high risk is defined in the regulatory draft. So that’s kind of problematic uses in the recruiting field in the employment admissions context, determining a person’s creditworthiness, or eligibility for public services and benefits, and some applications used in law enforcement and security and judiciary. And for those, these systems have to meet different requirements and undergo a conformity assessment before they are in the European&nbsp;market.</p><p>To ensure that an AI system complies with several requirements around serious risk management, it has to use data sets in training, validation, and testing that are relevant, representative, free of errors, etc. Documentation about a high-risk AI system must be really extensive and very precise — why you chose certain designs? Why you designed it in a specific way? The keyword is always human oversight. So high-risk AI systems must be designed to allow people to understand the capabilities and limitations of a system and counter so-called automation bias. Also, if necessary, reverse or override the output. It’s like code testing for algorithms.</p> Loopholes in AI regulation: Not the final&nbsp;world <p>The European Parliament and other bodies in Europe have already called for much stricter rules in some draft elements. In addition, certain member states believe that it should be more stringent in some cases. However, this is not the final&nbsp;word.</p><p>“In my personal opinion, I do think that the exceptions such as in facial recognition are too wide. It’s just difficult when you ban very specific uses of facial recognition but then actually in industry or private uses — there’s no ban at all. Even in the uses of law enforcement, you have certain areas where it can be used. Practically speaking, law enforcement in Europe will buy facial recognition systems on the market, wherever they’re produced, and use them in those specific cases that there would be allowed to. How do you really want to make sure that they don’t use them for other things? I think that’s a huge loophole. I do think that facial recognition has the potential to actually undermine our free society. In the end, so there’s a lot to criticize about this&nbsp;draft.”</p> Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:   2:16 — 6:56 Julia’s journey from being a German diplomat to now an advisor bin data policy and regulations in the&nbsp;US.  6:56 — 12:48 GDPR’s impact on Silicon&nbsp;Valley  15:55 — 20:38 Impact of GDPR on Big tech and SMEs in the&nbsp;U.S  20:38 — 25:53 How do the proposed AI regulations impact the&nbsp;U.S?  25:53 — 29:58 Detailed analysis of AI regulations  29:58 — 35:55 Loopholes and challenges of the AI regulation?  35:55 — End Does innovation and AI regulation go hand-in-hand?  <p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

  <p>The Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl pronounced “salt”) is a software library that provides the core operations required to build cryptographic tools. Sodium is a fork of NaCl with an extended API; it’s portable, and binaries are available to be used by various programming languages and operating systems. It comes in the form of a library called <code>libsodium</code>.</p>

<p>Although there are several Python and Go cryptography libraries, it is primarily a matter of personal choice which one to use. One advantage of <code>libsodium</code> is that it is available for many languages.</p>

<p>Today, we will use <code>libsodium</code> in Python to encrypt messages and decrypt them using <code>libsodium</code> in Go. Let’s get started!</p>

<p>NOTE: You can find the code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/python-go-libsodium-example.git">GitHub</a>.</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Libsodium Application 

<p>First, if you don’t already have Python on your computer, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Next, create a directory where all of our future code will go:</p>

   <code>mkdir libsodium
cd libsodium
</code>   

<p>To avoid issues running the wrong version of Python and its dependencies, we recommend creating a virtual environment so that the commands <code>python</code> and <code>pip</code> run the correct versions:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv .venv
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>.venv</code> containing the Python binaries and dependencies. The new directory should be added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file and then activated for use:</p>

   <code>source .venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>You can run the following command to see which version you are running:</p>

   <code>python --version
</code>   

<p>Next, install the PyNaCl library:</p>

   <code>pip install pynacl
</code>   

<p>Next, if you haven’t already installed Go on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">Download and install - The Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, make the directory a Go module and install the Go crypto library:</p>

   <code>go mod init crypto
go get golang.org/x/crypto
go mod download golang.org/x/sys
</code>   

 What is Public Key Encryption 
<p>Public key or asymmetric encryption requires the generation of two numbers called keys. One key is the private key, which only the owner knows. The second key is public; it is published and widely known.</p>

<p>A message encrypted using the private key can only be decrypted using the public key. Anyone who possesses the public key can decrypt the message. The public key holder knows the message could only have been encrypted by the private key owner.</p>

<p>Conversely, a message encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted using the private key. You can be sure that only one person can view the message. The strength of the encryption depends on how much “effort” it takes to break the math without access to the decryption key.</p>

<p>A secure way of exchanging messages is to use two sets of keys, one for each party involved. Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob and ensure that only Bob can receive it. Bob wants to ensure that only Alice could have sent it. To achieve this, Alice first encrypts the message using her private key, then she encrypts it with Bob’s public key.  To recover the original message, Bob decrypts the message with his private key, and then with Alice’s public key.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The above explanation is simplified slightly. In the example below, Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key are used to generate an encryption key.  The same key is generated using Alice’s private and Bob’s public key, <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/public-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption#purpose">creating a shared key</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The encryption and decryption processes require complex computation. Low-level libraries do exist for doing this, but they are not very convenient to use. Using <code>libsodium</code> greatly simplifies the process.</p>

 How to Create Key Pairs with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>First, we are going to write a Python program to generate public-private key pairs. Create a script called <code>generate_keys.py</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

def write(name, hex, sp):
    filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + sp 
    file = open(filename, 'wb')
    file.write(hex)
    file.close()

def make_keys(name):
    sk = PrivateKey.generate()
    write(name, sk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'sk')
    pk = sk.public_key
    write(name, pk.encode(encoder=HexEncoder), 'pk')

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage:", sys.argv[0], "name")
    sys.exit()

make_keys(sys.argv[1])
</code>   

<p>The program uses <code>libsodium</code> to generate a key pair. It also uses <code>libsodium</code> to encode the keys as hexadecimal strings for portability. These hexadecimal key strings are written to files using <code>write()</code> function. The <code>make_keys()</code> function generates a public-private key pair. The <code>PrivateKey.generate()</code> function returns the private key.</p>

<p>Libsodium objects have an <code>encode()</code> function to encode the object. In this case, it uses <code>HexEncoder</code>. The public key is an attribute on the private key object. The name of the key owner is passed as a command-line argument.</p>

<p>Now run the program to generate keys for Alice and Bob:</p>

   <code>python generate_keys.py alice
python generate_keys.py bob
</code>   

<p>The files <code>key_alice_sk</code>, <code>key_alice_pk</code>, <code>key_bob_sk</code>, and <code>key_bob_pk</code> should have been created.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>The message to be encrypted is a text file containing the poem “Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll. The poem itself is somewhat cryptic, as the meaning of the words is open to interpretation! Rather fittingly, “Jabberwocky” was first published in the book Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.</p>

<p>Download the “Jabberwocky” poem to <code>jabberwocky.txt</code>:</p>

   <code>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/libsodium/main/Jabberwocky.txt &gt; Jabberwocky.txt
</code>   

<p>Libsodium makes it very easy to encrypt messages. It uses a <code>Box</code> object constructed from your private key and the recipient’s public key. The box is then used to encrypt a message. Create a file called <code>encrypt.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
import sys

class EncryptFile :
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.sk = PrivateKey(self.get_key(sender, 'sk'), encoder=HexEncoder)
        self.pk = PublicKey(self.get_key(receiver, 'pk'), encoder=HexEncoder)

    def get_key(self, name, suffix):
        filename = 'key_' + name + '_' + suffix
        file = open(filename, 'rb')
        data = file.read()
        file.close()
        return data

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = Box(self.sk, self.pk)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = EncryptFile('alice', 'bob')
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.enc')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>We use the names of the sender and the receiver to construct the  <code>EncryptFile</code> class. <code>EncryptFile</code> uses the <code>get_key()</code> helper function to read the hexadecimal encoded key from a file. Libsodium <code>PublicKey</code>and <code>PrivateKey</code> objects are constructed from the encoded keys. The <code>encrypt()</code> function constructs a <code>Box</code> object from the sender’s private key and the recipient’s public key. Then the message is read from a text file as a byte string and is encrypted by the box. The encrypted message is saved to a file for transmission.</p>

<p>Note that this generates a 24-byte random, one-time-use number called a nonce (“Number used ONCE”). The purpose of the nonce is to ensure that if the same message is encrypted more than once, the resulting encrypted message will be different. The nonce forms the first 24 bytes of the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Encrypt the poem by running:</p>

   <code>python encrypt.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with Go and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>We are going to write a simple Go program that can decrypt a message. Create a file named <code>decrypt.go</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box"
)

var PublicKey [32]byte
var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKeys() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_bob_sk")
	keysk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(sk))
	copy(SecretKey[:], keysk)
	pk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_alice_pk")
	keypk, _ := hex.DecodeString(string(pk))
	copy(PublicKey[:], keypk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.enc")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := box.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;PublicKey, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKeys()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>Go is a strongly typed language, so we have to create 32-byte arrays to store the keys. The <code>GetKeys()</code> function reads Bob’s private key and Alice’s public key for the files. They are converted from hexadecimal strings into byte arrays and copied into the fixed-length arrays. The <code>Decrypt</code> function reads the encrypted message into a byte array. The nonce needs to be separated from the encrypted message and copied into a 24-byte array. The <code>box.Open()</code> function performs the decryption and then prints the decrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the application to see the poem “Jabberwocky” restored:</p>

   <code>go run decrypt.go
</code>   

 What is Secret Key Encryption 

<p>Secret-key encryption uses a single key to both encrypt and decrypt a message. It is commonly used as a faster alternative to public-key encryption. The key itself is a fixed-length random number. As there is only a single key, both the sender and recipient need a copy of it. This requires a key exchange which is often performed out of band or by using public-key encryption.</p>

 Encrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>We will again encrypt the poem “Jabberwocky,” but this time using secret-key encryption. For convenience, we will again generate and store the key in a file:</p>

   <code>gpg --gen-random 2 32 &gt; key_secret
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Secure key exchange must be used between parties holding any shared secret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Create a file called <code>encrypt_shared.py</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>import nacl.utils
from nacl.public import PrivateKey, PublicKey, Box
from nacl.encoding import HexEncoder
from nacl.secret import SecretBox
import sys

class Encrypter :
    def __init__(self):
        file = open('key_secret', 'rb')
        self.key = file.read()
        file.close()

    def encrypt(self, textfile, encfile):
        box = SecretBox(self.key)
        tfile = open(textfile, 'rb')
        text = tfile.read()
        tfile.close()
        etext = box.encrypt(text)
        efile = open(encfile, 'wb')
        efile.write(etext)
        efile.close()

encrypter = Encrypter()
encrypter.encrypt('Jabberwocky.txt', 'message.sec')
print('Done!')
</code>   

<p>This time the constructor creates a random secret key and stores it in a file. The <code>encrypt()</code> function uses a <code>SecretBox</code> to encrypt the message. Once again a 24-byte nonce is automatically created and prepended to the encrypted message.</p>

<p>Run the script to create the key and encrypted message files:</p>

   <code>python encrypt_shared.py
</code>   

 Decrypt a Message with <code>libsodium</code> and Secret Key 

<p>The Go code for decryption is quite simple. Create a file called <code>decryptsec.go</code> containing the following code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox"
)

var SecretKey [32]byte

func GetKey() {
	sk, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("key_secret")
	copy(SecretKey[:], sk)
}

func Decrypt() {
	enc, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("message.sec")
	var nonce [24]byte
	copy(nonce[:], enc[:24])
	crypto := enc[24:]
	message, _ := secretbox.Open(nil, crypto, &amp;nonce, &amp;SecretKey)
	fmt.Println(string(message))
}

func main() {
	GetKey()
	Decrypt()
}
</code>   

<p>In this case, only the secret key is extracted from the file using the <code>GetKey()</code> function. The program reads the encrypted message from a file and extracts the nonce. Finally, the function <code>secretbox.Open()</code> decrypts the message using the nonce and the secret key.</p>

<p>Run the program to see the “Jabberwocky” poem restored:</p>

   <code>go run decryptsec.go
</code>   

 Learn more about Python, Go, and <code>libsodium</code> 

<p>NaCl, Libsodium, and the language-specific wrappers around them simplify the process of encrypting and decrypting messages. Most cryptographic libraries provide low-level operations that are complex to use. The box mechanism performs encryption and decryption in a single function call. All you need is the data, the key or keys, and a nonce.

<p>There is a theoretical elegance to a fully transparent, informed, granular&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consent-2/">consent</a>&nbsp;approach in consumer&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;— but is it really viable?</p>



<p>Consent is good in theory. It’s a way for an individual to give explicit permission to permit or deny particular types of data processing or sharing by a service. But in practice, consent alone falls short on many fronts.</p>



 Consent fatigue is real. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">Consent fatigue</a>&nbsp;is where a user grows so weary of the frequent and complex consent requests from digital interactions, they click past them to avoid the time suck and brain drain. The best example of consent fatigue is privacy notices. Back in 2008,&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-to-avoid-consent-fatigue/">researchers</a>&nbsp;estimated that the average US user would likely encounter 1,462 privacy policies a year and consume around&nbsp;<a href="https://techland.time.com/2012/03/06/youd-need-76-work-days-to-read-all-your-privacy-policies-each-year/">76 days</a>&nbsp;if they read them in full. Fourteen years on, privacy policies are a mainstay of our digital lives.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-attitudes-and-experiences-with-privacy-policies-and-laws/">Pew Research</a>&nbsp;reports 81 percent of adults are being asked at least monthly to agree to a privacy policy but only 9 per cent are always reading the policy before agreeing to the terms and conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we rely on ‘informed consent’ if the&nbsp;informed&nbsp;part is largely missing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Consent doesn’t scale well from the consumer’s perspective. 



<p></p>



<p>Most people visit a small number of sites frequently and a large number of sites infrequently. And most don’t want a blanket setting for all the sites and services they use. Global opt-in or opt-out isn’t necessarily viable for the way many of us interact online, where we may want different choices for different types of web sites or services. Telling each site what we do and don’t want is cumbersome and resource-intensive. Circle back to consent fatigue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while the&nbsp;<a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a>&nbsp;appears to reduce the amount of effort a user needs to expend to exercise some data sharing choices consistently across multiple web sites, the web site or service must be set up to react appropriately to receiving a GPC directive from a user’s app or browser. We’re still better off with the GPC than without it, but this type of limitation voids its potential as a universal panacea without regulatory enforcement.</p>



 Consent brings an unbalanced cost-to-effort ratio.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Expanding on our last point, web tech expert&nbsp;<a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin</a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/"> </a><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;says: “All that consent does is that it offloads privacy labor to the user, and only under very specific conditions does it increase the user’s autonomy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There’s a reason why data brokers love consent so much and won’t ever stop talking about “transparency and choice“: it works in favor of whichever party has the time to invest in creating a consent funnel, and that’s never individuals.”</p>



<p>Of course, some services are trying to comply with regulations in the absence of an industry standard for consent notice design—and this inconsistency is yet another issue with a whole privacy model relying on consent.</p>



 Consent is easily manipulated.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Robin Berjon</a>&nbsp;weighs in on this point too: “Digital self-determination in the face of privacy issues is highly manipulable and that’s even&nbsp;without&nbsp;dark patterns.” Add in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>&nbsp;by services capitalizing on fatigued consumers and suddenly users are giving up far more data and privacy than they intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/10/most-eu-cookie-consent-notices-are-meaningless-or-manipulative-study-finds/">EU study</a>&nbsp;into cookie consent notices reveals this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“…&nbsp;the majority are placed at the bottom of the screen (58%); not blocking the interaction with the website (93%); and offering no options other than a confirmation button that does not do anything (86%). So no choice at all then.</p>



<p>A majority also try to nudge users towards consenting (57%) — such as by using ‘dark pattern’ techniques like using a color to highlight the ‘agree’ button (which if clicked accepts privacy-unfriendly defaults) vs displaying a much less visible link to ‘more options’ so that pro-privacy choices are buried off screen.</p>



<p>And while they found that nearly all cookie notices (92%) contained a link to the site’s privacy policy, only a third (39%) mention the specific purpose of the data collection or who can access the data (21%).”</p>



<p>It should come as no surprise that big platforms like Facebook and Google are masters at using dark patterns for consent. They design the process to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2021/07/26/privacy-debate-reveals-how-big-techs-transparency-and-user-control-arguments-fall">make it difficult</a>&nbsp;for the user to set privacy choices and understand them. Most consumers twiddle all the dials and think they’ve set all possible privacy protections, when in fact they have not.</p>



<p>What’s more, the guidance from big platforms on how to make good privacy choices is often not readily consumable and is intentionally skewed in their favor. They want to keep the data tap turned on full.</p>



 Consent can be convoluted. 



<p></p>



<p>Even when companies are trying to do the right thing, they tend to offer consumers privacy choices and implications that are difficult to grasp. In the GDPR for example, consent is spoken about in terms of criteria:&nbsp;informed,&nbsp;transparent,&nbsp;timely,&nbsp;contextual,&nbsp;granular. Regulations almost add to the convolution for the consumer.</p>



 Consent is only one (limited) tool in the toolkit. 



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://berjon.com/privacy-reality-check/">Berjon</a>&nbsp;reminds us: “The answer to problems caused by consent isn’t more consent, automated consent, or consent that covers more processing. It’s to use consent where and when it is the right tool to increase people’s autonomy, and to stop pretending that you can bang nails in with it in all the other cases.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He notes: “Lindsey Barrett summarized the situation well when she described notice and choice as ‘<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3354129">a method of privacy regulation which promises transparency and agency but delivers neither’.</a>”</p>



 So, what’s the outlook for consent? 



<p></p>



<p>Despite growing concern over consent alone as a mechanism for protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>,&nbsp;no one is taking it off the table just yet. Consent is one of six lawful bases to process personal data under&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">Article 6</a>&nbsp;of the GDPR. Consent is also present in other data protection regulations too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In looking to tame the beast, IAPP contributor&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/is-there-a-role-for-consent-in-privacy/">Robert Gelman</a>&nbsp;wonders whether “it’s possible that consent can play a meaningful and fair role in consumer privacy if an independent third party sets the terms of consent rather than a business desperate to have consumers agree to its terms?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He says: “Perhaps a truly neutral third party standing between the consumer and the business seeking choices involving privacy might produce a better and fairer outcome.”</p>



<p>In exploring the notion of a third-party consent mechanism, Gelman cites the US Do Not Call Registry and Apple’s new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT feature</a>&nbsp;as two data points proving a viable role for third parties: “In both cases, a third party sets the terms and the methodology for consumer choice. In the one case, Apple set the terms. In the other case, the FTC did. This is not what happens when a website unilaterally sets the terms of consent. A one-sided approach is why consent does nothing for consumers today.”</p>



 Our position on consent 



<p></p>



<p>Since Anonyome Labs started in 2014 we have felt that while nothing is wrong with consent approaches in theory, the consumer needs more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe that if regulations aren’t toothy on enforcement, it will result in big companies doing the wrong thing anyway. Regulations alone aren’t going to protect consumers from insolent companies and those beyond reach (outside the jurisdiction but doing business within it).</p>



<p>Consent is unnecessary when dealing with companies whose interests are aligned with the consumers’. But if interests aren’t aligned, a company may work hard to make it difficult for the user to withhold or withdraw consent.</p>



<p>Our consumer app&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;steps in when the consumer can’t make consent choices in their favor or it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/fight-the-fatigue-data-privacy-really-does-matter/">all too hard</a>. MySudo is a useful tool because it mitigates consent where the user needs to and keeps it in check where the user wants more control over their personal data.</p>



<p>It’s unlikely the privacy problem will ever be fully solved. Tools like&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and the capabilities in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, our business toolkit for rapidly deploying branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions, will always have a place and their role will grow ever more important.</p>

					<p>The worldwide adoption of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) has the potential to increase people’s access to goods and services, including for disadvantaged individuals across the globe. For example, more than one billion people in the world do not have a government ID¹, causing them to be excluded from a variety of services like banking and healthcare. If done properly, SSI can empower disadvantaged individuals with a digital identity that they control and can easily prove to others.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic discussed these topics and more as we participated in a panel discussion titled “SSI for Economic Empowerment: Lessons from Africa” at the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger</a> Global Forum 2021. Anna Johnson, Trinsic’s Director of Marketing, was the panel moderator, and the four panelists were:<br><br></p>  Fabian Portmann, CTO, <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a>  Bryan Pon, Director of Strategy, <a href="https://www.kiva.org/">Kiva</a>  Thea Sommerseth Myhren, CEO, <a href="https://www.diwala.io/">Diwala</a>  Lohan Spies, CTO, <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma</a>  <p><br>All four of the companies listed above are implementing SSI solutions within the African continent, and three of the four (Kiva, Yoma, and Farmer Connect) are using Trinsic to do so. In this event, the panelists shared insights from each of their respective SSI projects which range from empowering African youth to build a digital CV to connect them to future employers to empowering smallholder farmers with supply chain credentials that make some of them bankable for the first time.

					<p>One of the main points of discussion revolved around identifying the unique properties of SSI that make it adept at economically empowering people in Africa. The panelists had varying thoughts and perspectives to share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lohan from Yoma focused on the fact that many people in Africa do not have any form of identity—not even a national identity. He explained that SSI will make a massive impact from an economic perspective because SSI makes it possible for those who have no form of identity to build it up from scratch to the point where they have access to services they may have not had access to before. He also talked about the fact that people can take the credentials wherever they go (even cross-border) and use them to prove things about themselves and unlock economic opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bryan from Kiva talked specifically about two SSI properties that Kiva’s stakeholders find of value. The first is the ability to have peer-to-peer connections where the verifier of the credential doesn’t have to “phone home” to the issuing party to authenticate a credential. The second is the ability to support multiple credential issuers without having to harmonize or sync their databases.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the discussion continued, the panelists talked about the current challenges they are facing with implementing their SSI solutions in Africa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fabian from Farmer Connect brought up their focus on solving the end user adoption challenge which is due to multiple factors including end users’ literacy, access to cellular networks, or lack of smart phones. He stressed the importance of making the technology inclusive enough to address these circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thea from Diwala also focused on end user adoption and specifically mentioned the challenge of onboarding. She explained that in remote areas, people may not have an email or a phone number, so standard onboarding methods become much more complicated. She emphasized the importance of teaching digital literacy where needed and the importance of building solutions that are inclusive so no one gets left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To wrap up the discussion, the panelists discussed what was needed for SSI to be ultimately successful in Africa. Overall, the panelists shared the same sentiment that can be summarized with a quote from Thea when she said, “I think the future for SSI [in Africa] is collaboration. We all need to work together in terms of building the standards, building open source, and understanding how we actually enable this ecosystem to work across the whole sector.”</p>

 GiD Report#171 — How crypto will be regulated in the&nbsp;U.S. <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-170-a-bombshell-in-the-battle-for-the-future-of-crypto-2eb78259300b">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p> This week:   China as a bellwether  Biden’s infrastructure bill targets&nbsp;crypto  A Ripple Test to replace the Howey&nbsp;Test?  What clear legislation might look&nbsp;like  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. Crypto is growing up — and that means regulations are&nbsp;incoming <p>With Bitcoin touching $1 trillion in market capitalization and the explosion of DeFi and NFTs this cycle, crypto has fully captured the hearts and minds — or at least the attention — of the mainstream — which includes lawmakers and regulators alike.</p><p>One indicator? China — which has become somewhat of a bellwether for where things might be heading Westward, in part due to how the government is structured over there. If China decides to do something, they’ll just do it. It’s not quite as straightforward for the Biden administration.</p><p>And what has China been doing? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-08-01/china-tech-crackdown-communist-party-policy-changes-behind-1-trillion-selloff">Cracking down on Big Tech</a> — for starters. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/china-cracks-down-on-crypto-related-services-in-ongoing-war-on-bitcoin.html">But also&nbsp;crypto</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1">the&nbsp;FT</a>:</p><blockquote>In contrast, China is pressing ahead with a more forceful, unified top-down vision, setting the stage for transformational dynamics that have the potential to extend well beyond the country&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>What happens next will have profound implications for financial services, monetary policy, investment outcomes, payment platforms and the configuration of global reserve currencies. It will also influence the control and use of big data, as well as China-US technological and economic competition.</blockquote><p>The reality is that the crypto revolution matters — a lot — with plenty of long term implications. Governments around the world — from east to west — are going to want to get a handle of things. They’ll want to try to gain some semblance of control. And they’re going to want&nbsp;taxes.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-is-china-smashing-its-tech-industry">Why is China smashing its tech industry?</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1">China lays down challenge to the west on&nbsp;crypto</a>  <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/battle-lines-over-cryptocurrencies-being-drawn-in-congress">Battle lines over cryptocurrencies being drawn in&nbsp;Congress</a>  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0cbd5704-42fd-4c9c-b0ab-8bca212b64b8">Hedge funds back away from Binance after regulatory assault</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud">Tether Executives Said to Face Criminal Probe Into Bank&nbsp;Fraud</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/tether-remains-stable-amid-reports-of-doj-probe/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Tether Remains Stable Amid Reports of DOJ Probe — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-to-accept-bitcoin-by-end-of-2021-and-develop-own-1847360405/amp">Amazon Rumored to Accept Bitcoin by End of 2021:&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-denies-report-accepting-bitcoin-215220333.html">Amazon denies report of accepting bitcoin as&nbsp;payment</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/paypal-ceo-smart-contracts-defi-apps-part-of-companys-crypto-plans/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">PayPal CEO: Smart Contracts, DeFi Apps Part of Company’s Crypto Plans — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/goldman-files-for-defi-and-blockchain-equity-etf/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Goldman Sachs Files for “DeFi” and Blockchain Equity ETF — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-digital-yuan-puts-ant-and-tencent-in-an-awkward-spot-11627210802">China’s Digital Yuan Puts Ant and Tencent in an Awkward&nbsp;Spot</a>   2. How crypto ended up in Biden’s infrastructure bill Photo: Joe Campaigning<p>Unlike China’s top-down approach, President Biden has to deal with the legislative process. In this case, that means inserting crypto stuff into the $1 trillion infrastructure bill.</p><p>Beyond the expectation of raising $30 billion in taxes, of note is how the bill defines “brokers” (along w/the reporting requirements).</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: In an updated text of the bill, senators have narrowed the definition of “brokers” that would fall under the new transaction reporting requirements, but it’s still not specific enough, according to industry insiders.</blockquote>  The new version defines a broker as “Any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”  The worry is that even the new definition still doesn’t explicitly (or more clearly) exclude parties like miners, node operators, and software developers.  “Such a requirement is essentially forcing miners, lightning nodes, etc., to identify others on the network,” Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito <a href="https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1421903482693488642">tweeted</a>. “Not only is this nonsensical from a technical perspective, such a mandate would very likely be unconstitutional surveillance.”  <blockquote>Between the lines: This is yet another example of the cryptocurrencies only getting attention from lawmakers when they want something. The industry has been clamoring for clearer regulations and laws, and a slew of bills have emerged over the years, but things today are far from a neat and comprehensive set of&nbsp;rules.</blockquote><p>And this just in — after some last minute pushback from crypto lobbyists, lawmakers have amended the&nbsp;bill.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>After receiving pushback from cryptocurrency lobbyists, lawmakers revised that section of the bill to “clarify” the definition of a broker rather than expand upon&nbsp;it.</blockquote><blockquote>The legislation also removed language that explicitly targeted “any decentralized exchange or peer-to-peer marketplace.” It replaced that with a broader definition that characterizes brokers as anyone “responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another&nbsp;person.”</blockquote><blockquote>The cryptocurrency industry has been adamant that the tougher tax enforcement should not apply to miners, or creators, of digital money, or the “node operators” that keep the software behind transactions moving.</blockquote> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html">Cryptocurrency in the Infrastructure Bill: The industry won last-minute concessions.</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/updated-infrastructure-bill">Updated US Infrastructure Bill Narrows Crypto Reporting Rule — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-taxes-871cee3f-1e29-4888-8a06-f997e713030a.html">Crypto industry faces $30 billion tax threat from infrastructure bill</a>  <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/crypto-companies-fearful-of-28-billion-tax-plan-in-infrastructure-bill-2021-8">Crypto organizations say $28 billion tax plan in Senate infrastructure bill poses an ‘imminent threat’ to the&nbsp;industry</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/us/politics/infrastructure-deal-cryptocurrency.html">Infrastructure Deal Puts Cryptocurrencies in Washington’s Cross&nbsp;Hairs</a>   3. A Ripple Test to replace the Howey&nbsp;Test? <p>All of which is more or less fine. The U.S. government gets another revenue stream. Individuals and businesses have clarity around reporting rules (now that the “broker” thing seems to be adequately addressed).</p><p>Where there’s a clear lack of clarity, however, is with the industry at large when it comes to securities regulations — as evidenced by the ongoing SEC v. Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Fortune</a>:</p><blockquote>Whatever the ultimate court decision or settlement, the outcome is certain to impact the cryptocurrency world. The case is already turning up pressure on both the SEC and Congress to clarify the law and regulation governing cryptocurrency, particularly in terms of when a cryptocurrency is or isn’t a security. “We keep trying to shoehorn cryptocurrency into preexisting regulatory processes, when it’s abundantly clear it doesn’t fit well,” said Goforth. “We’re long overdue in fixing&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>And <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">here’s Roslyn Layton</a> over at Forbes on a “Ripple&nbsp;Test”:</p><blockquote>At a recent <a href="https://regproject.org/podcast/deep-dive-ep-185/">event</a>, crypto policy scholars discussed the Security and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against fintech startup Ripple and how the case amounted to “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/06/30/sec-assault-on-ripple-provokes-wider-debate/?sh=595863f929e1">regulation by enforcement</a>.” They suggest that the abrupt decision was an attempt by the SEC to sidestep Congress for the needed procedural step to clarify the SEC’s authority in statute. The abrupt determination, after 7 years, that Ripple’s XRP payment protocol and distributed ledger is not a currency but rather a security, has caused many currency exchanges to delist XRP and XRP holders have lost billions of dollars in value. It is hardly the first time that a regulatory agency has overstepped its authority, causing widespread damage to markets, innovators, and consumers. The SEC justified its action under the so-called Howey Test, which comes from a 1946 Supreme Court case which defines the meaning of an “investment contract” within the Securities Act of 1933. Admittedly vague, the Howey Test defines securities as invested contracts dependent on the efforts of others. The scholars suggested that the SEC itself needs a “Ripple Test”, a set of clear, transparent, and objective guidelines on whether an asset like cryptocurrency is a security.</blockquote><blockquote>John Berlau of the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggests two minimum requirements to determine whether a digital asset is a security: (a) an explicit promise of ownership or share of the firm’s revenues or profits, and (b) an explicit promise of return on investment. Berlau suggests that these two disclosures are necessary to distinguish cryptocurrency investment from the larger world of investment in which the SEC has no jurisdiction even though vendors hawk the investment value of art, comic books, action figures, cars, and other collectibles. Notably, this determination should be defined in statue by Congress, lest the SEC will continue to freelance on ever-expanding regulatory turf as seen presently in the fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) used for the distribution of digital&nbsp;art.</blockquote><p>With rumors of a potential settlement in the works last week <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneyjeremy1/status/1421470726654148615">losing steam</a>, we might have to wait a little bit longer for that regulatory clarity.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/elizabeth-warren-sec-deadline-crypto-regulation">the SEC’s deadline</a> to respond to Elizabeth Warren’s open letter on the risks of crypto was last&nbsp;week.</p><p>By the way, SEC chief Gary Gensler just <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler/status/1419685223076347908">joined&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/22/toward-a-ripple-test-at-the-sec/?sh=719c75ea2e67">Toward A Ripple Test At The&nbsp;SEC</a>  <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/07/29/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit-impact-on-crypto-industry/">Why Ripple’s SEC lawsuit could have a lasting impact on&nbsp;crypto</a>   4. What clear crypto regulation might look&nbsp;like <p>Or what if we didn’t have to wait for the conclusion of the Ripple lawsuit? What if we actually enacted clear legislation around crypto’s security&nbsp;status?</p><p>Seems like a novel idea — one that Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) appears to have taken to, introducing new legislation last week called the <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act</a>:</p><blockquote>“Innovation in the digital asset sector is creating new goods and services every day as well as many new, high-quality jobs. The United States should provide a legal and regulatory environment which promotes this type of innovation and growth,” said Rep. Beyer. “Digital assets and blockchain technology hold great promise, and it is clear that assets like Bitcoin and Ether are here to stay. Unfortunately, the current digital asset market structure and regulatory framework is ambiguous and dangerous for investors and consumers. Digital asset holders have been subjected to rampant fraud, theft, and market manipulation for years, yet Congress has hitherto ignored the entreaties of industry experts and federal regulators to create a comprehensive legal framework. Our laws are behind the times, and my bill would start the long overdue process of updating them to give digital asset holders and investors basic protections.”</blockquote><p>Some of the bill’s&nbsp;goals:</p>  Create statutory definitions for digital assets and digital asset securities and provide the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with authority over digital asset securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with authority over digital&nbsp;assets;  Provide legal certainty as to the regulatory status for the top 90% of the digital asset market (by market capitalization and trading volume) through a joint SEC/CFTC rulemaking.  Require digital asset transactions that are not recorded on the publicly distributed ledger to be reported to a registered Digital Asset Trade Repository within 24 hours to minimize the potential for fraud and promote transparency;  Explicitly add digital assets and digital asset securities to the statutory definition of “monetary instruments,” under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), formalizing the regulatory requirements for digital assets and digital asset securities to comply with anti-money laundering, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements;  <p>So what would constitute a security under Beyer’s proposed legislation? (You can check out <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/beyer_028_xml.pdf">the full text&nbsp;here</a>.)</p> “(82) DIGITAL ASSET SECURITY — <br>“(A) IN GENERAL. — The term ‘digital asset security’ means a digital asset that:  “(i) Provides the holder of the digital asset with any of the following rights:  “(I) Equity or debt interest in the issuer.  “(II) Right to profits, interest, or dividend payments from the issuer.  “(III) Voting rights in the major corporate actions (which shall not include new block creations, hardforks, or protocol changes related to the digital asset) of the issuer.  “(IV) Liquidation rights in the event of the issuer’s liquidation.  “(ii) In the case of an issuer with service, goods, or platform that is not wholly operational at the time of issuing such digital asset, with respect to any fundraising or capital formation activity (including initial coin offerings) which is accomplished through the issuance of such a digital asset, issues such digital asset to a holder in return for money (including other digital assets) to fund the development of the proposed service, goods, or platform of the issuer.  “(B) RULE RELATING TO DIGITAL ASSETS. — The term ‘digital asset security’ does not include any digital asset other than the digital assets described in subparagraph (A). Any digital asset not described in subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be, and regulated as, a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a et seq.).”. <p>Seems reasonable.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://beyer.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=5307">Beyer Introduces New Legislation To Regulate Digital&nbsp;Assets</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/congressman-introduces-new-legislation-to-regulate-digital-assets">Framework to Regulate Crypto, Stablecoins Introduced in US Congress — CoinDesk</a>   5.

<p>Many blockchains have requested this from us, and we’re finally opening up white-labelling for the Torus Wallet, compatible with any blockchain.</p><p>While the Torus Wallet currently supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and xDai, other blockchains looking to bring Torus’ seamless and secure user onboarding experience to their ecosystem can do so with a white-labelled version of the Torus&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Blockchains would be able to take advantage of our core features within the wallet such as our Reverse Name Resolver, which lets users send tokens to any Google, Twitter, Discord, or Reddit social account handles even before the user logs into the wallet. They would also be able to take advantage of our partnered FIAT on-ramp providers to deliver seamless top-up options for users looking to buy cryptocurrencies within the&nbsp;wallet.</p>White-labelled Login&nbsp;UI<p>The white-labelled solution would allow the customization of several design elements within the wallet and customize the colours according to their branding schematics.</p>White-labelled wallet interface<p>Blockchain developers looking to have their own blockchain supported on the Torus Wallet can initiate the development with our team of blockchain engineers. The complexity of the project would be dependent on whether that blockchain is EVM compatible. Support for the blockchain on white-labelled wallets would extend to allow decentralised applications on that blockchain to connect to the wallet as well, giving users a seamless web3.0 experience with familiar social&nbsp;logins.</p><p>Check out our comprehensive guide for white-labelled documentation, and discover how you can offer your users a seamless and enjoyable blockchain experience. <a href="https://docs.tor.us/guides/wallet-whitelabel">https://docs.tor.us/guides/wallet-whitelabel</a></p><p>For more enquiries on how you can integrate your blockchain with our white-labelled Torus Wallet, reach out to us at hello@tor.us.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/white-label-torus-wallet-for-any-blockchain-or-brand-4a411a9a6130">White-label Torus Wallet for any Blockchain or Brand</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Torus Labs</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

How can you incorporate privacy and transparency into the design of&nbsp;CBDC?</p><p>Phantom Yun&nbsp;: Blockchain can be defined as a system that sacrifices performance for the sake of increased security and decentralization. To become a useful and deployable CBDC, any CBDC implementation should perform as faster as other competing payment systems such as credit cards. Also, it is desirable to out-perform most cryptocurrencies to compete in the cross-border payment of choice. For this, we need to solve the blockchain Trilemma also, that is performance, security and decentralization can not be achieved at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>MetaMUI has solved the blockchain trilemma by identifying the fact that the current blockchain is not truly decentralized. It is structurally decentralized but operationally centralized. By reversing this, having structurally centralized but operationally decentralized architecture, we can achieve high-performance blockchain ever possible. MetaMUI can out-perform all blockchain-based platforms and centralized payment platforms.<br>MetaMUI CBDC is the only CBDC platform that can out-perform the so-called (the world’s fastest CBDC), Chinese&nbsp;E-CNY.</p><p>Blockchain-based CBDC should not only solve the blockchain trilemma but also the CBDC design trilemma. Identity, privacy, and programmability, which cannot be easily achieved at the same time. We can not ignore privacy for the sake of achieving legal compliance and implementing programmable money. MetaMUI’s answer to this trilemma is the use of a decentralized identity system such as self-sovereign identity to find the perfect equilibrium of CBDC design trilemma. Self-sovereign identity is very famous for its advanced privacy protection. By having SSID based blockchain system we can incorporate both privacy and transparency into the blockchain-based CBDC system. Also, we use zero-knowledge encryption to protect the transaction privacy of blockchain data.</p><p>#CBDC #MetaMUI #CBPM #Identity_Based_Blockchain #OMFIF #fintech #payments #blockchain #security #Privacy #programmability</p>

<p>Content negotiation allows for an HTTP server to respond to different types of clients. Many modern clients expect a JSON response, but there may be a need to format responses differently, maybe XML for older clients or a binary format for newer ones. Content negotiation is the mechanism used to solve that problem and others, such as dealing with multiple languages and even compressing HTTP requests.</p>
 
 
<p>In this post, I’ll walk through building a simple Java MicroProfile application and explain how content negotiation works.</p>
 
 
 Prerequisites 
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11+</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache Maven</a></p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://httpie.io/docs#installation">HTTPie</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>If you want to skip ahead, the source for this example is on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/quarkus-content-negotiation-example">GitHub</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 What is MicroProfile? 
 
 
<p>Around 2016, the Java EE specifications had started to stagnate and suffered from long release cycles; as a result, newer web services APIs were falling behind. Created to spur innovation, the new <a href="https://microprofile.io/">MicroProfile</a> project addressed the need to manage the existing Java JAX-RS, CDI, and JSON-P APIs, along with other new APIs for the evolving micro-services world.</p>
 
 
<p>Fast forward to today, Java EE has moved to <a href="https://jakarta.ee/">Jakarta EE</a> under the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/">Eclipse Foundation</a> and many MicroProfile projects have matured into Jakarta EE projects.</p>
 
 






Some projects change root packages as they move between projects. Anything starting with <code>javax.*</code> may have moved to <code>jakarta.*</code> or <code>org.eclipse.*</code>.



 
 
 
 
 What is Content Negotiation? 
 
 
<p>In server-driven content negotiation, the client makes a request to a server with instructions on the type of response it can handle. When possible, the server responds with the appropriate format or returns a <code>406</code> or <code>415</code> status code.</p>
 
 
<p>At a high level, the conversation looks like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Client:<br>
Hey Server!<br>
I’d like to look at <code><a href="https://api.example.com/user/123">https://api.example.com/user/123</a></code>.<br>
I need your response in JSON.<br></p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Server:<br>
No Problem Client!  Here is that response…​</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Another more verbose example might be:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Client:<br>
Hey Server!  I need <code><a href="https://api.example.com/user/123">https://api.example.com/user/123</a></code>, preferably in JSON!<br>
But, 😩 I’ll take XML if that’s all you have.<br>
I also need the info in English or French.<br>
Oh, please zip up the contents too.<br></p>
 
 
 
 <code>GET /user/123 HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json,application/xml;q=0.9
Accept-Encoding: gzip
Accept-Language: en,fr
Host: api.example.com
User-Agent: Client/2.0</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Server:<br>
Hey Client!<br>
All I have is XML (sorry about that), the response is in English,<br>
and I was able to zip it; here you go…​</p>
 
 
 
 <code>                                        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                                        Content-Type: application/xml
                                        Content-Encoding: gzip
                                        Content-Language: en

                                        &lt;user id="123"&gt;
                                          ...
                                        &lt;/user&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>I’d like to take this opportunity to apologize for using XML in this example 🤪</p>
 
 






Agent-driven content negotiation works differently. In this case, the client must already be aware of the server’s capabilities or must determine them by making a request to the server. This communication is not standardized.



 
 
 
 
 Content Negotiation Headers 
 
 
<p>In the previous example, I used the three content negotiation headers:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>Accept</code> - The list of media types the client supports.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Accept-Encoding</code> - The list of compression algorithms the client supports.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Accept-Language</code> - The list of languages the client supports.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>These "accept" headers allow for a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Quality_values">"quality value"</a> or a q-factor to define the client’s preferences. When omitted, the default value is <code>1.0</code>. The example above of <code>application/json,application/xml;q=0.9</code> tells the server that JSON is preferred, but XML would be the next choice.</p>
 
 
<p>The server’s response contains headers to let the client know which options were selected.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><code>Content-Type</code> - The media type contained in the response.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Content-Encoding</code> - The compression algorithm used.</p>
 
 
<p><code>Content-Language</code> - The language of the response.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>When I examine the request my browser made to display this blog post, it looks something like this:</p>
 







<p>Accept</p>
<p>text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,/;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9</p>


<p>Accept-Encoding</p>
<p>gzip, deflate, br</p>


<p>Accept-Language</p>
<p>en-US,en;q=0.9</p>



 
<p>My browser is telling the server: I’ll take anything, but here’s an ordered list of what I prefer:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>HTML, XHTML, AVIF, WebP, or APNG</p>
 
 
<p>XML or a signed exchange</p>
 
 
<p>Anything else.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>The browser supports <code>gzip</code>, <code>deflate</code>, and <code>br</code> compression. Finally, my language preference is US English (as in color spelled without a "u") or any English.</p>
 
 






There is a downside. These headers can also be used for <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">browser tracking and finger printing</a>.



 
 
<p>Enough primer, let’s get on to the code!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a MicroProfile Project With Quarkus 
 
 
<p>Most of the code below should be vendor agnostic, except where noted. Try out the example with your favorite <a href="https://start.microprofile.io/">MicroProfile vendor</a>, and let me know how it went in the comments!</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new project:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.0.2.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.example \
    -DprojectArtifactId=content-negotation \
    -DclassName="com.example.DiceResource" \
    -Dextensions="resteasy-jsonb"
    -Dpath="/roll"
cd content-negotation</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you haven’t guessed, this example is going to evaluate dice notation. The <a href="https://github.com/diceroll-dev/dice-parser">Dice Notation Parser</a> library will evaluate dice expressions such as <code>2d8+2</code> and return the results. Open up your <code>pom.xml</code> file and add the <code>dice-parser</code> dependency:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;dev.diceroll&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;dice-parser&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.1.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Update the <code>DiceResource</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/example/resources</code> to add a <code>GET</code> method:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.resources;

import dev.diceroll.parser.ParseException;
import dev.diceroll.parser.ResultTree;

import javax.ws.rs.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // wildcard for brevity

import static dev.diceroll.parser.Dice.detailedRoll;

@Path("/roll")
public class DiceResource  {

    @GET
    public ResultTree rollObject(@QueryParam("dice") String dice) throws ParseException {
        return detailedRoll(dice);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Start the server either from your favorite IDE or from the command line with:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mvn quarkus:dev</code> 
 
 
 






All of the code changes you’ll make should hot reload, but if you don’t see the changes as you continue, just kill the process and start it up again.



 
 
<p>Make sure things are working by making a request—and roll a single six-sided die.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==d6</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 148
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "expression": {
        "numberOfDice": 1,
        "numberOfFaces": 6
    },
    "results": [{
        "expression": {
            "numberOfDice": 1,
            "numberOfFaces": 6
        },
        "results": [],
        "value": 6
    }],
    "value": 6
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now that the app is working, let’s tweak some things and look at how the response changes!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Enable Compression for the REST Resources 
 
 
<p>Compression isn’t one of those features you should need to worry about. You <a href="https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/filters-and-interceptors.html#d0e9756">could deal with the compression logic yourself</a>, but most vendors have a configuration property you can tweak to turn it on.</p>
 
 
<p>For Quarkus, add the following line to your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>quarkus.http.enable-compression=true</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Make another HTTP request and include the <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header, and this time we will roll <code>2d6</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==2d6 "Accept-Encoding: gzip"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip (1)
Content-Length: 106

{
    "expression": {
        "numberOfDice": 2,
        "numberOfFaces": 6
    },
    ...
    "value": 9
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The response <code>Content-Encoding</code> header was set (HTTPie automatically unzipped the request)


 
 
 
 






 
<p>If you wanted to do the same thing with <code>curl</code> you would need to pipe the result to gunzip:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>curl localhost:8080/roll\?dice=2d6 -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" | gunzip</code> 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 Using the Request Accept-Language Header 
 
 
<p>It’s 2021, and implementing internationalization (i18n) is still hard. In the Java world, i18n usually means creating a <code>Locale</code> object containing the user’s language. It’s a little clunky to use, but the JAX-RS API defines a way to resolve the user’s <code>Locale</code>. Let’s look at a couple of different ways to manage this.</p>
 
 
<p>Add a new endpoint method in <code>DiceResource</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>@Path("/lang")
@GET
public Response getLang(@Context Request request) {
    List&lt;Variant&gt; variants = Variant.VariantListBuilder.newInstance() (1)
            .languages(Locale.ENGLISH, Locale.GERMAN) (2)
            .build();

    Variant variant = request.selectVariant(variants); (3)

    if (variant == null) { (4)
        return Response.notAcceptable(variants).build();
    }

    // set the response header, to the client knows which language was selected
    String lang = variant.getLanguageString();
    return Response.ok(lang)
            .header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_LANGUAGE, lang)
            .build(); (5)
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Use the variant list builder to select the language from the "Accept-Languages" header.


2
You will need to list all of your supported languages; order is important; the default option is the first if there is no <code>Accept-Language</code> header.


3
Use the request to select the correct variant.


4
If the selected variant is <code>null</code> return a <code>406</code>.


5
Build and return a <code>200</code> response.


 
 
 
 






The <code>VariantBuilder</code> also supports different encodings and <code>MediaType</code> too.



 
 
<p>Try it out! Make a request to <code>/roll/lang</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll/lang "Accept-Language: de"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: de (1)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 28

de</code> 
 
 
 


1
Note the <code>Content-Language</code> header.


 
 
 
 
<p>The above approach works well for showing off the API, but it’s a little limited in real-world usages as every endpoint method returns a <code>Response</code> and manages the headers directly. It would be nicer to extract this cross-cutting concern.</p>
 
 
<p>Another option is to use request and response filters. The next example implements both <code>ContainerRequestFilter</code> and <code>ContainerResponseFilter</code> interfaces. Create a new class <code>LanguageFilter</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.container.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // wildcard for brevity
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Locale;

@Provider
public class LanguageFilter implements ContainerRequestFilter, ContainerResponseFilter {

    final private static String LANG = "LanguageFilter.lang";

    final public static List&lt;Variant&gt; VARIANTS = Variant.VariantListBuilder.newInstance()
            .languages(Locale.ENGLISH, Locale.GERMAN) (1)
            .build();

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext) {
        Variant variant = requestContext.getRequest().selectVariant(VARIANTS); (2)

        if (variant == null) { (3)
            // Error, respond with 406
            requestContext.abortWith(Response.notAcceptable(VARIANTS).build());
        } else {
            // keep the resolved lang around for the response
            requestContext.setProperty(LANG, variant.getLanguageString()); (4)
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void filter(ContainerRequestContext requestContext, ContainerResponseContext responseContext) {
        String lang = (String) requestContext.getProperty(LANG);
        responseContext.getHeaders().putSingle(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_LANGUAGE, lang); (5)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Define the supported languages.


2
Select the <code>Variant</code> based on the request.


3
If a compatible <code>Variant</code> is not found, return a <code>406</code>.


4
Add the resolved language string to the request context.


5
Set the <code>Content-Language</code> response header.


 
 
 
 






Having spent years dealing with the Servlet API, I often make incorrect assumptions about how the JAX-RS API is structured. With JAX-RS, the request and response filtering are different interfaces.



 
 
<p>This solution works with any endpoint; test out the original <code>/roll</code> endpoint again. Dice notation allows for basic math, too; try to roll <code>2d8+1</code> (two eight-sided dice plus one).</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==2d8+1 "Accept-Language: en"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 154

{
    "expression": {
        "left": {
            "numberOfDice": 2,
            "numberOfFaces": 8
        },
        "operation": "ADD",
        "right": {
            "value": 1
        }
    },
    "results": [
    ...
    ],
    "value": 8
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>So far, so good!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Different Responses for Different Clients 
 
 
<p>Up until now, the simple <code>/roll</code> endpoint has been returning JSON, which is excellent if you are building a client that accepts JSON, but it’s not very user-friendly for text-based clients like HTTPie or curl. Two changes are needed to support a plain text response: Annotate the endpoint with an <code>@Produces</code> annotation and add a <code>MessageBodyWriter</code> to convert the dice parser’s <code>ResultTree</code> object into text.</p>
 
 
<p>Add the following <code>@Produces</code> annotation to <code>DiceResource</code>, to indicate it supports both <code>text/plain</code> and <code>application/json</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>@Path("/roll")
@Produces({MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON })
public class DiceResource  {
...</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you make a request to the <code>/roll</code> endpoint now, you will get an ugly response due to a call to the <code>toString()</code> method on <code>ResultTree</code>. 🤢</p>
 
 
<p>To fix this, create a new class <code>TextDiceTreeMessageBodyWriter.java</code> that implements <code>MessageBodyWriter&lt;ResultTree&gt;</code>, which renders something a little easier on the eyes:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import dev.diceroll.parser.Dice;
import dev.diceroll.parser.ResultTree;

import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MultivaluedMap;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyWriter;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.lang.annotation.Annotation;
import java.lang.reflect.Type;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

@Provider
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN) (1)
public class TextDiceTreeMessageBodyWriter implements MessageBodyWriter&lt;ResultTree&gt; {

    @Override
    public boolean isWriteable(Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType, Annotation[] annotations, MediaType mediaType) {
        return type == ResultTree.class; (2)
    }

    @Override
    public void writeTo(ResultTree resultTree,
                        Class&lt;?&gt; type, Type genericType,
                        Annotation[] annotations,
                        MediaType mediaType,
                        MultivaluedMap&lt;String, Object&gt; httpHeaders,
                        OutputStream entityStream) throws IOException, WebApplicationException {

        String result = Dice.debug(resultTree); (3)
        entityStream.write(result.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)); (4)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Add a <code>Produces</code> annotation to the class to mark the <code>MediaType</code> it supports.


2
This example keeps things simple and only supports the <code>ResultTree</code> class.


3
Calling <code>Dice.debug</code> will turn the result into text.


4
Write the string to the response stream.


 
 
 
 
<p>Time to test it out! Call <code>/roll</code> again roll <code>3d10k2+1</code> (roll three eight-sided dice and keep the highest two, then add one to the result):</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/roll dice==3d10k2 "Accept: text/plain"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 69

3d10k2 + 1 = 8
--3d10k2 = 7
----d10 = 4
----d10 = 2
----d10 = 3
--1 = 1</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Much better! Change the <code>Accept</code> header value to <code>application/json</code> to see for yourself.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Bonus: User Agent for Content Negotiation 
 
 
<p>Using the User-Agent header for content negotiation might not be your first choice. Still, it works great for a few use cases, for example when dealing with legacy clients that don’t correctly handle adding new fields to a JSON response object.</p>
 
 






If you are using Jackson to unmarshal JSON consider adding the <code>@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)</code> annotation to your client code to handle additive changes in REST APIs gracefully.



 
 
<p>One of my favorite examples of using the User-Agent for content negotiation is adding descriptive help to a REST server. I learned this trick from the <a href="https://github.com/spring-io/start.spring.io">Spring Initializer project</a>, which returns different results if you use HTTPie or curl: <code><a href="https://start.spring.io">https://start.spring.io</a></code>.</p>
 
 
<p>To detect the user agent, add an enum that contains basic user-agent parsing logic.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public enum Agents {

    CURL("curl"),
    HTTPIE("HTTPie");

    final private String agentName;
    final private static Pattern TOOL_REGEX = Pattern.compile("([^\\/]*)\\/([^ ]*).*"); (1)

    Agents(String agentName) {
        this.agentName = agentName;
    }

    public static Agents parse(String userAgent) { (2)
        Matcher matcher = TOOL_REGEX.matcher(userAgent);
        String name = (matcher.matches()) ? matcher.group(1) : null;
        return Arrays.stream(Agents.values())
                .filter(agent -&gt; agent.agentName.equals(name))
                .findFirst()
                .orElse(null);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
This regex looks for <code>{name}/{version}</code>


2
Calling <code>Agents.parse(userAgent)</code> will return an enum associated with Curl, HTTPie, or <code>null</code>.


 
 
 
 






User-Agent parsing is a much more complex topic; the above code works well because we are looking for a few specific clients.  This is not a general-purpose solution.



 
 
<p>Now that I have logic to figure out the user-agent, I’ll create a helper class to wrap the logic of returning localized help text. Create a new class <code>Help.java</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo;
import java.text.MessageFormat;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ResourceBundle;

public class Help {

    final static private Map&lt;Agents, String&gt; AGENT_HELP_MAP = Map.of(
            Agents.CURL, "help.curl",
            Agents.HTTPIE, "help.httpie"
    );

    public static String getHelp(String userAgent, UriInfo uriInfo, Locale locale) {

        String url = uriInfo.getBaseUri().resolve("/").toString(); (1)

        Agents agent = Agents.parse(userAgent); (2)

        // look up the help key
        String helpKey = AGENT_HELP_MAP.getOrDefault(agent, "help.generic"); (3)

        // Resource Bundle lookup/formatting
        ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("messages", locale); (4)
        MessageFormat formatter = new MessageFormat(resourceBundle.getString(helpKey), locale);
        return formatter.format(new Object[] { url });
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Resolve the base URL of the request <code>UriInfo</code>.


2
Parse the user-agent header and return an <code>Agents</code> enum.


3
Look up the help text key, or default to <code>help.generic</code>.


4
Get and format a string from a <code>ResourceBundle</code>.


 
 
 
 
<p>Create the corresponding <code>ResourceBundle</code> in <code>src/main/resources/messages.properties</code> :</p>
 
 
 
 <code>help.generic = \
    Welcome to the Dice Parser!!\n\n\
    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: text/plain\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: application/json

help.httpie = \
    Welcome to the Dice Parser!!\n\n\
    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: application/json\"

help.curl = \
    Welcome to the Dice Parser!!\n\n\
    Roll dice by making a request:\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Or get the result in JSON (the default):\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: application/json\"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add a German translation of this file (thanks to Google Translate), in <code>src/main/resources/messages_de.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>help.generic = \
    Willkommen beim Würfelparser!!\n\n\
    Würfeln Sie, indem Sie eine Anfrage stellen:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: text/plain\n\n\
    Oder rufen Sie das Ergebnis in JSON ab:\n\
    \    GET {0}roll?dice=2d6\n\
    \    Accept: application/json

help.httpie = \
    Willkommen beim Würfelparser!!\n\n\
    Würfeln Sie, indem Sie eine Anfrage stellen:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Oder rufen Sie das Ergebnis in JSON ab:\n\
    \    http {0}roll dice==2d6 \"Accept: application/json\"

help.curl = \
    Willkommen beim Würfelparser!!\n\n\
    Würfeln Sie, indem Sie eine Anfrage stellen:\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: text/plain\"\n\n\
    Oder rufen Sie das Ergebnis in JSON ab:\n\
    \    curl {0}roll?dice=2d6 -H \"Accept: application/json\"</code> 
 
 
 






You could use your favorite template framework for this instead of using a <code>ResourceBundle</code> directly.



 
 
<p>Lastly, create a new <code>HelpResource</code> class to tie everything together:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example;

import javax.ws.rs.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.*; // for brevity

@Path("/")
public class HelpResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String help(@HeaderParam(HttpHeaders.USER_AGENT) String userAgent, (1)
                       @Context Request request, (2)
                       @Context UriInfo uriInfo) { (3)
        return Help.getHelp(userAgent,
                uriInfo,
                request.selectVariant(LanguageFilter.VARIANTS).getLanguage()); (4)
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
The User-Agent request header.


2
The <code>Request</code> object (needed to select the correct language <code>Variant</code>).


3
The URI of the request.


4
Pass everything into <code>Help.getHelp()</code> to return the localized help message.


 
 
 
 
<p>The default Quarkus application adds a static <code>index.html</code> file to use as the root resource; delete this file so the new <code>HelpResource</code> can take its place:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>rm src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/index.html</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Put everything you learned together and make a request to <code>localhost:8080/</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/ "Accept-Language: en" "Accept: text/plain" "Accept-encoding: gzip"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Language: en
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Vary: Accept-Language
content-encoding: gzip
content-length: 251

Welcome to the Dice Parser!!

Roll dice by making a request:
    http http://localhost:8080/roll?dice=2d6 "Accept: text/plain"

Or get the result in JSON:
    http http://localhost:8080/roll?dice=2d6 "Accept: application/json"</code>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of the <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card</a>!</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://global.id/">GlobaliD</a> vision, we believe that everyone has a right to not only an identity but also a wallet tied to that identity. With that wallet, they should be able to hold, trade, and spend money and assets of any kind. In essence, it’s about giving everyone a seat at the&nbsp;table.</p><p>The XRP Card takes that one step further, allowing users to spend fiat, crypto, or any other digital asset from their GlobaliD Wallet, powered by <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, anywhere Mastercard is accepted — all while earning up to 5% cash back in XRP&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The XRP Card is also the first ever community-linked debit card of its kind — it’s available exclusively to members of the <a href="http://How%20to%20get%20the%20XRP%20Mastercard®%20Debit%20Card%20Check%20out%20the%20launch%20page%20Watch%20the%20step-by-step%20instructional%20video%20Join%20the%20XRP%20Army%20Group%20on%20GlobaliD%20Read%20the%20FAQ">XRP Army Group</a> on GlobaliD. The longer term vision is to empower any community with the tools to quickly and conveniently issue their own community debit cards to their members, each with their own unique set of traits and rewards programs.</p> How to get the XRP Mastercard® Debit&nbsp;Card   <a href="https://www.globalid.cards/xrp-card/">Check out the launch&nbsp;page</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/yMzh6N6xdQQ">Watch the step-by-step instructional video</a>  <a href="https://link.global.id/group-invite?short_link_id=VYaD0jAnLlgj">Join the XRP Army Group on&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://care.global.id/en/collections/2990567-xrp-card">Read the&nbsp;FAQ</a>  <p>(For now, the card is only available to U.S. residents, but we’re working hard on international expansion. Residents of Colorado, Hawaii, Louisiana, Nevada, New York, and Virginia are not eligible for the program at this&nbsp;time.)</p><p>All of this is made possible by GlobaliD’s Sovereignty Stack — composed of self-sovereign identity, messaging and groups, and the wallet — what we see as the core building blocks for the next chapter of the internet. It’s one reason why we were able to create the XRP Card in just five months from conception to initial&nbsp;launch.</p><p>We also couldn’t have done it without our ecosystem of partners — including <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, which powers the GlobaliD Wallet, and <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, whose <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">instant issuance program</a> underpins the XRP&nbsp;Card.</p><p>We caught up with two of the team leads on the XRP Card project at GlobaliD — Paul Stavropoulos and Laura Toh — to chat about the launch, the XRP Card program, and the long term&nbsp;vision.</p> How did the XRP Card get&nbsp;started? <p>Paul: We believe that identity is a combination of the credentials you have, the people you communicate with, and the value that you own. In the context of value, it’s also about how you spend it — which is very personal. It’s a big part of your identity. Right now, the main way people spend is through debit and credit cards. So, we see debit cards as the first step toward allowing folks to spend and make transactions with the value of any kind that they&nbsp;hold.</p><p>We started with the XRP Card because we happen to have a lot of fans that love the value that XRP brings. It was a natural fit to start with the XRP community because they’re active and highly engaged, allowing us to push forward not only our vision for allowing you to spend value that’s associated with identity but also for empowering communities, which we’ll talk about&nbsp;later.</p><p>Laura: Greg [Kidd, GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] has always been an advocate for XRP and crypto at large. He has a reputation for not backing away from difficult conversations around its future — for instance, his <a href="https://youtu.be/v2gLHm-4qRM">first podcast on the SEC lawsuit</a>. So it was a natural fit. We were able to get over 25,000 people on the waitlist in the first week with pretty much no marketing — just a&nbsp;tweet.</p> There’s a lot of debit and credit card programs being marketed at the moment that offer crypto rewards. The XRP Card appears unique in that regard since it’s tied to a specific community. Can you explain the thinking behind&nbsp;that? <p>Laura: The vision for GlobaliD is for everyone to have an identity that allows them to trust and be trusted online — similar to real life. For your digital identity to be worthwhile, you need to be able to do something with it. Our theory is that community (and Groups) is the best way of creating incentives for people to kickstart that approach, where the starting point for your identity is to be able to start interacting with other&nbsp;people.</p><p>Nobody gets a driver’s license for the sake of having a license. You get it because it allows you to do things — whether that’s driving a car or getting into a bar. For us, building communities is a way to make these identities valuable today. When you get your XRP Card, you’re not just getting a way to pay for things, you’re joining a community of like-minded people, who you can trust, interact with, and potentially further down the line, take collective action either socially or financially.</p><p>Paul: The biggest difference between the XRP Card and other offerings out there is that we’re not interested in just putting out a debit card. The long term vision is to empower individuals and groups — to allow them to create communities and have the ability to leverage the collective power of those communities. Eventually, GlobaliD users will be able to not only create groups, but also issue their own community-specific cards, allowing them to create their own merchant networks, reward programs, or even group funding mechanisms in order to leverage the group’s collective financial power. The next big step is implementing a noncustodial wallet — both for users and communities.</p><p>The XRP Card is essentially a reference implementation of that vision — how a decentralized community can organize and use their collective spending power, to earn rewards, and benefit from the way they interact in the real world when they spend money. The XRP Card is a way to build out these communities, and help people bridge that gap to the real world from their online community. It becomes another way to express and establish your identity.</p> What exactly do you mean by collective action? <p>Laura: There are two types of collective action that we’re exploring: first, a community could leverage its size and spending power to get better deals for its members, and second, they could pool funds in order to get access to goods, services, and investments that would be out of reach individually.</p><p>Groups could also grow pooled funds through the card itself — for instance, if they issue a card where a certain portion of the transaction fee goes to the group wallet. It could be a cause-based group aligned with some charity and in that way, the collective spending power of the community to make donations. By spending money with that group card, you’d be passively donating to your favorite&nbsp;charity.</p><p>Paul: Imagine if you’re a community focused on a particular sports team. The group could pool funds to potentially gain access to athletes and interviews. They could host special events, build out merchant rewards for jerseys or drinks at their favorite bars, or they could even help certain members of the community attend their first&nbsp;game.</p> The XRP Card was first announced earlier this year in February and has now officially launched at the end of July. It must have been a mad scramble to get this thing out in about 5&nbsp;months. <p>Paul: I think first and foremost, that’s a testament to the GlobaliD vision and framework, particularly around the Sovereign Stack — identity, messaging, wallet. We see those as the core building blocks for Web 3.0, and with some combination of those building blocks, you could, practically speaking, build anything across the spectrum of fintech products and services. We’ve spent the last few years building that foundation brick by brick so it’s incredible to see it all come together.</p><p>Laura: That being said, our team has been working incredibly hard to get this to market — so shout out to the engineering team, the product team, the design team, and the customer support team. Also, none of this could have happened without our ecosystem of partners — Apto with their instant issuance powering the card, Uphold powering the wallet. Everyone has been heads down working to make the XRP Card a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>But also a special shout out to the community. We wouldn’t be here without you — especially the beta testers! Thank you so much for your engagement, your feedback, and most of all, your positive energy and enthusiasm.</p><p>We’re just all super excited that it’s finally in people’s hands and&nbsp;wallets!</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/pstav90">Paul</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thelittletoh">Laura</a> on Twitter, and visit <a href="https://global.id/">Global.iD</a></p><p>You might also be interested in:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-joins-the-linux-foundations-cardea-project-22f298032240">GlobaliD joins the Linux Foundation’s Cardea&nbsp;Project</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/partner-spotlight-apto-payments-launches-instant-card-issuance-3a3397e8613a">Partner Spotlight: Apto Payments launches Instant Card&nbsp;Issuance</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-is-hipaa-compliant-1e8cdf915ab6">GlobaliD is HIPAA compliant</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-receives-soc-2-type-ii-certification-b2b6ea7a6d75">GlobaliD receives SOC 2 Type II certification</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-connects-to-the-indicio-network-2ad5688d72fd">GlobaliD connects to the Indicio&nbsp;Network</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-shares-ssi-code-at-the-internet-identity-workshop-446debec43e7">GlobaliD shares SSI code at the Internet Identity&nbsp;Workshop</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-the-xrp-mastercard-debit-card-827c0b37445b">Introducing the XRP Mastercard® Debit Card</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the second interview in this series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EmilioburFdez">Emilio</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>Four years ago before the Ontology project was officially announced, a friend told me about it. I decided to learn more and found that I really liked the project’s vision. I subscribed to their newsletter and… to my surprise, for that alone they gave me a generous airdrop with the launch of their TestNet. I was very pleased that the project did not have an ICO and instead had a fair and equitable distribution of their&nbsp;tokens.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>The purpose of the project was aligned with my thoughts, but there was no information in Spanish about Ontology. I decided to create a Spanish <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Telegram</a> channel to talk and share opinions with other people, and try to unify all the available information in&nbsp;Spanish.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>When I learned about the purpose of Ontology — i.e. its mission to provide decentralized identity and data management tools to the world — I realized that thanks to this purpose, something beneficial could be achieved for people, giving them back a large part of the freedom they have lost. I think the key role of a Harbinger is to convey that feeling, that things can be changed, and that there are projects like Ontology that are working hard to foster positive change in the&nbsp;world.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Because I feel part of something big; part of a project that wants to give people control of their identity again, and protect their privacy and&nbsp;data.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>There is a part of the community that is only there to speculate with the price and try to make a profit but, little by little, people are transformed and realize that the price is not that important. They understand that the purpose of Ontology goes further and that it will achieve very important changes in people’s daily lives. Then the economic benefits will&nbsp;come.</p> 6. What do you use as your key Ontology community channels for and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>All channels are valuable; the important thing is to know how to communicate the project’s vision and purpose. I enjoy talking about Ontology with new people face to face. It’s fun to share my knowledge about the project and its vision with&nbsp;others.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Before, when I wanted to talk to someone important from another project on YouTube, it was very difficult; they ignored me. But now when I tell them that I am part of Ontology, they pay attention to me and I can have interesting conversations. Another very comforting thing is when I wear my Ontology shirt and someone comes to talk to me because they know the project — it’s&nbsp;great.</p><p>The advice I would give to someone who wants to become a Harbinger, is that if they feel aligned with the purpose of Ontology, and are able to communicate well with other people and want to be part of a big family, jump in and join&nbsp;us.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Dedicated, Innovative, Ambitious.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>We have to find a channel where we can explain to a greater number of people the purpose of Ontology; where we come from, where we are, and where we are&nbsp;going.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Create more dApps that solicit community feedback. It is as easy as asking them, “What do you want us to develop?” Then, create a line of work where the community and developers work together.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the third interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Vittorio Bertocci,  Principal Architect at Auth0, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4618/1" title="Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?"> Browser Features vs. Identity Protocols: An Arms Race?</a> on Tuesday, September 14 starting at 9:50 am. at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Vittorio some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why are browser vendors introducing changes in their products that impact how we do identity today?</p>
<p>
Browser vendors really mean well. What they are doing is looking out for the users and we know that today, one of the big engines of the economy is the ability of advertisers to profile people. Even without their knowledge or consent so that they can serve high-performing ads. And a lot of these tracking occurs by using low-level primitives in the browser, such as cookies, redirects, decorated links. And so, browser vendors are trying to put a stop to it by inhibiting some of those functionalities in particular scenarios, or sometimes, we have had a lot of discrimination, eliminating entire categories or features.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, identity, and in particular, federated identity is built on the same building blocks that are used by the advertisers. And so, the outcome is that any actions against tracking, that do not really understand the difference between ad tracking and federated identity will affect the federated identity scenarios. And so that is basically what is going on right now. 
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the short-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The short-term impact of this can be quite painful for a number of customers. Let's say that some changes already went [into] production, so, the famous intelligent tracking protection in Safari and, on the SameSite different defaults in Chrome. The plans that Chrome had to [completely] eliminate third party cookies, which now luckily has been delayed by a couple of years.</p>
<p>And the outcome of those is that entire scenarios can just stop working. So, if, for example, you have a web application which runs mostly in JavaScript and executes code in the browser, and it relies on the ability to access third-party cookies, to get the tokens out of band, instead of actually showing redirects to the user, then, applications might actually be unable to get to those tokens in the background. And so, the experience of the user would be disrupted and the same goes for distributed log out. 
</p>
<p>You log out from one app expecting that you would be logged out from all the apps that are using the same identity provider, but it might not happen. You might end up being logged out only from one app, but still be logged in[to] the other apps. And those are short-term consequences. There are medium-term consequences, which can be far more severe. There are talks about introducing features that limit the way in which your browsers redirect, and that will potentially break SAML, which is extraordinarily adopted.</p>
<p>
A lot of critical infrastructure relies on SAML. And the moment in which those changes will occur, again, with SAML, is basically done - it is not dead, because people are using it, but it is done. There is a longer innovation. If it imposes changes that would require products to change the way in which we do SAML, we would be in big trouble because a lot of websites, institutions, [and] universities would just stop working. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the long-term consequences people need to consider, if any? </p>
<p>
The long-term consequences are more nuanced. One of the things that we as industry are trying to do with browser vendors and identity providers, and identity vendors and similar, is to devise a new class of primitives that allow the browser to do identity explicitly instead of using low level primitives, like cookies and redirects. We could offer APIs that do identity. The challenge with that is that if you go too high in the abstraction layers, you end up with something which is very inflexible. And as we know, from a history of how identity came to be on the internet, we need what we call permissionless innovation, as in, the ability to devise new scenarios, starting from flexible primitives.</p>
<p>
If your primitives are not very flexible because they address specific scenarios – you can address today's scenarios, but there is no guarantee you would be able to address tomorrow’s scenarios. And so, we need to strike this balance and if we fail to do so, we might actually significantly hamper innovation. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p>What is the best way for people in the identity industry to help move things forward?</p>
<p>
The absolute best way is to get involved. We have been talking with the browser vendors for a couple of years at this point, all as separate entities, like separate companies, and this is not very efficient. It is not very exhaustive because we all, all identity operators in the industry, have a different perspective and different use cases. So, we have been working in collaboration with the W3C to create a tent, a forum where we can all come together [to] the table and discuss our scenarios and contribute all our points of view. And it is a community group in the W3C called the fed ID (<a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">The Federated Identity</a>). And the best way is really to participate. So, to join the group, join the calls, participate in the discussion so that we can move these aspects of identity and browsers forward together. </p>

<p>CARIBBEAN – August 2, 2021 – ShareRing have today announced a pilot program to digitize the KYC (Know Your Customer) process for financial institutions based in the Caribbean region.</p>



<p>The pilot which began on June 1st, 2021, is part of ShareRing’s long term commitment to the region as they roll out their blockchain based identity and verifiable credentials ecosystem across a number of industries including health, events, financial services and travel. The ShareRing Caribbean team leading the project have over 20 years experience in the technology and financial sectors.</p>



<p>This digital ‘eKYC’ pilot will enable credit unions, insurance companies and other financial institutions to receive their customers ID and supporting documents in an encrypted digital format through their mobile device.&nbsp; The solution will eliminate much of the time-consuming aspects of account sign-up processes while still ensuring the institutions operate within the regulatory framework.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s scope includes exploring the potential for credit approvals and identity verification checks from one financial institution to be made available to other similar institutions or third parties.</p>



<p>In a quote from the President of the Barbados Teacher’s Co-operative Credit Union Limited, Ms. Sherry-Ann Scott-King stated – “We are metamorphozing our structure to embrace technological advances, and the use of blockchain technology is the solution to our KYC needs. Partnering with companies such as ShareRing reiterates this, and we’re excited to see the fruits of the project both for our members and the credit union, while ensuring we remain compliant with regulatory requirements.”</p>



<p>The key benefit for the credit union’s customer is having a streamlined digital process without compromising their data security. Using ShareRing’s encrypted ID technology, with its self sovereign and privacy-by-design features, means the customers remain in full control of their private and sensitive data.</p>



<p>“We’re very proud to deploy some of ShareRing’s core functionality to financial organizations in the Caribbean region. We are able to provide blockchain based eKYC solutions which facilitate heightened levels of security and trust between financial institutions and their customers” said Tim Bos, CEO and Founder of ShareRing.</p>



<p>—————————-</p>



<p>About ShareRing</p>



<p>ShareRing is a technology company which has created an ecosystem where individuals and organisations can transact in a secure and trusted digital environment. Central to establishing high trust levels is ShareRing’s encrypted self-sovereign ID solution, based on blockchain technology, creating an immutable “fingerprint” of an individual’s verifiable personal identity and documents. Self-sovereign means the individual retains full control over their own data since it resides solely on their personal device in an encrypted format, and is never stored centrally.</p>



<p>These features provide: security for the individual user and, confidence for the consumer of the data that the data provided has not been altered in any way since it was uploaded to the blockchain. Through the ShareRing Ecosystem, accessed via ShareRing Apps, ShareRing has created a number of products/solutions which digitize, streamline and radically improve processes across multiple industries and functions including health, financial services, events, travel &amp; hospitality.</p>

<p>Offering digital services is nothing new for the financial services industry. However, we have seen the pace of adoption has increased significantly during the COVID19 pandemic,&nbsp; and along with this has come a rise in fraud and other crime. With its basis in customer trust, security is crucial in the banking industry. Banks have to quickly adapt to the changing environment while ensuring they meet the highest levels of security and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Experts from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">IDnow, Ziglu, Santander, and Scotia Bank recently discussed</a> digitalization, customer onboarding, and digital identity in banking. In particular, how to embrace these technologies to offer the best customer experience whilst maintaining security and trust as the key drivers.</p>
 Growth in digital banking services 
<p>The events of the past 18 months have led to many changes in banking. Webinar participants agreed that the use of digital services has increased significantly, as has the range of services offered – not all of them expected before the pandemic. This has brought with it higher levels of customer onboarding and verification services.</p>
<p>As highlighted during the webinar, a <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">study by McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are now seven years ahead in digital transformation due to the pandemic. &nbsp;As an evidence of this remarkable adoption, IDnow shared that it has experienced a growth of up to 1,000% in the demand of verifications.</p>
 Rise in financial crime 
<p>Both unfortunately and unsurprisingly, the rise in digitalization has been accompanied by an increase in financial crime. At IDnow, we have seen overall fraud increases of around 250%&nbsp; – and a 180% rise in document fraud.</p>
<p>James Sullivan,&nbsp;Chief Operating Officer at Ziglu, also agreed and shared his experience at his organisation. James explained how over the past 12 months, they have seen an increase in fraud. This includes a significant rise in impersonation fraud, money mule activities, and scams. The lack of digital IDs in the UK is undoubtedly a contributing factor.</p>
 Building trust is vital for banks 
<p>Data security is paramount for all companies, most importantly for banks as they are the custodians of customers’ personal information and security is the foundation in trust. Rod Boothby, Global Head of Identity at Santander, explained his view of this and the importance to banks, saying:</p>
<p>“People trust banks as a store of their value. That means things like cash, securities, but also data. They know that banks will protect their data – which is very useful when you are trying to establish trust on the internet.”</p>
<p>Rod from Santander and Zemfira Khisaeva from Scotia Bank both highlighted how building trust online is critical. Without getting it right, they are not only risking security, but they are also potentially losing out on customers and revenue. Rod explained how recent digital identity approaches are being developed with data minimisation in mind, which would enable banks to request less information to customers when performing KYC processes.</p>
 ID verification as part of a digital strategy 
<p>The importance of digital identity verification is becoming more evident especially as both the volume of online services and the level of fraud increase. Roger Tyrzyk from IDnow explained how this is a hot topic in many industries now.</p>
<p>As banks add new services and functions, they also face different challenges. This includes thinking about new sources for digital identity, embracing new technologies and ensuring a seamless experience across multiple channels and bankend systems.</p>
<p>A primary drive of the changes we see from a verification technology point of view is how to ensure that the person is who they claim to be. Just capturing a photograph on an ID might not be enough.</p>
<p>Going forward there will be the need for more advanced techniques which can authenticate documents – some examples are the use of video techniques for checking dynamic security features and Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. The use of biometrics such as face, voice, or fingerprints will continue to be widely used as it is today, but the adoption of more robust data protection and security processes will also need to be considered.</p>
<p>Rod also agreed with this and expanded about the key difference between the physical world and the digital world. An ID document or passport can be produced in the physical world, but this is radically different in the digital world. How can it be proved that a person is who they claim to be in during a digital session?</p>
 Identity standards as a catalyst for trust 
<p>During the webinar, all participants expressed how standards shared between organizations are important too. Zemfira from Scotia Bank explained how banks in Canada use the same system to perform these verifications. Rod also shared how Santander (together with other banks) is working on developing an open ID trust framework for digital identity, which is aimed to standardise the verification approach not only for financial services, but also for other industries. Ultimately, this trust framework would allow organizations to onboard customers easily and securely, but with the customer in control of what data is shared.</p>
 Providing identity insurance for banking transactions 
<p>Another new development discussed was the introduction of identity insurance. This could see a small insurance premium on a transition to insure against fraud. Rod from Santander explains how this could greatly help trust and global financial inclusion, claiming that “By transferring the risk we allow people to act as though they are trusted everywhere.”</p>
 Importance of the user experience 
<p>Security, functionality, and better services are great, but what about the customer experience?</p>
<p>Zemfira pointed out that this is not something that has been so important in the past, with security and trust the main drivers. However, the focus has changed over the years as new generations come and challenger banks arise. User experience is moving from a ‘nice to have’ to a key differentiator amongst banks going forward.</p>
 How to achieve a great user onboarding experience 
<p>Participants also shared their views on KYC and the onboarding process, and how to make this process a good one for users. The suggested main areas of interest include:</p>
 
 Ensuring speed of customer onboarding. Users can give up if the process is slow. They are there to engage with your products and services, so get them doing this as soon as possible. 
 Reduce friction points. There is a level of “friendly friction” that customers are prepared to deal with, however it is important to communicate with the customer the value of your products and the reason for this ‘friction’. 
 Aim for a reliable solution: It is also very important to choose the right identity partner which systems and processes have been widely tested 
 
 Compliance is both important and challenging 
<p>There is a real challenge between regulatory requirements and friction points for customers during onboarding and verification. The art of finding the right balance between those two will be a key differentiator.</p>
<p>The regulatory ecosystem can be cumbersome to navigate for organisations as regulatory requirements typically differ from one country to another. Due to Brexit, UK companies operating in Europe, for example, will now need to acquire a licence in the countries they wish to operate and comply with local regulations. Another example are crypto currency companies with a licence in Europe that wish to onboard customers in Germany. With the implementation of the 5MLD in Germany, now these crypto companies are required to obtain a licence in Germany and comply with BaFin regulations, where a video-based verification is required.</p>
<p>Participants raised fact that the user experience will also be limited by local regulations. &nbsp;This is the case of Germany mentioned above and another example is Mexico, where onboarding can only be performed in person or via live video.</p>
<p>The lack of government digital IDs is also a limiting factor. This varies between countries. Countries like Estonia and Sweden, are well ahead with this. Sweden which uses BankID to onboard customers and Estonia the only country with a full digital identity which enables banks to onboard customers 100% using this. On the other hand, the UK is likely to face different challenges due to the lack of and identity document &nbsp;&nbsp;– James from Ziglu believes this is a leading contributor to the UK’s high level of financial crime.</p>
<p>James also raised the point about outsourcing and bank regulatory responsibility. There is a growing trend where financial services organisations are relying on third parties to perform their KYC processes. This is mainly due to the continuous developments of technologies which makes the processes more robust and reliable. However, it is important to mention that even though this process can be outsourced banks will still be responsible to choose the right partner and be aware on how they fulfil their regulatory responsibilities.</p>
<p>Learn more in our other banking blog article on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ekyc-europe-regulation-customer-experience/">how to balance regulation and customer experience</a>.</p>
 Looking to the future 
<p>It is always helpful with any technology to look at upcoming changes. Participants agreed that in the near future, changes would mostly come through improvement and maturing of current technology and reduction of errors in verification and KYC – rather than new developments.</p>
<p>Using existing tools to better outsmart fraudsters will be a critical area as we move forward and choosing the right partner who continuously innovate is vital in order to stay one step ahead of them. Fraud sophistication is increasing – including in areas that are not seen much yet, such as deep fake technology and quantum computing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is value in getting it right. Rod drew attention to <a href="mailto:https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">data from McKinsey</a> once again, which suggests that if we can solve the challenge of fraud and trust, it could add 3% to GDP in developed countries and up to 13% in developing countries.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to understand about these new regulations and their implementation. For some more insight from the experts, watch the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/webinar-banking-security-user-experience/">full webinar</a>. </p>

 Selective Disclosure: Share Just What You&nbsp;Want <p>What’s a good approach to protecting your online privacy and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">securing your digital data</a> from unauthorized access?</p><p>Undoubtedly, a complex question, right? But the answer can be simpler than you think, and in two words, the solution is <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> — a philosophy that empowers users to control the way their data is stored, accessed, and&nbsp;handled.</p><p>One of the driving principles of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> is a concept called Selective disclosure which enables individuals to share just what they want with others. It empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, you want to attend a musical show in your city, and due to the COVID pandemic regulations, the authorities have mandated complete vaccination as the entry criteria.</p><p>Traditionally, you would carry a physical card or a digital copy of the vaccination certification with you that certifies that you have taken the vaccines. But along with it, the show’s authorities would also get to know your full name, date of birth, the location where you were vaccinated, home address, phone number, and more, which is exposing a lot of information which is&nbsp;private.</p><p>Such additional information puts you at risk for data thefts, gender/racial bias, and loss of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>At the same time, how can you just reveal information about your vaccination by hiding other personal information?</p><p>Selective disclosure removes this conundrum.</p> What is Selective Disclosure? <p>Selective Disclosure is a concept that empowers the owner of a piece of data to disclose parts of a large data set, so the receiving entity knows just what’s&nbsp;needed.</p><p>As a result, an individual has the freedom to choose what is shared and no longer has to choose between an all-or-none approach. Undoubtedly, selective disclosure enhances an individual’s privacy and level of control over his or her personal information, including deciding who gets to see what data and how this data is used by&nbsp;others.</p> How to Implement Selective Disclosure? <p>In the context of SSI, selective disclosure is best implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> where the user has separate credentials for each piece of information such as his/her date of birth, full name, vaccination details, address, passport number,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>When required, all that the user has to do is create a verifiable presentation that contains just the data needed for verification. In our above example, the user has to create a verifiable presentation with his full name and his vaccination details and send it to the show’s authorities for verification.</p><p>Here’s how the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">VC</a> for this example can look like.

Rapid Transition Lab flow&nbsp;map<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that our food system is productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food system represents both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformation towards a sustainable food system. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a>[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead a global food system transformation.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food system may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards a sustainable and resilient food system, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food system. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food system; a system not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformation requires significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards a Swedish food system that promotes the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food system due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformation. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformation of the Swedish food system. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2019 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformation, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformation: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food system, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformation in the Swedish food system. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths. The Rapid Transition lab will complement these projects by focusing on the responses to Covid 19 pandemic in the Swedish food system and use these to build scenarios that in turn will be used to develop transformation strategies and identify capacities for&nbsp;change.</p> Further reading <p>More on Nordic food system transformation can be found in four policy briefs from the SRC, <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html</a></p><p>What can the COVID-19 pandemic teach us about resilient Nordic food systems? <a href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p> Who we&nbsp;are <p><a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre </a>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science.

<p>Enterprises are accelerating digital transformation initiatives in response to the rapidly evolving business landscape and a remote or hybrid workforce. Greater productivity is among the core benefits of these initiatives. But to realize these efficiency gains—and the additional advantages of a digital-first culture—you need to provide your workforce with access to every application and tool they need to do their jobs. And that’s often easier said than done.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Security leaders are faced with the new challenge of securing their organizations when very few users are on the corporate network. They need to give their employees the anytime and anywhere access they need to be productive, but not at the cost of security. Striking the right balance hinges on having confidence that the people requesting access are who they say they are and that they’re granted access to only those resources and sensitive data they’re authorized to use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Many websites have JavaScript functions that make network requests to a server, such as a REST API. The web pages and APIs are often in different domains. This introduces security issues in that any website can request data from an API. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) provides a solution to these issues. It became a W3C recommendation in 2014. It makes it the responsibility of the web browser to prevent unauthorized access to APIs.  All modern web browsers enforce CORS. They prevent JavaScript from obtaining data from a server in a domain different than the domain the website was loaded from, unless the REST API server gives permission.</p>

<p>From a developer’s perspective, CORS is often a cause of much grief when it blocks network requests. CORS provides a number of different mechanisms for limiting JavaScript access to APIs. It is often not obvious which mechanism is blocking the request. We are going to build a simple web application that makes REST calls to a server in a different domain. We will deliberately make requests that the browser will block because of CORS policies and then show how to fix the issues. Let’s get started!</p>

 Prerequisites to Building a Go Application 

<p>First things first, if you don’t already have Go installed on your computer you will need to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">download and install the Go Programming Language</a>.</p>

<p>Now, create a directory where all of our future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir cors
cd cors
</code>   

<p>Finally, we will make our directory a Go module and install the Gin package (a Go web framework) to implement a web server.</p>

   <code>go mod init cors
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
go get github.com/gin-contrib/static
</code>   

<p>A file called <code>go.mod</code> will get created containing the dependencies.</p>

 How to Build a Simple Web Front End 

<p>We are going to build a simple HTML and JavaScript front end and serve it from a web server written using Gin.</p>

<p>First of all, create a directory called <code>frontend</code> and create a file called <code>frontend/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Fixing Common Issues with CORS&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

            &lt;form id="form1"&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get v1" onclick="onGet('v1')"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Get v2" onclick="onGet('v2')"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The web page has a text area to display messages and a simple form with two buttons. When a button is clicked it calls the JavaScript function <code>onGet()</code> passing it a version number. The idea being that <code>v1</code> requests will always fail due to CORS issues, and <code>v2</code> will fix the issue.</p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>frontend/control.js</code> containing the following JavaScript:</p>

   <code>function onGet(version) {
    const url = "http://localhost:8000/api/" + version + "/messages";
    var headers = {}
    
    fetch(url, {
        method : "GET",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = data.messages;
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = error;
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>onGet()</code> function inserts the version number into the URL and then makes a fetch request to the API server. A successful request will return a list of messages. The messages are displayed in the text area.</p>

<p>Finally, create a file called <code>frontend/.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"github.com/gin-contrib/static"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func main() {
	r := gin.Default()
	r.Use(static.Serve("/", static.LocalFile("./frontend", false)))
	r.Run(":8080")
}
</code>   

<p>This code simply serves the contents of the <code>frontend</code> directory on requests on port 8080. Note that JavaScript makes a call to port <code>http://localhost:8000</code> which is a separate service.</p>

<p>Start the server and point a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to see the static content.</p>

   <code>go run frontend.go
</code>   
 How to Build a Simple REST API in Go 

<p>Create a directory called <code>rest</code> to contain the code for a basic REST API.</p>

<p>NOTE: A separate directory is required as Go doesn’t allow two program entry points in the same directory.</p>

<p>Create a file called <code>rest/server.go</code> containing the following Go code:</p>

   <code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strconv"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

var messages []string

func GetMessages(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	fmt.Println("Version", version)
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}

func main() {
	messages = append(messages, "Hello CORS!")
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/api/:version/messages", GetMessages)
	r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>A list called <code>messages</code> is created to hold message objects.</p>

<p>The function <code>GetMessages()</code> is called whenever a GET request is made to the specified URL. It returns a JSON string containing the messages. The URL contains a path parameter which will be <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>. The server listens on port 8000.</p>

<p>The server can be run using:</p>

   <code>go run rest/server.go
</code>   

 How to Solve a Simple CORS Issue 

<p>We now have two servers—the front-end one on <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, and the REST API server on <code>http://localhost:8000</code>. Even though the two servers have the same hostname, the fact that they are listening on different port numbers puts them in different domains from the CORS perspective. The domain of the web content is referred to as the origin. If the JavaScript <code>fetch</code> request specifies <code>cors</code> a request header will be added identifying the origin.</p>

   <code>Origin: http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>Make sure both the frontend and REST servers are running.</p>

<p>Next, point a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to display the web page. We are going to get JavaScript errors, so open your browser’s developer console so that we can see what is going on. In Chrome it is *View** &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools.</p>

<p>Next, click on the Send v1 button. You will get a JavaScript error displayed in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v1/messages’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request’s mode to ‘no-cors’ to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The message says that the browser has blocked the request because of a CORS policy. It suggests two solutions. The second suggestion is to change the <code>mode</code> from <code>cors</code> to <code>no-cors</code> in the JavaScript fetch request. This is not an option as the browser always deletes the response data when in <code>no-cors</code> mode to prevent data from being read by an unauthorized client.</p>

<p>The solution to the issue is for the server to set a response header that allows the browser to make cross-domain requests to it.</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:8080
</code>   

<p>This tells the web browser that the cross-origin requests are to be allowed for the specified domain. If the domain specified in the response header matches the domain of the web page, specified in the <code>Origin</code> request header, then the browser will not block the response being received by JavaScript.</p>

<p>We are going to set the header when the URL contains <code>v2</code>. Change the <code>GetMessages()</code> function in <code>cors/server.go</code> to the following:</p>

   <code>func GetMessages(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	fmt.Println("Version", version)
	if version == "v2" {
		c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>This sets a header to allow cross-origin requests for the <code>v2</code> URI.</p>

<p>Restart the server and go to the web page. If you click on <code>Get v1</code> you will get blocked by CORS. If you click on <code>Get v2</code>, the request will be allowed.</p>

<p>A response can only have at most one <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The header can only specify only one domain. If the server needs to allow requests from multiple origin domains, it needs to generate an <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> response header with the same value as the <code>Origin</code> request header.</p>

 Allowing Access from Any Origin Domain 

<p>There is an option to prevent CORS from blocking any domain. This is very popular with developers!</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</code>   

<p>Be careful when using this option. It will get flagged in a security audit. It may also be in violation of an information security policy, which could have serious consequences!</p>

 CORS in Flight 

<p>Although we have fixed the main CORS issue, there are some limitations. One of the limitations is that only the HTTP GET, and OPTIONS methods are allowed. The GET and OPTIONS methods are read-only and are considered safe as they don’t modify existing content. The POST, PUT, and DELETE methods can add or change existing content. These are considered unsafe. Let’s see what happens when we make a PUT request.</p>

<p>First of all, add a new form to <code>client/index.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;form id="form2"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="puttext" name="puttext"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="button" value="Put v1" onclick="onPut('v1')"/&gt;
    &lt;input type="button" value="Put v2" onclick="onPut('v2')"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>This form has a text input and the two send buttons as before that call a new JavaScript function.</p>

<p>Next, add the JavaScript funtion to <code>client/control.js</code>:</p>

   <code>function onPut(version) {
    const url = "http://localhost:8000/api/" + version + "/messages/0";
    var headers = {}

    fetch(url, {
        method : "PUT",
        mode: 'cors',
        headers: headers,
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("form2"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = data.messages;
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = error;
    });
}
</code>   

<p>This makes a PUT request sending the form parameters in the request body. Note that the URI ends in <code>/0</code>. This means that the request is to create or change the message with the identifier <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Next, define a PUT handler in the <code>main()</code> function of <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>r.PUT("/api/:version/messages/:id", PutMessage)
</code>   

<p>The message identifier is extracted as a path parameter.</p>

<p>Finally, add the request handler function to <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>This updates the message from the form data and sends the new list of messages. The function also always sets the allow origin header, as we know that it is required.</p>

<p>Now, restart the servers and load the web page. Make sure that the developer console is open. Add some text to the text input and hit the <code>Send v1</code> button.</p>

<p>You will see a slightly different CORS error in the console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v1/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn’t pass access control check: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request’s mode to ‘no-cors’ to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is saying that a preflight check was made, and that it didn’t set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header.</p>

<p>Now, look at the console output from the API server:</p>

 <code>[GIN] 2020/12/01 - 11:10:09 | 404 |  447ns |  ::1 | OPTIONS  "/api/v1/messages/0"
</code> 

<p>So, what is happening here? JavaScript is trying to make a PUT request. This is not allowed by CORS policy. In the GET example, the browser made the request and blocked the response. In this case, the browser refuses to make the PUT request. Instead, it sent an OPTIONS request to the same URI. It will only send the PUT if the OPTIONS request returns the correct CORS header. This is called a preflight request. As the server doesn’t know what method the OPTIONS preflight request is for, it specifies the method in a request header:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
</code>   

<p>Let’s fix this by adding a handler for the OPTIONS request that sets the allow origin header in <code>cors/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
}

func main() {
	messages = append(messages, "Hello CORS!")
	r := gin.Default()
	r.GET("/api/:version/messages", GetMessages)
	r.PUT("/api/:version/messages/:id", PutMessage)
	r.OPTIONS("/api/v2/messages/:id", OptionMessage)
	r.Run(":8000")
}
</code>   

<p>Notice that the OPTIONS handler is only set for the <code>v2</code> URI as we don’t want to fix <code>v1</code>.</p>

<p>Now, restart the server and send a message using the <code>Put v2</code> button. We get yet another CORS error!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Method PUT is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Methods in preflight response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is saying that the preflight check needs another header to stop the PUT request from being blocked.</p>

<p>Add the response header to <code>cors/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT")
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and resend the message. The CORS issues are resolved.</p>

 What Else Does CORS Block? 

<p>CORS has a very restrictive policy regarding which HTTP request headers are allowed. It only allows safe listed request headers. These are <code>Accept</code>, <code>Accept-Language</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, and <code>Content-Type</code>. They can only contain printable characters and some punctuation characters are not allowed. Header values can’t have more than 128 characters.</p>

<p>There are further restrictions on the <code>Content-Type</code> header. It can only be one of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, <code>multipart/form-data</code>, and <code>text/plain</code>. It is interesting to note that <code>application/json</code> is not allowed.</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens if we send a custom request header. Modify the <code>onPut()</code> function in <code>frontend/control.js</code>to set a header:</p>

   <code>var headers = { "X-Token": "abcd1234" }
</code>   

<p>Now, make sure that the servers are running and load or reload the web page. Type in a message and click the <code>Put v1</code> button. You will see a CORS error in the developer console.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field x-token is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any header which is not CORS safe-listed causes a preflight request. This also contains a request header that specifies the header that needs to be allowed:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-token
</code>   

<p>Note that the header name <code>x-token</code> is specified in lowercase.</p>

<p>The preflight response can allow non-safe-listed headers and can remove restrictions on safe listed headers:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X_Token, Content-Type
</code>   

<p>Next, change the function in <code>cors/server.go</code> to allow the custom header:</p>

   <code>func OptionMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT")
	c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Token")
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and resend the message by clicking the <code>Put v2</code> button. The request should now be successful.</p>

 Restrictions on Response Headers 

<p>CORS also places restrictions on response headers. There are seven whitelisted response headers: <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Content-Language</code>, <code>Content-Length</code>, <code>Content-Type</code>, <code>Expires</code>, <code>Last-Modified</code>, and <code>Pragma</code>. These are the only response headers that can be accessed from JavaScript. Let’s see this in action.</p>

<p>First of all, add a text area to <code>frontend/index.html</code> to display the headers:</p>

   <code>&lt;textarea id="headers" name="headers" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Headers&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the first <code>then</code> block in the <code>onPut</code>  function in <code>frontend/control.js</code> to display the response headers:</p>

   <code>.then((response) =&gt; {
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(response.error)
    }
    response.headers.forEach(function(val, key) {
        document.getElementById('headers').value += '\n' + key + ': ' + val; 
    });
    return response.json();
})
</code>   

<p>Finally, set a custom header in <code>rest/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.Header("X-Custom", "123456789")
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>Now, restart the server and reload the web page. Type in a message and hit <code>Put v2</code>. You should see some headers displayed, but not the custom header. CORS has blocked it.</p>

<p>This can be fixed by setting another response header to expose the custom header in <code>server/server.go</code>:</p>

   <code>func PutMessage(c *gin.Context) {
	version := c.Param("version")
	id, _ := strconv.Atoi(c.Param("id"))
	text := c.PostForm("puttext")
	messages[id] = text
	if version == "v2" {
        c.Header("Access-Control-Expose-Headers", "X-Custom")
	    c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:8080")
	}
	c.Header("X-Custom", "123456789")
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, gin.H{"messages": messages})
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the server and reload the web page. Type in a message and hit <code>Put v2</code>. You should see some headers displayed, including the custom header. CORS has now allowed it.</p>

 Credentials Are a Special Case 

<p>There is yet another CORS blocking scenario. JavaScript has a <code>credentials</code> request mode. This determines how user credentials, such as cookies are handled. The options are:</p>
 
   <code>omit</code>: Never send or receive cookies. 
   <code>same-origin</code>: This is the default, that allows user credentials to be sent to the same origin. 
   <code>include</code>: Send user credentials even if cross-origin. 
 

<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>

<p>Modify the fetch call in the <code>onPut()</code> function in <code>frontend/Control.js</code>:</p>

   <code>fetch(url, {
    method : "PUT",
    mode: 'cors',
    credentials: 'include',
    headers: headers,
    body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("form2"))),
})
</code>   

<p>Now, make sure that the client and server are running and reload the web page. Send a message as before. You will get another CORS error in the developer console:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Access to fetch at ‘http://localhost:8000/api/v2/messages/0’ from origin ‘http://localhost:8080’ has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn’t pass access control check: The value of the ‘Access-Control-Allow-Credentials’ header in the response is ‘’ which must be ‘true’ when the request’s credentials mode is ‘include’.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fix for this is to add another header to both the <code>OptionMessage()</code>, and <code>PutMessage()</code> functions in <code>cors/server.go</code> as the header needs to be present in both the preflight request and the actual request:</p>

   <code>c.Header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", "true")
</code>   

<p>The request should now work correctly.</p>

<p>The credentials issue can also be resolved on the client by setting the credentials mode to <code>omit</code> and sending credentials as request parameters, instead of using cookies.</p>

 Control CORS Cache Configuration 

<p>The is one more CORS header that hasn’t yet been discussed. The browser can cache the preflight request results. The <code>Access-Control-Max-Age</code> header specifies the maximum time, in seconds, the results can be cached. It should be added to the preflight response headers as it controls how long the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> and <code>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</code> results can be cached.</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Max-Age: 600
</code>   

<p>Browsers typically have a cap on the maximum time. Setting the time to <code>-1</code> prevents caching and forces a preflight check on all calls that require it.</p>

 How to Prevent CORS Issues with Okta 

<p>Authentication providers, such as Okta, need to handle cross-domain requests to their authentication servers and API servers. This is done by providing a list of trusted origins. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/enable-cors/overview/">Okta Enable CORS</a> for more information.</p>

 How CORS Prevents Security Issues 

<p>CORS is an important security feature that is designed to prevent JavaScript clients from accessing data from other domains without authorization.</p>

<p>Modern web browsers implement CORS to block cross-domain JavaScript requests by default. The server needs to authorize cross-domain requests by setting the correct response headers.</p>

<p>CORS has several layers. Simply allowing an origin domain only works for a subset of request methods and request headers. Some request methods and headers force a preflight request as a further means of protecting data. The actual request is only allowed if the preflight response headers permit it.</p>

<p>CORS is a major pain point for developers. If a request is blocked, it is not easy to understand why, and how to fix it. An understanding of the nature of the blocked request, and of the CORS mechanisms, can easily overcome such issues.</p>

Can SSI address&nbsp;them? <p>Absolutely, yes! COVID has enabled flexible work options that can take us to new places around the world. But, finding a place to rent in a new city may not be enjoyable, as you’ll have to navigate through different properties and neighborhoods, understand the prevailing tenancy laws, and maybe even work through the biases of landlords and property managers.</p><p>This is where SSI fits, as it can create trust regarding a tenant’s rental capacity, and in the process, reduce the&nbsp;bias.</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example. Let’s say, Lisa is an individual who decides to move to Berlin from Chicago to find a job. In the traditional setup, it’s difficult for Lisa to find a place because she can’t give any rental references in Berlin that a potential landlord can verify. She doesn’t have a job, so there’s a question of how she’s going to pay the&nbsp;rent.</p><p>With SSI, she can show her potential landlord that she has not missed even a single rental payment in the past, even though she had lived in a different country. Also, she can show her education credentials and working experience to prove that she is qualified enough to quickly find a job in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>This creates a sense of trust in the landlord, thereby helping tenants to find rentals&nbsp;easily.</p> Do you think SSI is a gamechanger in the real-estate industry? If yes,&nbsp;why? <p>Real estate is one of the sectors that has not completely embraced digitalization, and this means, there’s a lot of potential to bring about change in this&nbsp;sector.</p><blockquote>Currently, digital means sending documents such as payslips and past rental agreements in PDF format by email. In this new age of digital identity and verifiable credentials, there’s so much more that can be done such as identifying tenants with confidence based on verified information and being able to make informed decisions about tenant selection.</blockquote><p>And this is where SSI will be a gamechanger.</p><p>Further, landlords can confidently <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">comply with GDPR</a> and lower their exposure to risks associated with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd?gi=ee3cacaf54a7">data breaches and hacks</a>, because they have adopted a solution where tenants are in control of their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>In fact, using <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a> to check a potential tenant’s rental history is the first step. Soon, it can spill on to property management, property buying, and other aspects of real estate as&nbsp;well.</p> How can SSI address some of the urban housing challenges such as liveability? <p>Though sustainability and liveability can mean different things in different cities, there’s no doubt that every city must help its people to thrive day after&nbsp;day.</p><p>Housing is an important part of everyday life because good housing can enhance the quality of life and make living a lot less stressful. It can allow you to focus on other aspects of your life as&nbsp;well.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">SSI</a> brings about transparency in the housing market and removes frictions in finding a house. More importantly, the tenant’s documents that contain his/her PII can be shared safely and securely.</p><p>Another aspect is that there isn’t a lot of data around housing now. SSI provides the opportunity for rental data to be shared anonymously, so that at a city level better policy decisions can be made, developers can better understand market needs, and citizens can be more informed about, and active in, conversations around&nbsp;housing.</p><p>All these together can enhance the quality of life in a&nbsp;city.</p> How do you envisage the future of SSI in the real estate&nbsp;space? <p>At this point, there is a lot of hesitancy to adopt digitization in the real estate market. But that is changing as <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">COVID</a> has necessitated a push towards digital adoption.</p><p>Further, there is a considerable effort going at the highest national levels to create more awareness about digital identity, and overall, the next 3–5 years are expected to be big for&nbsp;SSI.</p><p>As more people take up flexible working opportunities and travel for new experiences, SSI gives them a secure way to prove their financial capabilities and rental histories across countries.</p><p>Leaders in the financial and government sectors are already testing out <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">SSI</a> and there’s such an opportunity for real estate to be bold, take advantage and be a frontrunner.</p><p>Note: opinions expressed here are the writer’s&nbsp;own.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/impact-of-self-sovereign-identity-in-real-estate-11456c4b1faa">Impact of Self-Sovereign Identity in Real Estate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

THE PRESENT&nbsp;MOMENT<p>Today, when the line between online and offline is blurred, what would it look like if we were to take a portrait?</p><p>Due to COVID-19 we have increased the proportion of the online world in our lives. Previously, the online world had a strong perception as a virtual world for entertainment such as games, but now the online world has become a reality that can offset the constraints of space and time in real public and private encounters. Participating in meetings through video conference, planning a ‘LAN drinking party’ with acquaintances, setting up a drinking table at their own home, and having a meeting are a daily scene where telecommuting and staying at home are encouraged. The trend of various metaverse worlds that are appearing one after another, provide a variety of options for self-expression. 2D and 3D avatars created according to each person’s taste become another ‘me’. Now, the portrait of ‘I’ living in ‘today’ is filled with the real me within the real landscape and the other half with the 3D avatar and unrealistic virtual world as the background.</p><p>It is not only the protagonist in the portrait that is divided into reality and virtuality. The contemporary online world completes a virtual landscape by absorbing various areas occupied by reality. Now, furniture, interior accessories, works of art, houses, buildings, and even land (real estate) fill the virtual world market, and active transactions are taking place. The emergence of ‘NFT’ in the field raises the value of virtual assets, which are digital files, to the value of real assets. NFT is an abbreviation of Non-Fungible Token, which refers to a ‘non-fungible asset’ registered in the blockchain. In the process of storing digital creations on the blockchain, a unique number such as a serial number is created, which gives rarity and uniqueness to digital creations. Digital files, which previously could be easily owned without quantitative restrictions through copy-paste, now exist as ‘the only original’ protected by a unique number, and the exchange of this technology will increase awareness of the existence of digital files and transaction methods.</p><p>In this exhibition, the NFT technology provided by CCCV was integrated into the exhibition and its various applications were exhibited. [Pick the NFT for CCCV] is designed to introduce new NFT works to the audience and check their reactions through voting. Visitors to the exhibition hall can vote for their favorite 3 out of the 20 NFT video works on display, and if the written work matches the top three final votes, they can win a prize. The total prize money for voting is 2 million won, and both the artist and the audience are given a chance to win. First, the first 1 million won will be shared among the three artists selected for the top-voted works, and the remaining 1 million won will be shared equally among the viewers who got all the top three final-vote matches&nbsp;. Next, in [Make your own NFT], you can experience the purchase and warranty of NFT works at once by requesting a portrait request. First, the visitor selects the artist who wants to create a portrait, and then purchases a portrait from the artist’s NFT page. Next, after discussing the background color and style of the work with the staff, fill a request form and submit it to the artist. The work will be delivered to the customer’s email and CCCV NFT box by the deadline specified in the request&nbsp;form.</p><p>NFT itself can be an inconvertible asset or work, but at the same time, it functions as a means of transaction for digital works and as a guarantee. In this exhibition, we would like to observe the possibilities of the integration of newly emerged NFT technology and art, and discuss the future changes based on this exhibition.</p><p>Written by Seo-Hee&nbsp;Bae</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-present-moment-cccv-first-nft-exhibition-2021-b82cf51bb307">THE PRESENT MOMENT: CCCV First NFT Exhibition 2021</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

This on-the-move life prevented the formation of lasting settlements.

<p>At Magic, we love to be where developers hang out. As a Developer Advocate, it’s especially fun to connect with devs dreaming up big ideas and hacking them into&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Back in April, the HackOn2.0 team reached out to me to talk about getting Magic involved in their next hackathon. We jumped at the opportunity and were so glad to support the HackOn2.0’s vibrant community.</p><p><a href="https://hackon.tech/">HackOn 2.0</a> is a week-long, global digital hackathon organized by Aditya Oberai, Rishabh Bansal, and team to bring developer’s ideas from inception to reality. This year’s edition focused on fostering innovation and also raised awareness on mental health and diversity.</p><p>A lot of people dedicated time to participate! 8,298 people registered. In total, there were 370 teams of 2–4 members&nbsp;each.</p><p>Participants built their hackathon projects based on these&nbsp;tracks:</p><p>Magic was proud to be a platinum sponsor. In addition, I was personally psyched to also be a mentor during the hackathon. The learning session set up for May 27th helped participants understand what Magic is and how to get started with&nbsp;it.</p><p>For the mentor session, you can catch the full video recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxwf6y7F424">here</a>.</p><p>“Best Hack built with Magic” was one of the categories for participants, in addition to the primary tracks. The participants were allowed to choose more than one sponsored track. We had the following prizes for participants:</p><p>It was exciting to see that 15% of all projects were built with&nbsp;Magic!</p><p>When it came to evaluating projects, selecting the winners was not an easy task. All of the projects were amazing and well-aligned to the primary track. In the end, we landed on the top 3 hacks that were focused on solving real problems and have utilized the best possible tech stack in this short time. A key criteria considered was how appropriately the project has implemented the Magic integration.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the winners — along with the problem they are solving, the technology used, important links, and their team&nbsp;members.</p> Winners  1. WeCare by&nbsp;Eternals  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>WeCare predicts the health risks to your body based on your daily health. The ongoing pandemic made everyone learn the importance of being healthy and how daily activities and diet play a major role in being healthy. Team Eternals wanted to alert the users of WeCare about any risk associated with a deficiency or unhealthy lifestyle by showing graphs and predictions using machine learning. WeCare has a smart predict feature that helps uncover latent diseases and predict the risk of future ones. Patients will be able to review medical conditions and reach their treatment goals much faster, lowering the risk of serious health complications.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, Python, Django, Apollo, GraphQL, Heroku, Firebase, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Harmanjit Singh, Kunal Khullar, Gurleen Kaur, and Paritosh&nbsp;Arora</p> Important Links <p><a href="https://wecare-h.web.app/">Frontend<br></a><a href="https://health-prediction-backend.herokuapp.com/">Backend</a><br><a href="https://youtu.be/u_vP7FN3ieM">Video&nbsp;demo</a></p> 2. ShopZop by Etherbots  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>The Covid-19 Pandemic has hit the small and medium-size businesses hard as they relied on their in-shop customers and had very little or no digital presence at all. And with the lockdown and movement restrictions, these businesses have suffered a lot. Team Etherbots came together to help connect the shop owners with customers and helping them. A simple solution was to harness the power of an application that almost every Smartphone user uses in India — WHATSAPP!. It will increase their online reach and solve the problem along with some&nbsp;revenue.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphCMS, GraphQL, WhatsApp, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Ayush Jain and Bhuvanesh Shathyan</p> Important Links <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QqZMSzL9Mg">video demo</a> of the&nbsp;product.</p> 3. Debately by&nbsp;tier-4  Problem it&nbsp;solves <p>Team tier-4 believes that debates help us have healthy discussions and solve problems within the society, helping us build a diverse and inclusive society. In the last few years, online and TV debates have been downgraded, and Tier-4 team members paired up to build an AI-based audio chat for the web using react, magic, webRTC, and symbal.ai to conduct and practice healthy debates. Debately enables individuals from all backgrounds, irrespective of race, religion, and region, to come together and debate on controversial or sensitive topics, share their opinions, or simply improve their language and communication skills while maintaining anonymity.</p> Technology used <p>ReactJS, WebRTC, FastAPI, MongoDB, SymblAI, Firebase, Magic</p> Team Members <p>Sanket Shevkar, Pranav Pathare, Aaryan Srivastava, and Gatij Taranekar</p> Important Links <p><a href="https://debately.study">Live demo</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZiDl7pNaOg">Video&nbsp;demo</a></p><p>HackOn2.0 not only let us to see how Magic fit into someone’s project and learn what features are performing well, but it also allowed us to connect with individuals, get to know them, and understand their perspectives related to solving real-world problems across topics like diversity and inclusion, mental health and awareness, Covid impact, and open innovation.</p><p>We were inspired to see participants tackle a specific problem statement, how devs interacted with different technologies, and successfully built a live demo in a few days. All while working remotely, too!</p><p>Overall, it was a very fun three days of meeting with community members. We gathered feedback and better understood the use case for Magic. It was also a great opportunity to collect more insights on improving product documentation for a better developer experience.</p><p>We look forward to participating in upcoming hackathons and further engaging with the developer community.</p><p>If you have any upcoming hackathons/meetups/conferences and want us to be part of your event, reach out to me on our <a href="https://discord.gg/magiclabs">Discord server</a> with the&nbsp;details!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-at-hackon2-0-9187d0e24d86">Magic at HackOn2.0</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the first interview in this series, Ontology speaks with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I first heard about Ontology back in early 2018 when ONT was listed on exchanges. I was looking for promising projects, so I discovered Ontology which I recognized as quite unique, in terms of its vision and consensus mechanism, as well as its focus on decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>As I was already impressed by the vision of Ontology, I wanted to engage more with the community so I joined its chat groups on Telegram where I discovered lots of amazing people. I was truly amazed by the quality of administrators who were very supportive. Therefore, I became an active member of those groups, and later, when I learned more, I was able to help the admins. I am convinced that when you believe in a project’s vision, you should support it in every way you&nbsp;can.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>The key role of a Harbinger is definitely to help community members while also spreading the word in order to increase the awareness of the project. Helping others is also my favorite part of being a Harbinger, as it gives me a lot of satisfaction when I know I’ve helped&nbsp;someone.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>To reiterate what I said in answer to the second question, “I am convinced that when you believe in a project’s vision, you should support it in every way you can”. Being an active part of the Ontology community is for me the best way I can personally support the project and help it to achieve its&nbsp;goals.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities? Is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Along with its main English chats, the Ontology community covers 30+ different language groups, which is quite unique in the blockchain space. By overcoming the language barrier, many more people from all around the world have access to information about the project. The Ontology community is very supportive of new members as Harbingers also serve as role models for&nbsp;others.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>My key channel is definitely Telegram, as I am an active administrator of the English <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">community</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyTradingOfficial">Trading group</a> and local <a href="https://t.me/OntologySlovakCzech">Czech &amp; Slovak groups</a>, while also helping out in groups like ONTO, Wing Finance and more. I also have active <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Twitter</a> and Reddit accounts where I actively interact with Ontology. Ontology also has an active YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">channel</a>, where I see some room for improvement. I would like to see more step-by-step guides and explanatory videos.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I remember someone from the Ontology team gave me the nickname “The Ontology Wikipedia”, ha-ha, that was when I realized I became an important part of the Ontology community, because I was recognized as a person who always had answers. To future Harbingers, I would suggest being patient with members, proactive with interactions and always hungry for information, as only then can you really help the community thrive.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>In only three? That’s tough I would say: dynamic, passionate and supportive.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more or less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Nothing is perfect, there’s always room for some improvement. To expand the community even more, I think it is important to stay in touch with community members. Especially to listen to their feedback and ideas. I would like to see more polls or votes about important things, which signals to people in the community that their voice matters. Community members can help the community grow by sharing Ontology articles, Twitter posts, commenting, etc. Also, actively using Ontology’s core products and recommending them to their own audience or friends to try&nbsp;out.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>During previous years, Ontology already proved it is here to stay and it is ready as never before to disrupt the verification process with their unique DID protocols. What I think will be a great milestone is implementation and active usage of decentralized identity and data by other projects. This is already starting to happen with partners like ROCKI, the NFT music platform. This should signal to the wider crypto space that Ontology is ready to be implemented all over the crypto industry. I always like to bring in the analogy between Chainlink with oracles and Ontology with DID. As Ontology acquires its first pioneer projects who actively and successfully use its technology, I expect a similar exponential boom as happened with oracles. It is time for DID to become a trigger word and the community can help with that. The crypto space is huge, therefore community members can help to bring us under the radar of the projects who could benefit from Ontology’s tech, as well as to raise awareness among crypto influencers.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p><p>Tune in next week for the second interview in the Ontology Harbinger Interview Series.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Key takeaways 
 
 
 
 Traditional custodians have an important role to play in digital asset custody 
 The key to compliant security token custody is digital identity 
 Digital identities enable token recovery (restitution obligations) 
 Custodians need access to the token smart contracts, not to the investors’ wallets 
 Security Token Custody = Wallets + Smart Contract Management + Digital Identities

					 Les échanges confidentiels et le partage de données sensibles : une problématique majeure en entreprise 
				 
				
			  
				
				
				 
					  
					 
						 Juliette Mégret 
						
					 
				  
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			  
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour échanger des informations entre collaborateurs, pour obtenir les statistiques de fonctionnement d’un serveur, ou bien pour que deux machines connectés d’une même ligne de production se synchronisent, l’échange de données est au cœur du fonctionnement de toute entreprise.</p>
<p>Que l’interaction ait lieu entre humains, entre humains et machines, ou entre machines, la protection des données sensibles est essentielle. Selon les échanges, l’anonymat des interlocuteurs doit autant être protégé que le contenu des échanges. Cela peut-être pour des questions de respect de la vie privée ; par exemple lorsqu’un employé communique avec la médecine du travail ; ou pour des questions de sécurité ; par exemple l’existence d’interactions avec un coffre physique ou numérique est une information qu’une entreprise souhaite généralement garder secrète.</p>
<p>La plateforme de Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) – identités numériques décentralisées entièrement contrôlées par leur propriétaire – développée par Unikname permet de répondre à cette problématique de façon simple et innovante.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les concepts de Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Le UniknameID, un identifiants basé sur les DID  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour manipuler une SSI, il est nécessaire de pouvoir l’identifier. Pour cela, le W3C a établi de nouveaux standards : <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">les DID</a> : Decentralized Identifiers. Les DID sont dérivés de matériel cryptographique, souvent illisible et impossible à mémoriser pour des humains. Afin de répondre correctement aux problématiques des entreprises, Unikname a développé <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">deux méthodes DID</a>, permettant conjointement de définir ses identifiants décentralisés humainement mémorisables :<a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/"> les UniknameID</a>.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://github.com/unik-name/did-method-spec/blob/main/did-uns/UNS-DID-Specification.md">La première méthode DID</a> désigne un crypto-account sur<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a>. C’est-à-dire que la méthode associe une identité au couple de clés cryptographiques asymétriques authentifiant toutes les transactions émises par le crypto-account.</p>
<p>Pour ce DID, le sujet est également le contrôleur. C’est-à-dire que l’objet qu’il identifie – le crypto-account – se contrôle lui-même. Grâce au matériel cryptographique dont est dérivé ce premier DID, toutes les transactions émises par <a href="https://www.unikname.com/my-unikname-app/">le crypto-account</a> lui seront irrévocablement rattachées.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En particulier si un crypto-account acquiert un NFT UNIKNAME, le DID qui y est attaché contrôlera totalement ce NFT. Le NFT UNIKNAME est une chaîne de caractères d’aspect aléatoire, à laquelle il est possible de rattacher des propriétés. Les caractères encodent en réalité une forme obscuricie d’un identifiant humainement mémorisable. Nous définissons ici la deuxième méthode DID, dont le sujet est le<a href="https://docs.unikname.network/tokens.html#the-unikname-token"> NFT UNIKNAME</a> et dont le contrôleur est le crypto-account propriétaire.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un UniknameID est un identifiant explicite, lisible et humainement mémorisable, stocké en dehors de la blockchain. Il est matérialisé sur Unikname Network par un NFT UNIKNAME ayant pour chaine de caractère la forme obscurcie de l’identifiant. Le propriétaire du UniknameID est le seul à pouvoir relier les formes explicite et obscurcie entre elles. La confidentialité d’un tel identifiant est donc totale. La première méthode DID, identifiant un crypto-account au NFT, permet de contrôler l’identité associée au UniknameID et de signer des transactions ou des messages en son nom.</p>
<p>Par la suite nous dirons qu’un UniknameID identifie une entité (Homme ou machine). Cette entité possédera les clés du crypto-account propriétaire du NFT UNIKNAME et sera contrôleur du UniknameID.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les « Verifiable Claim »  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le concept de Verifiable Claim (VC), <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-use-cases/">au sens du W3C</a>, est fortement associé à celui de SSI. Il s’agit de déclarations (claims) faites par une entité sur un sujet, et dont la paternité peut être vérifiée et datée par des mécanismes cryptographiques. Ces claims peuvent être stockées hors chaîne, de façon complètement privée et sous le contrôle des sujets. Les vérifications se font de façon autonome sans tiers de confiance centralisé.</p>
<p>Dans la solution développée par Unikname, les sujets de VC, comme les entités émettrices, sont identifiés par des UniknameID. Grâce à ces identifiants et aux DID de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/">la plateforme de SSI Unikname</a>, la paternité de l’entité et l’authentification du sujet peuvent être établies formellement.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Par exemple, un individu peut souhaiter faire valoir un diplôme pour prouver posséder certaines compétences, sans vouloir l’afficher publiquement. Le sujet est alors l’individu, et l’entité à l’origine de l’assertion est l’université ayant attribué le diplôme. La paternité de l’université est établie grâce au tampon sur le diplôme. L’individu conserve son diplôme chez lui, et le montre uniquement à son employeur au moment de justifier son niveau d’étude. Si l’employeur a confiance dans l’université, à la fois pour attribuer à juste titre un diplôme et pour gérer correctement son tampon, il reconnaîtra le niveau d’étude déclaré par le sujet du diplôme</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Grâce au standard des assertions vérifiables, il est possible de prouver des éléments d’une SSI, sans avoir à lister publiquement tous ses attributs.</p>
<p>Les preuves cryptographiques peuvent être stockées par le sujet, ou inscrites dans les propriétés du NFT UNIKNAME représentant le UniknameID dans la blockchain selon le besoin.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il est également possible de gérer des autorisations. Une entité capable de gérer des autorisations pourra émettre des VC pour des sujets, ce qui encadrera les opérations qui leurs sont autorisées. Par exemple, le service de sécurité délivrera des droits d’accès à une zone restreinte, ou bien une télécommande sera autorisée à actionner le démarrage d’une voiture… La vérification de ces droits se fait ici encore de façon décentralisée, directement par les intéressés. Il n’y a pas besoin de gestionnaire de droits centralisant toutes les autorisations. Il s’agit ici d’une avancée majeure : une telle entité représente une cible privilégiée pour un attaquant, et sa disponibilité est essentielle.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  La Blockchain Unikname Network  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Dans une entreprise, il peut être intéressant d’associer des UniknameID aux collaborateurs comme aux objets connectés. Le caractère lisible et humainement mémorisable du UniknameID sera un véritable plus pour les administrateurs système (qui sont encore des humains ) quelque soit l’entité qu’il désigne.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La plateforme de SSI Unikname propose un service de partage confidentiel d’informations entre identifiants. Les mécanismes décrits ci-dessus permettent d’utiliser la blockchain unikname.network comme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure#cite_note-dpki-20">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a> (DPKI) pour authentifier ces échanges. Cette infrastructure décentralisée garantit un faible coût de maintenance et une haute disponibilité des identifiants. Deux points essentiels dans la gestion d’un système d’information d’une entreprise.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les nombreux cas d’échanges protégés par Unikname  
			   
				
				
				  Un chat fortement sécurisé  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En distribuant des UniknameID à tous ses collaborateurs, une entreprise s’offre la possibilité d’établir un chat interne fortement sécurisé.</p>
<p>Par des mécanismes de DID et de VC, Unikname garantit l’intégrité des messages échangés ainsi que l’authenticité des expéditeurs. Ainsi, lorsqu’une personne reçoit un message d’un collaborateur, celui-ci est signé par son UniknameID. Le destinataire acquiert alors la certitude que le message n’a pas été falsifié et que l’émetteur déclaré est le véritable auteur du message. Il s’agit d’un point essentiel pour de nombreux échanges, en particulier pour message contenant des consignes de missions sensibles.</p>
<p>Des bots peuvent également être intégrés à la solution de chat, pour faire remonter des alertes par exemple. Un UniknameID étant attribué au serveur du bot, l’entreprise aura toujours la garantie de l’origine des informations.</p>
<p>Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les interactions entre objets connectés  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Un objet connecté est conçu pour accomplir une tâche spécifique parfois sensible : ouvrir des portes, déclencher une alarme, désactiver une arrivée d’électricité, etc.</p>
<p>Ces tâches sont déclenchées par la réception de données, ou par l’analyse d’une situation. Il y a un risque important de failles de sécurité lorsque les garanties d’intégrité et d’authenticité sont défaillantes.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>En identifiant ces objets par des UniknameID, on apporte ces garanties. Les échanges entre les objets sont également chiffrés, afin de protéger le contenu des interactions. La sécurité globale du système exploitant ces objets est augmentée de façon significative.&nbsp;Tous les messages échangés via la solution Unikname sont chiffrés de bout-en-bout, ce qui garantit une véritable confidentialité des échanges.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Des échanges de données vérifiables  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Les messages échangés entre entités peuvent être de simples messages mais aussi s’appuyer sur des assertions vérifiables comme nous les avons définies plus haut. Grâce à ce standard, le niveau de confiance accordé à un système où chaque entité est identifiée par un UniknameID est fortement élevée.</p>
<p>Les administrateurs de ce système peuvent aisément définir les entités capables d’émettre des assertions sur des sujets, ou de leur attribuer des autorisations. Ainsi, toute instruction peut être légitimée, et toute information avancée peut être vérifiée.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Unification des systèmes de partage  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>La force de la plateforme SSI Unikname, en plus d’être « privacy by design », réside dans son universalité. Les UniknameID permettent tous les types de partage de données : échange de message, partage de document de documents, synchronisation d’objets connectés, attribution et vérification de droits… Ils ne représenteront pas un n-ème identifiant à gérer, mais bien le seul, géré dans une application simple et dédiée aux besoins de l’entreprise</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Conclusion  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Chez Unikname, nous sommes convaincus que l’utilisation des Self-Sovereign Identity dans la société deviendra rapidement incontournable. Les garanties de sécurité, de confidentialité et de confiance qu’elles apportent répondront à de très nombreuses problématiques.</p>
<p>Les UnikameID définissent des SSI d’une grande facilité d’utilisation et de déploiement pour un coût très faible. Ils ont été pensés et développés pour s’intégrer naturellement dans le milieu de l’entreprise, et pour permettre de faire circuler de façon confidentiel et authentifiée des informations sensibles.</p>

<p>The WebTestClient is also an HTTP client designed for testing applications. It wraps WebClient and provides a testing facade for verifying responses. It can be used to perform end-to-end HTTP tests, binding to a running server. It can also bind to a controller or application context and mock requests and responses without the need for a running server.</p>

<p>Spring Security 5 provides integration with WebTestClient, and ships with SecurityMockServerConfigurers that can be used to mock authenticated users and authorized clients to avoid authorization handshakes during testing. This feature is handy for secured applications that access third-party OAuth 2.0 resources, as it will be explored in the following sections.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to:</p>

 Create a Secure Microservice with Okta Authentication 

<p>Start by building a simple microservice that returns the total count of a GitHub code search by keyword. The third-party service in this example is <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest">GitHub REST API</a>.</p>

<p>Create a microservice application using Spring Initializr and HTTPie. In a terminal window, request a Spring Boot Maven project with <code>webflux</code> for reactive, <code>okta</code> for security and <code>lombok</code>:</p>

   <code>http -d https://start.spring.io/starter.zip type==maven-project \
  language==java \
  bootVersion==2.4.5 \
  baseDir==search-service \
  groupId==com.okta.developer \
  artifactId==search-service \
  name==search-service \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.search \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta,lombok
</code>   
<p>NOTE: The <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/all">Lombok</a> dependency allows reducing boilerplate code with annotations, but requires additional configuration in your IDE to work. Check out the instructions at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">projectlombok.org</a></p>

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip search-service.zip
cd search-service
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Rename <code>application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, the following properties must be set:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    client-id: {clientId}
    scopes: openid, profile, email

service:
  github: https://api.github.com
</code>   

<p>Add security configuration for enabling OIDC authentication in the application. Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.search.security</code> and add the class <code>SecurityConfiguration</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.search.security;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.authentication.RedirectServerAuthenticationEntryPoint;

import static org.springframework.security.config.Customizer.withDefaults;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain configure(ServerHttpSecurity http) {

        http
            .authorizeExchange((exchanges) -&gt;
                exchanges.anyExchange().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2Login(withDefaults())
            .exceptionHandling()
            .authenticationEntryPoint(new RedirectServerAuthenticationEntryPoint("/oauth2/authorization/okta"));
        return http.build();

    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the configuration above, any request must be authenticated, and the authentication entry point will redirect to Okta. The entry point definition is required as a second client registration will be configured later in the tutorial for the third-party requests. For this example, login is enabled, to verify the flow with the browser.</p>

<p>Create a <code>com.okta.developer.search.controller</code> package and add a <code>SearchCount</code> class for the <code>totalCount</code> result:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.search.controller;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty;
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;

@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
public class SearchCount {

    @JsonProperty("total_count")
    private Integer totalCount;
}
</code>   

<p>Then add a <code>SearchController</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.search.controller;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.annotation.RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import static org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.reactive.function.client.ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction.oauth2AuthorizedClient;

@RestController
public class SearchController {

    @Value("${service.github}")
    private String apiUrl;

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;


    @GetMapping(value = "/totalCount/{keyword}")
    public Mono&lt;SearchCount&gt; getSearchCountAuthorized(@PathVariable String keyword,
                                                      @RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient( "github")OAuth2AuthorizedClient authorizedClient){
        return this.webClient.get().uri(apiUrl, uriBuilder -&gt; uriBuilder
                .path("/search/code")
                .queryParam("q", keyword).build())
                .attributes(oauth2AuthorizedClient(authorizedClient))
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(SearchCount.class);
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Independent of how the user authenticates, in this case using Okta, another client registration is in play for the search request.</p>

<p>The <code>SearchController</code> requires a <code>github</code> authorized client, that is set as an attribute in the WebClient. With this parameter, Spring Security will resolve the access token for accessing the GitHub REST API. Notice the controller automatically wires a <code>WebClient</code> instance that will be configured in the next section, along with the GitHub client registration. Also, notice the mentioned declarative composition of the request. The URI, parameters, request attributes, and response extraction are defined through method chaining.</p>

 Access an OAuth 2.0 Third-Party Resource with Spring WebClient 

<p>For the <code>WebClient</code> to handle the GitHub grant flow, it must include the <code>ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction</code> filter. Create the package <code>com.okta.developer.search.configuration</code> and add the class <code>WebClientConfiguration</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.search.configuration;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.registration.ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.reactive.function.client.ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.server.ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
public class WebClientConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public WebClient webClient(ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrations,
                               ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository authorizedClients)  {
        ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction oauth =
                new ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction(clientRegistrations, authorizedClients);

        return WebClient.builder()
                .filter(oauth)
                .build();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>The <code>ServerOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction</code> provides a mechanism for using an <code>OAuth2AuthorizedClient</code> to make requests including a Bearer Token, and supports the following features:</p>

 
   setDefaultOAuth2AuthorizedClient: explicitly opt into using <code>oauth2Login()</code> to provide an access token implicitly. For this use case, the <code>WebClient</code> is used to access a third-party service, so the tokens obtained from Okta are not valid for accessing GitHub. 
   setDefaultClientRegistrationId: set a default <code>ClientRegistration.registrationId</code>. This could be a useful option, as the <code>WebClient</code> would be already initialized with the required GitHub client registration. But for some reason, the integration test will not pick up the mock client registration, and a grant flow will be triggered to production GitHub. That’s the reason why instead of using this feature, the <code>WebClient</code> is passed the GitHub authorized client through attributes when invoked in the <code>SearchController</code>. 
 

<p>For the GitHub client registration, you need a GitHub account. Sign in and go to the top-right user menu and choose Settings. Then on the left menu, choose Developer settings. From the left menu, select OAuth Apps, then click on New OAuth App. For the example, set the following values:</p>

 
   Application name: search-service 
   Homepage URL: http://localhost:8080 
   Authorization callback URL: http://localhost:8080 
 

<p>Click Register application. Now, on the application page, click on Generate a new client secret. Copy the Client ID and the generated Client secret.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Edit your <code>application.yml</code> and set the following properties:</p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          github:
            client-id: {githubClientID}
            client-secret: {githubClientSecret}
</code>   

 Spring WebClient Testing with MockWebServer 

<p>For testing code that uses the WebClient, Spring Framework documentation recommends <a href="https://GitHub.com/square/okhttp#mockwebserver">OkHttp MockWebServer</a>, in the WebClient chapter. This recommendation should also be included in the Integration Testing chapter, as only clients that use <code>RestTemplate</code> internally are mentioned in that chapter. Different aspects of Spring <code>WebClient</code> and <code>WebTestClient</code> are covered across the three references Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Spring Security, and navigating through documentation is not an easy task.</p>

<p>For this example, the <code>MockWebServer</code> will mock the GitHub REST API. With this library and the help of Spring Security Test, hitting to production can be avoided, and the third-party authorization can be mocked.</p>

<p>Edit your <code>pom.xml</code> to add Spring Security Test and MockWebServer dependencies:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;5.4.5&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.squareup.okhttp3&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okhttp&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.squareup.okhttp3&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mockwebserver&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;4.0.1&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create the test class <code>SearchControllerIntegrationTest</code> with the following code:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.search;

import okhttp3.mockwebserver.MockResponse;
import okhttp3.mockwebserver.MockWebServer;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.AutoConfigureWebTestClient;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertyRegistry;
import org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertySource;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import java.io.IOException;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOAuth2Client;
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@AutoConfigureWebTestClient
public class SearchControllerIntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient webTestClient;

    public static MockWebServer mockWebServer;

    @BeforeAll
    static void setUp() throws IOException {
        mockWebServer = new MockWebServer();
        mockWebServer.start();
    }

    @DynamicPropertySource
    static void properties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) throws IOException {
        registry.add("service.github", () -&gt; "http://localhost:" + mockWebServer.getPort());
    }

    @Test
    public void testGetTotalCount(){

        mockWebServer.enqueue(new MockResponse()
                .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
                .setBody("{ \"totalCount\": 9}"));

        webTestClient
                .mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .mutateWith(mockOAuth2Client("github"))
                .get()
                .uri("/totalCount/bleble")
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().isOk()
                .expectBody().jsonPath("$.tocalCount", 9);
    }

    @AfterAll
    static void tearDown() throws IOException {
        mockWebServer.shutdown();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s break down what is going on in this test.</p>

<p>The <code>@BeforeAll</code> and <code>@AfterAll</code> annotated methods start and shut down the <code>MockWebServer</code> that will mock GitHub REST API. The <code>@DynamicPropertySource</code> annotated method overwrites the GitHub REST API URL and makes it point to the <code>mockWebServer</code> instance.</p>

<p>The call to <code>mockWebServer.enqueue()</code> sets up the mock response for the third-party call.</p>

<p>In the <code>WebTestClient</code>, the test request is configured with a mock <code>OidcUser</code> with the <code>mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())</code> call, avoiding some kind of simulation of the grant flow with the Okta authorization server.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, independent of how the user authenticates, there is a second client registration in play for the request under test. The call <code>mutateWith(mockOAuth2Client("github"))</code> creates an OAuth2AuthorizedClient, avoiding the simulation of a handshake with the third-party authorization server.</p>

<p>Run the integration test with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw test
</code>   

<p>Now, run the application to manually verify the request flow with a browser.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Open an incognito window and go to <code>http://localhost:8080/totalCount/root:%20DEBUG</code> to request a code search for the string <code>root: DEBUG</code>.</p>

<p>First, the authentication flow will redirect to Okta for the login:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you sign in with your Okta user, Spring Security will trigger the GitHub authorization flow, to instantiate the authorized client required for the API request:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After the GitHub login, then you must authorize the search application for sending requests to the GitHub REST API on your behalf:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After you authorize access, the search result will show:</p>

   <code>{"total_count":114761362}
</code>   

 Learn More About Reactive Spring Boot and WebClient 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and got a clear picture of WebClient testing for applications that access third-party services. As mentioned before, <code>WebClient</code> and <code>WebTestClient</code> documentation pieces are covered in the three references, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Spring Security, so I recommend taking a thorough look at all of them.</p>

<p>An additional aspect to explore is how to add layering, given that client registrations must be injected as controller parameters, to trigger the authorization flows when required.

 Web 2.0 vs Web 3.0 — A Bridge Between the Past and the&nbsp;Future <p>Web 2.0 represents the Internet as we know it today and includes all the blogs, social media sites, shopping, news generation, and&nbsp;more!</p><p>It is marked by user-generated content, interoperability across different services, usability, interactiveness, and high levels of participation. While this may seem like a huge leap from the static pages of web 1.0, in reality, there have been little to no changes to the core definition between the two versions.</p><p>What has really changed is the way we use existing infrastructure, and from this standpoint, it’s safe to say that it’s really the front-end that has seen the bulk of changes in web&nbsp;2.0</p> Salient Features of Web&nbsp;2.0 <p>In Web 2.0, users&nbsp;can</p>  Classify and sort information  Create and develop APIs for interoperability across different software  Create and share dynamic and responsive content with&nbsp;others  Send and receive information from different sources  Access content from mobile devices, multimedia consoles, televisions, and&nbsp;more  <p>From the above features, we can say that the pillars of Web 2.0 are mobile technology, social media, and the&nbsp;cloud.</p><p>Will these pillars continue their dominance in web&nbsp;3.0?</p><p>Unlikely, because these technologies don’t create a sense of trust among the entities participating in an interaction because of a lack of built-in security and authorization mechanisms.</p><p>As users and technologies become more mature, there emerged a greater need for trust, security, privacy, and control. And this need led to the evolution of web&nbsp;3.0.</p> What’s Web&nbsp;3.0? <p>Web 3.0 is truly a big leap from web 2.0 as the backend and the infrastructure are going through a transformation. Also known as the Semantic Web, this generation of the Internet uses an advanced metadata system that structures and arranges all kinds of data in such a way that it’s readable by both machines and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Probably the biggest advantage of web 3.0 is that the information will be universal and can be found by anyone, which means no more digging through content for hours to find what you&nbsp;want.</p><p>Now, you might wonder how it overcomes the drawbacks of web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Well, the pillars of web 3.0 are artificial intelligence and decentralized networks.

Elemental Chat Demonstrates new P2P Possibilities<p>We have reached an important point for Holo as we progress towards the release of the hosting platform. The Pre-Release test of Hosted Elemental Chat continues successfully with more than 200 peers chatting across the world. Messages arrive quickly and participants report a real-time chat experience using the app. Elemental Chat is testing the end-to-end infrastructure of a peer-to-peer Holochain application being hosted by the peer-to-peer Holo hosting network. This demonstrates potentially massive new possibilities on the web. Why do we say&nbsp;that?</p>Current stats visible to all users in Elemental Chat<p>What this means is that each user, when they create their credentials, are creating the cryptographic keys for their instance of the application. Holo cannot write chats on their behalf — ever. Holo cannot remove an entry for a user — ever. The only thing Holo can do, as the infrastructure provider that bridges the connection to the centralised Internet, is prevent an application from being hosted on the platform. Applications of course have their own sets of rules and the creators and developers of those applications will design&nbsp;those.</p><p>I’ve asked a few team members to share about what this means — just to give everyone a sense of how important these results really&nbsp;are.</p><p>“When I use elemental chat knowing my friends and all of humanity is hosting the service I’m using, the internet feels human and fresh all over again.” — David&nbsp;Atkinson</p><p>“We’ve proven that the Holo hosting product, which is a complex system of distributed hApps and centralised infrastructure and which underpins the Holo ecosystem and HoloFuel, works.” — Alastair&nbsp;Ong</p><p>“This release is the first release where we’re delivering value to individual web users. Now, ANYONE can participate in Hosted Elemental Chat, you don’t have to be a host.” — Rob&nbsp;Lyon</p><p>“Hosted EC is a seed of digital agency using a browser and a basic internet connection.” — Lisa&nbsp;Jetton</p><p>Each of us on the Holo team have different personal reasons, drives, and perspectives as to what Holochain and Holo enable in the world and why it matters. Arthur has shared much about this in his blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-4ac6045ac894">unclosable carriers and the future of communication</a>. Many on the team see Holochain as a distributed infrastructure that can digitally support the distributed coordination required to face and overcome the most pressing global and local challenges of governance and collaboration that lie&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Some of us are excited to enable, at a structural level, the choice about how and where data is stored and who has access to it. Others in our team are concerned about the lack of transparency and the coercive tendencies associated with providers of mainstream Internet services, and are delighted that developers can now replace those apps on Holochain.</p><p>We see the positive test results from Hosted Elemental Chat as a beacon of what is to&nbsp;come.</p> So What’s&nbsp;Next   We launched an update to the <a href="https://holo.host">Holo.Host</a> website. Surprise!  We are ready for people to <a href="https://register.holo.host/elemental">pre-register to try Elemental Chat in a web&nbsp;browser</a>.  We are continuing the pre-release test and plan to add even more users in the coming&nbsp;week.  We are releasing a new version of Holochain for developers this&nbsp;week.  We are testing read-only functionality on Holo so that folks who do not want to login to chat can have visibility to the prototype.  We are working to get the HoloPort Alpha Program ready for hosts to register so that we have enough ports online to support the open release of Hosted Elemental Chat and so that they can begin accruing HoloFuel.  We are continuing to work on sharding in Holochain — moving this week to integration testing of this key scalability feature.  We are working on the new HoloFuel&nbsp;hApp.  We are testing Elemental Chess on&nbsp;Holo.  <p>This is a busy summer for Holo and Holochain. More&nbsp;soon.</p><p>– Mary</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holo-hosted-elemental-chat-in-a-browser-9be7ad4cbe01">Holo Hosted Elemental Chat in a Browser</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About ShareRing</p>



<p>ShareRing is a technology company which has created an ecosystem where individuals and organisations can transact in a secure and trusted digital environment. Central to establishing high trust levels is ShareRing’s encrypted self-sovereign ID solution, based on blockchain technology, creating an immutable “fingerprint” of an individual’s verifiable personal identity and documents. Self-sovereign means the individual retains full control over their own data since it resides solely on their personal device in an encrypted format, and is never stored centrally.</p>



<p></p>



<p>These features provide: security for the individual user and, confidence for the consumer of the data that the data provided has not been altered in any way since it was uploaded to the blockchain. Through the ShareRing Ecosystem, accessed via ShareRing Apps, ShareRing has created a number of products/solutions which digitize, streamline and radically improve processes across multiple industries and functions including health, financial services, events, travel &amp; hospitality.</p>

 Simplifying Multi-Network on Ocean with a Unified Interface   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality  🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market  🐋 Multi-Network Aquarius   🦑 The New&nbsp;Reality <p>When we launched the Ocean Market as part of v3 we had <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">just moved onto ETH Mainnet</a> from our own custom PoA Mainnet, so all focus for the user interface went into working against that one production network. As we deployed the Ocean Protocol contracts to more chains to escape rapidly rising transaction fees, the main interface paradigm, of basing the displayed metadata on the user’s connected network quickly became a pain to use. Hello, Could not retrieve asset.&nbsp;🙃</p><p>So we sat down and figured out the best patterns to solve these main pain points, focusing solely on the end user perspective:</p>  Reduce friction when following links to assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Retain the DID and existing URLs as the unique identifier for an asset, regardless of&nbsp;network  Increase discoverability of assets outside of ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Increase discoverability of all networks Ocean Protocol is deployed&nbsp;to  Encourage usage of networks beyond just ETH&nbsp;Mainnet  Reduce need to switch wallet networks as much as possible when browsing the&nbsp;market  Any possible solution needs to scale easily as we continue deploying to more&nbsp;networks   🧜‍♀️ Multi-Network Market Leeloo agrees words with “multi” in front are&nbsp;better.<p>Ultimately, we arrived at a solution tackling all this, where the main new paradigm is an interface showing assets mixed from multiple networks. All the time and on every screen where assets are listed. This detaches the metadata and financial data source from the user’s wallet network as it was&nbsp;before.</p><p>The displayed networks are now controlled by the new network selector.</p>The new network selector and revised menubar in the Ocean Market interface.<p>By default, we auto-select all production networks Ocean Protocol is deployed to. As soon as you interact with this new network switcher, your selection takes over and is saved in your browser so it will be the same the next time you come to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Selecting or de-selecting networks then modifies all Elasticsearch queries going to our new Aquarius, resulting in mixed assets on&nbsp;screen.</p>Mixed assets from multiple networks.<p>All assets now indicate which network they belong to, and you are prompted to switch to the asset’s network when we detect your wallet being connected to another&nbsp;network.</p>One remaining place where user wallet switching is still important.<p>And in the case of using MetaMask, we added actions to switch your wallet network directly from the UI, which, as of right now, is pretty much the most streamlined user flow possible to switch networks with MetaMask from a&nbsp;Dapp.</p><p>With all this, wallet network switching is now only needed once you want to interact with an asset, like downloading or adding liquidity to its&nbsp;pool.</p><p>User wallet network also stays important for publishing an asset, so we based the whole publish form on the currently connected network to define onto which network an asset is published.</p>Publish form with network indicator.<p>As for our key market statistics in the footer, we switched it to show consolidated numbers as a sum of all production networks. In its tooltip, you can find the values split up by&nbsp;network.</p>New consolidated market statistics based on each&nbsp;network.<p>More assets on screen and more controls also led to further UI tweaks to get more space available to the actual main content. We completely refactored the main menu layout, added a global search box to it, and moved some warnings around. And, while we were at it, improved the mobile experience for it.&nbsp;✨✨</p>Everything you need from our menu is all there in mobile viewports<p>And finally, we also automatically migrate all your existing bookmarks from all the networks and combine them into one&nbsp;list.</p> Developer Changes <p>For developers, there are new values in app.config.js controlling the networks which are displayed in the network selection popover:</p><p>- chainIdsSupported: List of all supported chainIds. Used to populate the Networks user preferences list.<br>- chainIds: List of chainIds which metadata cache queries will return by default. This preselects the Networks user preferences.</p><p>In the background, the code base changed drastically. We now have only one Aquarius but still multiple providers and especially subgraphs, and we had to also technically detach the wallet network from the data source. E.g. for showing prices and financial data, main refactoring work went into correlating the assets based on ddo.chainId with the respective subgraph and querying multiple subgraphs at the same time as needed. For this, we also simplified our GraphQL setup and switched from <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/">Apollo Client</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql">urql</a>.</p><p>If you’re interested in all the detailed code changes, you can follow along with the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/pull/628">main Pull Request</a> which has references and screenshots for all other changes done against it. This is also the best place to start if you run your own fork of the market and want to integrate the latest multi-network changes without looking at just one big change in&nbsp;main.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/market/pull/628">Multinetwork Interface by kremalicious · Pull Request #628 · oceanprotocol/market</a></p> Check it&nbsp;out! <p>Head to <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">market.oceanprotocol.com</a> and see assets currently mixed from 3 networks by&nbsp;default.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a></p><p>You can find all the values required to connect your wallet to the networks Ocean Protocol is deployed to in our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supported networks</a> documentation, along with a guide on how to <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/#set-up-custom-network">set up a custom network in MetaMask</a>.</p>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">Supported Networks</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/#set-up-custom-network">Set Up MetaMask Wallet</a>   🐋 Multi-Network Aquarius <p>Aquarius got a complete refactor. Besides numerous optimizations and stabilization, this new Aquarius indexes assets from multiple chains and delivers them all together in its API responses, with a new ddo.chainId value as part of each asset’s metadata.</p><p>In addition to making an interface with mixed assets possible, this also brings a huge maintainability advantage as now only one Aquarius instance has to be deployed and maintained instead of one for each supported network.</p><p>So multiple Aquarius instances are now reduced to one instance, where for every network a specific indexer is started. The <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/references/aquarius/">Aquarius API</a> got a new endpoint exposing which chains are indexed under /api/v1/aquarius/chains/list.</p>/chains/list endpoint response exposing indexed chain&nbsp;IDs Migration to Multi-Network Aquarius <p>Aquarius v3.0.0+ is the&nbsp;one.</p><p>If you use our remote Aquarius instances, all you have to do is point your app against the new aquarius.oceanprotocol.com and then in your interface do things based on ddo.chainId, like modifying your Elasticsearch queries to include assets from specific networks.</p><p>We will keep the old dedicated network instances like aquarius.mainnet.oceanprotocol.com running until September 1st, 2021, and we encourage everybody to migrate to aquarius.oceanprotocol.com instead.</p><p>With one Aquarius indexing multiple chains it is rarely useful to return all the assets as most likely you are only interested in production network assets when listing them in an app. So we will also remove the GET /assets/ddo endpoint and suggest to replace it with a specific search query to POST /assets/ddo/query, and include the chainId you want,&nbsp;like:</p> {<br>  page: 1,<br>  offset: 1000,<br>  query: {<br>    query_string: {<br>      query: 'chainId:1 AND -isInPurgatory:true'<br>    }<br>  }<br>} <p>If you have your own instances deployed we suggest to deploy a new one with v3.0.0+ to have everything reindex, and finally switch your URLs in your app to this new deployment and adapt your app interface accordingly.

Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/">eftpos</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/">FinTech Australia</a>, established the <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/news/eftpos-launches-advisory-committee-to-give-FinTech-a-voice">eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee</a>. The Committee was established as a way of giving Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network for the betterment of Australia’s digital economy.




 




Over the past five months, ten leading FinTech companies joined the Committee, chaired by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bentabell/?originalSubdomain=au">Ben Tabell</a>, eftpos’ Chief Information Officer. Together, the Committee collaborated to help create an initial report on how to best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap, API programs along with a variety of industry topics.




 





<blockquote>Enabling Australian FinTechs a direct avenue to discuss how they partner and collaborate to access the eftpos payments network through the Committee resulted in recommendations that covered a number of central themes, including consultation and engagement, regulation, and technology and solutions<p></p>Ben Tabell, eftpos Chief Information Officer and Committee Chair</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco </a>is honoured to have been one of the companies invited to join the Committee alongside <a href="https://assemblypayments.com/">Assembly Payments</a>, <a href="https://www.bleuco.com/">Bleu</a>, <a href="https://www.monoova.com/">Monoova</a>, <a href="https://www.sniip.com/">Sniip</a>, <a href="https://verrency.com/">Verrency</a>, <a href="https://www.ezypay.com/">Ezypay</a>, <a href="https://www.azupay.com.au/">Azupay</a>, <a href="https://www.polipayments.com/">POLi</a> and <a href="https://www.paypaplane.com/">Paypa Plane</a>.




 




The aim of the Committee is to advise eftpos on ways the company can build on its efforts to make it easier for FinTechs to access the eftpos network, products and services. The focus is to enable FinTechs to build experiences that can work across a broad range of connected devices in the digital economy.




 




eftpos has now released the report in collaboration with FinTech Australia, delivering ten recommendations on how Australian fintechs can best leverage the eftpos digital roadmap and API programs.




 




Of the recommendations in the report, Meeco is especially interested in the inclusion of data as the new currency, mobile wallets and digital identity. These map directly to the work Meeco has had the privilege to explore and validate together with eftpos over the past year. This includes a <a href="https://hedera.com/blog/eftpos-pioneers-new-ecommerce-micropayments-solution-using-hedera-hashgraph">micropayments Proof-of-Technology</a> using Meeco’s multipurpose wallet decentralised on Hedera and a pilot that is now underway with eftpos’ identity broker solution, <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/payment-solutions/payment-solutions-for-business/connectid">connectID</a>, for credentials verification as part of employee onboarding.<br><br>We’re delighted that this work with eftpos and <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera Hashgraph</a> has resulted in us being selected as a FinTech Australia <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announced-as-finnies-2021-finalist/">Finnies finalist in the “Excellence in Blockchain/Distributed Ledger” category</a>. The Finnies event and announcement of winners is now delayed to September, due to the rolling COVID restrictions in Australia.




 




The eftpos FinTech Advisory Committee Report; Innovating on the domestic card rails, is now available to download.




 





 
 <a>Read the report</a> 
 





 




We would like to thank eftpos and FinTech Australia for the opportunity to have contributed to the Committee and the report.  We hope you find it interesting and useful.

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Peter some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the problems of the identity's status quo today?</p>
<p>
Yeah, the identity status quo today. This is a tricky question because what we see these days is we get more and more in this area where we need identity, where you need to authenticate yourself in a more deeply- and highly-connected environment. And since one of our main [areas of] focus or visions for Bosch is the Internet of Things [IoT]. And we see a more and more connected car, connected to the infrastructure, connected to the smart city, [and connected] to anything else, even to the streets and the crossroads now. There you need to have a particular idea where you can say, okay, you need to upload or download data from the car, and then the infrastructure or the car needs exactly to know who does that. Where the car data comes from and who you are.  
</p>
<p>And so today the ID is getting more and more important because without an ID, you have not the chance to do anything when it comes to smart traffic, smart city or anything like that, or anything with dealing with the IoT. So therefore it's [important]. And the problem that I see personally as well is [that] really these days, you only have these federated systems of ID. You get your ID on the internet via Apple, Google, Amazon, or any other proprietary systems. And so, if you have really, really safety critical stuff, I do not really trust these other systems when it comes to highly critical data which needs to be transmitted. And if my ID is really stored somewhere [on someone] else's computer or server or any backend, this could be getting a bigger and bigger problem in the future.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How can decentralized identity solve pressing identity issues? Why is this particularly relevant to the mobility industry?</p>
<p>
Yeah, exactly. I think we definitely can shoot at these problems - what I just said, because when we talk about decentralized identity, you do not have these intermediaries in the background again anymore. So, what we have here is decentralized. We have another system of governance. We have another system of control. So, for one particular technical system like self-sovereign identity, for example, you are really self-sovereign of your data. So, you [are] controlling your own ID, your own identity, and you control what kind of data you are giving to the other site when you talk to anyone in the internet or Internet of Things. And so, when you talk about mobility, and you go into your car, not only yourself need to digital identity, the car itself - as a device - needs identity as well.</p>
<p>
And if in the future, if you think about [car] charging, for example, parking or zoning in a smart city, or anything like that, then you always – what I said before - you need to authenticate or authorize yourself to do anything and as well, maybe to buy things or to sell things, data in the car. And then absolutely it's so important that you can control what you are doing exactly with your data. Therefore, decentralized systems are quite important. And my hypothesis here, is it won't go without it in the future. Of course, Amazon, Google, or the likes can tell you, okay, trust us, the data is safe, and we can do it on premise and all that stuff, but on really the safety critical things, I do not trust anyone. I do only trust myself in these cases because when it goes about the life of the driver, for example, the safety of one, then we have to trust the person themselves, and that is possible really only with decentralized systems.     
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>When will decentralized identity become a reality? </p>
<p>
If you would have asked me like a year ago, I would have said maybe like five or 10 years. We are very far from it because automated driving, as well, needs a longer time. However, things have changed because we are going now in a phase where the governments are making a lot of pressure to really enforce the industry to use these digital identities. And especially there's one very interesting development at the moment that the German government, for example, they are pressing on using self-sovereign identity. </p>
<p>And so, with that, the time is getting faster and faster, or the development time is getting faster and faster. And I expect now to be able to use these systems, like in one, two years already. And together with this, we are in a huge collaboration mode with Gaia X in Europe at the moment. And so this helps again, because we have all the industry groups, a lot of startups, [and] a lot of universities coming together, working on these problems in a very fast mode. And so this helps us maybe in having [within] two or three years’ time, really scalable and usable systems out there.   
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Could you share some insights on your presentation at EIC 2021? </p>
<p>
Right, I already started it, featured it a little bit. Trust is really the key concept because when you talk about, maybe, automated driving, then you need to trust the infrastructure. You need to trust the data which comes into the car because the car has to take some decisions. Where to drive, how to drive and as well, the driver gives some very trustworthy data to the car and to the infrastructure. And that is in a lot of different use cases. You need that trust relationship, and you need technical systems that help you with that. And so there are some use cases I would really talk about a little bit deeper and try to explain  what is the situation today. How would we solve this today, and how would we solve that problem or challenge with these new technologies we are seeing upcoming.  </p>

 The Healthcare Industry Has Been Ravaged by Data Breaches and Should Expect More, but Blockchain Can&nbsp;Help  By Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and&nbsp;data <p>In May of this year, the Republic of Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE), <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-57184977">suffered</a> a “catastrophic” cyberattack. In addition to directly causing the number of hospital appointments in some areas of the system to drop by 80%, the hackers also stole and shared <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13d33a08-ce83-4f8a-8d93-a60a5e097ed8?segmentid=acee4131-99c2-09d3-a635-873e61754ec6">sensitive medical and personal information</a> of patients online as well as details of correspondence with patients. While three quarters of the HSE’s servers have been unlocked since the attack, the HSE’s CEO recently <a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/hse-cyber-attack-around-75-of-systems-now-unlocked-but-weeks-of-disruption-still-ahead-1214684">said</a> that it will still be “many more weeks” before health services return to&nbsp;normal.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the UK, statistics from the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/data-nhs-patient-breaches-privacy-b1877154.html">show</a> that 3,557 personal data breaches were reported across the health sector, the majority within the NHS, in a two year period to the end of March this year. Not all data breaches are reported, so the total is likely to be much higher. The private health data of thousands of people was shared with strangers, with one patient even having strangers turning up at her door to let her know her private details, including her home address, had been mistakenly sent to other patients. Malicious actors have the opportunity to blackmail and disrupt the system when they gain access to sensitive health information, which is arguably the lifeblood of our societies’ public&nbsp;health.</p><p>Data breaches and the potential for data breaches such as this are a perfect example of the dangers of storing sensitive identity and health data on centralized systems. While the continued rise of digital services have made maintaining a secure digital identity, a trusted digital format of a company or person’s identity, increasingly important, unfortunately, many healthcare facilities and systems still use centralized systems such as excel spreadsheets on centralized computer systems that are easy for malicious actors to hack — or even pen and paper — to house patient data. In order for health data to be stored securely, it should be stored on decentralized systems built on blockchain technology that are encrypted and&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Digital transformation, accelerated by the pandemic in areas from cloud computing, big data, ecommerce, and, perhaps most importantly, health, is continuing to pick up pace. In healthcare, there is enormous potential for digital transformation and the increasing use of health data to improve the efficiency of systems and wellbeing of people worldwide.</p><p>In the US, innovation in healthcare and increasing reliance on health data has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/health-clouds-are-set-to-play-a-key-role-in-healthcare-innovation/">compared</a> to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Elsewhere, the reliance on data is strong, the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care recently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft/data-saves-lives-reshaping-health-and-social-care-with-data-draft">published</a> a policy paper titled “Data Saves Lives”. This paper asserted that in the midst of “the greatest public health emergency that this country has tackled for generations” data was essential in identifying those “who are most vulnerable to coronavirus” helping the system to protect its citizens. Data was essential in their progress in the fight against Covid-19, powering vital research and analysis. Nonetheless, throughout the pandemic, the UK and other countries were managing huge amounts of personal identity and health data that were highly sensitive and could lead to malicious practise if placed in the wrong hands, on insecure centralized systems that are susceptible to breaches.</p><p>Reflecting, Phil Booth, Coordinator at MedConfidential, an organization that campaigns for better confidentiality and security for patient data, summarised the key issue of trust and health data storage when he claimed that the major risk of the GP data programme is that it destroys trust. Booth said that convincing patients and GPs to opt into the programme, which involves <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/latest-news/improved-collection-of-gp-data-launched">increased collection and sharing of health data</a>, given the inherent risks involved whether through mismanagement or from malicious actors like hackers, “undermines trust”. Reliance on health data and maintaining secure digital identities for healthcare is only going to become more important in the coming years. With this in mind, it is vital that patients can be confident that when they hand over sensitive data it is being stored and managed securely. Unfortunately, the nature of centralized systems for health data storage, as recently evidenced by these statistics from the UK and the HSE cyberattack, have inherent security risks. The infrastructure behind the systems is too weak to withstand technologically advanced&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>The solution lies in decentralized data storage and management. Decentralized systems that are built on blockchain provide an encrypted and secure means for companies and organizations to store their data. Unlike centralized systems, their immutable format makes them very difficult to infiltrate; they are trustless and essentially don’t require users to put their faith in archaic technology or systems prone to human error. As well as this, patients must invest in decentralized identity solutions that help them manage their personal information. Using decentralized identity platforms, users can take back control of the information they share with institutions, ensuring that security and private data management are at the forefront of every exchange.</p><p>As digital transformation in healthcare continues to gain traction, it is likely that data breaches will become more, not less, common. Anticipating this, adopting decentralized solutions for health data that puts the control of the data in the hands of the patient, rather than on a centralized database, will reduce both the malicious and unintended dissemination of patient data while ensuring that the true potential of healthcare data and innovation can be realized.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>The identity industry is evolving. Once a niche field that very few people understood, digital identity is now a strategic piece in every organization's security architecture. Organizations are successfully breaking away from monolithic, legacy systems yet one key challenge that remains is building user-centric security solutions. To build centralized authorization in an increasingly decentralized world, identity data needs to be dynamic and easily adaptable — without changing a single line of code. Join host Cameron D'Ambrosi and Director of Strategic Alliances at Cloudentity David Lee as they pave way for the next realm of "identity 3.0" and break down open data, the adoption of new identity standards, and active governance systems across the organization.</p>

 &nbsp; 
 The Lead Up&nbsp; 
<p>The topic has been discussed in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group">informal bi-weekly meetings</a>&nbsp;for the last two months&nbsp;(we call it the SCIM Interest Group), with strong participation and lots of healthy opinions.&nbsp;&nbsp;We started by reviewing the many different draft extensions that are out there for SCIM, and a lot of those reviews are available on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe2lm3WNUfehPOxEvZ92ygA">SCIM IG&nbsp;Youtube&nbsp;channel</a>&nbsp;if you are interested.&nbsp; We applied for the&nbsp;BoF&nbsp;meeting to get feedback from a larger audience and to judge whether we have momentum, and now we are going to find out.&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Microsoft View&nbsp; 
<p>When it comes to SCIM,&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;interested in participating for several simple reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Operational Clarity&nbsp;</p>
 
 At the time SCIM was born,&nbsp;the&nbsp;cloud was&nbsp;still&nbsp;new&nbsp;and the possibilities were not known.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;very&nbsp;common assumed implementation pattern was&nbsp;a push model from on-premises to cloud, and this led to assumptions about who would be pushing what data where.&nbsp;&nbsp;These days however, the combinations of push and pull, client and server, are much more varied.&nbsp;We think that some simple updates in language and better profiling of common implementation roles could make the specification much more intuitive to adopt – thus&nbsp;helping overall interoperability&nbsp;across the identity community&nbsp;and&nbsp;getting us closer to making SCIM a must-have&nbsp;cross-domain interface.&nbsp; 
 
<p>End to End Automation as a First Order Goal&nbsp;</p>
 
 The Identity world is now&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;powered by automation and&nbsp;AI.&nbsp; Connectivity is no longer just about web single-sign on;&nbsp;the new and growing requirement today is for&nbsp;automated&nbsp;corporate oversight,&nbsp;including&nbsp;governance, provisioning, risk detection and threat intelligence.&nbsp;And we don’t only want to automate the connections, we want to automate the establishment of the connection.&nbsp; We are hoping to research&nbsp;whether there is additional&nbsp;metadata or even schema that could facilitate a more seamless bootstrapping of&nbsp;various protocols in the multi-cloud world, including&nbsp;protocols like&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/wg/sse/">Shared&nbsp;Signals and&nbsp;Events(SSE)/CAEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="http://openid.net/wg/fastfed">Fastfed</a>, with a plan to&nbsp;lay the groundwork for the explosion in multi-cloud automation that&nbsp;growing industry verticals like&nbsp;<a href="https://cloudknox.io/cloud-infrastructure-entitlement-management/">CIEM</a>&nbsp;exemplify.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Security Best Practice&nbsp;&amp; Multi-cloud&nbsp;Updates&nbsp;</p>
 
 In the API Security world, a lot has happened since the first SCIM work began.&nbsp; OAuth 2.0&nbsp;has become&nbsp;the preferred mechanism for protecting APIs and a number of extensions have evolved that increase security during access token presentation.&nbsp; We want the negotiation of industry-best security to be well specified for identity data&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Get Involved&nbsp; 
<p>The most important thing to do is to sign up for the IETF Birds of a Feather meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration is here:&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.ietf.org/111/">https://registration.ietf.org/111/.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no membership requirement, but there is a fee – a day pass costs $125 but there are fee waivers available if that cost is too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also join our merry band in the SCIM Interest Group – connection data is on our wiki:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/SCIM-Interest-Group/wiki">Explanation of our goals, how to get involved, and pages on our dedicated work efforts (github.com)</a>&nbsp;. We meet every 2 weeks, in two different times of day to encourage global participation. For updates,&nbsp;the easiest way to stay informed is to subscribe to the&nbsp;<a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ietf.org%2Fmailman%2Flistinfo%2Fscim&amp;data=04%7C01%7CPamela.Dingle%40microsoft.com%7C50789b8468294876f9df08d9507d030f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637629320743730646%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=sGI8BsjgtS2v7idTkSnr4O0QI9BlYBs9M2DGaePjr8U%3D&amp;reserved=0">SCIM Mailing list at IETF</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope your excitement about this standards work is as great as&nbsp;ours&nbsp;and we cannot strongly enough encourage your participation – the best specifications are made from diverse input, and the more breadth we have in implementation experience and point of view, the better we will do.&nbsp; Join us!&nbsp;</p>

This next acquisition is <a href="http://cloudknox.io" title="CloudKnox Security">CloudKnox Security</a>, a vendor offering unified privileged access and cloud entitlement management. These technologies, sometimes also referred to as CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), are essential for getting a grip on entitlements and access to cloud resources in multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments.</p>
 Permission Management for hybrid cloud infrastructures 
<p>The CloudKnox Cloud Permissions Management Platform delivers a range of capabilities for managing privileges and access for cloud resources. This includes discovery and assessment of the state of privileges. It supports managing and optimizing privileges, for enforcing principles such as least privilege and need to know. It supports monitoring, auditing, and reporting, as well as forensics and incident response. Support spans the major clouds, but also virtualization environments such as VMware NSX, and management of server operating systems.</p>
 Extending PAM and hybrid cloud support in Microsoft 365 
<p>With that acquisition, Microsoft strengthens their <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/" title="Azure Active Directory">Azure Active Directory</a> offering, by further extending the reach into multi-cloud and multi-hybrid environments, but also extending the capabilities for managing privileged access entitlements and thus the breadth of its PAM (Privileged Access Management) capabilities. We expect to see integration of these technologies into the existing Microsoft stack of identity and security solutions soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft demonstrates with these acquisitions that identity and security are, for long, not just a by-product anymore, but one of the core pillars of their portfolio. Specifically, Microsoft is consequently extending its scope of solutions beyond the own ecosystem, serving the breadth of today’s heterogeneous IT environments.</p>

  <p>Toggling functionality using feature flags in .NET Core apps is quite straightforward, especially with a neat little feature flag management service.</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll walk you through how to build a simple web application using <a href="https://www.okta.com">Okta</a> for user authentication and how to use <a href="https://www.configcat.com">ConfigCat</a> to manage and access feature flags.</p>

 What Are Feature Flags? 

<p>Feature flags (aka. feature toggles) are a relatively new software development technique that enables development teams to turn features on and off on the fly. You can think of them as a remote control for your application, or an actual on/off switch for a feature. You can do many great things with feature flags.  Typically, the primary purpose of feature flags is to decouple feature releases from code deployments so developers can both deploy a new feature that is turned off (or hidden from the user), and they can turn on a new feature as needed (ie. whentesting is complete,  when the marketing team is ready, or whenever you, the developer,  feel confident in the feature).</p>

 Some Cool Things Possible with Feature Flags 

 Canary Releases and Phased Roll-outs 

<p>After deploying a new feature, you can turn it on for just a handful of your users to gather feedback without risking your reputation on a broader audience. Sometimes, it’s a good idea to release a new feature in smaller phases to see how the infrastructure handles the load.</p>

 A/B Testing 

<p>Sometimes it’s hard to decide if we want to go forward with feature A or feature B, so we need to test first. Testing on live users provides high-quality data. Showing feature A to one group of users, while showing feature B to another group enables developers to measure which feature the user prefers.</p>

 Dogfooding 

<p>Tech companies, Okta included, usually use their products internally. So, whenever a new feature is on the horizon, it’s a good idea to test it on your organization first, to be sure that you are satisfied with the user experience and quality.</p>

 Emergency Kill Switch 

<p>“Never release on Friday!” - often said by experienced developers. Major issues tend to rise over the weekend when it is difficult to get hold of the development team and rollback. This toggle comes in handy when you need to immediately turn the latest feature off.</p>

 The Anatomy of a Feature Flag 

<p>At the end of the day, a feature flag in your code is a Boolean variable. A common practice is to place the new feature in one of the statements of a conditional.</p>

   <code>if(isMyNewFeatureEnabled)
{
    doTheNewThing();
}
else
{
    doTheOldThing();
}
</code>   

 Where Does the Feature Flag Value Come From? 

<p>The feature flag value can come from several different places. In some cases, you can determine its value based on other parameters in the application. For example, you can decide that you want a feature to be enabled only in the Staging environment, but not in Production. Sometimes, it is a good idea to put your feature flags in a configuration file, just beside the application like <code>appsettings.json</code>. There are also a growing number of feature flag management services (such as ConfigCat), which usually provide a nice UI to manage your flags.</p>

 How to Implement Feature Flags in .NET Core 

<p>Now, I will demonstrate how to implement and use feature flags in .NET Core using a sample application created with the Okta CLI. For managing and accessing feature flags from my code, I’m going to use the <a href="https://www.configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/csharp">ConfigCat SDK for .NET</a>.</p>

<p>In this example, my new feature will be Okta’s Twitter feed, embedded to the home page of the application. The feed should only be visible if its feature flag is turned on.</p>

 Before You Get Started 

 Set Up a Sample Application with the Okta CLI 

<p>Okta is a secure and customizable solution to add authentication to your app. Okta supports any language on any stack and lets you define how you want your users to sign in. Each time a user tries to authenticate, Okta will verify his/her identity and send the required information back to your app.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a> provides turnkey application templates with configured login flows.</p>

<p>Install the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a> by following the steps on the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<p>If you already have an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Developer</a> account, run the following command:</p>

   <code>okta login
</code>   

<p>If you don’t, you can register a new account by running:</p>

   <code>okta register
</code>   

<p>The Okta CLI is now set up and ready! Run:</p>

   <code>okta start
</code>   

<p>to launch the CLI.</p>

<p>Select the <code>ASP.NET Core MVC + Okta</code> option when prompted.</p>

<p>A ready application will be created with the Okta login flow, enabling you to write secrets with <code>appsettings.json</code> or to add the new client to your Applications on the <a href="https://developer.okta.com">Okta Developer Console</a>.</p>

<p>You can test run the application by hitting <code>F5</code>or by entering <code>dotnet run</code> in your command line.
A browser window will open, and you should be able to log in using your Okta credentials.</p>

<p>I have uploaded my working application to GitHub in case you get stuck: <a href="https://github.com/mr-sige/okta-netcore3-feature-flags">Okta .NET Core 3 Feature Flag Example</a>.</p>

 Set Up a ConfigCat Account 

<p>Go to <a href="https://www.configcat.com">ConfigCat.com</a> and sign up for a free account.</p>

<p>You will see your first feature flag <code>My awesome feature flag</code> already created.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can work with this feature flag, but I’m going to add a different one for my Twitter feed feature.</p>

<p></p>

 Accessing feature flags from .NET Core 

 Installing the ConfigCat SDK 

<p>In our application code, we’d like to know if the Twitter feed feature should be turned on or off. For that, we need the <a href="https://www.configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/csharp">ConfigCat SDK for .NET</a> to access and download the latest value of our feature flag.</p>

<p>First, install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/ConfigCat.Client">Nuget package</a> or type:</p>

   <code>Install-Package ConfigCat.Client
</code>   

 Getting the Feature Flag Value 

<p>In the HomeController.cs add the following lines:
Run the ConfigCat client. The client will automatically poll and download the latest feature flag values every 60 seconds. You can <a href="https://configcat.com/docs/sdk-reference/csharp#auto-polling-default">customize this polling interval</a> if you’d like to.</p>

   <code>var client = new ConfigCatClient("YOUR-SDK-KEY");
</code>   

<p>YOUR-API-KEY is under the SDK Key tab on the ConfigCat Dashboard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <code>GetValue()</code> call will return whether the Twitter feed should be enabled or not.</p>

   <code>var twitterFeedVisible = client.GetValue("twitterFeedVisible", false);
</code>   

<p>Here is how my controller looks in one piece:</p>

   <code>public IActionResult Index()
{
    var client = new ConfigCatClient("tNHYCC8Nm0OPXt2LxXT4zQ/k-5ZmLLd10isguXVF6PrTw");
    var twitterFeedVisible = client.GetValue("twitterFeedVisible", false);
    return View(twitterFeedVisible);
}
</code>   

<p>And my <code>Index.cshtml</code>.</p>

   <code>@model bool
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="display-4"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
    @if (Model)
    {
    &lt;div class="w-50"&gt;
        &lt;a class="twitter-timeline" href="https://twitter.com/okta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;Tweets by okta&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    }
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

 Targeting Users with Different Features in .NET Core 

<p>Sometimes, our product managers want to be able to set different features for different user groups. In these cases, the feature flag value depends on certain properties of our logged-in users. For example, I’d like to turn on Okta’s Twitter feed only for users whose email addresses end with <code>@okta.com</code>. Let’s see how this will look in the code.</p>

<p>First, we need access to the email address of each logged-in user. Since I’m using Okta authentication, I can access this via <code>HttpContext</code>.</p>

   <code>var userEmail = HttpContext.User.Claims.Where(claim =&gt; claim.Type == "email").Select(claim =&gt; claim.Value).FirstOrDefault();
</code>   

<p>Then, we’ll make a user object and add the email address as a property.</p>

   <code>var user = new User(userEmail) {Email = userEmail};
</code>   

<p>The first parameter is a required identifier. In this example, the email address works perfectly as a unique identifier.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s pass the user object to the <code>GetValue()</code> call for an evaluation.</p>

   <code>var twitterFeedVisible = client.GetValue("twitterFeedVisible", false, user);
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: Don’t worry about data privacy; because the feature flag evaluation is on the client-side, sensitive user information will never leave your system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the <a href="https://app.configcat.com">ConfigCat Dashboard</a>, click the <code>TARGET SPECIFIC USERS</code> button and add a targeting rule. In this case, the rule is: if the email address of the logged-in user contains <code>@okta.com</code>, the Twitter feed feature should be enabled.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run your application and play around with different targeting rules. They are quite fun!</p>

 Takeaway 

<p>Feature flags are quite simple to implement and add great value to your application’s flexibility. Even if you choose to go with a feature flag service provider or implement your own solution, I’m confident your product team will love the idea of decoupling feature releases from code deployments, as it eliminates a major source of stress from the equation. Also, A/B testing capabilities and percentage-based roll-outs will save your brand reputation and increase confidence when going to production with a new idea.</p>

So the idea here is that when you buy the NFT, you get an enforceable, practical, legal right that will allow you to take physical possession of the&nbsp;object.</p><p>And that is a problem that has both legal layer where we have to be able to say that you actually own the thing. It has technical layers in that we have to make sure we don’t wind up, for example, double spending physical objects. So you have two claims on a single, for example, gold bar. And the third thing that we ought to be dealing with is physical custody to make sure that the physical offsites that we’re dealing with are where we think they are when we go and try and collect&nbsp;them.</p><p>So the objective is to kind of build a whole system here where the legals, the technicals and the physical custody all align in a way that allows you to buy an NFT for a physical thing and get the physical thing. So what I’m going to start with is a few slides that just kind of illustrate how we got here and kind of what the idea is and then we can actually take a look at some NFTs for hopefully desirable, physical property that you can buy and sell right&nbsp;now.</p><p>So the company is called Mattereum. A little bit about my background: I’m basically a climate guy. I spent basically off and on 20 years figuring out how to relocate tens or hundreds of millions of people as part of climate change. Went into industry in 2014 after a long time in military think tanks. And in the long run, what I’m very interested in is using this kind of blockchain based resource allocation technology for managing very scarce, physical resources and environments like refugee camps, but also potentially space stations, moon base, Mars&nbsp;space.</p><p>Because this problem of, you know, who’s got the 10 millimeter wrench and can I borrow it so I can get the satellite dish installed in very austere environments using software to manage scarce physical resources makes a ton of sense to me. And at the kind of 10 year, 15 year horizon, that’s the kind of direction that I’m traveling.</p><p>Should also say that I was the release coordinator for the Ethereum chain and my background in crypto goes back into the mid&nbsp;1990s.</p> Bringing Ethereum to the Physical&nbsp;World <p>The bottom line is that we’re trying to get Ethereum into a position where Ethereum can break out of the digital sphere and get right into the physical sphere in the same way that, for example, USDT and USDC gave us access to the dollar economy and allowed us to do price stabilization inside of smart contracts.</p><p>What we want to achieve with Mattereum is the same thing, but for houses, cars, gold bars, collectibles, fine art, clothes, whatever it&nbsp;is.</p><p>One of our critical sort of conceptual breakthroughs we actually got on Twitter from a fellow by the name of “gmoneyNFT” who basically said NFTs start to make a lot more sense once you realize that everything in the world except money is an NFT. And that was kind of where the lights went on. I’m like, yeah okay, this is exactly what we’re doing. We’re just modeling everything that you can’t get to with the ERC-20s you can get to as an ERC-721. So it’s that same extension kind of like USDT, kind of like USDC, but for everything, represented as NFTs rather than represented as currency instruments. Does that kinda make sense? It’s a big conceptual jump but let’s start&nbsp;there.</p><p>The reason for doing this is the world of physical goods is extremely large. I mean the numbers are completely eye watering. And if we can begin to manage this kind of volume using the blockchain at that point, it’s very, very clear what the longterm economic model for something like Ethereum&nbsp;is.</p><p>Right now, we have bit of a problem that we have layers of speculation on speculation on speculation on speculation, so when the Ethereum price wobbles, the entire economy wobbles. That is not where we want the world’s global computing infrastructure to be. We want the computing infrastructure to remain rock solid. So if you’ve got some kind of financial speculation over here, the entire edifice doesn’t rock. And we get there by putting say tens of trillions of dollars of physical assets into the Ethereum ecosystem so that 99% of the value in the Ethereum ecosystem is physical goods which have their property rights controlled with Ethereum rather than virtual goods, which are all denominated in value in&nbsp;Ether.</p><p>To me, that is the point at which we’ve kind of finally broken through. We’re in the real world. We’re deployed in the real world. And things really begin to change socially, culturally, and in tricky areas with regulation like climate change, this is how we get the leverage on those kind of tricky&nbsp;areas.</p><p>So that’s the kind of goal state, right? The goal state is to get out into the physical world, stabilize the economy by using the digital layer of all the smart contracts as a way of controlling value in the physical world rather than having the value only be locked inside of the smart contracts.</p> Crypto: An Economic Engine for Securing Global&nbsp;Trade <p>The economic lever for doing this is counterfeiting.</p><p>So in areas like wine, for example, roughly 8% of all the wine that was imported to Germany is fake. In high-end wine markets like auction markets, that number can be 20 or 30%. And remember wine is $360 billion annually. So when you start talking about 8% of a $360 billion market, if you can use the NFTs to assert the credible provenance to prove the wine is real, then what that gets you is an economic engine which is preventing the fraud, drives the use case for the blockchain.</p><p>And this is a very, very direct powerful economic driver that moves real-world transactions from the kind of website e-commerce paradigm where everything is done with credit cards up into the blockchain space where you do the same transactions for the same wine, but this time you use crypto plus NFTs rather than doing the transactions in the kind of credit card&nbsp;economy.</p><p>And you do that specifically because you can eradicate the fraud. That economic engine applies to a gigantic percentage of the world’s trade. I mean, says here at 3.3%, that’s averaged out against all commodities. It’s very spiky. Some things are massively fraud written. Other things were relatively fraud free, but that’s enough of a margin to pay for the transaction cost to moving onto a secure platform.</p><p>In this respect what we’re looking at here is a kind of an economic gradient between a low trust economy on credit cards and a high trust economy on crypto and NFTs with a kind of 3.3% of global GDP lever between those two economies. So this is how we kind of get world trade to bump off the credit card system up and onto the Ethereum&nbsp;rails.</p><p>I apologize if that’s kind of abstract. We’re very deeply soaked in this stuff. So, you know, it can be a little jargony, I apologize.</p> Trust Communities: Webs of Trust Around Physical&nbsp;Goods <p>So the way that we do this jump is we essentially assemble a thing which is kind of like a miniature DAO and we call this Trust Community.</p><p>So if I take a physical asset, So here we have the infamous Shatner stuff. Our first customer was William Shatner, the actor from star Trek. Here we have some memorabilia that Shatner signed and the verification of these physical assets is driven by a community of trust around each asset. So what you have is multiple different parties who are each staking value guaranteeing that those assets are real. And that multi-party authentication structure allows also for different kinds of&nbsp;truth.</p><p>So for example, if we’re looking at these Shatner toys, maybe one person comes along and says, “I was there when they were signed.” Another person comes along and says, “I’ve got records of when these things were manufactured.” Another person comes along and says, “I’ve done a CO2 calculation for how much energy was consumed in making these toys.” And you’ve got carbon offsets that pay for that,&nbsp;right?</p><p>So that as a model: where we’ve got all of these different individuals who are all staking value around a single asset, but each one is picking up a different facet of the truth. This is very much like a DAO and you can also imagine a syndicate where you might get 20, 30, 40, 50 people that were all simultaneously staking behind the opinion of a single&nbsp;expert.</p><p>And what this allows us to do is spread the trust and spread the risk associated with physical asset purchases across networks: individuals, staking pools, potentially insurance networks. And we are working very closely with UNN.Finance to actually build staking pools that will allow people to participate in providing the warranty infrastructure around the purchase of physical goods on Ethereum.</p><p>So much as I’m historically quite down on DAOs because of issues like joint several liability, if you do it correctly and you’re very careful not to create something which looks like a share, you can still use a lot of the concepts from DAOs but what you’re doing is spreading risk through essentially promissory instruments rather than things which entitle people to share a future&nbsp;profit.</p><p>It’s quite delicate, but it’s important to stay out, for example, securities law.</p> A God’s Eye View of Product Lifecycles <p>So the final point that I want to make here is that this is not a simple closed system. The gold bars that we sell, for example, have an estimate of the amount of CO2 involved in manufacturing the gold bar and the amount of CO2 that was involved in creating the&nbsp;NFT.</p><p>And then we’ve got partner company Nori who has sold us blockchain tokens to cover that gold carbon&nbsp;burden.</p><p>What we have here is an integration of the authenticity data about the gold, the legal transfer right instantiated as an NFT and also tokenized carbon to basically take away the environmental load.</p><p>What we’re really doing is we’re embedding these physical goods inside of their total context and more and more and more of the total context of the goods becomes visible in the blockchain as we do things like importing data from anti-slavery databases or anti slavery researchers to verify that, for example, gold bars were produced without any slave labor being involved.</p><p>And we think that’s fundamentally important because again, you know, if the blockchain really is kind of the world computer, we need to be able to model the externalities of trade in that world computer so that we can accurately price goods. Right? If something comes in contaminated with a whole bunch of, you know, slave centric manufacturing processes, we don’t want to be in a position where that thing is being sold right beside something that was produced artisanally and extremely carefully to make sure no one was exploited. We need to be able to show these distinctions so that we can apply economic or potentially regulatory pressure to get the garbage out the global supply&nbsp;chain.</p> Examples of Live Physical Asset&nbsp;NFTs <p>So here we have an OpenSea page for three physical objects: an etching by Salvador Dali, a half-a-million year old stone hand axe made by an unknown hominid, probably a human, but maybe not, and a Tibetan bronze statue of a god called Acalanatha. These are NFTs on OpenSea. You can go find them if you look for Mattereum. This thing currently has a bitterness for just about $6,850 — sorry,&nbsp;$8,650.</p><p>So these things are being sold right now. The physical handaxe is stored in a vault in London. And when you buy the NFT, you get the right to take the handaxe out of the vault, or you can leave the handaxe in the vault and just hold the NFT. And every year you pay a storage fee and that covers the storage in the vault for another&nbsp;year.</p><p>Now why might you want to do this? Well, maybe you want to own a handaxe. And you don’t want to have it shipped to your house and stick it on a shelf where your kids will decide they’re going to use it for, you know, opening the box of cereal. You want to own the thing because you’re interested in the heritage and the history. You don’t need it physically in your house. More likely. You’re somebody that is interested in doing something like a museum show, and you want to lock in ownership of all of the assets you want to show simultaneously as a&nbsp;batch.</p><p>And then once you’ve got the property rights secure for all of these things, then you could prove the logistics into a play to get all the stuff to one place, to have it on display. And then it can go back into vaulting. Um, But I mean, no denying it’s a stop right? It’s a thing which is there just to show how concrete and tangible these things&nbsp;are.</p> The Value Flows within Trust Communities <p><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0xd3fdaeac03cd397b37f98375dfac9308c933afa8/6">Lohko PAMP Gold Bar 1 oz (S/N: 74707) - Lohko NFT | OpenSea</a></p><p>Let’s go take a look at a gold bar, which is maybe a little more practical. So here we have one-ounce gold bar currently owned by Singh Capital, sold by a customer of ours, Lohko. So same thing. This bar is in a vault in Singapore. Ownership of the NFT gives you the right to transfer the physical&nbsp;bar.</p><p>Let me talk through the legal magic that makes this possible. So when you buy the NFT, OpenSea takes a 2% payment out of the NFT transfer. So I as the buyer have paid 98% of the money to the seller of the NFT. 2% is being collected by OpenSea and that 2% is then relayed to a set of people in this Trust Community who are authenticating the&nbsp;bar.</p><p>So that Trust Community is mapped in a structure called the Asset Passport. So all of these people here, right? You can see we’ve got data, terms of service, vault, NFT, and carbon. Each one of those five entities is being paid a percentage of this 2% fee by the buyer immediately on purchase of the NFT. So this creates a legal obligation between say the vault warranty provider and the new owner of the NFT. And those legal obligations are represented entirely on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>So, although you can’t directly verify that the bar is physically there on chain. You know, there is the video camera watching the bar where you could go and get feed. And even if there was you couldn’t trust the camera. What we can represent fully on train is a legal liability to say if the bar isn’t where you said it is, then you will pay. And so what we need to do then is assess the liability on each one of those people and their ability to pay. And that serves as a proxy for the physical presence. So on chain, you can make the estimate about whether people actually have the money to pay their debts. And if they do, you can use that by extension to validate the physical&nbsp;goods.</p><p>And that is a very solid contractual relationship between the NFT buyer because if you accepted the money from the NFT buyer to say that you were signing up to provide this data and the data is wrong, you have an extremely clear basis for litigation and Mattereum also handles that litigation.</p><p>Let’s go take a look at the vault claim. A party, in this case Lohko Wallet, who are our customer and our partner that is producing the gold, they say they will take a quarter of a percent of the NFT sale price of the bar. And in return, they will accept a liability which is the gold value of the bar specified by the spot price from the London bullion market association, plus&nbsp;5%.</p><p>So they are on the hook. As soon as you buy the NFT for the full price of bar, plus 5%. Now notice you’re not buying the NFT from them. You’re buying the NFT from Singh Capital, who are the current owner of the NFT. So you pay the money to Singh Capital. You also pay the money to Lohko. For Singh Capital you purchase the NFT. From Lohko, you purchase a warranty on the NFT, and this is also true for the other people in this warranty provider&nbsp;network.</p><p>This is what I mean by Trust Community. The trust structure continues to pay out every time the NFT is transferred and that creates a continuous legal container for the NFT. It’s a very, very durable structure.</p><p>Not say that you have to make a claim. You want to say to Lohko, “Hey, you know, I asked for the bar to be physically shipped to me and it wasn’t physically shipped to me. I’m making a claim. There is a contract. And this is a big, old, scary, legal document. Every time a new asset is added, new contracts are generated. The fields in yellow are being basically pulled out of a data structure on IPFS. So all of the underlying documentation is stored in IPFS. We pull that information out of the IPFS and we use it to prepare these documents, which verify the legal obligation. So everything is very, very tight on the backend. All the documents are stored and identified around their hashes. They can’t be modified. They’re uploaded into IPFS at the same time the NFT is created. The NFT links directly to those documents in&nbsp;IPFS.</p><p>The whole print system is extremely tight and we’re working on making this stuff easier to understand. It’s a bit tricky to document because there’s so much detail. So at the point where the NFT is transferred, this is the contract which is being executed between the NFT buyer and Lohko. And it’s the network of those executed contracts that provide the proof that the asset is&nbsp;there.</p><p>Here’s some Star Trek stuff. These were the first set of NFTs we did. Exactly the same kind of structure. This time for ownership of a collection of Star Trek toys signed by William Shatner. These guys have digital authentication chips on them. We’re still being a little secretive about how that works. There’ll be a big announcement about it probably the next two or three months. But we have the ability to put a key pair in a physical chip directly on the assets in a vault. The whole system is basically as tight as a drum. It’s a very, very clean, clear&nbsp;model.</p> The Role of Decentralized Insurance Networks in the Mattereum Protocol <p>There’s a lot of stuff here which is still to do. I mentioned UNN.finance. So some of these warranties could draw not against an individual’s assets, but they could draw against a pool which is manifested as a smart contract. So that in the event that the goods are not as described, you make a claim on the pool and the pool then pays out. And anybody can put their funds into that pool and collect revenue streams by virtue of the fact that their money is at risk covering these physical goods and it’s covering those transactions.</p><p>Once the system is set up that’s really when the system goes from being slightly manual and a little bit legal-flavored to being dramatically sort of crypto native and digital. And I would expect that we would have gold with that set up attached to it probably within two months. We’re getting pretty close to. It might even be a little sooner. And once that’s done, what you get as a situation where one or more experts states their opinion about why something has value and maybe put some of their own money on the line kind of like a deductible and an insurance contract. And then behind that, a lot of other people can then pile in behind that expert and put their money into a benefit pool, which will then cover anything that isn’t covered by the expert’s own funds inside of this deductible framework.</p><p>So that point, it becomes possible for people who believe these gold bars are genuine to profit from the sale of each bar because they put value at risk backing the fact that this gold is actually there. That structure is basically the lever that we’re going to use to get, you know, enormous volumes of assets into the Mattereum and into the Ethereum world, so that you would finally have things like smart contracts which are doing things like owning gold. Or buying houses. You can imagine something that’s like a property hedge fund where you simply buy NFTs for real estate and the whole thing is secured by a huge pool, which is just taking a percentage of each transaction in return for making sure that if one of the properties is fraudulent, we doubled sold by somebody, that risk isn’t passed onto the hedge fund, but it’s absorbed by the insurance pool.</p><p>And as those models really begin to spin out, I think you’re going to see a very dramatic change in people’s understanding of what blockchain is because the fastest and cheapest, easiest way to buy a house will be to buy an NFT of a house and then walk around to the real estate agent, pick up the keys literally two blocks&nbsp;later.</p><p>I expect us to do the first real estate using the system in Q3 of this year. It’s probably only going to be a parking space in London, but once the principal is established that you can do real estate, after that the fun really begins. And that’s basically it. I’m not going to delve down into the guts of the environmental work that we’ve been doing. There’s also a whole bunch of stuff here about circular economy and carbon management, but I think it’s a topic for another talk, and I’ll leave it&nbsp;there.</p><p>END.</p><p>The Mattereum Protocol is a culmination of decades spent thinking on how to manage scarce resources on the planet such that people’s basic necessities of living are secured, even in the worst of situations.</p><p>Vinay distilled his insights on the technological and social transformation of material culture in the book, The Future of Stuff, where he explores how things came to be and how we can build a better path forward where humanity can live in equilibrium with the&nbsp;planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Future-Stuff-Vinay-Gupta-ebook/dp/B08B4F5QK3/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=the+future+of+stuff&amp;qid=1627267518&amp;sr=8-2">The Future of Stuff</a></p><p>If long-reads aren’t your preferred media, our podcast extends this discussion to other builders and thinkers who are shaping material culture across a range of industries.</p><p><a href="https://podcast.mattereum.com/">The Future of Stuff</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/vinay-gupta-at-ethcc-2021-how-to-use-ethereum-to-save-the-planet-69cedf0eba">Vinay Gupta at EthCC 2021: How to Use Ethereum to Save the Planet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-169-its-all-about-creators-b1e91d5fb6b5">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  What SEC commissioners really think about the Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit  What people are&nbsp;saying  Everything Ripple/SEC  This week in&nbsp;crypto  Chart of the week — ”The 81 countries exploring central bank digital currencies”  This week in antitrust  Stuff happens   1. What SEC commissioners really think about the Ripple&nbsp;lawsuit Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Photo: TechCrunch<p>Crypto’s in a quiet phase at the moment, but there are big rumblings on the regulatory front. One of the key battlegrounds is the ongoing lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple over the sale of alleged securities in the case of&nbsp;XRP.</p><p>Last week, both Ripple and the two individual defendants in the case, Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse all cited <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/peirce-roisman-coinschedule">a recent letter penned by SEC commissioners Hester Pierce (AKA Crypto Mom) and Elad Roisman</a> in relation to the recent settlement with Coinschedule.</p><p>You might call it a bombshell revelation.</p><p>In the letter, Pierce and Roisman pointed out the continued lack of clarity around what’s a security and what isn’t based on existing guidance and regulatory frameworks:</p><blockquote>There is a decided lack of clarity for market participants around the application of the securities laws to digital assets and their trading, as is evidenced by the requests each of us receives for clarity and the consistent outreach to the Commission staff for no-action and other relief. The test laid out in SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293 (1946), is helpful, but, often, including with respect to many digital assets, the application of the test is not crystal clear. Although the Commission staff has provided some guidance,[1] the large number of factors and absence of weighting cut against the clarity the guidance was intended to&nbsp;offer.”</blockquote><p>And rather than bring clarity, the SEC’s current preference for enforcement as a means of regulation has only further muddied the&nbsp;waters:</p><blockquote>“In this void, litigated and settled Commission enforcement actions have become the go-to source of guidance. People can study the specifics of token offerings that become the subject of enforcement actions and take clues from particular cases; however, applying those clues to the facts of a completely different token offering does not necessarily produce clear answers. Providing guidance piecemeal through enforcement actions is not the best way to move forward; if the Commission intends to continue to do so, then we should at least be clear about which tokens we have identified to have been sold pursuant to securities offerings.</blockquote><p>It’s almost as if the SEC is trying to be as vague as possible! The only thing they’re certain&nbsp;about?</p><blockquote>…the only certainty we see is that people have questions about how to comply with the applicable laws and regulations.</blockquote><p>Indeed, even when presented the opportunity for clarity, the SEC backed away, as Pierce and Roisman highlight:</p><blockquote>We nevertheless are disappointed that the Commission’s settlement with Coinschedule did not explain which digital assets touted by Coinschedule were securities, an omission which is symptomatic of our reluctance to provide additional guidance about how to determine whether a token is being sold as part of a securities offering or which tokens are securities.</blockquote><p>So even if you wanted to be a law abiding citizen in the space, it isn’t clear how. Rather than address that lack of clarity, the current SEC status quo merely creates an environment of fear and uncertainty. (The commissioners also propose a safe harbor rule — essentially a sandbox where crypto startups can play in as a way to promote innovation.)</p><p>Pierce and Roisman conclude:</p><blockquote>Whether we decide that all or a subset of token offerings are securities offerings, providing clear regulatory guideposts and then bringing enforcement actions against people who ignore them is a better approach than the clue-by-enforcement approach that we have embraced to date and that today’s settlement embodies. In short, we know folks have questions and confusion persists in the marketplace; it is important that we start providing clear and timely&nbsp;answers.</blockquote><p>Sounds reasonable.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/07/19/the-secs-fair-notice-farce-starring-william-hinman/?sh=5f0ba8782f4f">Roslyn Layton</a>, who has consistently covered the lawsuit over at&nbsp;Forbes:</p><blockquote>Another portent of doom for the SEC’s legal team is a recent missive on a settlement with crypto exchange Coinschedule from SEC commissioners Peirce and Roisman, two Republicans who likely voted against the Ripple case driven by former Republication SEC Chair Jay Clayton. The Commissioners were essentially whistleblowers from inside the agency’s top leadership, attesting that the SEC fails to provide clear guidance and fair notice on digital&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The Commissioners’ statement probably does not surprise the SEC’s legal team. They likely know that Hinman’s answers to Ripple’s questions could sink their case and their credibility as an agency. It invites a ruling that could bring the SEC’s farce of fair notice to an&nbsp;end.</blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gregkidd/status/1417530496360271873">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>Without the ethical practice of fair notice, the Howey test is displaced by the Tony Soprano test: Jay Clayton’s infamous statement of saying ‘if it’s a security then we’ll regulate it’ and then not doing so or giving fair notice for 7&nbsp;years”.</blockquote><blockquote>Hopefully this will stop SEC racketeering and will motivate them to provide clear rules based regulation rather than operating via shakedown enforcement actions</blockquote> 3.

 Gravity, Tykn advancing interoperability of two decentralized identity solutions for the humanitarian sector <p><a href="https://www.gravity.earth/">Gravity</a> and <a href="https://tykn.tech/">Tykn</a> are pleased to announce our continued collaboration to advance the interoperability of our two distinct decentralized identity solutions for improved identity management in the humanitarian sector. Recently, Gravity and Tykn successfully conducted an interoperability Proof of Concept between Gravity’s digital ID protocol built on Tezos blockchain and Tykn’s Cloud Wallet built on Sovrin blockchain within the context of the <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027?source=friends_link&amp;sk=6bbf44ccecc283a580782c9dbfa21da5">Dignified Identities in Cash Programming (DIGID)</a>&nbsp;project.</p> The DIGID Project provides one of the first examples — if not the first! — of attempts at interoperability between two different decentralized identity technologies in the humanitarian context. <p>To date, there have only been a few attempts at demonstrating interoperability within decentralized identity that we are aware of.* With our novel approach, Gravity and Tykn’s collaboration is an exciting first step towards achieving interoperability between different decentralized identity wallets based on two distinct protocols that leverage very different standards and networks.</p><p>To better explain the importance of interoperability of digital identity solutions within the humanitarian context, this article includes the following sections:</p>  <a>What is interoperability?</a>  <a>Why is interoperability important?</a>  <a>What are the benefits of interoperability between decentralized ID solutions in the humanitarian sector?</a>  <a>How are Gravity and Tykn addressing interoperability within the context of the DIGID&nbsp;Project?</a>   What is interoperability? <p>Interoperability refers to the basic ability of different systems (for example, the two decentralized identity protocols from Gravity and Tykn) to readily connect and exchange information with one another. In terms of decentralized identity, interoperability involves a scenario where Alice, who has a decentralized identity wallet based on protocol A can share credentials with Bob, who uses a wallet based on protocol B. With full interoperability, Bob can easily decrypt, read, and verify Alice’s credentials. Interoperability between different protocols is an important argument in favour of decentralized identity.</p> Why is interoperability important? <p>One of the key use cases envisioned for the use of decentralized identity in humanitarian aid is that NGO A can issue credentials to a beneficiary who can then easily share these credentials with NGO B. Interoperability allows NGOs A and B to use different decentralized identity protocols for issuance and verification, while still allowing a beneficiary to easily share credentials between the two organizations to gain access to different services.</p> Interoperability is important because it reduces the risk of vendor lock-in and siloed data management solutions. <p>Using a decentralized identity protocol with a high degree of interoperability may help mitigate risks arising from being dependent on a single vendor, both for humanitarian organizations and for beneficiaries receiving assistance. For example, decentralized identity solution Vendor A could experience a system-wide fault or suddenly cease activity. With siloed data management solutions, beneficiary data would all be lost in this scenario. However, with interoperable decentralized identity solutions, beneficiary data may still be available from decentralized identity solution Vendor&nbsp;B.</p><p>To date, there have only been a few attempts at demonstrating interoperability within decentralized identity. As such, the interoperability test conducted between Gravity and Tykn within the context of the DIGID project is one of the first of its kind that we are aware&nbsp;of.</p> What are the benefits of interoperability between decentralized ID solutions in the humanitarian sector? <p>Interoperability between decentralized ID solutions:</p>  facilitates the implementation of multiple digital ID solutions with no vendor&nbsp;lock-in  removes inefficiencies and barriers present in current siloed beneficiary databases  increases collaboration within and among organizations working to support similar target populations  provides greater opportunities for market innovation within the digital ID space, driving digital ID market&nbsp;growth   How are Gravity and Tykn addressing interoperability within the context of the DIGID&nbsp;Project? <p>Launched by a consortium of some of the largest international NGOs in the world, the DIGID Project aims to address the issue of lack of official or recognized identity for recipients of humanitarian assistance by piloting digital identity solutions in&nbsp;Kenya.</p><p>This project strives to give control and ownership of personal data back to individuals, and at the same time increase collaboration between NGOs and their beneficiaries, with user consent as a&nbsp;key.</p><p>Earlier this year, Gravity’s digital ID solution powered the DIGID Project with the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) to help vulnerable Kenyans without a proof of identity create digital identities on Gravity’s platform and access much-needed KRCS cash assistance. While the DIGID project leverages Gravity’s identity stack built on Tezos blockchain with beneficiaries creating Gravity identity wallets, the aim is to ensure that services that are at the intersection between Gravity’s ID platform and third-parties are also able to issue and read credentials from other decentralized identity protocols.</p> For sustainability purposes, it is critical that any digital ID solutions that are built for the long term are as interoperable as possible. <p>Thus, a key next step in the DIGID Project post-pilot phase following the creation of Gravity digital IDs for KRCS aid beneficiaries was to test interoperability between Gravity’s digital ID solution and another third-party solution (in this case, Tykn’s Cloud Wallet) to show how NGOs using different decentralized identity technologies could increase collaboration between humanitarian aid organizations and their beneficiaries.</p><p>The interoperability proof of concept demonstrated how two NGOs can use different decentralized identity platforms to register and deliver assistance to the same set of beneficiaries. This is made possible by associating a beneficiary’s different Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with each other. This needs to be done because each DID is specific to the two different decentralized identity platforms being used. Allowing for these DIDs to be associated with one another means that NGOs can use both sets of DIDs and issue credentials to both decentralized identity platforms. This is useful because it allows NGOs to share data with each other and beneficiaries without having to agree on a common identifier (such as a phone number, national ID number or system generated ID number) that is needed to identify a beneficiary between two separate&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Beyond this initial interoperability test within the context of the DIGID Project, Gravity and Tykn look forward to continuing to innovate together to make interoperability in the decentralized identity and humanitarian aid spaces possible for real-world use.</p><p>Gravity and Tykn are grateful to the DIGID consortium of international NGOs for making this interoperability test in the context of the DIGID Project possible.</p><p>To learn more about Gravity, visit our website at <a href="http://www.gravity.earth/">www.gravity.earth</a> or follow us on <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/company/gravity.com">LinkedIn</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth">Twitter</a>.</p><p>—</p><p>*For example, <a href="https://sovrin.org/interoperability-series-linking-and-exchanging-attachments-with-verifiable-credentials/">a collaboration between two decentralized identity providers based on the Sovrin network</a> allowed for interoperability between their respective digital identity wallets in the context of the Swiss pharmaceutical industry.

 Some Overviews 

<p>Blockchain Commons is getting big, so we produced some overviews of our work!</p>

<p>Video Overview. Over the last few years, Blockchain Commons has produced a number of specifications, including our fundamental work on Uniform Resources (URs), our other innovations such as Lifehashes and Object Identity Blocks, and our updates of sharding technology with SSKR. If you’re trying to get a handle on the technologies we’re using and the specifications that we’re creating with our Airgapped community, we invite you to take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYgOFSdUqWY">technology overview video</a>, which runs through our core conceptual and specification work one element at a time.</p>



  
<p><br></p>

<p>The Gordian Principles. We’ve also begun publishing some descriptions of what the Gordian architecture means to us. It’s focused on four principals that we believe are crucial to digital-asset management: independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. They’re all about ensuring that you’re the controller of your digital assets. Besides writing a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">short overview</a>, we’ve also begun adding descriptions to each of our reference apps, discussing how they embody those principles.</p>

<p>And, those reference apps were our biggest news for the quarter …</p>

 Reference App Work 

<p>Our reference apps show off how Blockchain Commons’ Gordian Principles work in real life. We made great progress on them this quarter.</p>

<p>Gordian Releases. Where we had three reference apps available for beta testing in Q1, in Q2 we advanced to having two available for release from Apple.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229"></a>
Gordian Seed Tool is the app previously known as Gordian Guardian.
It allows for the management of your cryptographic seeds in a way that’s secure and resilient. You store your seeds in Seed Tool, ensuring that the data is encrypted and that it’s redundantly backed up to iCloud, and then you derive and export keys as they’re needed. As with all of the Gordian reference apps, this one demonstrates the usage of a number of Blockchain Common’s specifications, including SSKRs, UR, and even our new <code>request/response</code> airgap methodology that we just <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-001-request.md">debuted</a> this February.</p>

<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070"></a>
Gordian QR Tool is a simpler tool that similarly allows for the storage of QR codes in a secure and resilient way. Thus, if you had a largely unused seed or key, you could export it as a QR and store it here. QR Tool can also be used to store other private information such as 2FA seeds or the brand-new Smart Health Cards. QR Tool recognizes many categories of QR codes, including the UR types that Blockchain Commons has defined, allowing easy categorization and sorting of your cryptographic data. Our QR Tool was slightly held back by inadequacies we found in Apple’s QR creation functions, which can produce overly large QRs. We’ve already begun work <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/QRCodeGenerator">translating a better QR library into Swift</a> and expect to integrate that into v1.1 of QR Tool in the future.</p>

<p>QR Tool and Seed Tool also offer the first demonstration of the interactions possible in a Gordian architecture. One of the most powerful examples involves Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">SSKR specification</a>. Seed Tools allows a user to not only shard a seed using SSKR, but also to encode those shares as QR codes. The encoded shares can then be given to friends and family who have QR Tool, ensuring the safe storage of all the shares required to restore your seed!</p>

<p>We have more reference app releases planned for the future. Gordian Cosigner remains available as a Testflight beta release, and is our reference app for demonstrating how to conduct airgapped signing. We are also beginning work on the Gordian Recovery app, which we announced last quarter; it’ll demonstrate methodologies for recovering assets held by third-party wallets.</p>

<p>Sweeptool Debut. Recovering funds held in a third-party HD wallet can be tricky since you don’t always know which addresses were actually used. We’ve also been attacking that problem with a command-line tool called <code>sweeptool</code>, which sweeps funds  anywhere in the hierarchy defined by a descriptor. Sweeptool is the work of one of our intern graduates, and is already available as an <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/sweeptool-cli">alpha release</a>.</p>

<p>Timelock Experiments. Our current architecture for #SmartCustody depends on multisigs to allow for the partitioning of keys and the creation of resilience. However, we’re already thinking about the next generation of #SmartCustody, which will allow the use of timelocks to recover funds in the case of the incapacitation of a principal. We did some deeper investigation into miniscript this quarter, which allows for easier integration of timelocks into Bitcoin addresses, and also mapped out some new architectures for progressively sweeping funds forward to keep ahead of timelocks. However, we discovered that at this point miniscript isn’t yet integrated with the descriptor-wallets that are another of the core elements of the Gordian architecture. This prevents integration with our Gordian apps.</p>

<p>We’ve published a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">preliminary paper</a> on the usage of Timelocks, but it isn’t finalized yet because of these issues. Meanwhile, one of our interns has begun work on a Rust-based Timelock project called <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/mori-cli">mori-cli</a>. This work is all meant to ensure we’re ready when miniscript is added to Bitcoin Core, or when timelocks are integrated into descriptors in some other manner.</p>

 Coding Processes 

<p>Releasing apps is just one step of a larger coding process, which requires careful consideration of what languages (and libraries) to use and careful reviewing of their security.</p>

<p>Rust Focus. Sweeptool is written in Rust, which is an increasing focus at Blockchain Commons. We’ve also been using it for our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/musign-cli">musign-cli work</a> and some of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/torgap">torgap work</a> and have touched upon it in <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/18_5_Accessing_Bitcoind_with_Rust.md">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a>. We think that Rust is an important language for the future of Bitcoin development in large part because of its safety guarantee, including <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/07/22/why-rust-for-safe-systems-programming/">memory safety properties, which can resolve 70% of security problems</a>. Our main barrier for wider use of Rust has been the fact that C and C++ are the main languages used by Bitcoin Core, iOS, and Android, but we’ve already seen the start of changes there, and hope to be able to integrate Rust even more fully in the future. The fact that the Rust-based <a href="https://bitcoindevkit.org/">Bitcoin Dev Kit</a> is actually in advance of Bitcoin Core in some features is very encouraging.</p>

<p>Security Review. Bitmark, one of our Sustaining Sponsors, has hired <a href="https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/">Radically Open Security</a> to conduct a security review of our SSKR libraries, <a href="https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir">bc-shamir</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr">bc-sskr</a>. This is crucial element in making Blockchain Commons’ specification work widely available, since it would be improper for us to review our own security code. As our first partners planning to use one of our libraries in a shipping project, as opposed to just our specifications, Bitmark is stepping up to the plate to fund the review of our core SSKR libraries. We expect this pattern to repeat with future partners and libraries in the future. It shows the power of our open libraries: future companies will be able to depend on our SSKR libraries thanks to Bitmark’s contribution, and then they’ll be able to make contributions of their own that will be much less than if they’d had to security review an entire suite of  themselves.</p>

 New Docs 

<p>The blockchain infrastructure is empowered by users and developers who know how to use it properly. Teaching them is the goal of our documentation projects.</p>

<p>UR &amp; SSKR Docs. The ultimate purpose of our reference applications is to demonstrate how our new specifications can be used in actual applications. Hand-in-hand with that, we’re also producing documentation that lays out in more detail how those specifications work. We’ve begun collecting many of those docs in the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/tree/master/Docs">documents area of our crypto-commons repo</a>. This quarter we added to our docs repo with several documents about our Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction system, including <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-users.md">SSKR for Users</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/sskr-developers.md">SSKR for Developers</a>. We also released a series of articles on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/ur-1-overview.md">Uniform Resources (URs)</a> intended to show developers how they’re constructed and used.</p>

<p>We are also planning further support for our interoperable specifications such as UR and SSKR at a virtual interoperable wallet specification workshop. We’re currently working on locking down a date.</p>

<p>Learning Bitcoin Translations. Our best-known tutorial at Blockchain Commons, is our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line course</a>, which we pushed to v2.0 last year and which has 1,700 stars and 100 watchers on Github. We’re thrilled that translations are now ongoing into both <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/portuguese-translation/pt">Portuguese</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/tree/spanish-translation/es">Spanish</a> thanks to a half-dozen core volunteers. Some of Blockchain Commons’ own programmers and interns entered the blockchain industry thanks to this course, so we’re looking forward to these translations opening the doors even wider.</p>

 Other Priorities 

<p>Finally, we have a lot of more varied projects that all saw some progress.</p>

<p>Our Summer Interns Have Begun Work. Thanks to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/human-rights-foundation-grants-bitcoin-defi-education-activism">a grant from the Human Rights Foundation</a>, we have a class of a dozen interns this summer. We’re engaging them with weekly calls to introduce them to crucial use cases and to let them talk with Bitcoin and Lightning experts from the industry and human-rights experts, most recently including John Callas from the EFF and Alex Gladstein from HRF.</p>

<p>Some of our human-rights-focused intern projects include a self-sovereign donation app, scripts to automate the setup of privacy and/or bitcoin services, documents on managing pseudonymity, and tracking of blockchain-based legislation.</p>

<p>Some of our more general intern projects include deployment of a full Esplora node for Blockchain Commons, the creation of scripts to make it easier for others to do so, documentation on bitcoin fee-estimation use cases, improvements to our Spotbit server including expansion of the Spotbit API and client app, and the aformentioned work on Mori and on Learning Bitcoin translations.</p>

<p>Our first completed intern ‘21 work is a short <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line/blob/master/15_0_Using_i2p.md">i2p chapter</a> for Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line, talking about an alternative (or supplement) to traditional Tor privacy.</p>

<p>Wyoming Testimony. Christopher’s testimony has continued in Wyoming, talking about DAO and identity, to improve and extend both laws. The most recent testimony <a href="https://youtu.be/ayQ086BVDXE?t=4060">on May 28</a> continued to work through the ramifications of the definitions of principal authority for self-sovereign identity.</p>




<p><br></p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Speaking of which, it was the fifth anniversary of the concept of self-sovereign identity, which first suggested that we should control our identities on the internet, not be beholden to centralized agencies. Christopher <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">wrote an article</a> for Coindesk celebrating that anniversary, talking about how far we’ve come and reflecting on how things could be improved.</p>

<p>BTCR. Finally, we’ve also been talking about another of our blockchain projects that originated in <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>: BTCR, a self-sovereign decentralized identifier that uses the Bitcoin blockchain. Recently Christopher and the other creators of BTCR talked with <a href="https://the-rubric.castos.com/episodes/the-granddaddy-of-dids">The Rubric</a> about the past and future of the DID.</p>

<p>As you can see, we’ve got lots of ongoing work that continue to expand the ideas of responsible key management and self-determination on the internet. If you’d like to support our work at Blockchain Commons, so that we can continue to design new specifications, architectures, reference applications, and reference libraries to be used by the whole community, please <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>. You can alternatively make a <a href="https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com/">one-time bitcoin donation</a> at our BTCPay.</p>

<p>Privacy, as we know, is a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">complex topic</a>. When it converges with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">technology</a>, it becomes more complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One aspect of this complexity is where privacy fits in with&nbsp;disinformation—false or misleading information spread&nbsp;intentionally&nbsp;to confuse or manipulate people. Disinformation is also called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/search/disinformation">bad information</a>, “weaponized information” and “fake news”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Disinformation is different from&nbsp;misinformation—false or misleading information spread&nbsp;unwittingly—but the two together have eroded trust in information to the point we’re in an “information crisis”. (The WHO characterizes the spread of mis and disinformation and the mistrust in information about COVID-19 as an “<a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic#tab=tab_1">infodemic</a>”.)</p>



<p>Since our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">remit</a>&nbsp;is protecting&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/">information&nbsp;privacy</a>,&nbsp;we were interested to&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">hear</a>&nbsp;how&nbsp;<a href="https://juliaangwin.com/books/">Julia Angwin</a>, award-winning investigative journalist, editor-in-chief of&nbsp;<a href="https://themarkup.org/">The Markup</a>&nbsp;and author of&nbsp;<a href="https://juliaangwin.com/books/">Dragnet Nation</a>,&nbsp;linked privacy to disinformation in a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">podcast</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/programs/aspendigital/">Aspen Digital</a>‘s Executive Director&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/our-people/vivian-schiller/">Vivian Schiller</a>.

 Angwin links privacy to disinformation in two ways 



<p></p>



 1. Lack of privacy generates disinformation 



<p></p>



<p>Angwin says&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">relentless data surveillance</a>&nbsp;has forced individuals to protect their privacy by engaging in some degree of information obfuscation: “You can’t avoid being seen, so you change how you’re being seen. This is disinformation.”</p>



<p>When Angwin wrote her landmark book,&nbsp;<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/dragnet-nation-a-quest-for-privacy-security-and-freedom-in-a-world-of-relentless-surveillance/9781250060860">Dragnet Nation</a>, she tried all the ways she could to escape what she calls “dragnet surveillance”. She says: “I wasn’t trying to evade the FBI; I was just trying to get out of indiscriminate tracking that is everywhere. I did all sorts of things like getting a burner phone and fake identities and different types of accounts, and what I found was that I was really engaging in quite a bit of disinformation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The world of relentless surveillance has actually forced individuals to try to protect their privacy through misdirection and obfuscation. This is literally a coping technique for a world of relentless surveillance … the world of surveillance creates a need and a requirement for everyone to engage in a bit of disinformation,” she said.</p>



<p>Angwin says this has set the standard for a level of disinformation we haven’t seen before.</p>



 2. Lack of privacy subjects people to disinformation<br> 



<p></p>



<p>Angwin says digital technology has allowed the creation of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propaganda">propaganda</a>&nbsp;(a form of disinformation) on a mass scale. Where once the purview of governments, she says propaganda has become an industry and vulnerable communities are most at risk from the disinformation it spreads.</p>



<p>“The industry needs to know who to distribute propaganda to—and that’s where the data exploitation market comes in. You can find vulnerable people because you can buy lists of them. When people used to send junk mail, these lists were called ‘sucker lists.’ These were people who are going to fall for your scam. Now, of course, you can buy any kind of sucker list on Facebook or Instagram.” And “any kind” is right. These lists can now be granularly targeted by various factors including a person’s political and religious leanings, household income, age, location and more.</p>



<p>Angwin believes propaganda weaponizes disinformation and lies “because they can be sent directly to the people who are most vulnerable to receive them. News is being filtered and tailored to people.”</p>



<p>She points out that Facebook sells “sucker lists” via its ads, for example.&nbsp;Users can buy ads targeted to certain people, based behavioural data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are served information that they believe might be attractive to us. There are millions of people who might be susceptible to dis and misinformation,” Angwin says.</p>



 What’s the fix? 



<p></p>



<p>Asked whether it’s possible to individually control this tracking and data exploitation, Angwin says no. “Honestly as an individual you have very little control because we need to use these technologies to participate in daily life. Ultimately your ability to decline participation in the data exploitation market is pretty minimal. Most you can do is minimize around the margin but not opt out entirely.” (We’d recommend you use&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySu</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">d</a><a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">o</a>.)</p>



<p>Angwin says most platforms are only offering “an illusion of control” over our personal data. “You go into some sort of privacy menu, and you can turn all these knobs and dials. The studies have shown that the more knobs and dials there are, the more you feel you’re in control and the more willing you are to accept privacy violations.&nbsp;So they offer you these very confusing settings, and you move them around and you think,&nbsp;‘Oh, I’ve really solved this.’ The truth is, not really, you haven’t.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She concedes some platforms are getting more aggressive at turning off tracking, and cites&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">Apple</a>&nbsp;in this, but says often platforms are simply swapping one form of tracking for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">another</a>.</p>



<p>As such, Angwin believes there aren’t remedies, so much as considerations. She implores people to think about “whether the benefits of microtargeting really outweigh the risks”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The idea of categorizing all human behavior and then allowing commercial interests to use those to target individuals: Are the risks to society higher than the benefits to advertisers?” she asks.</p>



<p>Listen to the full podcast episode,&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1D9yw8R7kp4tnxFLAZz5MT">‘Privacy in the Age of Disinformation’</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Het is eind juli, de vakanties zijn in volle gang. Even het gas eraf, even pas op de plaats en terugkijken op (weer) een bijzonder half jaar. Want wat is er ontzettend veel gebeurd rondom Ockto, de groei zit er flink in!</p>



<p>Begin dit jaar zijn we verhuisd! Al zitten we slechts 500m verderop, we hebben nu wel 3x zoveel ruimte. En dat moet ook wel! Want sinds januari is het Ockto team gegroeid met wel 10 nieuwe Ocktonianen.</p>



<p>Op gebied van het Ockto platform zijn we apetrots op onze PSD2 licentie en de banktransacties die hierdoor ook met Ockto aangeleverd kunnen worden.</p>



<p>In Nederland ervaren steeds meer mensen het gemak van Ockto. Inmiddels worden er wekelijks bijna 2x zoveel Ockto sessies gedaan dan begin dit jaar. Dat is niet voor niets. Naast het steeds bredere gebruik van Ockto bij hypotheekaanvragen, financiële planning en pensioeninzicht wordt Ockto ook steeds vaker gebruikt voor het aanvragen van consumptieve financiering, gemeentelijke regelingen, huurwoningen, lease aanvragen, etc.</p>



<p>En als klap op de vuurpijl zijn we ook bezig Ockto klaar te maken voor gebruik Frankrijk.</p>

  <p>Spring Cloud Sleuth allows you to aggregate and track log entries as requests move through a distributed software system. In a monolithic system, it’s relatively easy to track requests as they move through the codebase because all requests can easily be logged to the same log file. You can generally just filter the log by the thread ID. But in a distributed system, a single client request may sprawl across any number of discrete cloud services. Any given service may have multiple instances handling different parts of the request. There is no single log file, with a request spread across multiple server instances. How do you use logs in this situation? How do you trace a request flow across a service mesh?</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will see how Spring Cloud Sleuth can be integrated into a Spring Boot application. The Spring Boot application will be secured using Okta as an OAuth 2.0 &amp; OIDC provider. You’ll use the Okta CLI to configure Okta and Spring Boot. You’ll also download and run a Zipkin server to collect the Spring Cloud Sleuth entires and visualize them.</p>

 What is Spring Cloud Sleuth? 

<p>Spring Cloud Sleuth’s solution is to inject span and trace IDs into log entries. A trace ID is the unique identifier that an entire request flow will share. It’s like the glue that sticks all of the log entries together. A span is more local and is defined for each request received for each request sent event. They define particular interaction points.</p>

<p>The initial span, or root span, is generated when a client request is received from outside the distributed system. This request lacks trace and span information. The root span becomes the trace ID for the rest of the request flow through the system.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how Sleuth span and trace generation would work through a hypothetical service network.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In practice, the span and trace IDs look like the following in log entries (the bracketed section after the <code>INFO</code>). Notice how the span ID and trace ID are the same? That’s because this is the root span, the beginning of the request tree identified by that particular trace ID.</p>

   <code>service1.log:2016-02-26 11:15:47.561  INFO [service1,2485ec27856c56f4,2485ec27856c56f4] 68058 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] i.s.c.sleuth.docs.service1.Application   : Hello from service1. Calling service2
</code>   

<p>These are the Sleuth span and trace IDs associated with the service name.</p>

   <code>[service1,2485ec27856c56f4,2485ec27856c56f4]
[SERVICE NAME,TRACE,SPAN]
</code>   

<p>Once you have all these nifty log entries with IDs in them, you need a log aggregation and analytics tool to make sense of them. You can use any of the freely available tools: Kibana, Splunk, Logstash, etc. if you want. In this tutorial, you’ll use Zipkin. Zipkin is a Java-based distributed tracing system designed for this use case and seamlessly works with Spring Cloud Sleuth.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will create a simple, example Spring Boot service with two endpoints. You’re going to run two different instances of this service and use HTTPie to make a request to one instance of the service. This service will make a request to the second instance of the service, which will return a reply to the first service, which will return a reply to your original request. This request process will be logged, and the Sleuth log entries automatically pushed to a local Zipkin server, and you will be able to visualize the request flow using the Zipkin server.</p>

<p>The point of the example is to demonstrate how to integrate Spring Cloud Sleuth and how Spring Cloud Sleuth allows you to track request flow across different services, also, how the whole process can be secured using Okta and JSON Web Tokens.</p>

<p>Before you get started, you need to have a few things installed.</p>

 
   Java 11: This project uses Java 11. OpenJDK 11 will work just as well. Instructions are found on the <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/install/">OpenJDK website</a>. OpenJDK can also be installed using <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>. Alternatively, <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> is another excellent option for installing and managing Java versions. 
   Okta CLI: You’ll be using Okta as an OAuth/OIDC provider to add JWT authentication and authorization to the application. You can go to <a href="https://developer.okta.com">our developer site</a> to learn more about Okta. You need a free developer account for this tutorial. The Okta CLI is an easy way to register for a free Okta developer account or log in to an existing one and configure a Spring Boot app to use Okta as an auth provider. The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">project GitHub page</a> has installation instructions. 
   HTTPie: This is a powerful command-line HTTP request utility that you’ll use to test the Spring Boot server. Install it according to <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">the docs on their site</a>. 
 

 Bootstrap a Spring Boot App Using the Spring Initializr 

<p>Spring has a great project called Spring Initializr. Why no “e”? Because it’s cool, that’s why. Joking aside, it’s pretty great. You can go to <a href="https://start.spring.io/">start.spring.io</a> and quickly configure a starter project. You can browse the project online before you download it. You can get a link you can share and save for the configured project. And you can even use a REST API, which is what you’ll do below.</p>

<p>Open a bash shell and run the command below. This will download the project as a compressed tarball, untar it, and navigate you into the project directory.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
 -d dependencies=web,cloud-starter-sleuth,okta,cloud-starter-zipkin \
 -d baseDir=spring-cloud-sleuth-demo | tar -xzvf -
cd spring-cloud-sleuth-demo
</code>   

<p>The command uses a lot of the default settings. It uses Maven as the dependency manager. It uses Java as the programming language. It uses Spring Boot 2.4.5 (the current release at the time of writing this tutorial). It creates a JAR as the build target. Finally, it specifies Java 11 (again, at the time of this tutorial).</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most important thing it configures is four dependencies.</p>

 
   Spring Web - adds Spring MVC for building RESTful web applications using Tomcat as the default server 
   Spring Cloud Sleuth - adds the basic dependencies to write Sleuth-compatible log entries 
   Zipkin Client - adds the ability to write Sleuth entries to a Zipkin client 
   Okta Spring Boot Starter - adds <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">Okta’s Spring Boot Starter</a>, which helps configure Spring Boot for use with Okta as an OIDC and OAuth 2.0 provider 
 

<p>The demo application can be run with <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code>. However, it has no endpoints defined and doesn’t do anything except start. So, before you make it do something more exciting, first you need to configure Okta and JWT auth.</p>

 Configure Spring Boot for OIDC Authentication 

<p>OIDC is an authentication protocol that, along with OAuth 2.0, provides a spec for a complete authentication and authorization protocol. This is the protocol that Okta and Spring implement to provide the secure, standards-compliant JSON web token (JWT) authentication solution that you’ll use in this tutorial. Creating an OIDC application on Okta configures Okta as an authentication provider for your Spring Boot application.</p>

<p>Open a bash shell and navigate to the demo project root directory.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Open your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file. You should see something like the following.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https\://dev-123456.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-secret={yourClientSecret}
okta.oauth2.client-id={yourClientId}
</code>   

<p>While you’ve got the properties file open, add a couple of new properties.</p>

   <code>spring.application.name=${APP_NAME}
server.port=${APP_PORT}
</code>   

<p>These two properties will allow you to specify the application name and port from the command line when your boot the app. You need to be able to do this because you’ll need to run two distinct application instances with different names on different local ports.</p>

 Create a Security Configuration Class 

<p>To configure the Spring Boot application as a resource server, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class. The following class tells Spring Boot to authenticate all requests and use JWT-based auth for the resource server.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>
   <code>@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt;
                authorizeRequests.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
    }

}
</code>   

 Make an Example Spring Cloud Sleuth App 

<p>Replace the <code>DemoApplication</code> class with the code listed below. I’ll explain the code below.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.web.client.RestTemplateBuilder;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.http.HttpEntity;
import org.springframework.http.HttpHeaders;
import org.springframework.http.HttpMethod;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestHeader;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    RestTemplate myRestTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }

    @RestController
    static class SimpleRestController {

        private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SimpleRestController.class);
        private final RestTemplate restTemplate;

        SimpleRestController(RestTemplateBuilder restTemplateBuilder) {
            this.restTemplate = restTemplateBuilder.build();
        }

        @Value("${APP_NAME}")
        private String appName;

        @GetMapping("/a")
        String a(@RequestHeader(name = "Authorization") String authToken) {

            log.info("Handling a - " + appName);

            HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
            headers.add("Authorization", authToken);
            HttpEntity request = new HttpEntity(headers);

            ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(
                "http://localhost:8082/b",
                HttpMethod.GET,
                request,
                String.class
            );

            String result = response.getBody();
            log.info("Reply = " + result);

            return "Hello from /a - " + appName + ", " + result;
        }

        @GetMapping("/b")
        String b(@RequestHeader(name = "Authorization") String authToken) {
            log.info("Handling b - " + appName);
            return "Hello from /b - " + appName;
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The demo app creates two endpoints, cunningly named <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. To demonstrate how Sleuth works across services in a network of microservices, you will run two instances of this application. Using HTTPie, you’ll call endpoint <code>a</code>, which will call endpoint <code>b</code>. Endpoint <code>b</code> will return a result to endpoint <code>a</code>, which will return a combined result to your shell.</p>

<p>The logging statements are important. This is where the Sleuth span and trace markers are going to get injected into your logs and sent to the Zipkin server (which you’ll set up in a moment).</p>

<p>In endpoint <code>a</code>, notice that the code grabs the JWT token from the header as a request param and uses Spring’s RestTemplate to make a request to endpoint <code>b</code> including the token in the request. Both endpoints will require this token for authentication, so this is important. It’s also important that you use Spring’s <code>RestTemplate</code> and that you inject it as a bean because this allows Spring Cloud Sleuth to automatically include the Sleuth trace ID in the request, which is the main point here, tracking request flow across different services.</p>

<p>If you don’t inject the <code>RestTemplate</code> as a bean but instead instantiate it directly in the method or use a different HTTP client, you will need to manually add the Sleuth trace ID.</p>

 Launch a Zipkin Server 

<p>Before you start the two instances of the Spring Boot app, you need to launch your Zipkin server. Because the project includes the Zipkin Client dependency (along with the Spring Cloud Sleuth dependency), Spring Boot is configured to send logging information to a Zipkin server at the default port <code>:9441</code>. This includes a graphical interface that allows you to search and view log traces.</p>

<p>For more information on the Zipkin server, take a look at <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin#quick-start">their quick start page</a>. The Zipkin server you’re launching uses a default, in-memory store that does not persist data. When you restart the service, all data will be lost. This is great for testing. For production, you might want to use a persisting store. Zipkin supports Cassandra, Elasticsearch, and MySQL. See <a href="https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-server">the GitHub page</a> for more information.</p>

<p>There is a Spring Boot annotation, <code>@EnableZipkinServer</code>, that launches a Zipkin server for you. However, this annotation is deprecated. Instead, they suggest downloading the server as a JAR file and launching that.</p>

<p>Open a new bash shell. Use the following command to download the latest Zipkin server as a JAR file.</p>

   <code>curl -sSL https://zipkin.io/quickstart.sh | bash -s io.zipkin:zipkin-server:LATEST:slim zipkin.jar
</code>   

<p>Run the server and leave it running while you’re working on the tutorial.</p>

   <code>java -jar zipkin.jar
</code>   

<p>You’ll see some output on the console ending with the following.</p>

   <code>2021-06-21 10:19:20:587 [armeria-boss-http-*:9411] INFO Server - Serving HTTP at /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0%0:9411 - http://127.0.0.1:9411/
</code>   

<p>There’s nothing to see yet, but you can open the Zipkin dashboard in a browser: <code>http://localhost:9411</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Launch Two App Instances 

<p>Now you’re ready to launch the instances of your app. First, you need to run the following commands in two separate shells. Notice that you’re using the environment variables to pass the application name and port to the Spring Boot app.</p>

<p>Service A:</p>
   <code>APP_NAME="Service A" APP_PORT=8081 ./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Service B:</p>
   <code>APP_NAME="Service B" APP_PORT=8082 ./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>You should see console output like the following for both apps.</p>

   <code>...
2021-06-21 10:26:41.539  INFO [Service A,,] 126840 --- [           main] o.s.s.concurrent.ThreadPoolTaskExecutor  : Initializing ExecutorService 'applicationTaskExecutor'
2021-06-21 10:26:41.769  INFO [Service A,,] 126840 --- [           main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port(s): 8081 (http) with context path ''

</code>   

<p>Try a test request. Open a new bash shell (the fourth, for those counting). Use HTTPie to make a GET request at the <code>/a</code> endpoint.</p>

   <code>http :8081/a
</code>   

<p>You’ll get denied.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 
</code>   

<p>This is expected. You need to include a valid JWT.</p>

 Create a Valid JWT with OIDC Debugger 

<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>

<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>

<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>

<p>Scroll down and click SEND REQUEST.</p>

<p>You should get a success page with an access token. Then, if you’re curious, you can inspect the decoded token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the token value to the clipboard.</p>

<p>In the bash shell that you will make the HTTP requests from, save the token value as a shell variable.</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJJdXVaRG00RTg5WUg5U1JoeC1tbWl...
</code>   

 Confirm Spring Cloud Sleuth Works 

<p>Great. At this point, you should have four bash terminals going.</p>

 
   Spring Boot service A 
   Spring Boot service B 
   Zipkin server 
   Bash terminal for making requests with HTTPie (where you just stored your JWT) 
 

<p>You’re going to make a simple GET request to service A on endpoint <code>/a</code>. Service A will log the request and make a call to service B on endpoint <code>/b</code>. Service B will log that request and return a reply back to service A. Service A will log that it received a reply and will return the reply to your bash terminal.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This example is a little contrived, but the point is to show you how each log even will have a unique Sleuth span value while the entire request flow will share the same trace value.</p>

<p>Make a request to service A endpoint <code>/a</code> using the JWT you just created.</p>

   <code>http :8081/a "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

<p>If all went well, you should see this.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...

Hello from /a - Service A, Hello from /b - Service B

</code>   

<p>Take a look at the console output from the two services.</p>

<p>Service A</p>
   <code>2021-06-21 15:28:38.800  INFO [Service A,ef0fe81ff18325ff,ef0fe81ff18325ff] 14429 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] e.d.DemoApplication$SimpleRestController : Handling a - Service A
2021-06-21 15:28:39.577  INFO [Service A,ef0fe81ff18325ff,ef0fe81ff18325ff] 14429 --- [nio-8081-exec-1] e.d.DemoApplication$SimpleRestController : Reply = Hello from /b - Service B
</code>   

<p>Service B</p>
   <code>2021-06-21 15:28:39.556  INFO [Service B,ef0fe81ff18325ff,76b95441dd8d0300] 14466 --- [nio-8082-exec-1] e.d.DemoApplication$SimpleRestController : Handling b - Service B
</code>   

<p>All of these log entries have the Sleuth span and trace IDs injected into them, along with the service names.</p>

   <code>[Service A,ef0fe81ff18325ff,ef0fe81ff18325ff]
[SERVICE NAME, TRACE, SPAN]
</code>   

<p>Notice how the first ID is the same for all three entries. That’s the Sleuth trace ID that ties the entire request sequence together. Also, notice that for the entries for service A, the span and trace IDs are actually the same. That’s because this is the initial Sleuth logging event that kicks off the request tree, so that ID is the ID of the root span, which becomes the trace ID for the rest of the tree.</p>

<p>Take a look at the Zipkin dashboard at <code>http://localhost:9411</code>.</p>

<p>Click Run Query. You’ll have one result.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Show, and you’ll see a detailed summary of the request tracing and logging.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you look at the detailed graph, you’ll see three spans. The original GET request from the bash shell is the first one. Within that, a span encompasses the GET request to service B from service A and a third span encompasses service B receiving the GET request.</p>

 Learn More About Spring and Spring Boot 

<p>In this tutorial, you learned a little about Spring Cloud Sleuth and how it can trace requests through service meshes built with Spring Boot. You created an example application that you started two instances of and used Spring Cloud Sleuth to track an example request through the service network. Next, you secured the services using Okta JWT OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. Finally, you ran a local Zipkin server that allowed you to visualize the Sleuth span and trace entries in your logs.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-cloud-sleuth-example">okta-spring-cloud-sleuth-example</a> repository.</p>

 Install AWS Serverless CLI, Python 3, and Tornado 

<p>If you haven’t already got an AWS account, create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">AWS Free Tier Account</a>.</p>

<p>Next, install the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html">AWS SAM CLI</a>.</p>

<p>Next, if you don’t already have Python installed on your computer, you will need to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install a recent version of Python 3</a>.</p>

<p>Now, create a directory where all of our future code will live.</p>

   <code>mkdir aws-python
cd aws-python
</code>   

<p>To avoid issues running the wrong version of Python and its dependencies, it is recommended to create a virtual environment so that the commands <code>python</code> and <code>pip</code> run the correct versions:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv .venv
</code>   

<p>This creates a directory called <code>.venv</code> containing the Python binaries and dependencies. This directory should be added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file. This needs to be activated to use it:</p>

   <code>source .venv/bin/activate
</code>   

<p>You can run the following command to see which version you are running.</p>

   <code>python --version
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to install the Tornado Python library to build a web server for the front end.</p>

   <code>pip install tornado
</code>   

 Create an Okta Account and Application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



 CORS and Effect on AWS Lambda 

<p>As an important aside, we need to make a design decision as to how to pass the access token from the web front end to the Python backend Lambda function. There are several ways this can be done, it can be passed as an authorization header, in a cookie, or as a query or post parameter.</p>

<p>As the backend will be implemented as an AWS Lambda function, this limits our choice due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) restrictions. Web pages are hosted on a web server that has a domain name called the origin domain. When a web page needs to communicate with a backend API, a JavaScript function makes an HTTP request to the backend server. If the domain name, or even the port number, of the backend server, differs from the origin domain, then the browser will refuse the response due to CORS.</p>

<p>In order to overcome CORS restrictions, the backend server needs to set response headers that give the browser permission to accept the response data. The most important header is the one that specifies which origin domain can receive the response:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.example.com
</code>   

<p>It is also possible to allow access from any origin domain:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</code>   

<p>Do be careful about allowing any domain, as it will almost certainly be flagged at a security audit, and may be in violation of an information security regulation.</p>

<p>CORS also adds further restrictions on which request HTTP headers are allowed. In particular, the <code>Authorization</code> header is forbidden. The restriction can be overcome by adding a second response header:</p>

   <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
</code>   

<p>There is however a further complication. The browser doesn’t know whether the server will allow the authorization header to be sent. To overcome this, the browser will make a preflight request to the server to determine whether the actual request will be allowed. The preflight request is an HTTP OPTIONS request. If the response contains the correct CORS headers then the actual request will be made.</p>

<p>The application we are going to build has a backend API implemented in Python, which will validate the access token on each request. This function is deployed as an AWS Lambda function. Unfortunately, the container in which the Lambda function is deployed will receive the preflight request. It will attempt to validate the token in the authorization header. This will fail as the container doesn’t have the public key required to validate the token, resulting in a <code>403 Forbidden</code> response.</p>

<p>We can’t use the authorization header, and cookies are often blocked, so we will send the token as a POST parameter.</p>

 Build a Simple HTML and JavaScript Client 

<p>We will start by building a simple web front end in HTML and JavaScript. It will be served by a web server written in Python.</p>

<p>First of all, create a directory called <code>client</code> which will contain static content.</p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/index.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;How to write a secure Python Serverless App on AWS Lambda&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;script src="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.7.3/js/okta-sign-in.min.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;link href="https://global.oktacdn.com/okta-signin-widget/5.7.3/css/okta-sign-in.min.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"/&gt;
        &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /&gt;
        &lt;script src="control.js" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;How to write a secure Python Serverless App on AWS Lambda&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;div id="widget-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="centred"&gt;
            &lt;form id="messageForm"&gt;
                Message: &lt;input id="message" name="message" type="message"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="hidden" id="token" name="token"/&gt;
                &lt;input type="button" value="Send" onclick="onmessage()"/&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
            &lt;textarea id="messages" name="messages" rows="10" cols="50"&gt;Messages&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The Okta Sign-In Widget’s JavaScript and CSS files are loaded from Okta’s global CDN (content delivery network). The <code>widget-container</code> will be replaced by the login form when the page loads. The page contains a simple form that has a test box for a message and a hidden input that will hold the access token. The text area at the bottom will display responses from the server.</p>

<p>Now, create a stylesheet called <code>client/style.css</code>. Here is an example:</p>

   <code>body {
    background-color: #ccccff;
    text-align: left;
}

h1 {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 50pt;
    font-style: italic;
    color: #0000FF;
    clear: both;
}

h2 {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 30pt;
    font-style: normal;
    color: #0000FF;
    clear: both;
}

.centred {
    text-align: center;
    display: block;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>client/control.js</code> with the following JavaScript:</p>

   <code>var accessToken = null;

var signIn = new OktaSignIn({
    baseUrl: 'http://{yourOktaDomain}',
    clientId: '{yourClientId}',
    redirectUri: window.location.origin,
    authParams: {
        issuer: '/oauth2/default',
        responseType: ['token', 'id_token']
    }
});

signIn.renderEl({
    el: '#widget-container'
}, function success(res) {
    if (res.status === 'SUCCESS') {
        accessToken = res.tokens.accessToken.accessToken;
        signIn.hide();
    } else {
        alert('fail);')
    }
}, function(error) {
    alert('error ' + error);
});

function onmessage() {
    const url = "http://localhost:3000/api/messages";
    var headers = {}
    if (accessToken != null) {
        document.getElementById('token').value = accessToken;
    }
    fetch(url, {
        method : "POST",
        mode: 'cors',
        body: new URLSearchParams(new FormData(document.getElementById("messageForm"))),
    })
    .then((response) =&gt; {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(response.error)
        }
        return response.text();
    })
    .then(data =&gt; {
        messages = JSON.parse(data)
        document.getElementById('messages').value = messages.join('\n');
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
        document.getElementById('messages').value = error;
    });
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s see what this JavaScript does. It declares a variable that will hold the access token. It then creates an <code>OktaSignIn</code> object. Replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientId}</code> with the values from the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>The <code>renderEl()</code> function displays the login form and performs the authentication process. On successful login, the access token is extracted from the response and saved. The login form is then hidden.</p>

<p>The <code>onmessage()</code> function is called when the user hits the submit button on the form. It stores the access token in the hidden input on the form and then makes a POST request to the backend server. It writes the response from the server into the text area.</p>

 Build a Web Server in Python 

<p>Now you are going to build a web server in Python to serve the static content. A web server is required because some of the JavaScript will not work if you simply load the page into a browser.</p>

<p>You will make the server a Python package, which is simply a directory, in this case, called <code>server</code>, containing Python code. Python packages require a file called <code>__init__.py</code>. This is run when the package is loaded and is often just an empty file.</p>

   <code>mkdir server
touch server/__init__.py
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>server/FileHandler.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>from tornado.web import StaticFileHandler

class FileHandler(StaticFileHandler):
    def initialize(self, path):
        self.absolute_path = False
        super(FileHandler, self).initialize(path)
</code>   

<p>It uses the Python Tornado framework and implements a static file handler that serves any files from the directory specified in the <code>path</code> constructor parameter.</p>

<p>Next, create a file called <code>server/__main__.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>import signal
import sys
from tornado.httpserver import HTTPServer
from tornado.ioloop import IOLoop
from tornado.options import define, options
from tornado.web import Application, RequestHandler
from server.FileHandler import FileHandler

define("port", default=8080, help="Listener port")
options.parse_command_line()
application = Application([
    ('/()$', FileHandler, {'path': "client/index.html"}),
    ('/(.*)', FileHandler, {'path': "client"}),
])
http_server = HTTPServer(application)
http_server.listen(options.port)
print("Listening on port", options.port)
try:
    IOLoop.current().start()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
   print("Exiting")
   IOLoop.current().stop()
</code>   

<p>This, first of all, looks for a command line parameter called <code>--port</code> to obtain a port number to listen on which defaults to 8080.</p>

<p>An <code>Application</code> object is created which implements a Tornado web server. The application is constructed with a list of tuples. Each tuple has two or more values. The first value is a URI. This can be a regular expression. Any URI component in parentheses is captured as a path parameter. The second tuple value is a Python class that handles requests for matching URIs. Any remaining values are path parameters captured from the URI. They become constructor parameters as an instance of the class is created on each request. In this case, the file or directory containing the static content is specified.</p>

<p>Finally, the server is created and started.</p>

<p>Now, the front end can be tested by starting the server and pointing a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

   <code>python -m server --port=8080
</code>   

<p>You should be able to log in using your Okta credentials. You will not be able to send a message at this stage as there is currently no backend.</p>

 Create an AWS Lambda Function in Python 

<p>You need to create a basic AWS Lambda function. You can use the SAM CLI to build, run, and deploy the application. Lambda functions can be built and run locally in a Docker container which emulates the AWS environment.</p>

<p>First of all, create a directory called <code>auth-app</code>, and create a Python package called <code>messages</code> inside it:</p>

   <code>mkdir -p auth-app/messages
touch auth-app/messages/__init__.py
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>auth-app/messages/requirements.txt</code> containing a list of packages to be loaded by <code>pip</code>:</p>

   <code>jwt
requests
tornado
</code>   

<p>Next, create a simple Lambda function. Create a file called <code>auth-app/messages/messages.py</code> containing the following Python code:</p>

   <code>def message(event, context):
    return { 
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello World!'
    }
</code>   

<p>The function has two parameters, which are both dictionaries. You will be using the <code>event</code> map later to extract request parameters. The function has to return a dictionary containing the HTTP response code and the response body.</p>

<p>Next, you need to create the deployment template file <code>auth-app/template.yaml</code>:</p>

   <code>AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

</code>   

<p>The globals section defines a timeout. This is the maximum time the function is allowed to complete a request.</p>

<p>The resources section defines one or more Lambda functions. It defines any environment variables that will be passed to the function. The <code>CodeUri</code> defines the Python package containing the function. The <code>Handler</code> defines the Python function to call. The <code>Runtime</code> defines the language and version of the executable environment, in this case, Python 3.7. The events define the API, the path is the request URI, and the method is the HTTP request method.</p>

<p>Next, build the application in a Docker container. The first time this command is executed, SAM will pull a Docker image. This can take some time to download.</p>

   <code>cd auth-app
sam build --use-container
</code>   

<p>The build creates a directory called <code>auth-app/.aws-sam</code>.  This should be added to your <code>.gitignore</code> file.</p>

<p>Now, you can run the application locally:</p>

   <code>sam local start-api
</code>   

<p>Then test it using <code>curl</code>:</p>

   <code>curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/messages
</code>   

 Validate a JWT Offline in a Python Lambda Function 

<p>Offline JWT validation requires a public key. Authentication providers, such as Okta, provide a URL that returns a public key set (JWKS). The key set is a JSON array. We are going to base64 encode the JSON array to make it more manageable. Issue the following command to get the base64 encoded keys:</p>

   <code>curl https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/keys | base64
</code>   

<p>Next, create a file called <code>env</code> in the <code>auth-app</code> directory that overrides environment variables in the template file:</p>

   <code>{
    "MessagesFunction" : {
        "OKTA_KEYS": "base64 string from key provider"
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you are going to extract the public key from the key set. There can be multiple keys, but I will assume that there is only one, which is often the case. Add the following Python code to <code>auth-app/messages/messages.py</code>:</p>

   <code>import base64
from jwt import (JWT, jwk_from_dict)
from jwt.exceptions import JWTDecodeError
import os

public_key = None

def get_keys():
    keys = base64.b64decode(os.environ['OKTA_KEYS'])
    jwks = json.loads(keys)
    for jwk in jwks['keys']:
        public_key = jwk_from_dict(jwk)

get_keys()
</code>   

<p>NOTE: This post uses local validation of JWTs rather than using the introspect endpoint to validate them remotely. This is done for efficiency.</p>

<p>The function gets called when the file is loaded. It extracts the JWKS from the environment variable and does a base64 decode to get the JSON string. This is then turned into a Python dictionary. It then calls <code>jwk_from_dict()</code>, which extracts the public key.</p>

<p>Next, add a verify functions which validates the token using the public key:</p>

   <code>def verify(token):
    result = {}
    try:
        decoded = instance.decode(token, public_key, False)
    except JWTDecodeError:
        result = { 'statusCode': 403, 'body': 'Forbidden '}
    return result
</code>   

<p>You also need a helper function to extract the URL encoded POST form data:</p>

   <code>def get_post_data(body):
    postdata = {}
    for items in body.split('&amp;'):
        values = items.split('=')
        postdata[values[0]] = values[1]
    return postdata
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to modify the main <code>message()</code> function to do validation and return the messages or an error:</p>

   <code>def message(event, context):
    body = get_post_data(event['body'])
    result = verify(body['token'])
    if not bool(result):
        messages.append(body['message'])
        result = { 
            'statusCode': 200,
            'headers': {
                'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
                'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'OPTIONS,POST,GET',
            },
            'body': json.dumps(messages) 
    }
    return result
</code>   

<p>NOTE: Notice that the response includes the CORS headers.</p>

<p>You now have a complete application. Build and start the AWS backend:</p>

   <code>sam build --use-container
sam local start-api --env-vars env
</code>   

<p>Start the frontend webserver:</p>

   <code>python -m server --port=8080
</code>   

<p>Now, point a web browser at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. Type in a message and submit the form. You should get a 401 error message displayed. Log in using your Okta credentials. Now send another message. You should see a list of messages.</p>

<p>TIP: When working with complex web applications, always have the developer console open on the browser. It will save a lot of time diagnosing JavaScript and network errors.</p>

 Learn More About Python, JWTs, and AWS 

<p>You have now built an application that uses Okta authentication to obtain a JWT access token. A Python API validates the token using a public key before processing any requests.</p>

<p>You only did local deployment as a proof of concept.  To deploy a Lambda function into the cloud use:</p>

   <code>sam deploy --guided
</code>   

<p>This will prompt and guide you through the deployment process and give you the URL to the deployed function.</p>

<p>While writing this post, I experienced first-hand how confusing and overly complicated Amazon documentation can be. As you can see, the actual minimal code to make things work is quite simple.</p>

<p>There are some downsides. The functions have to be started when requests arrive. This can add latency. Also, you have no control over which instance of a function will handle a request. Typically each request will be handled by a different instance of a function. Any data which needs to be available across requests must be stored in cloud storage or a database.</p>

<p>Serverless applications are definitely the way forward. The beauty is that you can simply deploy a function into a cloud, and not have to create any server environment to host the function. The functions can be written in a number of programming languages including Go, Java, and Python.</p>

<p>The cloud replicates the functions depending on demand. They scale to zero, meaning that they use no resources, and hence incur no costs when not being used.</p>

We would have to be completely confident that, as everyone represents their own data to the network, there is no way for people to misrepresent their data.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbTo_e3l_Lk">Self-Sovereign Identity (w/ Fabian Vogelsteller &amp; Constantin Kogan)</a> <blockquote><p>Constantin Kogan joins Fabian Vogelsteller, Ethereum developer, LUKSO founder, creator of Mist browser, web3.js, Feindura (CMS), ERC20, and ERC-725 protocols, and author of Meteor.js.&nbsp;</p></blockquote> <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/magic-raises-27m-to-future-proof-authentication-79d8c63b2813">Magic Raises $27M to Future-Proof Authentication</a> <blockquote><p>Magic makes it plug and play for developers to add secure, passwordless login, like magic links and WebAuthn, to their applications.

Endorsed by the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/assets/pdf/Roadmap_for_Digital_Cooperation_EN.pdf">UN Secretary General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation</a>, the Digital Public Goods Alliance defines digital public goods as “<a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/about/">open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs</a>).” DPGs are a growing part of discussions about how to ensure that digital transformation delivers on development outcomes and&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Caribou Digital convened a group of senior policymakers, donors, and practitioners to build on the important work being done to shape the concept of digital public goods, and how they can be advanced to meet the challenges presented by increasingly pervasive and rapid digital transformation. What follows is a collated and editorialised account of the major points discussed during the conversation in the form of four key takeaways and two concrete&nbsp;actions.</p> Digital transformation is neither good, nor bad, but never&nbsp;neutral. <p>Digitalisation is transforming the world faster than ever imagined, thus there is value in discussing the concept of DPGs. In the words of one participant, ‘we need to shape it in a way that is more acceptable to us, that serves the world, rather than a few corporations’. Focusing on DPGs is a response to that — and to the recognition that the private sector is not always equipped to deliver public sector outcomes and that the interests of the public and private sector are not always aligned. For example, at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the <a href="https://id4africa.com/">ID4Africa Movement</a>, a poll of the delegates identified vendor lock-in as their main concern. This emphasis on challenges of public procurement of digital infrastructure has led to a focus on open source platforms for the public sector and public sector service delivery. This is reflected in the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/content/digital-cooperation-roadmap/">United Nations’ Secretary General’s Roadmap towards Digital Cooperation, </a>the <a href="https://solutions.dial.community/products">Digital Impact Alliance’s work on DPGs,</a>and the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/">Digital Public Goods Alliance&nbsp;(DPGA)</a>.</p> Beyond DPGs as open-source platforms. <p>Discussion around DPGs is dominated by the use of open source platforms to address challenges such as vendor lock-in identified by those African governments from the survey. These solutions take the form of tools such as the open-source ID platform <a href="https://www.mosip.io/">MOSIP</a> or the interoperable financial infrastructure <a href="https://mojaloop.io/">Mojaloop</a>;the <a href="https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/">DPGA’s database currently lists nearly 600 platforms</a> that qualify as DPGs. However, critically, it’s not the platforms that define DPGs but rather the standards that determine whether a platform is a public goods,such as data security, privacy, and legal compliance. But DPGs need to be viewed beyond open-source models. As participants in the discussion flagged, open-source technologies do not inherently serve the public good, as they are frequently used by the private sector to serve private interests rather than the public good, such as mobile operator MTN using the open-source financial service platform Mojaloop in Malawi. Ensuring that digital infrastructure serves the public good goes beyond questions around hardware and software to include questions of governance, security, and the relationship between the public and private sector. These issues of digital governance are critical: defining digital goals, standards, codes, and accountability mechanisms. The development sector has few shared policies, standards, and codes;the DPGs conversation should drive consistency in governance as much as in systems and platforms.</p> Context eats technology for breakfast. <p>While technologies — open source and otherwise — can help address critical issues and progress towards the SDGs, the particularities of context demand flexibility and responsiveness. Thus, an approach to DPGs that emphasises standards and governance is critical to ensuring that we can build frameworks that can help influence processes of digital transformation towards the public good. This approach must stress protection to mitigate the harms that we increasingly recognise can be amplified through digital transformation of public&nbsp;goods.</p> Expand beyond government to&nbsp;society. <p>The development community needs to expand its’ conception of public goods beyond the current focus on their role in government and state infrastructure, such as digital identity and financial rails. The understanding of public goods needs to be expanded to meet critical challenges faced by people in both the Global South and North: the challenges of work, such as disintermediating employment platforms (see our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods/home">Platform Livelihoods work</a> and others such as the <a href="https://fair.work/en/fw/homepage/">Fairwork Foundation</a>), and the erosion of a public sphere through collapsing media models (see <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/unbundling-the-imaginary-community-adf1eb7e5ea8">our work on alternatives to ad-based business model</a>s and work such as the <a href="https://publicmediastack.com/">Public Media Stack</a>). The DPGA’s work on content, such as the <a href="https://digitallibrary.io/">Global Digital Library</a>, is also helpful&nbsp;here.</p> Concrete steps to advance the role of Digital Public Goods in development  Define our problems. <p>DPGs are a theme of our time, but they are clearly an evolving conversation. It’s critical that the development community starts from a definition of the core problems it seeks to address and articulates what they are trying to solve for, in order to provide guidance for how to best solve them. For example, we need to be precise about where the market failure is across the delivery value chain. Because if we don’t define our problem, we’ll waste effort and resources building things that are not as effective as they need to&nbsp;be.</p> Define standards for public&nbsp;goods. <p>To move beyond systems to focus on standards, governance, and regulations that can support the public good, we need to bring stakeholders together to agree on shared vision, values, and goals that can be supported by appropriate standards. For example, there is growing concern around the protection aspects of technologies used in cash transfers and digital identity, yet there are no shared standards across the development and humanitarian sector to guide approaches to these critical technologies. If we want to start talking about things like Open Banking, protection must be right at the core of the conversation.</p><p>This conversation on public goods brought together policy makers and practitioners from across a wide variety of contexts who spoke frankly and freely about their approach to and work on DPGs. These conversations, like the ones we remember from post- conference and seminar coffee, drinks, and dinner, are the conversations that our series of diagnostic discussions facilitates.</p> Participants: <p>Chris Locke&nbsp;: Caribou&nbsp;Digital</p><p>Jonathan Wong&nbsp;:&nbsp;UNESCAP</p><p>Anand Varghese&nbsp;:&nbsp;DAI</p><p>Chris Burns&nbsp;:&nbsp;USAID</p><p>Emily Middleton&nbsp;: Public&nbsp;Digital</p><p>CV Madhukar&nbsp;:&nbsp;Omidyar</p><p>Ben Ramalingam&nbsp;: Humanitarian Innovation Hub</p><p>Greta Bull&nbsp;:&nbsp;CGAP</p><p>Kari Jacobsen&nbsp;:&nbsp;NORAD</p><p>Tomicah Tilleman&nbsp;: New America Foundation</p><p>Jason Munyan&nbsp;: UN Office of Special Envoy for&nbsp;Tech</p><p>Emrys Schoemaker&nbsp;: Caribou&nbsp;Digital</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/digital-public-goods-for-development-a1266a72c67a">Digital Public Goods for Development</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep. 4: Ending Modern Slavery with Technology &amp; Social Movements, with Helen&nbsp;Burrows <p>How can we effectively combat slavery in global trade when policy and governments fall short? Human rights lawyer and activist Helen Burrows joins the show to discuss how corporations and consumers can bring an end to slavery and labor abuses through better technology and social awareness.</p> Episode Notes: <p>On this episode, I’m joined by Helen Burrows. A human rights lawyer turned activist, in recent years she’s focused on combatting slavery in the supply chains which give us the clothes on our backs, the phones in our pockets, and so much&nbsp;more.</p><p>We discuss the scale of this dark facet of material culture, how it flourished with trade globalization, how governments have failed to do anything about it, and how a combination of technological innovation and social action between corporations and consumers can create a better path forward. There were some technical difficulties during recording, so please forgive the audio quality. Nevertheless, I hope this conversation illuminates your understanding of the real costs of our stuff and how we can make it better, for everyone.</p><p>All music courtesy of Zoe Keating. Track: “Optimist”</p> Episode Outline   Introduction [00:01:09]  Our Slavery Footprint [00:02:41]  Corporate versus Social Action | Satyagraha and Holding Firmly to Truth [00:04:13]  Breaking Open Corporate Silos with Blockchain [00:08:45]  Removing the Veil of Ignorance [00:12:05]  Hacking the Profit Mindset for Social Good [00:19:44]  Mattereum: Satyagraha-as-a-Service [00:21:42]  Understanding as a Prelude to Change [00:23:29]  Automated Morality [00:28:25]  The Flaws of Trade Globalization [00:33:05]  On Helen’s Work with Mattereum [00:35:45]   Introduction [00:01:09] <p>Garrison: All right. Let’s just get into it. Cool. Would you like to introduce yourself to the listeners?</p><p>Helen: My name is Helen Burroughs. I am a lawyer by training, but for the past 20 years, I’ve worked in legal and judicial reform with around 50 countries around the world. On anything from access to justice, to anti-corruption, human rights, to human trafficking.</p><p>In the last five or so years, I deepened my interest and work in the anti-slavery field. Considering the work I’ve done on that and related areas for a lot of years in lots of countries, I’ve seen how completely ineffective governments have been doing anything to eliminate this, currently impacting around 40 million people around the world and realize that it’s companies and consumers that are the answer to this issue, I think, and that we can see more traction in less time by focusing in that direction, rather than on relying on governments to get the law and its enforcement right.</p><p>So, my interest has been in, how do we increase the capacity or decrease rather the capacity of supply chains and make them more transparent, so we know where our stuff comes from, how it’s made and what harm or not it may have done along the way to our doorstep.</p> Our Slavery Footprint [00:02:41] <p>Garrison: Anti-slavery work, on the supply chain front is something I’ve been aware of for a few years now. And you hear a bunch of stories. You hear a bunch of pilot programs from basically every supply chain company under the sun, but you never really see any sort of a huge fundamental shift in how people do&nbsp;things.</p><p>Before we get into the weeds, I want to relay something and something I would suggest listeners do is there’s a website called slavery footprint dot org. And it has, you know, information on the subject in terms of the scope of it. And it also has a survey that you can take. It’ll ask you about your diet and the overall kind of composition of your household. How many cars do you have? How many bedrooms or home office, your wardrobe composition like whether or not you have leather shoes&nbsp;, electronics, and it gives you a projection of roughly the number of slaves that are working for you to secure your lifestyle.</p><p>When I took the survey, it projected 26. Instantly in my head, I imagined what about like my neighbors and then everyone else in the town and then in the state, in the country. And then I just imagine that number just like just rocketing up. It is quite striking.</p> Corporate versus Social Action | Satyagraha and Holding Firmly to Truth [00:04:13] <p>Garrison: Something I planned on talking about like later in the conversation. But I liked that you mentioned it right off the bat, which was that you lost hope, unfortunately, that government would enact the necessary policy to get more transparency out of the corporate supply chain, have it be a mandated thing, an industrial standard, and that you think it’s gonna come down to consumers and awareness and like social movement from the consumer side. I think that kind of difference between corporate action and the action of people as a whole is a really interesting thing cause it’s very different. And it’s very difficult.</p><p>There are instances of this happening in the past very effectively.</p><p>There’s a concept I like called Satyagraha, which was Gandhi’s driving philosophy in terms of how he conducted his social movements. And it was a direct influence on the civil rights movement with Martin Luther King and also with Nelson Mandela, fighting apartheid in South&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>And what Satyagraha means is “holding firmly to truth,” or it’s an insistence on truth. You show that institutions of power, like what they’re actually doing to people, and then it’s on them. You know this without a doubt. It’s irrefutable. What are you going to do? And it could be remarkably effective. So I wonder, do you think that would be possible now, like that kind of very thorough systemic&nbsp;change?</p><p>Helen: I think we’re sitting on the cusp of it. And I dunno whether that’s a kind of wince answer but I don’t think we’re there yet. I think that the movements that you’ve mentioned, this is a little bit different because it’s often been the oppressed rising up and not taking any shit anymore. Whereas slavery by its nature is hidden. Slaves cannot get out in the streets and voice their concern about the status quo and demand emancipation. That’s not how the mechanics of this industry functions. So we’re not looking at the same type of movement, but the same type of energy is absolutely required.</p><p>The same type of commitment is required because obviously it wasn’t just Martin Luther King and his people. The movement was massive and included people from everywhere of every color. And so it’s not just that, but the nucleus of those movements is different to the nucleus of this movement. And I don’t think consumers, society, are there enough in enough numbers yet to produce any kind of tipping point to transformation. So I think it’s also gonna take the convergence of industry saying, “We don’t want to do any harm. We’re trying our best not to, but we actually don’t know the harm that we’re doing and we don’t know a better way of doing business.”</p><p>Holding onto the truth, holding firm to the truth, is what we want to do is provide that truth because at the moment that the truth is, you know, a little bit colored in here and there, but there’s plenty of gaps that we don’t know. So it’s the democratization of truth, actually, to be able to see it on a broader&nbsp;scale.</p><p>So companies can say, “We’re not done with that. We want to be sustainable environmentally and as regards to social labor standards. And we’re not okay with this. So we’re going to change how we operate.” But being upfront about that and consumers saying, “Now I know where my product comes from and how it’s made at every point along the way, I can now make an informed choice about whether or not I want to buy that&nbsp;thing.”</p><p>So I think the movement is coming, but we have to preempt the movement by providing the foundations for this democratization of knowledge and therefore truth to put more fuel underneath the energy that exists. But I mean, we have seen different movements. The vegan movement for example is fundamentally different to civil rights movement, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>That’s one that’s done great things. So it’s not like it’s the only type of movement that can succeed absolutely, but it depends a lot on the commitment and the energy of the people at the nucleus. So yeah, I think that we’re not there yet. We’re on the cusp of&nbsp;it</p> Breaking Open Corporate Silos with Blockchain [00:08:45] <p>Garrison: On this aspect of kind of putting it on the otus of industry to adopt these standards into like really put an effort into doing this. You’re interested in blockchain technology in the application of this. Would you care to go into that in more&nbsp;detail?</p><p>Helen: Ah, so I think the benefits of blockchain technology offer themselves in a couple of different realms in this space. One is I think, philosophically again, the sort of democratization of information, access to it, and the concept of the disintermediation of information and the breaking down of silos because that’s been a huge problem across the board. But, you know, as it relates to slavery, the company will keep its information about its supply chain and what it makes might have found in terms of labor abuses. They’ll keep that really secret, of course. And then this government department keeps its information secret and the NGOs don’t have outlets to communicate what they know and workers themselves don’t have outlets to communicate. So by breaking down all of those kinds of barriers, and I’m not talking about blockchain technology itself, but the philosophy behind removing silos is something that is uniquely innovative about the approach. And in terms of the technology itself: the immutability of information. So obviously, if you put junk in, you get junk out, like we always and so it’s a case of ensuring that we have adequately robust sources of triangulated, checked, verifiable data that goes in. And as long as that process can be assured, then what then ends up on the blockchain can not be changed obviously. And that’s a radical departure from what we’ve ever been able to do before in terms of the collection and presentation of information about this side of how things&nbsp;work.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. In some sense it’s yeah. A clever hack for truth or I guess consensus is a better word. It’s not capital T truth in this sense. But one thing that I’ve noticed, being active in this space for about four years now is there’s been so many supply chain blockchain projects. So many of them. Entire consortiums have been formed and they do these track and trace pilot programs, but they don’t go anywhere.</p><p>Helen: No, they don’t because track and trace is so two-dimensional. It just tells you that this flask that I’m holding, that nobody can see: where it originated and then it was tagged and then we can trace it as it travels all over the world. And so it ends up being recycled I thought. It doesn’t tell me anything about the labor conditions of the people who manufactured the aluminium. It doesn’t tell me where the paint was made and who painted it and how noxious it may be. It doesn’t tell me where the plastic came from. It doesn’t tell us anything that we need to know about this product in order to make ethical choices about whether I want to buy&nbsp;it.</p> Removing the Veil of Ignorance [00:12:05] <p>Garrison: In some of the writing I’ve been doing for Mattereum, I describe it as a zero history problem. This concept of zero history in our stuff is really problematic. Cause like you said, we don’t really know where it comes from. We don’t know about the labor conditions that brought it into the world. And it’s just kind of part of this larger systemic problem of managing production and consumption in society. Like that cycle is so bloated. It’s just a ever-hungry machine that keeps churning.</p><p>Helen: Exactly, it wasn’t that long ago that there were four seasons in the fashion year. Now there’s 52. So, you know, just the exponential increase of what we’re told we have to buy. And I’m just using fashion as one example of how it is across the board. We have to have this schedule and we have to have that, this will make our lives easier, quicker, faster, whatever. And we get caught up in it certainly.</p><p>It’s really in our faces. It’s a gluttonous consumer and level of consumerism that we don’t even realize that’s what we’re a party to fueling. We ripped off too. There’s lots of products out there that will have lovely green labels on them and tell us that um their cotton is organic, but it doesn’t tell us whether that cotton was picked by child slaves in Kazahkstan. The cotton’s organic so that’s all right. Or, it, it might say that this tuna was caught without a net or these prawns were sustainably farmed, but it doesn’t tell you that the guys on the boat doing the fishing have been on vessels for the last 25 years, passed on the high sea from boat to boat, completely enslaved, and their only chance of escape is to get sick and die and be thrown over the board. It doesn’t tell you anything like that. So as consumers, we don’t even know what we need to know. Because we’re not being told, we’re being told the cotton’s organic, there were no nets involved in his fishing and we think done deal, that’s&nbsp;it.</p><p>And we’ve been greenwashed and whitewashed. And we don’t look underneath the curtain. We’re not interested in looking underneath the hood enough to know more, to find out more, but I don’t really put the faults of that at the feet of consumers necessarily because we do rely on authority, including governments to do the right&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Even in the UK where arguably they’ve got one of the strongest pieces of anti-slavery legislation in the world, the level of dilution that was required in order to get that piece of law over the line meant that all companies have to do is pop the hood and have a quick look to see if anything looks out of place. And if it is then that’s fine. There’s no obligation to delve right down to the top or up to the top of your supply chain and tell us exactly what’s going on in micro detail. There’s nothing like that. So, you know, we rely on government to tell us what the standard is and what the requirements ought to be and what we need to know, but they’re not doing that job because of the various divergent pressures on them that pull them in a different direction. Then we get this sort of green, white-washing layered on top of that inside this sort of grotesquely, huge consumerist society that we are. And it’s just a recipe for continued disaster.</p><p>Garrison: And the culpability here is multi-dimensional. Like at a fundamental level, there’s also a part of it where our desire, like our capacity for desire, what we desire. Our desire as a function is being kind of manipulated. But there’s a self awareness on corporations that have multimillion dollar marketing budgets to sell us things or using algorithms to get us to market things to ourselves in the weird feedback loop. But the idea that, oh, people want things that are green. They want things that are sustainably sourced. Uh, Let’s give it to them. Even though there’s been plenty of cases where that was actually completely false. It’s a fancy packaging that looks organic and earthy, but there’s still in fact horrible stuff happening.</p><p>Helen: Often they don’t know. I remember having a conversation with the person who was at the time the head of sustainability at McDonald’s and of 80,000 supply chains that they had to keep an eye on. They said that their their due diligence was really comprehensive and robust. And in the last 12 months they had found one case of labor exploitation among 80,000 supply chains across multiple countries. You know, If you only find one case of exploitation in that many supply chains and loads of countries, your system doesn’t work. That’s the only explanation.</p><p>So companies often don’t know. And companies don’t have access at the moment to the capabilities that they need to get right down there in supply chains. If you think a mobile phone, how many components are in a mobile phone, trying to trace all of those diffuse supply chains around to their source, and then you get to the cobalt. And you’re like, we got as far as the smelter and then we were screwed. We didn’t know where it came from. There’s lots of really logistical, legitimate, as well as illegitimate reasons why companies don’t actually know, but instead of facing up to that and saying we’ve got gaps here in our knowledge, they just stick a label on and say, “Our cotton’s organic.”</p><p>And we go, oh, great. Organic cotton. I can sleep at night now I bought that organic cotton and I didn’t buy that rubbish pesticide laden one. Or 10% of the profits from this company goes to help women rescued from trafficking and prostitution in India. Great. I can sleep well. We rely on that one box tick, whatever their marketing people choose that box to&nbsp;be.</p><p>I think it’s the whole story. But again, we don’t know what we don’t know. And it’s getting out there, what we do need to know about these products. And in the environmental space, that’s incredibly complicated because it vastly depends on the product and its processes. Consumables in the anti-slavery space are a little easier in some respects, given the standards sort of universal of how you should treat people who work for&nbsp;you.</p><p>And you know what international law says about all of that. But not easy in terms of accessing the information, because this is a. $200 billion class a year industry. There’s a lot invested in the status quo and they will take a lot to deconstruct all of that. So there’s a lot invested in making sure that people don’t know what actually happens in various parts of various supply chains, because it is terrible.</p><p>So it’s not an easy thing to try and deal with. We need to start and lots of project, as you said, with the track and trace work is there’s just lots of anti-slavery and environmental protection work going on globally. As of course, we all know, but what’s missing is that straight line truth. That complete knowledge, or where there isn’t complete knowledge, the courage to say these are gaps and who can fill them for us. We’d like to know, and then whatever the result is, we’ll work with it and we’ll do what we can to make it better. And, you know, with that level of commitment and consumers behind them, then that’s what could produce this&nbsp;change.</p> Hacking the Profit Mindset for Social Good [00:19:44] <p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. I also wonder. Corporations operate under certain incentives. Profits are what they optimize for. So I wonder if there’s a way to almost like Trojan horse this insistence on truth at the systemic level by saying like, “ You’ll have all these incredible efficiency gains that it’ll actually be more valuable for you to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Helen: Yeah. Yeah. There’s a number of ways that this is financially at a level of value attractive to companies. Obviously we’re not going to go and start by trying to twist the arms of companies. You’d start with the companies that are really making, have made great inroads and demonstrated great levels of investment and commitment. You’d start there cause they’re the ones that want to do the right thing, but yet there’s massive efficiencies to be&nbsp;gained.</p><p>Look at all of the money that’s wasted in supply chains because time wastage, lags. So much goes wrong in the supply chain that could be massively tightened up to create huge time and cost efficiencies as well as anything else. And also, the other side of it, the flip side of it is that, what is it about 98% of a company’s value is its reputation. And when companies like like Zara get called out because the machinists have sewn notes into the hems of coats saying, pockets of coats saying, “Please help us. We haven’t been paid.” That wipes a lot off the slate in terms of that company’s value. And a lot of companies get called out. Obviously there’s a risk analysis to be done about whether you allow that risk to be on the table. That has the capacity to wipe a lot of value off of companies.</p><p>So for companies wanting to manage that risk, manage their risk, and also increase cost and time efficiencies in how they do business, then absolutely having a comprehensive line of sight down their supply chain is a very smart thing to&nbsp;do.</p> Mattereum: Satyagraha-as-a-Service [00:21:42] <p>Garrison: Absolutely. This podcast is presented by Mattereum. So listeners who may not be aware of Mattereum, but will probably be curious as to how we approach this kind of challenge.</p><p>So one of the kind of core inventions within the project is the Asset Passport. So just as you know, people have passports in order to travel freely internationally and cross borders, it’s a digital identity for an object instead. So this identity, this passport has very detailed information about the object, where it came from, what it is, weight. Is it vaulted somewhere? Any other kind of manufacturing or production data that’s necessary to have a very firm grasp Identifying this item. And also legal guarantees baked in so that there’s access to recourse if there’s like a commercial fallout. There’s arbitration and dispute resolution and stuff like that, all baked into an object that’s attached to this global marketplace by&nbsp;default.</p><p>We could have these digital identities created with supply chains at the point of production. So as soon as something is built before it’s, before it goes into the vast machinery of commerce, a provenance making sure that there’s no zero history there, like from the raw material to the finished product there’s this history that you can&nbsp;follow.</p><p>So in, in a way Vinay described it recently in a way that I like. He described as Satyagraha as a service: you’re seeing the truth of the objects that you produce as a company or that you consume or buy as a consumer.</p> Understanding as a Prelude to Change [00:23:29] <p>Garrison: There was a book that I I didn’t, I wasn’t able to read the whole thing before the call, called Blood and Earth (by Kevin&nbsp;Bales.)</p><p>He gives a really kind of clear description of him kind of seeing this thing. Actually going to the source of like where they’re mining minerals that ended up going into cell phones and seeing it in person. And it’s just there. And these operations are just simply operating. And just parts of the world as if there’s no, without a care in the world. But one thing he said that I think is the key to this is that once you know this, once you’re aware of this, you can’t forget it. You can’t ignore it. Or at least you can daydream all you want but once the facts are presented to you, you have to do something. And I think that idea that if people knew without a doubt, that that there were literally millions of slaves existing in the world today. We think of slavery as a bygone era like this dark past but it’s happening in either similar or in different ways. It’s kind of obscured, you know, in the giant machinery of&nbsp;trade.</p><p>I think one of the challenges with kind of driving awareness of this and trying to get a traction on the social front is you know, with social media and the way like the media landscape is nowadays we’re just constantly bombarded with information. Everything is happening all at once. Being connected as we are: it is both a beautiful and terrifying thing, depending on how that manifests. So do you think there’s a concern of effectively reaching the necessary number of people? Social awareness to the extent that actual change could be implemented.</p><p>Helen: I don’t think access with people will be the problem. It will be the approach that needs to be different from any approach that’s been used before. Because the approach that we often see is the picture of poverty, the physical child, woman, in a distressing situation. And that’s meant to tug on our heart strings adequately for us to take&nbsp;action.</p><p>All it does is make us feel bad and disconnects us because we don’t know that person is one of 40 million. Which is too big for us to contemplate in terms of how can I make a difference to 40 million people. We have to connect it, human to human, and have it resonate between your life and their life. My life and their life. We have to make the connection. Also, most people don’t know that 80% of the stuff they buy has been touched somewhere along the line by a slave, at least one. They don’t know that, but even if they did know that they would, we would still say maybe this one was the 20% that wasn’t touched by a slave and I can still sleep at&nbsp;night.</p><p>So we’re so disconnected from the reality, but it happens to someone, somewhere else, that I can’t influence because it’s too far, too disconnected from my reality. And just too big. We get overwhelmed and we disconnect. So the approach must be different in order to engage people. Because I think we now have the platforms where we can reach people with the right&nbsp;message.</p><p>We can do it very quickly and I think more effectively than&nbsp;before.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. It’ll certainly be a challenge. You’re dealing with complexity on the business front, the technology side of things, the social dynamics. It’s a genuine mission. And it has to be compelled by a desire to see things become better for people and just reducing suffering in the world. That has to be the north star that people&nbsp;—</p><p>Helen: It&nbsp;does.</p><p>And I think that the vast majority of people are not bad. They don’t want to do harm. And I believe that many businesses that do harm didn’t mean. The exegencies of businesses and the logistics of operation forced them down a road. Maybe, obviously they agreed to it, but maybe they didn’t set out — I don’t believe that people set out to do harm. So I do believe that there’s enough of us, both as consumers and businesses that do want to do the right thing and with the right tools in our hands and the right information in our hands, we can and now we have the capacity to be able to provide that, but I don’t pretend that it’s a quick&nbsp;fix.</p><p>This is generational attitudinal change that is required. But I do believe that we’re very close to having enough people on board as consumers and businesses, to be able to start making a&nbsp;dent.</p> Automated Morality [00:28:25] <p>Garrison: And I think showing people what’s possible is really important. Even as design artifacts. Being able to show people like here’s what this would be like in practice. It’s really difficult for people to change how they do things, how they operate in their daily lives. But one example that Vinay gives: the concept of automated morality. What if you could configure through some mobile app — you have it integrated with your payments or your payment card or whatever it is — make it to where it’s able to detect if there’s lack of transparency or even just actual documented evidence of bad labor conditions or slavery. And it tells you, it notifies you before you make the purchase.</p><p>Helen: Yeah, exactly. We have the capacity now to predict when slavery may be more likely to occur. Imagine, for example: As a few years ago happened with the conflict in Syria, mass migration into certain parts of Turkey. That was very auditable. We already knew, for example, that there was some dodgy factories close to the border in Turkey. You’ve got desperate people fleeing across the border need to earn money:&nbsp;bang.</p><p>I know that’s a very simplistic example, but still the fact remains that you can use the knowledge we have to predict when things are going to go south, when things are going to go wrong. And when things could result in human or environmental harm. And we can begin to do that so people could be warned like you say, when something actually happens or when the sort of geopolitical socioeconomic indicators start showing us red flags. But we can also automate morality by building in buttons into our Amazon whatever search is saying, do you want slave free tech? Do you want an environmental harm-free tech? And then you get your products filtered by those things as well. So there’s definitely ways of making it super easy for us as consumers to make the right choices. But obviously then what sits beneath that needs to be robust and comprehensive. It can’t be that the picked cotton was organic, but we know nothing about the 99% other parts of that&nbsp;product.</p><p>So we have to be really on point about everything that sits underneath the water of that&nbsp;iceberg.</p><p>Garrison: And that integration has a very clever side effect. If you did this and it prevented people, like people’s willingness to purchase from them because of the obscurity or whatnot at that point. It’s like, okay, well then prove it and then you’ll be one of the most, you know, a more popular&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Helen: Exactly. And I think a lot of the approaches that have been taken today to been finger pointing at company is going your bad. Like Zara, when it all came out about notes sewn into coat pockets. You’re bad. You’re a terrible company. And so companies felt backed into a corner, not wanting to be forthcoming with information that they have about their supply chains, because they’re scared of being ridiculed. And, you know, I totally understand that. Whereas if we come from the perspective of we don’t know exactly what’s going on, but we want to find out and when we do find out we want to deal with it. So we’re going to just be upfront and open. And that’s real transformation of culture that is required in order for businesses to feel confident to do that, to air their dirty&nbsp;laundry.</p><p>Garrison: There’s like a consumer literacy there like just knowing and understanding things. Everything is so complex these days. Like no one understands how the global financial system works. It’s incredibly important. It drives how resources are allocated around the planet, but not even the top top professionals in global finance could tell you how exactly does it work because there’s so much automation. There’s so many automated tooling from like high-frequency trading systems and such where like it’s all these processes that are just happening often autonomously and that’s happening further. So the thing we need to do is to automate this insistence on truth and sustainability so that these kind of darker aspects of supply chains that exist now isn’t just automated and further kind of optimized to the flow of goods, as it&nbsp;is.</p> The Flaws of Trade Globalization [00:33:05] <p>Helen: Yeah. Yeah. I think that underneath all of this is a fundamental restructure of global business actually, and ceasing of our current approach, which is let’s just go and find that from a country where we can get cheaper labor. That whole approach that is adopted pretty much universally. We have to shift that culture. We have to alter that culture, that approach because otherwise we are going to go and seek out and exploit the most vulnerable and with already existing socioeconomic pressure, you know, in whatever context those people live in. If you’ve got added to the international commercial pressure on that, it becomes unavoidable.</p><p>It’s the culture of how we do business internationally, that also needs to be considered. That’s the bigger&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Garrison: And there’s definitely a connection between resilience, economic resilience and scale of commerce. Like globalization a few decades, like rapidly scaled commerce around the world. But because of that, because it had to fracture and spread into this complicated matrix of distributors and manufacturers. It became less centralized within a certain region or like a state in the United States, for example, it became this global machine and it’s very easy for things to slip through the&nbsp;cracks.</p><p>Helen: Exactly. And that’s the problem is the complexity is just in so many cases, seemingly impossible to uncover. Global trade liberalization was marketed to us as a really great thing for countries to make friends and be closer. You know, we never were told about well, this is the flip side of that, that we’re going to go to China where we can get labor for X or India, or this country in Africa where labor’s less so we’re going to make them work really hard for not very much money so we can bring in cheap stuff. We were given the good news story about global trade deals or international trade deals and the&nbsp;like.</p><p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. So even if you’ve got one corruptible feeling dodgy state involved, that is the only opportunity that is required for you to sour and taint that whole supply chain. And with the number of countries that we go to and use for the production cycle of various consumables, every single least developed country in the world is being&nbsp;flogged.</p> On Helen’s Work with Mattereum [00:35:45] <p>Garrison: I think we’ve covered quite a bit. Is there anything in particular that you’d want to cover? Oh would you like to inform listeners what you’re working&nbsp;now?</p><p>Helen: With Mattereum?</p><p>Garrison: Yeah.</p><p>Helen: So I am working with Mattereum to develop the approach that we will take to this because what we want to do is add rails of data onto Asset Passports to complement the information that’s currently provided in it to inform people about the environmental and social provenance of particular products or particular articles. So we’re developing the standards, the approach, how we will screen claims and test claims so we’re not going to be part of the greenwashing movement, so we can certainly distinguish ourselves from that and offer something that really is different and much better than has been before. What we need the technology to do for us in order to operationalize that.</p><p>Garrison: This is definitely one of the uh, better undertakings that I think anyone can be doing now. It’s a difficult subject to talk about, but I’m optimistic about the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Helen: Good. So I think we have to be otherwise reality becomes a bit&nbsp;—</p><p>yeah. Yeah. It’s good to be optimistic. I think we have reason to be optimistic.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-4e62b79b6833">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Economic experts believe that the EURO 2020 boosted the economy of participating countries and other European countries alike in ways including the expected bookmakers – but also food delivery services, small businesses, and pubs saw a surge in order intakes during this month.</p>
<p>As an ID verification platform provider, our angle on the EURO 2020 and its economic impact laid primarily on the gaming sector and its tremendous spike in player verification throughout the tournament.</p>
<p>Especially in the UK, the EURO 2020 enjoyed high viewing figures while bets been placed were skyrocketing:</p>
 
 ITV (UK TV Channel) pulled in 27.6m viewers during England’s 2-1 extra-time win on Wednesday 11th of July, making it the most-watched football match ever shown on one channel in England. 
 There were reported 30 million pounds worth of gamblers across some of the biggest gambling operators in the UK. 
 Entain, who also owns brands such as Ladbrokes, and coral reported that this was the biggest sports event with estimates of 250 million pounds worth of bets! 
 Some operators in the industry reported having seen more players betting on the England and Italy final than any other sports event during the tournament. 
 
<p>While keeping a lookout, especially for our gaming customers in Germany and the United Kingdom, we watched closely when exactly the numbers of player verification spiked and how to respond to it adequately concerning ID verification.</p>
 Encouraging players to verify themselves even before the EURO 2020 
<p>Operators predicted that they would see up to 80% of players signing up between June 10th -Jun 17th, for example, if 50,000 customers signed up, only a few of them will hit the deposit limit, then operators would reach out to players in the first week of July to verify following background checks.</p>
<p>A lot of time before the kick-off to the tournament, many operators and businesses found themselves advertising and creating campaigns to have players verify themselves before the EURO 2020 kicked off to help increase user experience.</p>
<p>Although Euros kicked off officially on the 11th of June, we started seeing spikes in player verification from the first week of June. Driven by the events themselves, certain promotions were targeted at the beginning of Euros for a better and seamless customer experience.</p>
 Leveraging AutoIdent to enable a quick and user-friendly onboarding 
<p>The overall conversion rate for the end-users was improved by the efforts made by gambling operators by giving players both AutoIdent and VideoIdent options. This was taking into consideration background checks that take place before the ID Verification and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand. However, for many of our operators, IDnow’s automated solution Autoident was the recommended route for players to have themselves verified as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When Germany was no longer part of the tournament (29th of June), we observed the player going through the withdrawal stage sooner than expected. Now what we observe is one-off bettors’ volumes did spike during the period when the German game was on however, this volume has dropped.</p>
 Cutting down the ‘30-day grace period’ because of Germany’s new gaming regulation 
<p>There were other curveballs for gambling operators waiting as of the 01st of July, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">a new State Treaty on Gambling 2021 (Glücksspielstaatsvertrag, GlüStV) was introduced and activated in Germany</a> with the undeniable impact on the user experience.</p>
<p>Usually, gambling operators share a grace period of allowing players to go through identity verification with ID documents within 30 days of registration. However, some operators had to reduce the 30-day grace period for a short while to 3 days to help remain and regulate the new regulations that came into place.</p>
<p>What I observed in my work managing gambling clients at IDnow was the new players casually spending low amounts during the Euro’s allowed many operators to have a soft KYC check so they can allow players to enjoy remote gambling and have fun responsibly. Within mind that deeper KYC Verification needs to be done with a 3-30 days grace period. Operators were right to predict that the spikes in player verification were higher in July after the 01st of July regulations went live.</p>
 Fighting criminal activities and underage gambling with ID verification 
<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nfc-gaming-operator/">IDnow was prepped for the EURO 2020 volume</a> and the increase in player verification spiked up by 114% compared to the previous month. This was expected behavior for many operators however, what we also found was an increased attempt from organised crime groups.</p>
<p>Organised crimes groups usually use gambling platforms to launder money. There are many steps that IDnow had to think about to fight against these activities and protect our clients and operators from these groups.</p>
<p>There are some severe consequences to how far the money earned and used through gambling operators can go, such as embezzlement to trafficking. We are also observing an all-time increase in gambling addiction in underage gamblers.</p>
<p>Studies have shown and shared via several UK-issued newspapers that in the past two years, 50,000 + children are being addicted to online gambling and the nation’s Gambling Commission showed 450,000 children aged 11 to 16 gamble regularly. This is why it was very important to understand what we work with and wanted to achieve was beyond enabling great customer experience but also protect minors and comply with set regulations in these strict markets.</p>
<p>Identity verification has not always been mandatory. In the past 10 years, we have seen markets like the UK, Australia, and now in the last couple of years the USA becoming more mindful and rethinking how the remote gambling business is impacting youth and adults.</p>
<p>When IDnow was picking up a higher number of fraudulent activities across several clients during the EURO 2020 tournament, IDnow fraud agents found patterns of what could be organised crime attacking specific organisations such as Money mules (recruited by criminals to receive money into their bank).</p>
<p>In these cases, it was highly challenging to allow just machine learning and reply solely on automated solutions to see fraudulent ID’s being processed. At IDnow we have a hybrid model of process ID’s. it has helped increase the confidence of verifying players and end-users and by using humans to look over the automated decision to be closest to getting the verification methods right as possible.</p>
 Player Verifications behaviours 
<p>Some players also had been verified previously during the grand national as a one-off fun activity however, these players are not sports bettors who use the online platform to bet regularly. This is the same behaviour we expected at IDnow with players who participated in EURO 2020 will not continue to use these online platforms at the end of the tournament.</p>
<p>Even though there was a spike during the euros, and we observe a drop in verifications and back to a normal level of betting, we are currently likely to see the player verification increase in August due to the domestic leagues starting again.</p>

This year, we went from a few people in a San Francisco loft to a 30+ all-remote team spread around the world. We’ve over 10X’d the number of developers building with Magic and our community continues to grow at a fast clip each month. Now, we’re securing millions of user identities for companies of all sizes and verticals.</p><p>Trailblazing customers like <a href="https://feedback.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a>, <a href="https://decrypt.co/">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://polymarket.com/">Polymarket</a>, <a href="https://fairmint.co/">Fairmint</a>, and more integrate Magic as their core auth flow. We’ve helped our customer base expedite time-to-market, boost conversion rates, reach more audiences, level up security, and reduce cost. And we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Our vision is to build the passport of the internet in order to safeguard the trust between users and internet services.</p> The legacy&nbsp;model <p>User trust is one of the biggest challenges of the internet. Despite explosive growth in the number of people now connected to the internet — over 5.1 billion users, 67% of the planet — user trust is at an all-time low.&nbsp;Why?</p><p>The current user trust model of the internet is fundamentally broken.</p><p>A majority of the internet ecosystem has been trading user security, trust, and privacy in exchange for convenience and unsustainable profit growth. These dynamics at play resemble a teetering Jenga tower about to collapse.</p><p>We are ensnared in a cybertrust paradox: relying on both a handful of mega-corporations and relative geopolitical stability for access to vital online services — sometimes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651344/wwdc-2019-apple-force-ios-developers-sign-in-third-party">forcefully</a> so.</p><p>These corporations may:</p>  Go out of business and <a href="https://stormpath.com/">stop providing services</a>  Get hacked and cause <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-04/hackers-breached-colonial-pipeline-using-compromised-password">massive damage</a> to businesses and&nbsp;users  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/github-starts-blocking-developers-in-countries-facing-us-trade-sanctions/">Restrict critical access</a> due to geopolitical motivations  Exploit user privacy and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ex-app-store-review-chief-discusses-apple-competing-with-developers-2019-5">compete with businesses</a> built on their own platform due to misaligned incentives  Ignore compatibility with modern tech stacks like Jamstack, blockchain, and other forms of decentralized infrastructure  <p>Big tech companies become centralized custodians, amassing troves of user identity data, creating single-points-of-failure with “too big to fail” level risks. With motivations to expand and maintain growth at all costs, they acquire more companies and absorb even more user identities. Close to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/acquired-identity-management-companies">80% of all recorded acquisitions</a> happened in the last 8 years&nbsp;alone.</p><p>This problem compounds itself. One password leak makes other compromises easier, and the rate of lost or stolen passwords is only accelerating, as more companies are moving online due to the pandemic. Facebook’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4">most recent data breach</a> compromised phone numbers and personal data, making it easier for hackers to impersonate users and scam them into handing over login credentials. In this instance, over 500 million users’ data were&nbsp;leaked.</p><p>To hedge against these risks, companies are under more pressure to keep data safe and act swiftly and transparently in a cyberattack. So they turn to their developers to implement authentication in-house. This often ends up being extremely expensive, involving building large teams to continuously address a multitude of security, compliance, infrastructure, reliability, and scale challenges. Despite these resources, 66% of breaches took months or even years to discover in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>Data breaches and lost/stolen passwords are a looming challenge of our times. Traditional forms of authentication haven’t changed much in decades and passwords are already obsolete.</p><p>Now more than ever, we need digital identity infrastructure that’s secure and sustainable — that scales with modern internet ecosystems.</p> The future <p>At Magic, we believe the solution starts with developers.</p><p>Instead of deferring responsibilities to end-users to improve their own security hygiene with things like password managers, Magic makes it plug and play for developers to add secure, passwordless login, like magic links and WebAuthn, to their applications. Users are no longer exposed to password-related risks from the very&nbsp;start.</p><p>So, what makes Magic authentication unique? Instead of usernames and passwords, Magic uses public and private keys to authenticate users under the hood. A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier</a> is signed by the private key to generate a valid authentication token that can be used to verify user identity.</p><p>Traditionally, usernames are publicly recognizable identifiers that help pinpoint a user, whereas passwords are secrets that were created by the user and are supposed to be something only they&nbsp;know.</p><p>You can think of public and private keys as materially improved versions of usernames and passwords. The public key is the identifier and the private key is the secret. Instead of being created by users and prone to human error (e.g. weak/reused passwords), the key pair is generated via elliptic curve cryptography that has proven itself as the algorithm used to secure immense value sitting on mainstream blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>Using blockchain key pairs for authentication gives Magic native compatibility with blockchain, supporting over a dozen of blockchains. This enables blockchain developers to use Magic SDK to provide user-friendly onboarding experiences to mainstream users and tap into the potential of the rapidly expanding blockchain industry that is growing <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/04/27/2217572/0/en/Blockchain-Market-to-Expand-at-56-1-CAGR-and-Reach-USD-69-04-Billion-by-2027.html">56.1% year over year</a> and projected to reach $69.04 billion by&nbsp;2027.</p><p>The key pairs are also privacy-preserving (no personally identifiable information) and exportable. This allows user identity to be portable and owned by users themselves (self-sovereignty).

At <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">EIC 2021</a>, Dr. Angelika Steinacker and Dr. Barbara Mandl will hold a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4590%20title="> pre-conference workshop</a> on Monday, September 13 starting at 9:00 am.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Angelika and Barbara some questions about their planned workshop.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Which audience do you hope to attract for your joint workshop on Women in Identity?</p>
<p>
We are hoping for a very diverse audience. We are addressing everyone who is currently working or planning to work in the space of Identity and Access Management and or Security. Our Agenda is put together in such a way, that it is meant for a very diverse audience. The workshop itself is meant to be inclusive, regardless of position, gender, or nationality.  It should be interesting for everyone. For managers in Identity and Access   Management, technical specialists, sales persons and students. As it is a workshop, we would love to have people who join the entire workshop from the beginning to the end, and people who really like to participate and like lively discussions and are very open-minded.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the goals of Women in Identity?</p>
<p>
Women in Identity is a registered non-proﬁt membership organization. Everyone at every level within Women in Identity is working on a voluntary basis and our teams are located across the globe. We want to inspire, elevate, and support a more diverse workforce in the digital identity industry. I am the Women in Identity ambassador for the DACH region (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). We are now a group in DACH of more than 25 women in this network who want to make identity inclusive, exchange ideas and discuss further steps to encourage women to get involved in STEM.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What will the agenda look like?</p>
<p>
The agenda will be very interesting. We will have short presentations and a fireside chat with discussions with all attendees. The agenda will also include breakout sessions to discuss various topics in depth, for example technical IAM achievements, the future of Identity and Access Management, agile methods in IAM programs, and we will present the results of each of the breakout sessions to the entire audience.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What would you like the takeaways to be? </p>
<p>
Mainly, we would like our participants to be excited about the new ideas and the thoughts which were presented in the workshop, and which they discussed in the breakout sessions. Ideas and thoughts, nurturing a new impulse to contribute, and also  knowing how to contribute, to create inclusiveness in the Identity and Access Management and Security workplace.</p>
<p>We would like people to have a refreshed motivation and a new sense of curiosity for Identity and Access Management and Security through new ideas and thoughts, which will be discussed and presented at the workshop. </p>

<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Doc some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why does decentralized identity matter to companies today?</p>
<p>
You as an individual have sovereignty and agency when you put your shoes on in the morning, when you drive your car, when you ride your bicycle. [But] we don't have that much [agency] yet on the internet. We don't have our own bicycle. We don't have our own car. We have a different one for every website that we go to. We have no more privacy than what websites and services provide separately. We don't have any scale across all of them. We're always agreeing to terms that other parties are proffering to us and giving us very few choices about how we answer and no records of that. And that's because we're always thinking that whatever we have as an individual is up to a company. And there are so many companies that we're dealing with as individuals that we don't have scale. We don't have full agency. We have no more agency than what the company provide for us.  
</p>
<p>That's too much responsibility for companies, and it's not responsibility that they necessarily want. It's too much. Why should you have to keep records of all these preferences, all these different things. It doesn't make any sense. You should be able as an individual - because you have agency - to change your address, to change your last name, to have a shopping cart you could take from site to site for the good of the companies that you're dealing with. You know, that's something that works for people and it works for companies as well. And that's why we need agency. We haven't had it yet online. We created the online environment more or less on the old industrial model where we had to have scale. </p>
<p>Every company separately needed all the scale they could get across all the customers that they wanted, and to hold that scale exclusively, so customers had no way to move from company to company or site to site with their own tools where they could deal at scale. They have a browser, but the browser is all they got really. After that, it's up to the company to remember who was that? That's a cookie I put in your browser. The customer should have more independence than that, and that independence should pay off for the companies. And we don't have it yet. That's a big “to do”.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the business value of decentralized identity?</p>
<p>
The business value of decentralized identity, which I think of as distributed identity, by the way, is independence for the customer. It's independence for the individual. It's that everybody has the capacity to obey all of Kim Cameron's original seven laws of identity: Minimum disclosure for a constrained use, justifiable parties, plurality of operators [and technologies etc].  
</p>
<p>Those things are all really good for business, and we don't have them yet. And we don't have the tools on our side. We need wallets of our own, or something is like a wallet, that is our instrument for making verifiable claims and presenting verifiable credentials that can be verified easily and minimally disclose. There's a lot of thought and a lot of development that's going into, how do we make this work on the corporate side? I haven't seen enough on my side, on the individual side, that I just have to have that wallet. That's a great wallet. I have that. What can I put in that wallet? Have I seen his company before? What's my relationship with them? Where did I get these credentials? What are those? I shouldn't have to think about any of that.   </p>
<p>I think in the abstract, it all works, but we need to make it work in the concrete and it’s never going to work unless we have something that is an app on the front page of our phones; something that's a body function for us like our wallets are in our back pockets and our purses. And like apps are on our phones. We need those. There are some in the world now. There are some SSI wallets, but we need ones that are what I call “inventions” that mother necessity. You have to have them - take one look at it and say, I got to have that. I gotta have that. That's going to save me all kinds of trouble.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can organizations do to kickstart decentralized initiatives?</p>
<p>
I would suggest that companies go to their employees and say, don't think of yourself as an employee, think of yourselves as a customer or a user if you don't have customers, you just have consumers, they don't pay anything, but you have them. What would you want that works not only for this company, but for every company you deal with? What gives you scale? What can we do in cooperation with every other company out there, that's going to give you scale as a person, not just as an employee, but as a person? And especially think of how do we not trap customers? How do we not put them into a walled garden or into a silo? How do we liberate them so they can deal in a more efficient and useful way with all the companies they deal with? And look at what the fundamentals of SSI are, and how they would work with that.</p>
<p>But how do we put that to use in the world, for you as an individual, and get all of the input you possibly can, because I guarantee that the employees of your company know more about what they would want, as individuals operating in the world, than the company could begin to guess at.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the risks at play if organizations don't work on decentralized initiatives soon?  </p>
<p>
The main risk is getting left behind on something that will be universal, eventually. It's like 1991, and we don't have the browser yet, but the internet is already here. We are all going to be using the internet. Something like the browser is going to show up. Everybody's going to have one. Are you just going to put a brochure on the web, and say I'm going to hand it off to the marketing department? Or are you going to base the whole world – your entire company - on what the internet is going to do for you, that everybody can see through their browser? </p>
<p>
That's the future we're going to have with SSI. We're going to have self-sovereign customers. They are going to present verifiable credentials to your company and other companies. And you're going to participate in that. How do you get involved with that? We don't have the browser yet. And I don't think we do. We don't have the equivalent of the browser for SSI. We're going to have the equivalent of a browser, probably a number of things that might be like a browser, but it'll play the role of a browser in the sense that it's something. I have a better example, of maybe an email client. You know, we all had - if you were fluent in basic computerese – Mutt and Pine, and things that worked in the command line. And then later say Eudora, that you could use as an email client. This is long before Google sort of normalized it with Gmail, but you could still take your mail off Gmail and put it on your own server.   </p>
<p>
And people are going to have their own instruments for expressing their self-sovereign identities and really identifiers. Again, I have verifiable credentials that I'm going to present. I go to the concert and all you need to know is I have a ticket. I just flash something on my phone. You've got a ticket, you get in. We have some of that right now with QR codes. I went to a game the other day and showed a QR code, got in no problem. That starts to get there. That’s a form of SSI, but that's one company's way of presenting. That’s one B2B solution that happens to work in a B2C way.  </p>
<p>
We need the C2B solutions. Browsers are C2B. They're not B2C. We don't have a different browser for every company we deal with. We have one browser we deal with, with every company, one email account we deal with, with every company. We have one SMS client that we use to deal with every company. We have one phone number that we give when a phone number is required as an identifier. Those are examples of scale. We should have many, many other kinds of scale, but you can't begin to see that if you're only looking at it at an individualized B2C way. You're going to have to imagine a future where every one of us has, self-sovereign ways to present verifiable credentials that work across the whole world in a normalized way. And where does your company play in that? And I think right now, the way to play in it, is jump in with a whole lot of other companies that are doing are doing base level work on common protocols, the standards, and ways to make this new industry scaffold itself up. Get together with other companies on that base level stuff. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The title of your keynote is 'Where stands the Sovereign Self?' What do you hope to achieve with your keynote at EIC 2021? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to achieve, as I've tried to do I think with every keynote I've given there going back to the beginning, full respect for what can only be solved from the individual side. There are so many business problems that can only be solved from the customer side. And, I think with SSI especially, we finally have a lot of activity around that. But I'm still not seeing enough that starts with the individual, that says how do we get this person’s scale? How do we make this work across entire markets and across the entire world? How can we start equipping them - individuals – with ways to manage their lives? [We] have barely thought that out. Google and Apple provide calendars and contacts. And so does Microsoft, but they're not exactly compatible. They're very siloed.  </p>
<p>That's our personal data. We're always talking about personal data [and things like] harvesting personal data. The personal data that matters are: my health, my finances, what I own, my contacts, my calendar - nobody has solved these yet. And [there are] standards laying around in a world. Phil Windley is here [at EIC]. He'll tell you about picos and other things. I suggest you talk to him. If I was 25 years old right now, I would start with picos. I would start with things that people own. How do we make owning things a lot easier? How do we make communicating with companies easier about what we own outside of companies’ separate siloes? That plays into SSI. That plays into I go to the store and I say, yeah, I'm a member of this. I already have this. I already bought this one. You know, I go, did I buy this? Did I buy this keyboard?  I have a box over there that has three Apple keyboards. I didn't even know I had these. If I had known, my life would [have been] simpler. I wouldn't have bought another one the other day. But I don't know those things because I don't have record of that. When I get the receipt, I should put it through something that remembers it. Nobody's thinking about these things, or if they are, they're not gaining any scale. Give people scale around controlling their lives. We have the internet now. We have digital technology now. We're all digital beings. Give us ways that we can manage our lives. Fire marketing, get them out of the room, because they're only thinking still like: how do we find out all about what the customer wants? For one company, a piece. Get rid of that. Just think about what the customer needs. You're a customer. Everybody here is a customer. Think about what you could use in your life that you don't have right now, that gives you scale across every company you deal with in ways that are useful to those companies, where going to appreciate getting just a verifiable credential that says: I bought this before. I belong to this. I have a warranty. Lots of things like that, but in a standard way across all the companies you're dealing with. That is the frontier. </p>

<p>The company will be acquired by InfoCert and will join the Digital Trust Division. The consideration for 60% of the capital is equal to Euro 43.8 million.</p>



<p>Rome, 21 July 2021. Tinexta S.p.A., leading company in Digital Trust, Cybersecurity, Credit Information &amp; Management and Innovation &amp; Marketing services, through its subsidiary InfoCert S.p.A., has finalised today a Binding Offer, in the form of a Put Option Agreement, to the French company Oodrive S.A.S. for the acquisition of 60% of CertEurope S.A.S.’ capital. Oodrive is backed by Tikehau Capital, the global alternative asset management group since 2017.</p>



<p>CertEurope, headquartered in Paris, is one of the three largest Certification Authorities in France with a well-known brand and a market share of around 40% in the eIDAS certificate sector. The company has the authorisations and accreditations to issue all types of certificates required by the French market, in compliance with the technical requirements established by the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI).</p>



<p>Through the acquisition, Tinexta will enter the French market, the second largest in the European Community, and InfoCert, the largest Certification Authority in Europe, will be enabled to sell its solutions on the territory. CertEurope’s well-established business relationships with some important trade associations (lawyers among the others) and with the major national retailers (resellers of digital services) represent a potential accelerator for the penetration of InfoCert’s solutions into the French market.</p>



<p>The agreement provides for the purchase of 60% of CertEurope’s capital for a total consideration of Euro 43.8 million (which includes an earn-out of Euro 3.8 million depending on the 2021 and 2022 result performances), assuming zero net financial debt at closing.</p>



<p>The option right inherent in the minority interests in the company’s capital may be exercised in 2023, on the basis of specific Put/Call1 agreements. The discounted value of the Put/Call option of the minority interest is estimated at approximately Euro 28.4 million.</p>



<p>The investment for 100% of the capital is estimated at Euro 72.2 million, composed as follows:</p>



€ millionInitial Cash-Out40.0Earn-out Debt*3.8Put Options Debt*28.4Total Investment72.2<br>*Discounted value, non-interest bearing.



<p>The acquisition of CertEurope will be financed with the existing liquid assets. The Enterprise Value of the company is equal to Euro 66.7 million, at a multiple of between 12x and 13x the 2020 EBITDA proforma for the acquisition of the majority stake and at a multiple of between 12x and 13x the expected 2022 EBITDA for the exercise of the option right on the remaining shares in 2023.</p>



<p>In the 2020 fiscal year, CertEurope recorded Revenues of Euro 14.1 million, up 6.9% compared to the previous year, a proforma2 EBITDA of Euro 5.2 million, with an operating EBITDA Margin equal to 37% on the revenues.</p>



<p>In accordance with the French legal system, the conclusion of a final agreement would occur after the seller has conducted the information-consultation process of the works council. Closing is expected by the fourth quarter of 2021. This operation is subject to the completion of the foreign investment control procedure in France.</p>



<p>The total value of the Digital Trust market in France is estimated3 at approximately Euro 150 million, with a growth forecast equal to 23% per year over the next few years, reaching Euro 500 million in 2025. The competitive environment is made up of a few major brands (including CertEurope, with around 10% market share, the third largest player) and a large number of smaller competitors.</p>



<p>Enrico Salza, Chairman of Tinexta S.p.A., said: “The Group continues growing, taking a further step towards international development and progressively consolidating its position abroad, confirming its vocation as a European player in digital identity”.</p>



<p>Pier Andrea Chevallard, CEO of Tinexta S.p.A., commented: “Through CertEurope, Tinexta group will be able to operate in France, a large market with great potential, also in regulated activities, and will have a high standing local platform and a brand of undoubted recognition to boost the international expansion.</p>



<p>We embarked on this process with determination because we are confident that this is a highly strategic operation, which can be a steppingstone to expand our presence in Europe. The high degree of complementarity with InfoCert’s expertise and services will enable us to achieve much value from this operation”.</p>



<p>“This agreement opens up significant opportunities – added Danilo Cattaneo, CEO of InfoCert – in CertEurope we found a group of skilled and motivated people that is already working with us in tailoring top selling InfoCert solutions for the specific needs of French companies and professionals, that will have available all the solutions of the Group with a local expert presence.</p>



<p>We shared the vision as a group to further invest resources in R&amp;D to provide expertise and valuable solutions for the digital transformation that will be a leading trend in Europe for the years to come.</p>

<p>La società verrà acquisita da InfoCert ed entrerà nella Divisione Digital Trust. Il corrispettivo per il 60% del capitale è pari a Euro 43,8 milioni.</p>



<p>Roma, 21 luglio 2021. Tinexta S.p.A., società leader nei servizi Digital Trust, Cybersecurity, Credit Information &amp; Management e Innovation &amp; Marketing, attraverso la sua controllata InfoCert S.p.A., ha finalizzato oggi una Binding Offer, sotto forma di Put Option Agreement, alla società francese Oodrive S.A.S per l’acquisizione del 60% del capitale di CertEurope S.A.S.. Oodrive è detenuta dal 2017 da Tikehau Capital, gruppo globale di gestione patrimoniale alternativa.</p>



<p>CertEurope, con sede a Parigi, è una delle tre più grandi Certification Authority in Francia con un brand molto conosciuto, una market share pari a circa il 40% nel comparto dei certificati eIDAS. La società possiede le autorizzazioni e gli accreditamenti per l’emissione di tutte le tipologie di certificati richiesti dal mercato francese in conformità ai requisiti tecnici stabiliti dall’Agenzia nazionale per la sicurezza dei sistemi informatici (ANSSI).</p>



<p>Attraverso l’acquisizione, Tinexta entrerà nel mercato francese, il secondo per dimensione nella Comunità Europea e InfoCert, la più grande Certification Authority in Europa, sarà abilitata alla vendita delle proprie soluzioni sul territorio. I consolidati rapporti commerciali che CertEurope intrattiene con alcune importanti associazioni di categoria (tra le altre, avvocati) e con i grandi rivenditori nazionali (reseller di servizi digitali) rappresentano un potenziale rilevante acceleratore per la penetrazione nel mercato francese delle soluzioni di InfoCert.</p>



<p>L’accordo prevede l’acquisto del 60% del capitale di CertEurope a fronte di un corrispettivo complessivo pari a Euro 43,8 milioni (che include un Earn-out pari a Euro 3,8 milioni in funzione delle performance di risultato 2021 e 2022), ipotizzando un indebitamento finanziario netto pari a zero al closing.</p>



<p>Il diritto di opzione inerente alle quote di minoranza del capitale della società potrà essere esercitato nel 2023, sulla base di specifici accordi di Put/Call1. Il valore attualizzato dell’opzione Put/Call della quota di minoranza è stimato in circa Euro 28,4 milioni.</p>



<p>L’investimento per il 100% del capitale è stimato pari a Euro 72,2 milioni, così composto:</p>



€mCash-Out iniziale40,0Debito per Earn-out*3,8Debito Put Options*28,4Investimento totale72,2*Valore attualizzato, infruttifero.



<p>L’acquisizione di CertEurope sarà finanziata con la liquidità esistente. L’Enterprise Value della società è pari 66,7 milioni di euro, ad un multiplo compreso tra 12x e 13x l’EBITDA 2020 proforma per l’acquisizione della quota di maggioranza e un multiplo compreso tra 12x e 13x l’EBITDA 2022 atteso per l’esercizio del diritto di opzione sulle restanti quote nel 2023.</p>



<p>Nell’esercizio 2020, CertEurope ha registrato Ricavi per Euro 14,1 milioni, in crescita del 6,9% rispetto all’anno precedente, e un Ebitda proforma2 di Euro 5,2 milioni, con un Ebitda Margin pari al 37%.</p>



<p>In conformità con l’ordinamento giuridico francese, la formalizzazione dell’accordo definitivo avverrà dopo che la parte venditrice avrà condotto il processo di informazione-consultazione del comitato aziendale. Il closing è previsto entro il quarto trimestre del 2021. L’operazione è soggetta al completamento della procedura di controllo degli investimenti esteri in Francia.</p>



<p>In conformità con il regime legale francese, il signing è previsto nel mese di settembre, al termine del processo di Hamon Law che coinvolge le Risorse Umane della società acquisita e che viene avviato oggi. Il closing è previsto entro il quarto trimestre 2021. L’operazione è sottoposta al completamento delle procedure di Antitrust e Golden Rule in Francia.</p>



<p>Il valore totale del mercato del Digital Trust in Francia è stimato3 in circa 150 milioni di euro, con previsioni di crescita pari al 23% all’anno nei prossimi anni, fino a raggiungere i 500 milioni di euro nel 2025. Il contesto competitivo è composto da alcuni brand rilevanti (tra cui CertEurope, con circa il 10% della quota di mercato, terzo player) e da un elevato numero di competitor di piccole dimensioni.</p>



<p>“Il Gruppo – ha dichiarato il Presidente di Tinexta S.p.A., Enrico Salza – continua a crescere compiendo un ulteriore passo di sviluppo internazionale e consolidando progressivamente la propria posizione anche all’estero, confermando la vocazione di player europeo per l’identità digitale”.</p>



<p>“Attraverso CertEurope – commenta Pier Andrea Chevallard, Amministratore Delegato di Tinexta</p>



<p>S.p.A. – il gruppo Tinexta potrà operare in Francia, un mercato vasto e dalle grandi potenzialità, anche nelle attività regolamentate, e disporrà di una piattaforma locale di elevato standing e di un brand di indubbia riconoscibilità per accelerare l’espansione internazionale.</p>



<p>Abbiamo avviato il percorso con determinazione poiché siamo convinti che si tratti di un’operazione di elevato contenuto strategico, in grado di rappresentare un trampolino di lancio per l’ampliamento della nostra presenza in Europa. L’elevata complementarità con le competenze e i servizi di InfoCert ci consentirà di estrarre molto valore da questa operazione”.</p>



<p>“L’accordo annunciato oggi apre opportunità significative – aggiunge Danilo Cattaneo CEO di InfoCert – in CertEurope abbiamo trovato un gruppo di persone competenti e motivate che già sta lavorando fianco a fianco con noi per fornire ad aziende e professionisti francesi le soluzioni InfoCert integrate con i prodotti CertEurope e adattate alle specifiche esigenze e normative locali.</p>



<p>Abbiamo condiviso la visione come gruppo di investire ulteriormente in ricerca e sviluppo per essere in grado di fornire tutta la competenza e le soluzioni necessarie alla trasformazione digitale che sarà realizzata in Europa nei prossimi anni”.</p>



<p>Tinexta è stata assistita nell’operazione di acquisizione di CertEurope da Roland Berger per il supporto alla predisposizione del piano industriale, da PWC per le attività di due diligence finanziaria e fiscale e da DLA per la due diligence legale ed il supporto alla negoziazione dei testi contrattuali.</p>



 



  Tale diritto di opzione, anche se classificato come indebitamento secondo gli IFRS/IAS, non comporta nessun onere finanziario prima del suo esercizio, che potrà verificarsi solo nel 2023.  Il perimetro dell’operazione fa riferimento alla legal entity CertEurope S.A.S. successivamente ad un processo di carve out e carve in che verrà completato prima del closing. In particolare, con il carve out verranno trasferiti alcuni asset e 13 Risorse Umane, mentre a seguito del carve in entreranno in CertEurope 24 Risorse Umane.

The AERGO blockchain is mainly used as a platform to create value/assets for customer uploaded videos and to improve trust in transactions. Today, I would like to explain to you how BananaClips uses AERGO and why it makes AERGO and BananaClips more valuable systems and services.</p> Uploading Videos on BananaClips <p>BananaClips is also a platform where anyone could upload their created and valuable videos in public. When users upload a video to BananaClips, the following process is performed internally.</p>  Saving the original video file to a secure archiving location  Automatic video&nbsp;analysis  Extracting copyright information  Extracting search information  Detecting unsafe&nbsp;contents  Monetizing contents  <p>During this process, the blockchain is utilized in steps 2, 3, and&nbsp;6.</p> Video Analysis and Extracting Copyright Information <p>When a video file is analyzed, various pieces of information called metadata are extracted such as the size of the video screen (i.e. resolution), geographic location information, whether the video is horizontal or vertical, and so on. It is very important to keep this information safe as it can be easily edited or deleted. It can be said that this is the first step to secure copyright.</p><p>BananaClips keeps this extracted metadata on the AERGO blockchain network to prevent modification or deletion of customers’ video contents. In addition, by providing metadata for free through the AERGO network, we are step by step in preparation for standardization for copyright protection and revitalization of the community.</p> Digital Watermark <p>Even simply extracting metadata and storing it on the blockchain network would be useless if it could not be utilized. For this reason, Banana Clips uses its own digital watermark technology to store invisible encrypted information, i.e. steganography, in the video content itself. This steganography data becomes a compass from which you can check the metadata extracted from above and stored securely on the AERGO network. In other words, no matter how the video content is altered or misused, if users/systems can check the metadata and related licenses, users/systems can further protect the copyright.</p> Smart Contract <p>The extracted metadata would be added through a smart contract deployed on the AERGO network created by BananaClips, and anyone could view and check the metadata via the AERGO network. However, if anonymous users/systems want to add or modify metadata, it can cause confusion due to incorrect data and misguided behaviors. Therefore, only BananaClips can save and edit the metadata in the smart contract for the present. In the future, we plan to establish a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) so that various members and partners can participate in this smart contract, and we will develop to standardize it.</p> Monetizing contents <p>BananaClips issues NFT with new value on the AERGO network for an uploaded video content that has been prepared through the above processes. However, in order to improve the user experience, new tokens would be issued and provided to users in a different way from other NFT services.</p><p>It is not an easy task for customers who want to upload and monetize contents to understand and prepare their personal wallets and coins for issuing. If you, who are reading this article, think about when you tried to understand about a blockchain and coins at first, I assure you will fully understand that this process is not easy. Making this process simple and easy is also one of the biggest challenges and differentiation factors BananaClips has prepared for&nbsp;you.</p><p>Fewer steps and simplifications do not compromise security at all. Rather, a roll called “confirmer”, which is not present in the existing ARC2, is added to prevent incorrect transactions that may occur by attacking a smart contract by any change. This role and step to guarantee by our system has been included to achieve a higher level of security.</p><p>Additionally, BananaClips users can withdraw their NFT assets at any time through AERGO or Ethereum (we plan to support more blockchain networks) and can obtain video contents again at any time after withdrawal via our service. Since our marketplace can be used again through re-deposit their NFT assets, it will provide usability at a more advanced level than other services in terms of scalability to support various platforms.</p><p>The NFT smart contract was developed according to the ARC2 standard. Here, the additional APIs provided after research and development by our engineering team will not lack in providing a higher level of service to BananaClips customers. Soon, the AERGO community will be able to meet the advanced NFT open marketplace.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bananaclips-on-aergo-e06d3a537a9c">BananaClips on AERGO</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 A Tale of Two Approaches to Decentralized Data Integrity <p>Holochain is quite different from blockchain, but because they are designed to solve some of the same problems – and because people try to understand Holochain in terms of blockchain all the time – we figured it would be a good idea to frame at least one key aspect of Holochain in comparison to blockchain.</p><p>A complete primer on Holochain and blockchain would need a good deal of detail about what blockchain really is and how it works, and we’d probably be addressing a lot of common technical misconceptions about blockchain in the process. This is not that article.</p><p>Instead, this piece focuses on the approach each technology takes to solving an important challenge, which is really the fundamental challenge of decentralized computing: how to ensure that data is accurate and tamper-proof in a way that is efficient enough to scale.</p><p>We’ll look at blockchain’s approach, then Holochain’s.</p> Blockchain and Global Consensus <p>Blockchain is a cryptographically secured, decentralized ledger of data. You can think of a blockchain as a record of events: the things people said, who agreed to what, who sent money to whom, and so on. Up until blockchain was invented, these sorts of records were pretty much always stored in centralized databases, such as those held by government entities or private companies. Blockchain was created as a way for people to interact and transact without needing to trust such intermediaries.</p><p>What makes blockchain secure and trustable – in other words, what ensures its data integrity – is that the data is not just cryptographically protected but also replicated to many different computers (called nodes) controlled by different people or organizations. Only when a piece of data is adopted by the multitude of nodes is it considered factual, at which point it’s committed to the record. For someone to alter the record, they would have to not only break cryptographic barriers but also change most of the copies that are floating out there – a pretty much impossible task.</p><p>The way that nodes reach ‘consensus’ on what data to commit to the record varies from blockchain to blockchain, but it typically involves some type of competition among the nodes to write the next chunk of entries, or ‘block’, to the chain. Ultimately the selection of the winning node is random, so it’s not exactly consensus in the way that people mean the term in the real world. But the important takeaway is that, one way or another, the blockchain nodes come to terms on a global state of data, where all nodes hold a replica of all the same data.</p><p>And so here we come to the scalability problem: it requires tremendous computing work for all the nodes to write and hold the same data. This makes blockchains notoriously slow processors: the Bitcoin network processes just a few transactions per second, while the Ethereum network currently processes dozens. Users are accustomed to waiting minutes, sometimes up to an hour, for a single transaction to be confirmed.</p><p>The problem gets worse as you try to make blockchain do more things, which has been its aspiration, more or less, since Ethereum positioned itself as a decentralized world computer when it launched in 2014. That’s the point at which blockchains began to be able to store not just transaction records but all kinds of files and even executable application code that performs functions when accessed, resulting in new data that also gets written to the blockchain. It’s been an attractive idea to imagine that much of what we do on the web today could be hosted on blockchain networks as decentralized applications (dApps). In reality, though, apps like social networks, communication platforms, travel-booking systems, ride-sharing systems, calendar systems, and so on need much faster throughput, by many orders of magnitude, than blockchain can provide. Can you imagine waiting several minutes (and paying a gas fee!) to get a message through on a chat platform? Or for an edit to show up on a collaborative editing tool like Google Docs? Can you imagine how much computation and storage would be required to accommodate on a blockchain all of the photos and videos on social media, with all nodes needing to write all of that data and keep it forever? It doesn’t work. Facebook receives <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/facebook-statistics/">over 4 million likes every minute</a> and currently stores <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/facebook-statistics/">over 250 billion photos</a>.</p><p>Efficiency is such a challenge in blockchain that there are entire companies, including some of the most talked-about crypto projects today, dedicated to figuring out how to make blockchain scale better. Some of them focus on ‘layer-1’ solutions, which attempt to increase the throughput of blockchain protocols themselves, while others are ‘layer-2’, which perform computations or store data off-chain and then periodically merge records into the blockchain. Most of these solutions, though, seem to be setting their sights on low-throughput applications such as financial transacting as opposed to live collaboration apps, social networks, media platforms, and so on. And the few that do seem capable of handling a broader set of applications make compromises on decentralization, concentrating hosting and consensus mechanisms among centrally authorized nodes.</p><p>Still, the accomplishment of blockchain is not to be taken lightly. It’s more resilient to corruption than any ledgering or value-storage system than has ever existed before, and it is changing global finance as a result, with lots of room for growth still. But what’s probably even more important is the awareness it has sparked of what’s possible. Its aspirations have infected broad communities of people with a sense that we could communicate and transact without centralized intermediaries. Blockchain’s scalability challenges may ultimately limit its utility, but it has already revolutionized how humans think about interacting.</p> Holochain and Embodied Local States <p>The architects of Holochain began with a basic question: what if everyone could actually just hold their own data and share it with the network as needed? If everyone could just host themselves rather than relying on mining nodes to do it? We could avoid all this massive replication, which would obviously be much more efficient. We would just need to do it in a way that still ensures data integrity. We would have to be completely confident that, as everyone represents their own data to the network, there is no way for people to misrepresent their data.</p><p>That is fundamentally what Holochain does. Holochain is a framework for ensuring data integrity within a decentralized application without relying on anyone other than the users themselves. </p> A Natural Solution <p>At this point in the conversation, people familiar with blockchain are often skeptical. What’s to prevent people from lying about their state? From, say, spending the same money in two different places? (Holochain supports applications far more diverse than just currencies, but it’s often useful to use currencies as an illustration.)</p><p>We’ll get to some of the mechanics that make this possible in a moment. First, let’s look at the principles behind the mechanics, by way of analogy to nature… starting with some of its smallest objects.</p><p>Consider the covalent bonding of a chlorine atom and a hydrogen atom to create a molecule of hydrogen chloride. This requires the hydrogen atom to have a free electron available, i.e. not shared with any other atom. How does the chlorine atom ‘know’ whether the hydrogen atom has an electron available? It’s simply apparent. The hydrogen atom embodies whether a free electron exists in its state. It’s not able to misrepresent whether there’s a free electron, and it’s not able to ‘double-spend’ its electron, because the availability of an electron is evident to other relevant atoms upon inspection. There is global visibility, on demand, of local state.</p><p>It would be ridiculous to believe that, in order to know whether an atom has a free electron, there should be a global, synchronized ledger of the whereabouts of all electrons in the universe. Or – to use a natural example with somewhat larger objects – that the status of the trillions of cells in our bodies should be registered on a global body tracking system. The cells already embody the changes: the levels of oxygen in the blood cells, for example, determine whether they offer oxygen to organ tissue cells in exchange for carbon dioxide. Then the reverse happens once the blood cells reach the lungs, where they exchange carbon dioxide for fresh oxygen. These interactions are determined on a cell-to-cell basis, without reference to any body-wide ledger of blood cell oxygen levels.</p><p>Holochain’s premise is that it’s equally unnecessary for all nodes in a decentralized application to hold a record of everyone’s state, as happens in blockchain, or for nodes to reach consensus before a user commits a state change to their own record. The local embodiment of state can act as its own authority, as long as the structure of data is tamper-proof. Also, only information necessary for larger-scale coordination needs to be widely shared, with all shared data strongly tied to where it came from. In this way, Holochain is an agent-centric system for decentralized computing: the users (agents) themselves are the definitive source of information in the system.</p><p>Okay, with those principles established, let’s look briefly at some of the architecture that makes Holochain’s data structure tamper-proof and scalable. After a cartoon break, that is.</p> Holochain’s Core Components <p>Source Chain. Each user hosts their own data on a source chain, which is a cryptographically signed record of everything you’ve ever done or said within Holochain applications, stored locally on your machine. Source chains, like blockchains, are hash chains, which associate a cryptographic fingerprint (or ‘hash’) with every record (or ‘entry’). Hashes are unique to the particular data they represent: changing just one comma to a period in a thousand-page book would result in a completely different hash.</p><p>DHT. Data that needs to be shared with the network is published to a shared environment called a distributed hash table, or DHT. Your tweets and comments in a Twitter-like app, your ride requests in an Uber-like app, your edits in a collaborative document editor… all of these are on the DHT. (Data that doesn’t need to be shared can remain private to your source chain.) Each user running a Holochain app stores a tiny slice of the app’s DHT, in addition to hosting their own data.</p><p>DNA. Each application’s rules for sharing data are written into the application code itself, known as DNA. The DNA is what says that this is an application for tweeting (which involves sharing data with a certain structure) versus calling rides or co-editing documents (which involve sharing different data with different structures). It also defines who can join the app’s network: can anyone join, do you need an invitation code or to pay, or is there some other criteria? A copy of the DNA is hosted by every application user, which means that any user is able to validate whether data being shared to their slice of the DHT conforms to the application’s rules.</p> But What Makes It Tamper-Proof? <p>Okay, cool structure maybe, but why can’t someone simply alter their source chain and misrepresent their data to others? </p><p>You can think of a source chain like a diary: each page contains a header, which identifies the fact that something happened and when it happened, and an entry, which contains the content of what happened (such as “I sent 100 units of currency to so-and-so”). Some of these entries might have been published to the DHT and others might not have, but in all cases the headers, which contain the hashes of the entries, are shared to the DHT. In other words, I may or may not have published the contents of a given diary page, but everyone is able to see that I wrote something on the page, and they are able to see the unique fingerprint that corresponds the contents of the page (which would completely change if I were to ever modify the contents even slightly).</p><p>Let’s say you and I are doing some transaction such that I need to send you 250 units. The app’s rules (encoded in the DNA) will say that in order for this transaction to go through, you need to verify my account balance, which means that I need to show you enough information from my diary in order for you to do so. (Remember, there is global visibility of local state, to whatever degree is necessary for a given action to be validated.) Your computer can very quickly add up all the pluses and minuses on the pages in my transaction diary, my source chain. You know that I’m not hiding any pages because you can check the DHT and see exactly how many pages have writing on them. And there’s no way I could have altered a previous page without making it obvious I’ve done so, because every action I take is a new timestamped event with a new header and new unique hash that also gets shared to the DHT. Plus a system of header monitoring by ‘neighbors’ ensures that I’m unable to fork or roll back my source chain without getting flagged. If anything doesn’t add up, or if it seems like something has been obscured, the transaction simply fails the validation rules and does not take place.</p> But What Makes It Scalable? <p>Most of blockchain’s challenges with scalability are really challenges of managing global consensus. Since Holochain maintains data integrity without the need for consensus, it doesn’t run into the same limitations.</p><p>There is no need for universal agreement. Keeping with our currency example for a moment: how many computers need to confirm our transaction in order for it to be executed? If this were blockchain, all nodes would need to come to terms with one another and keep a record of our transaction forever. In Holochain, the transaction is complete when just two computers have written it: yours and mine. Then, afterward, we publish the data to the DHT, and randomized groups of nodes store it so that others can confirm for themselves, later as the need arises, that we’re representing our states accurately. Data validation is party-to-party, just like for all the cells in our body, just like for all the atoms in the universe. This feature alone eliminates all of the computing required to reach global consensus.</p><p>There is no need for universal state. It’s true that many types of data do need to be published to the network – tweets and comments, ride requests, document edits, and so on, to keep with our earlier examples. It’s also true that an app sometimes needs system-wide tracking to monitor aspects of overall activity, just as the body has ways of monitoring and responding to changes in blood oxygen levels overall; this is another reason that the DHT often needs to store some amount of shared data. Unlike on a blockchain, though, each piece of data on the DHT is replicated only enough times to make sure the needed data is always available, including when the author might be offline. We’re talking about maybe dozens of replications in Holochain rather than potentially thousands or more in blockchain. And this limited replication is strategically distributed across all the users participating in the app, which means that each user performs just a little bit of extra work to hold a very small portion of the DHT.</p><p>Each DHT contains data for only one application. A blockchain contains all the data from all the applications running on that chain: every Ethereum node, for example, contains all the historical data for all the dApps running on Ethereum. In Holochain, each app has its own shared storage space in the form of its DHT. As Holochain architect Arthur Brock <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/limits-to-blockchain-scalability-vs-holochain-19685dcb89f9">put it recently</a>, “If I just want to run a Twitter-like app, why should I also have to run your crypto exchange, gambling app or collectible cartoon animals? On Holochain, users only run the apps they actually use.”</p><p>Each new user to an application adds storage and computing capacity. In blockchain applications, where miners and stakers write and store data, the network capacity is constant no matter how many nodes are added, so increased user activity increases the strain on computing resources. Holochain applications are entirely hosted by the users themselves, so as the demand for the app grows, so does the computing power to run it.</p> A Truly Peer-to-Peer Network <p>Let’s use one more example, a social networking application similar to Facebook or Instagram, to summarize the different approaches to data integrity taken by Holochain and blockchain. Let’s also add in the approach that today’s centralized social networks take, as a point of additional comparison. In this social network, you do all the things you’re accustomed to: posting text and images and videos, commenting on other people’s posts, and chatting privately with friends.</p>  In the centralized scenarios common today, all of the data – including your photos and comments and messages – are held by the company who owns the platform. The social network is supposedly secure and scalable by virtue of its being centralized: the company takes responsibility for maintaining the network, and they are paid to do so in one or more ways. As we have seen, though, our data is often not as secure as these companies might like us to believe: data breaches are extremely common (since data stored in one centralized place makes a honeypot for hackers), plus our data is routinely sold to advertisers or leaked to other third parties (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> was but one extreme example).   A blockchain version of a social network would theoretically be hosted by the miners or stakers running the blockchain nodes. Integrity would be ensured by virtue of your data being written to the blockchain only after a consensus of nodes determines the data to be legitimate, then being replicated across all nodes and stored by them forever. But the data load would be extremely high in this scenario, creating a major scalability problem. Many blockchains and blockchain apps try to solve this problem by reducing the number of nodes that need to reach consensus, or by doing much of the computing or hosting work off-chain on centrally authorized servers. These approaches all compromise on decentralization and point us back, in one way or another, toward scenario #1.<br><br>(In point of fact, even a truly on-chain social network would be only nominally decentralized, since the miners and stakers, who need to be paid to do their job just like a centralized company does, effectively become a new kind of intermediary. But this is the subject of <a href="https://medium.com/holochain/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-4ac6045ac894">another article</a>.)<br>  In a Holochain version, the entire network – all of the data and even the application code – is hosted by the users themselves. It’s truly peer-to-peer. Data integrity is ensured through global visibility of local state, established on an as-needed basis. You share your photos, comments, and messages to the network through a shared table called a distributed hash table (DHT), but you remain the primary authority on everything you’ve published. The network is scalable by the fact that no global consensus is necessary, by the fact that the DHT involves only as much data and replication as necessary, and by the fact that every user shares a small piece of the load. The more users join the network, the more capacity it has for scale. And there are no intermediaries at all – no one who needs to be paid or trusted to write and store your data on your behalf.  <p>If a peer-to-peer approach is that much better, why hasn’t everyone been doing it this way all along? One factor is probably the technical complexity involved, but another is probably that it’s difficult for people to imagine that everyone could host their own data and not be able to misrepresent themselves. Even though Holochain has been around in some form for several years, its approach to data integrity is enough of a departure from blockchain’s that developers and users are only just beginning to understand its potential, similar to how it took several years for Ethereum’s capabilities to be widely understood.</p><p>That does seem to be changing, however, especially since Holochain’s <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/?%20https://blog.holochain.org/announcing-and-unpacking-the-new-holochain/">refactored state model went live</a> and is proving to be many times more performant than previous versions – and also since so many new applications are preparing to launch on Holochain. And we can expect greater and greater awareness of Holochain as more applications go live in the coming months.</p><p>At a time when blockchain still has so much potential for growth, it may seem odd to be already talking about a post-blockchain application space. But given the scalability challenges blockchain faces and Holochain’s readiness to leapfrog these issues, it might be time to begin thinking outside the blocks.</p> <p>One way to stay tuned about Holochain and Holo is to <a href="https://holo.host/newsletter-signup">sign up for the occasional newsletter</a>.</p>

<p>Full Transcript: Beyond Bitcoin – DeFi with Algorand, Algomint, and MeldVentures</p>



<p>Leyla: Hello everyone and welcome to Beyond Bitcoin, a new monthly series where we break down the latest trends in cutting edge technology, blockchain, and beyond- And why it matters to you!</p>



<p>My name is Leyla and I’m co-hosting on behalf of BSN Global. And joining me is ShareRing’s Communications Manager Timothy Kingery.</p>



<p>Timothy: Thank you Leyla!&nbsp;</p>



<p>and with us today for our series premiere we’d like to welcome our industry experts:<br><br>Summer Miao, Head of Community&nbsp;Asia Pacific for Algorand Foundation<br><br>and Michael Cotton,&nbsp;Founder of MeldGold&nbsp;and Co-Founder of MeldVentures and Algomint,&nbsp;here to share their insights and answers to the real questions that matter about DeFi, thank you both for taking time out of your busy schedules to join us!</p>



<p><br>Summer: Thank you<br><br>Michael: Thanks for having us</p>



<p><br>Timothy: Starting off, can you tell us a little about yourselves and how you came to work for one of the top blockchain companies in the world?<br></p>



<p>Michael: Thanks Timo,&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;I started the Gold industry straight out of highschool, so with the money I’d saved up working through highschool I started building my own gold business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That business went on to be one of the largest gold companies here in Australia,&nbsp; so now currently employs 60 staff and is spread across the country including one the highest-rated security vaults for precious metals in Australia.</p>



<p>And then around 5 years ago I started looking at blockchain tech and really loved the concept and loved the idea. For me I saw the true innovation and I saw the future and what really held, and then we started building out this concept of bringing gold to blockchain and really creating a gold currency once more.<br><br>Since then we’ve gone on to partner with companies such as MKS PAMP, the largest gold trader in the world, based in Switzerland, Heraeus out of Asia, and Perth Mint here in Australia.</p>



<p>And then I head up MeldVentures- an Australian-based technology investment company. And MeldGold is really moving it’s way through to become the digital gold standard for gold across the world.</p>



<p>Leyla: Wow, that is incredibly impressive, Michael</p>



<p>Your passion for gold and innovation have clearly paid off, so thank you so much for sharing your experience with us today.<br><br>Michael: Thank you<br></p>



<p>Leyla: Summer, how about you? What brought you here?</p>



<p>Summer:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Okay so actually, it’s an interesting story with a series of happy coincidences-</p>



<p>So I joined the blockchain space in early 2018 – back then I was still working in the traditional education industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there happened to be a blockchain startup looking for a senior marketing fellow. That’s the first time I heard about the word “blockchain” and I did some research out of pure curiosity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You see, 2018 was the year when Bitcoin turned 10, however, many were still skeptical towards Bitcoin and the technology behind it. And after vast research, I was able to have a better understanding of the blockchain and I was amazed by the beauty of the idea and the great potential behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So I thought to myself, okay, “This might be the next generation of the “Internet”, and look how the internet has changed our lives and become something that you cannot live without. This might be something.” So with these expectations, I decided to change the direction of my career and I took a leap into the blockchain industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, one year after, another happy coincidence happened; Algorand Foundation started seeking a team member in Asia for local community building. That’s when I seized my moment and luckily I became part of this great team.</p>



<p>Timothy: Excellent story, I really resonate with that view of it being like the new internet! Thank you for sharing that with us.<br><br>And judging by their popularity and lead in this industry, it’s easy to say joining Algorand was a wise choice!<br><br>Your team has climbed to the top of the charts in terms of market cap and has established itself as an industry-leading DeFi platform of choice by many new DeFi blockchain companies, with Algomint here being just one of many promising projects.<br><br>But for those of us in the industry two years ago, DeFi wasn’t really in the headlines at all. What stuck out to you about Algorand, of all blockchain companies?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Summer: Okay so without a doubt, Algorand is a world-renowned project which has attracted global attention with everything it’s launched, and as you might know there is intense competition in the public chain sector.</p>



<p>So to me, Algorand stood out from the rest for a few big reasons:<br><br>Firstly, and maybe most importantly, is the Algorand team and it’s leadership:</p>



<p>Our Founder, Silvio Micali, is also a Turing award winner. He is the co-inventor of many widely-used blockchain protocols, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Random Functions, and the Probabilistic Encryption.</p>



<p>Many of which have also served as the foundation of modern cryptography and under his leadership we’ve got some of the greatest minds in the industry leading us. That alone gives me confidence that Algorand would succeed.</p>



<p>Then the technical aspects:</p>



<p>Algorand has managed to find an approach that solves the blockchain trilemma without any compromise.</p>



<p>So, a little background here, the blockchain trilemma is one of the main challenges that blockchains have faced throughout the decade in which the three key objectives:</p>



<p>Security</p>



<p>Scalability</p>



<p>And Decentralization</p>



<a href="https://www.seba.swiss/research/the-blockchain-trilemma">Source</a>: SEBA BANK AG



<p><a href="https://www.seba.swiss/research/the-blockchain-trilemma"></a></p>



<p>Summer: Couldn’t be fully achieved without sacrificing at least one of them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So Algorand, by employing a novel pure Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm solved the trilemma and created a truly secure, fast, and scalable blockchain platform.</p>



<p>One fun fact: the name Algorand is a combination of two words: Algorithm and Random – So we call our approach Algorand, because we crucially rely on algorithmic randomness for it’s efficiency</p>



<p>And it’s also worth mentioning that Algorand has a fast-growing ecosystem, and many use cases are from traditional industries. So, a number of companies, actually so far seven hundred have chosen to build on Algorand. So all of these reasons certainly helped my decision to apply, yeah.</p>



<p>Timothy: That’s a fantastic explanation, and with that in mind I can see how it was an easy choice!<br><br>And that’s really impressive regarding your Founder too, Silvio, I didn’t know he played such a big role in developing those protocols!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Verifiable Randomness, that kind of stuff is used by so many different blockchains, that is really fundamental to this industry, that’s amazing.</p>



<p>We’ll include a link in the description below if you’d like to learn a little more about these after the show. But before we get too far, we’d like to break down in the simplest terms possible what exactly IS DeFi?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what impact will this have in people’s lives?<br></p>



<p>Summer: Okay, I’ll take this question-</p>



<p>DeFi is short for “decentralized finance,” it’s a term for a variety of financial applications in cryptocurrency or blockchain to disrupt financial intermediaries.</p>



<p>To put it more specifically, DeFi stands for financial services with no central authority. So DeFi takes out traditional elements of the financial system, such as exchanges, or banks; and it replaces the middleman with a blockchain smart contract.</p>



<p>Okay, so you may ask: So no intermediaries to steal a part of my cake, what other advantages does DeFi have compared to traditional finance? And what impact will it have for the world?</p>



<p>So, First of all, DeFi will make financial services more accessible and everyone will have a fair chance in the financial system. All information which are required when creating a bank or a brokerage account, such as the government-issued ID, Social Security number, or proof of address are not necessary to use DeFi. So this is especially helpful for those who are unbanked in Africa and Southeast Asia who have no access to basic financial services.</p>



<p>Second, no central party or authority can reverse transactions or turn off the services. So you can control your assets independently, all transactions are publicly traceable, and you know exactly where your money is all the time.</p>



<p>And last but not least, transactions are enforced and governed by the “smart contract.” Basically, money is programmable according to predefined computer code, which is publicly available for anyone to audit. With these, DeFi can be applied in real-life services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take insurance as an example – just think of regular insurance – except that the rules of insurance events are encoded and the claims are paid out automatically – how convenient is that!?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael: And to add to what Summer is saying as well, I think the other piece of this is not just allowing users to access these services, but it’s really giving some of the brightest minds in the world the freedom to build out these products.</p>



<p>And the barriers to entry for financial products is extremely high, where as in the DeFi space and the blockchain space, you know, those with the best ideas and the strongest capability can actually deliver valuable products with a lot more ease.<br></p>



<p>Leyla: Well, that is truly fascinating, thank you for breaking that down for us</p>



<p>So, you explained DeFi includes a number of financial products and services,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could you tell us about some of the most popular and how they compare to their counterparts in traditional finance?<br></p>



<p>Summer: Okay so, imagine trying to invest a single dollar in a way that would have any tangible return as an asset without being high risk? It’s virtually impossible. Even with financial inclusion, price point accessibility is not enough.</p>



<p>Through DeFi solutions, the users will be given the chance to take part in trading global tech stocks through a digital tokenization model that divides one share of a traditional equity into an individual 1/10,000 micro-equity token of representative value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This will advance microfinance by moving beyond micro-loans into micro-equity that can create wealth regardless of socioeconomic standing. So, this is actually the work of focus of MESE, one of our ecosystem partners, they are providing accessible wealth creation tools to the underbanked. MESE is a micro-equity stock exchange powered by the Algorand blockchain they aim at letting users invest very small amounts in selected stocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is made possible as the negligible transaction fees on Algorand allow MESE to provide micro-equity token shares that would not be viable at a chain with substantive transaction fees.</p>



<p>So you will be able to hold one crypto-based micro-equity token of big companies like Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Twitter, Amazon, or Google, which is to hold a cryptocurrency that represents 1/10,000th share in a real stock.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael: And to add to that as well and I think Summer touched on it briefly is in terms of micro-loans, the other really interesting part this opens up then is the ability to then take micro-shares or take assets in companies like Google or Apple and actually access loans against those assets.</p>



<p>In the traditional space that’s an incredibly difficult task and in most cases non-existent. But, within DeFi, the ability to do that in a trustless way, in under a minute, and access a loan at really competitive interest rates is a really fascinating piece of the puzzle.</p>



<p>Because, number one, it allows people to access opportunities they might have before them that they may not want to sell their current holdings in other platforms, yet they want to take advantage of this opportunity –</p>



<p>Or, alternatively, they might just need a short-term loan, they might be short on funds, or have an emergency, you know, it happens to the best of us.</p>



<p>So the ability to access those funds quickly, easily, and at a much better rate is really important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tim: Very Cool!<br><br>Some of those stocks are prohibitively expensive, the last I checked you can’t buy a share of Google for under $2,000.</p>



<p>So will this be as easy as buying stocks with any other app? Or will it still require some cryptocurrency knowledge?<br><br>Summer:&nbsp;</p>



<p>MESE aims to make the investment as easy as possible, so the experience will be no different than using the other app.</p>



<p>I believe the key to mainstream adoption is to make blockchain invisible for users. While the user is using the service based on blockchain technology, they won’t need to understand or even realize it’s blockchain related.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just like nowadays, we are using all the services enabled by the internet, but for most of the users, they don’t quite care what technology is behind this.</p>



<p>Tim: Well said,</p>



<p>Yeah, I think a lot of us would agree with you there, most don’t really care how the TV works on the inside, we just want the entertainment that it provides.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think as more blockchain products become more user-friendly focused like ordinary apps, we’ll see a huge increase in adoption.</p>



<p>So these DeFi loans seem like a no-brainer, you know, if you do the math comparatively with their traditional finance counterparts, but if you’re already savvy in Bitcoin you’re probably not too excited at the prospect of low double-digit returns on the year.</p>



<p><br>But for the millions, or billions of people who don’t necessarily enjoy the thrill or inherent risks of investing, when do you think DeFi loans would be in the hands of ordinary users, like my neighbor Bill?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is anyone working on making this like, really mainstream?<br><br>Summer: Yes, that’s what we are heading to, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the key question behind this is “when will blockchain technology obtain mainstream adoption?” or “Is blockchain technology business ready?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So while the benefits of blockchain are clear, for blockchain use cases, such as DeFi, if it wants to be welcomed into mainstream adoption and become an alternative for real-world use cases it has to solve issues like high execution cost, scalability &amp; speed, and the security issues.</p>



<p>To advance ahead, the industry needs a next-generation, open-source, permissionless blockchain being decentralized, scalable, and secure with a built-in transactional speed and low fees to power real-world use-cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe Algorand is one of the ideal platforms to push blockchain into mainstream adoption. And hopefully your neighbor Bill and my friend Jane will soon enjoy the blockchain services with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be honest, it will take some time but it will be worth the effort.</p>



<p>Michael: I think too, as Summer said, blockchain really does need to be invisible for broader adoption,</p>



<p>I think it also creates opportunities for people like Bill to understand the technology and really come to terms with the idea that it’s secure, and it’s an incredible tech, but it’s also not that scary.</p>



<p>Another benefit of DeFi is that those usual roadblocks that I said earlier for entrepreneurs and developers to create interesting products are dramatically reduced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So there is definitely a great variety of products both live and coming, and as we do start to see new generations of Blockchain technology coming to market like Algorand, we are seeing more secure options arise, which inherently means broader adoption is coming.</p>



<p>For example, at Meld Gold we are working with several new projects launching on Algorand blockchain to create yield with Gold, something that’s almost unheard of in the traditional sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the brilliance of Algorand and several of the products building on top of this incredible technology is they are making it easier and easier for people like Bob to access these kinds of opportunities.</p>



<p>Timothy: Gold Yielding!?</p>



<p>If I’m following you correctly, that’s a way to earn an Annual Percentage Yield from gold you own that you would otherwise be just sitting on?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Can you tell us a little more about this?</p>



<p>Michael: Yeah, of course, traditionally assets like physical gold have been cumbersome to deal with, store, and move.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But with Blockchain technology, once that gold is digitized, you can now own that gold. It can be vaulted and stored, trustlessly accounted for, and have a digital representation of that gold on blockchain, which opens up a whole new world of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In reality, it’s essentially unlocking the value within gold that traditionally would not be accessible. Now with your gold represented digitally you can utilize DeFi via platforms, like some of the lending platforms coming to Algorand to earn yield on that gold like you would in dollars or other currency.<br></p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, yeah that’s the first I’m hearing of anything like this, that’s brilliant!<br><br>So aside from the consumer products and benefits we’ve discussed, are there any DeFi products or services that you think would be useful for businesses?</p>



<p><br>Michael: Most definitely, all the advantages Blockchain brings to consumers play out for businesses as well. As you can imagine they are just larger transactors and larger equity holders, so the value is just multiplied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taken by the same token, the ease of use for businesses is also key, it needs to be invisible for businesses just like it is for consumers. And with all the advantages Blockchain brings and how incredibly powerful the tech is, imagine if it was as user-friendly as the apps we are using today.</p>



<p>Summer: Yes, It’s a wonderful thing to see the convergence between the DeFi products and the traditional business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would like to share a good example:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulous, it’s one of the DeFi use cases building on Algorand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a decentralized peer-to-peer DeFi loan platform that provides artists with a more direct and accessible way to secure funding. Also, it offers everyone a fair chance to invest in one of the world’s fastest-growing and most lucrative industries: music.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opulous loans are backed by future music royalty earnings and copyrights. Unlike cryptocurrency, these assets have predictable future values and carry no risk.</p>



<p>The platform will analyze a borrower’s music data and copyright assets to ascertain how much money they are eligible to borrow. It will then establish a custom loan repayment plan based on their predicted future earnings.</p>



<p>Musicians currently earning a steady royalty income will be eligible to receive up-front loans equal to the value of revenue they generate over 12 months, paying as little as 4% in interest rates.<br></p>



<p>Michael: And beyond just Bob we’re also now seeing institutions and startups and corporations looking at what DeFi can offer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, on the start-up front, a tech startup raises $5,000,000 to develop / expand on their project, and rather than sit earning bank interest they can utilize DeFi to generate stronger, meaningful returns to add to their development fund, really increasing their runway and increasing their likelihood of success.</p>



<p>And I agree with Summer about Opulous, you know, as one of the more interesting use cases, allowing artists to digitize future music royalties on blockchain and reducing that friction in market entry while delivering value both to creators, investors and fans is really interesting.</p>



<p>And I think this really opens up what we’ll see in some of this next generation, which is the kind of concept where, for example, farmers could take their future crop yields, digitize them, and gain loans at better interest rates with less friction.</p>



<p>Leyla: So fascinating, well, you both touched on a lot there, but I’m intrigued about the applications to music.</p>



<p>Is this something that would combat the piracy problem causing musicians to lose revenue since file-sharing and torrents became so popular?</p>



<p>Michael: Great question, Blockchain technology via NFTs does help solve this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a fairly new area with a lot of development happening as we speak, but even right now, a song can be loaded into an NFT via hash code and played through a decipher; which means only an original can be played.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the brilliance of that is if you get sick of a song, you can actually trade and sell it on the secondary market.</p>



<p>And then what we see happening is royalties can then be attached to those NFTs and the actual original creating artist can still receive royalties on-chain, completely trustlessly, over time.</p>



<p>And with Algorand this can all happen at lightning-fast speed, at incredibly low cost, and with each component in a trustless manner.</p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, that is a fantastic concept, I think a lot of musicians would be thrilled to learn about this, but I think we’ll have to save a deep dive into NFTs for another episode!</p>



<p>Moving forward though, with this new array of DeFi financial products on the way, do you see this causing more banks to downsize or close?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are banking jobs or loan officer jobs being eliminated?</p>



<p>Michael: Look, I think it needs to be looked at from a different lens, and I think that’s the innovation lens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If DeFi becomes truly a challenger to traditional finance, which I think it is well on it’s way to being, we won’t see the banking industry die out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think we’ll see them be forced to change– adapt, innovate themselves, the difference is normally the changes aren’t this drastic. This is one of the rare occurrences where we see huge leaps forward and the market trying to catch up while being wary of what it holds.</p>



<p>Summer: Yeah, I agree with Michael, so for central banks, cryptocurrencies are now considered a potential threat. However, we can see that when facing the threat, banks are making positive changes to adapt to a new technology trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As one would say, If you can’t beat them, join them!</p>



<p>Banking and governments hold the most power in the world, it may be naive to think that they will stand by as crypto and blockchain replace them.</p>



<p>At this point, nearly all world powers have considered releasing a digital version of their currency from their central bank — the main reason is to head off Bitcoin and crypto from gaining too much momentum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new reality tends to look like centralized authorities will be adopting blockchain solutions to avoid the risk of being extinct.</p>



<p>Leyla: I think a lot of us would be happy to see financial services across the board improve, even if they’re simply forced to, to remain competitive!</p>



<p>How do you see DeFi maturing over the next 5 years?&nbsp;</p>



<p>And what sort of products do you think will go mainstream and how will that affect the current players in the industry?</p>



<p>Michael: I think we’ll see a lot of the current players adapting to meet the market, so we’ll see a lot more adoption from the financial sector and the traditional sector coming to blockchain.</p>



<p>With these additional funds and power coming into the marketplace, we’ll see further accessibility and broader acceptance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As always, you know, additional competition always brings additional innovation, you know, the more competitive the marketplace is, the harder those within the marketplace work to remain an edge and be competitive and also meet the market in terms of what the demands are.</p>



<p>In terms of interesting new products and concepts coming into the marketplace, there’s a huge spectrum of great things coming, but one of the ones that I like most is trustless funds management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is kind of a new concept, and the idea is:</p>



<p>Rather than giving your money to an institution where you deposit and you wait to see what the sort of interest levels are and really trusting a third party to hold those funds and deliver that return–</p>



<p>It’s actually done via smart-contracts, which is a trustless vehicle that allows you to:</p>



<p>One, see all the investments that are being made, but also allows you then earn a return via that vehicle without having to trust that third-party, really removing that element of counter-party risk, where someone might disappear with the money isn’t actually possible in a vehicle like this.</p>



<p>So it really is a new level of transparency for investments.</p>



<p>Timothy: Wow, yeah that’s really interesting, so just to clarify for our audience, you said there is no institution to deposit my money with, so this is a non-custodial solution?<br><br>So the money is in my possession and in my control the whole time rather than with the fund manager, but still being traded?</p>



<p>Michael: Yeah so, Tim it’s actually non-custodial in the sense that it’s not actually controlled by anyone else,</p>



<p>It’s actually controlled by the smart contracts, so what it means is the only one who can actually access and withdraw the funds is you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the other piece to add to that which I think is really interesting as well is with this new generation of automated or autonomous funds management any investment can be made,&nbsp;</p>



<p>it’s not a matter of investing a million dollars, you could invest as little as $10 in a project like this. Which is another interesting element that really changes how we’ll see the new financial structures.</p>



<p>Leyla: I’m always wary of trusting anyone with my money, and I think a lot more people would be receptive to the idea of managed investing if they could maintain control of their funds at all times.</p>



<p>While we’ve been talking about more of the basic level of use cases, what interests you the most about the DeFi space?<br><br>And is there any sort of milestone or advancement you’re really excited about?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Summer: Okay, I’d like to share with you the recent updates regarding Algorand:</p>



<p>We will continue to grow our ecosystem in various aspects including DeFi and NFT, and especially the stablecoin ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there have been a lot of stablecoins issued on the Algorand blockchain such as USDT, USDC, Euro (Monerium), Candian dollar (QCAD), Brazilian Real (BRZ), Turkish Lira (BiLira).&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are also collaborating with our partners on the digital version of the local currency, such as Mexican Peso, Indonesian Rupiah and also, Japanese Yen.</p>



<p>As a project we are investing a lot of our resources and partnerships into working on various stablecoins that are beyond US dollars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This way, it will enable more DeFi use cases, with massive social impact. And we expect to unleash the potential of stablecoins and accelerate the convergence between decentralized and the traditional finance.</p>



<p>Timothy: &nbsp;Very cool!&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those of our audience who may not know what stablecoins are, these are digital tokens backed and redeemable 1-for-1 with their paper counterparts.<br><br>The primary purpose of this is to make them easily tradable across all cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFi platforms.</p>



<p>While there are some tokenized forms already available for most common fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar with USDT,&nbsp; USDC– Algorand is forging ahead to add many more, so that’s definitely something to keep an eye on!<br><br>And Michael, what are you most excited about coming up?<br></p>



<p>Michael: We have a really strong focus on what the future of DeFi looks like, what does the next 10 years look like for this next generation of finance?</p>



<p>Working really closely with a lot of the Algorand building community I get first-hand view of what’s coming and what’s being developed.</p>



<p>So for me, you know, talking with all these other projects, for us where the focus is on creating the most collaborative and powerful ecosystem we can that fills in all the pieces of what a traditional ecosystem or financial ecosystem requires. And ensuring that in that development we’re also making sure it’s a really inclusive environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is something where the entire world can adopt and participate, and doesn’t exclude any particular party, which I think is a really important part of where we’re heading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leyla: That sounds very exciting, Can you expand on the ecosystem you envision?<br><br>And what sort of other DeFi financial products do you see becoming commonplace in the next 10 years?</p>



<p>Michael:&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the key thing to keep in mind is we shouldn’t force technology like blockchain where it doesn’t belong. Likewise, where it is more valuable over the alternative option it should 100% be adopted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In broad terms, at its core, anything that removes the need to hand over control of your assets, such as dollars, or some of the new generation of assets, such as your personal information or medical history, is something where blockchain fits really perfectly.</p>



<p>The other side of this is removing friction, cost, adding speed, or creating certainty in a transaction. This is another really valuable set of components that bring real value within the blockchain space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This ecosystem could expand into things like controlling your own personal identity. This would allow data to be delivered to you as you like it, but also control who actually gets to see your data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, getting paid to see ads for products you are actually interested in, versus advertising companies getting paid for that same information.</p>



<p>Taking the money you earned then onto a loan platform to generate great yield while verifying your identity on that platform via a KYC token in your wallet – But you’re not actually giving up your personalized data, is a really good sort of stepping process as to what we can see coming from this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then finally taking that yield you’ve just earned and via an atomic transaction, which is like a trustless swap with a third party that you can verify is a good actor through their KYC token, on the same transaction is something really useful and something you could not do before…</p>



<p>and this is just the beginning!</p>



<p><br>Leyla: Incredible!</p>



<p>Well guys, honestly, I have many more questions but we are out of time!</p>



<p>For myself and those viewing who would be interested in learning more about DeFi and the types of products we’ve talked about, where would you recommend we start?</p>



<p>Michael: Thanks guys very much for having me, both Tim, Leyla, and <a href="https://bsnbase.io/g/main/index">BSN Global</a>, really appreciate it – and for making this possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And we have a whole series of other articles coming out, so we have regular content coming to market.</p>



<p>Summer: And thanks for having me in this very first session of Beyond Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I really like the idea of putting the blockchain in a way that is easy and fun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While being in the industry for around 3 years – not long but enough to witness the rapid and amazing development happening every day. I am also glad to see the shift in people’s opinion towards blockchain and a growing interest comes from the traditional industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’d like to take this chance and ask everyone to join the journey to witness the development of this groundbreaking technology. Maybe you missed the early stage of the internet boom, but you can still catch the trend of blockchain!</p>

  <p>In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will deconstruct the term Access Management and look at the various elements and concepts behind. Access Management is multi-facted and includes many concepts. On the other hand, many of the areas we should find being supported in Access Management are still missing in most implementations. So: What does it need for a modern, comprehensive Access Management? How will this look differently from now? Will we get rid of the burden of annoying authentication procedures or reviewing static entitlements we don’t understand? Which roles should policies play? Could we move forward to just-in-time entitlements? And will we finally get rid of passwords.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger will cover trends that are already visible, options you can take today, but also evolutions that are just visible at the horizon and innovations vendors should focus on today.</p>
<p>He will deliver you a high-level playbook for tactical and strategic steps for evolving what you have in Access Management towards a broader, future-proof solution.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/access-management-playbook-2021-07-21-kuppinger"></a>

<p>Recent acting chair of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/biographies/rebecca-kelly-slaughter">Rebecca Slaughter</a>&nbsp;wants&nbsp;<a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/recent-ftc-chair-signals-push-for-rules-on-data-collection-and-dark-patterns-that-sidestep-congress/">new rules</a>&nbsp;to shift the burden for avoiding data abuse away from consumers and firmly onto businesses.</p>



<p>Slaughter argues&nbsp;that the current model of giving users choice and control over their personal data, while important, isn’t working to stop data privacy and market competition abuse. Instead she wants businesses to stop excessively collecting and abusing consumer data in the first place, including through the use of&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>. And she points out the FTC doesn’t have to wait for Congress to act on this matter.</p>



<p>Speaking at the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR)’s “Privacy and Antitrust: Integration Not Just Intersection”&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/18/perspectives-on-tackling-big-techs-market-power/">panel discussion</a>&nbsp;in June, Slaughter said:</p>



<p>“I want to sound a note of caution around approaches that are centered around user control. I think transparency and control are important. I think it is really problematic to put the burden on consumers to work through the markets and the use of data, figure out who has their data, how it’s being used, make decisions … I think you end up with notice fatigue; I think you end up with decision fatigue; you get very abusive manipulation of dark patterns to push people into decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So I really worry about a framework that is built at all around the idea of control as the central tenant or the way we solve the problem. I’ll keep coming back to the notion of what instead we need to be focusing on is where is the burden on the firms to limit their collection in the first instance, prohibit their sharing, prohibit abusive use of data and I think that that’s where we need to be focused from a policy perspective.”</p>



<p>New FTC chair,&nbsp;Lina Khan, was sworn in on June 15, 2021, so we’ll watch this space.</p>



<p>In the meantime, we point to our complete privacy toolkit&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;as a way for businesses to be proactive about limiting the amount of customer data they collect and manage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is a powerful collection of identity protection capabilities delivered as a vast toolkit of easy-to-use APIs and SDKs that make it simple to:</p>



  quickly integrate identity protection and privacy capabilities into a brand’s new and existing products and services&nbsp;  give users control over their personal data and identity  offer next generation privacy tools for communications, browsing, payments and more  deliver your customers unprecedented privacy, security, and trust.&nbsp;

Here is an excerpt from his recent article published on&nbsp;Forkast:</p><blockquote>Traditionally, different sectors have used paper or centralized spreadsheets on internal computers to house information and data sets. However, as we have seen, increasingly sophisticated technology has led to a higher risk of threats to private information, especially when housed on centralized systems. Moving forward, it is essential that businesses and individuals invest in decentralized solutions to store and manage data. On a macro scale, end-to-end technology run on blockchain enables private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. From an individual perspective, investment in decentralized digital identity solutions can help users take back control of how and when their data is shared, especially when the current systems are not taking adequate precautions to protect their&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><p>ChainNews — <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/808724023675.htm">From casting to circulation, comprehensively combing the NFT industry value&nbsp;chain</a></p><blockquote>On June 21st, Alipay released two limited-edition NFT skins, which sold out in minutes. NFT are growing in popularity because they allow real-world assets that to be tokenized and quantified. At the same time, NFTs are highly liquid, which makes NFTs easy to purchase and transfer.</blockquote><p>On the third anniversary of Ontology’s MainNet, we launched 10,000 limited edition NFTs. This follows the launch of other Ontology-based NFTs such as HyperDragons, Ontology 2.0 Medals, and Citizen NFTs. Ontology is also providing DID solutions to the music NFT platform, ROCKI. In the future, we will continue to explore the opportunities to combine NFTs with DeFi as well as more traditional industries.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

<p>Global supply chains are hugely complex as they span across companies and countries. As a result, there’s also a high chance of forgeries, inefficiencies due to multiple authentications, and delays that can, in turn, have a compounding effect on other companies’ operations and even a nation’s economy as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The good news is that a lot of these issues can be resolved with <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> Digitizing Credentials <p>The paper credentials that are being used now in the supply chain industry are slow as they require physical verification, and are easily forgeable as&nbsp;well..</p><p>Since VCs are machine-verifiable and tamper-proof, they can be used to securely manage paper credentials and to track the movement of goods across international borders. Check out this <a href="https://devpost.com/software/transportation-hub-lorry-receipt-issuer">PoC </a>to better understand how you can digitize credentials for the supply chain using Affinidi’s stack.</p> Tapping into a Verifiable Global Marketplace <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Verifiable credentials</a> can be used to establish a trustworthy trade connection with another entity on the global marketplace to buy and sell goods across countries and to handle payments, shipping, and the logistics that come with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The advantage with VCs is that they are built on JSON-LD and hence, can be used to verify the credentials of buyers and sellers between different systems and data models.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In early June 2021 Cisco announced its vision for the Future Cloud. This vision comprises two distinct elements – <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/solutions/data-center-virtualization/data-center-events/un-box-webinar.html?ccid=cc002457&amp;oid=wbrcsm026191" title="UCS a unified hyperscale computing infrastructure">UCS, a unified hyperscale computing infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://video.cisco.com/video/6249019154001" title="tools to provide end to end observability of hybrid cloud services">tools to provide end to end observability of hybrid cloud services</a>.</p>
 Hybrid Management Challenge 
<p>As organizations adopt a hybrid IT delivery approach this increases the challenges of managing and securing the different elements.&nbsp; Some of which are delivered as cloud services and some in other ways.&nbsp; Usually, these different elements need different management and security tools and, where hundreds of applications are being delivered, this imposes a significant management burden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, some cloud vendors have started to offer tools that extend beyond their own cloud.&nbsp; A more widely adopted approach is the use of VMware; this is supported by a wide range of clouds and provides common tools that can be used wherever it is deployed.</p>
 Cisco Infrastructure for Hybrid IT 
<p>Cisco’s approach to this challenge is UCS.&nbsp; According to Cisco – this is a programmable self-aware, self-integrating system based on the concept that infrastructure is code. Servers are designed to be stateless, with their identity, configuration, and connectivity extracted into variables that can be set through software. This enables management tools to help guarantee consistent, error-free, policy-based alignment of server personalities with workloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UCS is supported by Cisco Intersight which is an SaaS management tool that provides a single control point for the complete hybrid USC.&nbsp;&nbsp; On paper this provides a solution to a real problem however, it depends upon the customer choosing Cisco products to get all the benefits.</p>
 The Network for the Hybrid Cloud 
<p>The network is the key enabler of the hybrid cloud.&nbsp; The availability of wide area high performance networks is what has made practical the remote delivery of business-critical services.&nbsp; Indeed, the large CSPs (cloud Service Providers) have all invested heavily in their own private networks as a critical part of their service infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the new 5G mobile networks are widening the availability of high-performance connectivity into new use cases including manufacturing, logistics, and travel.</p>
<p>The app on the end user device is just the tip of the iceberg – the app depends upon the work done by the distributed services that provide the functionality.&nbsp; Therefore, the end user experience is becoming dominated by the performance of the networks that connect these services.&nbsp; While the performance of CPU, RAM and storage are still important for the individual services, the end user experience is determined by the end-to-end performance of the networks.</p>
 Governing the Hybrid Cloud Network 
<p>While the performance of hybrid IT services is dependent upon the network much of the network involved will be outside of the direct control of the business.&nbsp; This makes it important to take a governance-based approach with clear service level agreements supported by measurement of delivered performance.</p>
<p>The end-to-end network traversed by a transaction delivered from a hybrid deployment may involve a mobile network (radio and backhaul), the public internet, the in-cloud network, the connection to the organization’s data centre as well as within it.&nbsp; Identifying where unacceptable delays, that are outside of the agreed service levels, are occurring is not a simple task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This challenge is increased by modernised applications which exploit multiple distributed containerised services.&nbsp; What used to be a subroutine call on a server is now a service request, and the performance of this this depends upon the network.&nbsp; One business transaction now involves a web of service interactions.&nbsp; This architecture also increases the attack surface since, these services themselves are points of vulnerability if not properly protected.</p>
 Cisco ThousandEyes 
<p>Cisco’s response to these challenges is their ThousandEyes Platform. According to Cisco this combines a variety of active and passive monitoring techniques to provide insight into the end users’ experience across the applications and services. As well as monitoring enterprise network performance though locally installed agents it also exploits pre-deployed software vantage points across the globe to provide real-time internet outage detection.&nbsp; The platform enables enterprises to monitor and measure the end-to-end network performance to identify bottlenecks.&nbsp; It can also help to detect abnormal traffic patterns that could indicate security compromises.</p>
 What about SASE? 
<p>There are various vendor definition of SASE (Secure Access Service Edge).&nbsp; Cisco defines it as “Secure access service edge combines networking and security functions in the cloud to deliver seamless, secure access to applications, anywhere users work.” Although Cisco did not focus on SASE in these announcements the distributed nature of a service based architecture means that the service edge, if it exists at all, is highly complex and hence will be increasingly difficult to manage and secure.</p>
 Opinion 
<p>Cisco has correctly identified some of the key challenges from the hybrid IT delivery model that is now commonplace in organizations.&nbsp; A common approach to managing and securing the heterogeneous components of this infrastructure is a major headache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, UCS adds yet another flavour to an already crowded field and Cisco Intersight depends upon the use of UCS.&nbsp; Organizations need to consider UCS in the context of the wider market including vendors such as VMware, popular open-source solutions such as OpenStack, other hyperconverged infrastructure products, as well as emerging hybrid IT management tools from the major cloud vendors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast Cisco have correctly identified the network is a critical element of hybrid deployments and that it has the potential to become the major performance and security concern for modernised application architectures.&nbsp; In this context their ThousandEyes platform is very relevant to the governance of networks in a service-oriented hybrid architecture.</p>

 Mission Holding at DM: The Case of Nature-based Solutions <p>This is the fifth in a series of DM notes, in which we write about insights from our work on the ground, following internal learning sessions called DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #5 is a reflection on how we build and organize missions internally, taking Nature-based Solutions as a case&nbsp;study.</p> Mission Oriented Innovation: An Introduction <p>One of the most interesting aspects about the mission to send a human to the moon and back launched by President John F. Kennedy was the design of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency — commonly known as DARPA. Its relationship to the government bureaucracy, connection to Department of Defence procurement, and organizational structure all enabled it to work towards the breakthrough innovations that made the mission a success. Inspired by that we ask: how do we build, shape and hold the missions to address the kind of complex systemic challenges we have to face collectively today that are beyond the realm of technology alone?</p><p>Mission-oriented innovation is itself an emergent practice. Building on a theoretical background grounded in the industrial strategy and innovation systems literature, to date it has primarily been used by local and national governments seeking to address the grand challenges they face by taking a more proactive role in economies.</p><p>DML has been working to put a mission-oriented innovation approach front and centre in its work around various domains: Nature-based Solutions, Spatial Justice, Mental Wealth and other emerging ones. These missions fit within the broader mission of DML as an organisation, which we currently define as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs focuses on accelerating societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and positive interdependence. Our aim is to discover, design and develop the institutional ‘dark matter’ that supports a more democratic, distributed and sustainable future. Our daily work ranges from policy and regulation to finance and data, from governance and democratic participation to organisational culture and identity. To keep that transparent, we undertake open work in collaborative partnerships to discover and provoke alternative visions of the future, designing how they might look in practice, and experimenting in context to reveal how they could work and enable the necessary change.</blockquote><p>Mission-oriented innovation implies a few shifts,&nbsp;moving:</p><blockquote>○ from market ﬁxing to market shaping (rationale)<br>○ from incremental to transformational change (ambition)<br>○ from analysis to experimentation (approach)<br>○ from sectors to challenges (domain)<br>○ from independent to collaborative work (relationships)</blockquote><p>Innovation is central — but not necessarily technological innovation. It could be financial, legal, regulatory, institutional, democratic or cultural, which increases the importance of broad participation.</p><p>According to IIPP’s Missions: A Beginner’s Guide, here’s how to set good missions:</p><blockquote>1. Be bold and inspirational, with a clear narrative, high engagement and wide societal relevance.</blockquote><blockquote>2. Set a direction with clear, concrete targets that are measurable and time&nbsp;bound.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Be highly ambitious, requiring research and innovation, but with a credible chance of&nbsp;success.</blockquote><blockquote>4. Be cross-disciplinary and cross-sectoral.</blockquote><blockquote>5. Drive multiple, bottom up solutions.</blockquote><p>However, there are big differences in between a government driving a mission that is technological, such as landing a human on the moon, VS when an organisation like DML works to drive a mission internally and with its collaborators. See below an emergent typology of missions; DM’s approach being closer to the last one described.</p>Source of the visual: <a href="https://twitter.com/RowanEConway">Rowan&nbsp;Conway</a><p>We recognize that a mission only deserves to be called as such when it has a clear directionality. As such, we have focused on our most advanced internal mission, which we are developing across and beyond each singular commission, contrat or grant, to make more legible how we are currently doing this work, what we are learning in the process, and how best we can move&nbsp;forward.</p> Our Nature-based Solutions Mission <p>Now, more than ever, we need to learn to collaborate in symbiosis with nature. Institutions are recognizing the urgency to advance this ambition, setting net-zero targets and announcing ambitious tree-planting and other nature restoration ambitions. But we are struggling to reach implementation. This is a multi-faceted problem and, amongst others, can be linked to the lack of funding, the disconnect between data and mapping or the complexity of turning policy into reality when confronted with land competition.</p> Mission framing <p>DML’s Natural Assets mission focuses on providing the infrastructure components for radical collective action to regenerate, enhance and scale natural or modified ecosystems for human and non-human thriving.</p>Urban landscapes — NbS<p>We are working collaboratively to identify strategic risks within the status quo and how to address them across landscapes (e.g. peatlands, urban nature, watersheds, rivers) through financial instruments and mechanisms; regulatory and outcomes frameworks; inclusive governance; asset management tools; and smart contracts.</p>Deep Code Innovations — NbS<p>We are now developing various proofs of possibilities with partners; amongst others, in Québec/ Canada, Scotland/ UK, Madrid/ Spain, Milan, Italy, and Sejong/ South Korea. For each project, various shared deep code innovations are being developed; we therefore work across verticals (mission, initiatives, etc.) as well as across horizontals (finance, regulation, etc.).</p>Proofs of possibilities being deployed across the NBS mission and deep code innovations. On the left, you find the categories of the deep code innovations (described in the previous visual), as well as which project is working to develop each of&nbsp;them.<p>This year, we will focus on building the technological data platforms and investment vehicles to start assembling the infrastructures for a thriving planet. This work will be advanced thanks to the considerable support we have received recently for Trees As Infrastructure (<a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAI</a>) from Morgan Stanley, Google.org, Climate-KIC and the World Economic&nbsp;Forum.</p>TreesAI Website<p>TreesAI is currently developing a transparent, verifiable financial platform to grow Nature-based Solutions for resilient cities. Through novel accounting and contracting models we value trees as assets, reorienting administrative procedures and attention toward the diverse environmental benefits and behaviours of urban&nbsp;forests.</p><p>The components of the TreesAI platform that will be tested could then also be adapted and applied either in support or another initiative in the same NbS mission, or to support another mission in a different context or&nbsp;region.</p><p>To read more about why municipalities are struggling to reach tree-planting targets, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">click here</a>.

Each of these stages has different types of activities involved in moving it forward. We are currently working to define them in more&nbsp;detail.  Community of practice — It requires a certain critical mass of projects and resources for a mission to sustain a community of practice. With enough experiments on the ground, it allows for the mission constituents to better benefit from peer-to-peer learning, mutual accountability, collective credibility, and shared capabilities that go beyond the impact of any single project. At the early stage of mission building, these multiple interactions can be burdensome. However, regular sharing around theory and framework can still be valuable.  Shared deep code innovations — Some of the deep code innovations that are being developed (across regulation, finance, contracts, etc.) can be adapted, bundled and implemented across various initiatives and missions, which raises the question of how our entire portfolio is linked and how we create lines of overlap and compound learning across the organization (see a very preliminary sketch of that&nbsp;below).  Preliminary framework partially representing DML’s cross-mission portfolio dashboard  Mission pollinators— We need people to translate and pollinate content across projects that sit together within a mission and/ or across other domains. Learning and adaptation across initiatives (for instance between our NbS mission projects Trees As Infrastructure and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">Nouveaux voisins</a>)—at the level of strategic risks, co-benefits and other key questions —cannot be done without people actively working in both projects and with the necessary brain space to spot patterns.  Deep code pollinators— We also need people who are more specialized in one deep code innovation (e.g. finance and capital innovation, or risk &amp; contracting innovation) to work across various missions. They are able to spread and compound relevant learning across different domains that share similar deep code challenges.  Place-based anchors — Place-based cultural sensitivity, knowledge and networks are essential for a mission to be adapted and implemented in a new region. Working internationally requires us to find a balance between having some of our team members working across geographies, some anchored in local contexts, and also partnering with solid and complementary local stakeholders.  Mission wide funding — To actively craft a mission — creating spaces for sharing, compounded learning, and actively making the system visible — requires resource for a few people to take on the pollination, facilitation and sense-making activities. Since funding is normally provided at a project level, funding this cross-project connectivity is a challenge that we need to be proactive in addressing.  Towards civic-led missions — Organizationally and institutionally, we’re as deeply problematized by the monopoly power of state as we are by the monopoly of the private sector, which raises the question of how we can move to a mission that is fundamentally civic-led, beyond state and market actors, in a way that is legitimate and drives public&nbsp;good.  Emergent order — The framework and practices of how to organise in a mission-led approach depends on the actors involved and the resources available, and emerges over time. The current mission framework at DM, for instance, has been an emergent one that is still being defined organically as we go, driven by principles rather than by fixed structures.  Evolving roles — As with any emergent systems organising, as a mission grows the people building it shed roles and take on new ones to adapt to the emerging&nbsp;needs.

				  Machine-readable governance is the key to making decentralized identity accountable, effective, and trustworthy.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Much is talked, much is written about governance in decentralized identity. “Trust frameworks,” “trust marks,” “transitive trust” all form part of a lexicon that can be confusing to those looking to enter the field, develop a product or service, or find a simple solution to a problem. In part, this is because the word “governance” is used to cover a lot of ground, from corporate structure and network policy, to responsibilities, values, policies, and legal agreements. Corporate and technical governance can overlap to the point where it’s easy to end up thinking that governance is a problem that needs to be solved before we can use the technology.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why this isn’t true. From a design perspective, it’s impossible to lay out all the rules of an information ecosystem in advance, and unwise to try and do so, given that an ecosystem must be able to grow organically to become an ecosystem. The architecture of decentralized identity has clear and simple constants defining its essence: privacy by design, security by design, permanent and portable identity for everyone and everything. The key to sustainable innovation is to combine these constants with flexible parameters. This allows a simple set of rules to generate an infinite number of variations. If all these varieties are interoperable, we end up with a network of networks.</p>
<p>All of this is not to understate the value of paperwork—and the need for common agreement around issues like interoperability. Mars will need a constitution—and a great one. But we must get there first.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance enabled by Agents<br>
The thing is, we have a way to enable clear, flexible, governance right now through Agents and machine-readable governance. Agents are the software that allow data to be shared and authenticated by consent between parties, and this makes them the most important governance entities in decentralized identity. That’s because they are programmable with governance rules that define how digital information can be accepted, exchanged, verified, updated, and revoked. They enable people and organizations to trust an exchanged credential.</p>
<p>When Indicio deployed its decentralized ecosystem for a pilot on digital COVID credentials in Aruba (the ecosystem is now called <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a> and is a project of Linux Foundation Public Health), Agents containing machine readable governance made the whole system work:</p>
 
 Tourists downloaded a “digital wallet” agent to accept a COVID test credential 
 The COVID testing lab used an agent to issue a test credential 
 The government used an agent to verify the test credential and then issue a proof-of-test credential to the tourist. 
 Hospitality businesses across the island used downloadable verifier agents to scan and verify the government issued credential when the tourists showed up 
 
<p>Machine-readable governance allowed the government to implement its COVID test policies quickly within an architecture for privacy-preserving technology. People knew what was needed. People knew that changes could be quickly dialed into the governance if information changed. And above all, people knew who to trust. Instead of starting with top-down rules, the combination of Agents and machine-readable governance enabled bottom up governance to get the job done.</p>
<p>Start local, scale global<br>
This is a critically important point. While decentralized identity is a new and unfamiliar concept to many people, most have an intuitive grasp of decentralized governance. In politics, it is synonymous with the view that local knowledge will drive better governance for the governed than a decision taken far away; in the European Union, this is the principle of subsidiarity: Power should be exercised as close to the citizen as possible.</p>
<p>When it comes to decentralized identity, this is why figuring out what works at the local or hyperlocal level becomes a powerful source of trust. Because specific, local knowledge is essential to building transparent, competent, and reliable solutions—the three distinguishing features of trustworthiness, according to philosopher <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PNX6M_dVsk">Onora O’Neill</a>—the technology is more likely to be trusted and adopted when it can incorporate specific, local knowledge.</p>
<p>When we have learned what works to solve a myriad of local problems, we can then scale up to governance at a global level. The governance frameworks created as we deploy these solutions are not going to be mutually exclusive; but the search for one framework to rule them all now is likely to be fruitless at best and a hindrance at worst.</p>
<p>Instead, we need to focus on maximal privacy through minimal rules, and let the interplay of agents and machine-readable governance handle all the pre-existing, national, international, sector-specific, and institutional governance frameworks that will need to be accommodated as decentralized identity expands across the globe.</p>

Darkwah</a> &amp; <a href="http://anyidoho.me/profile">Nana Akua Anyidoho</a>, <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of&nbsp;Ghana</a></p>Ads for Glovo (food delivery) and Bolt (ride-hailing) services in Accra. Photo-credit: Nana Akua Anyidoho &amp; Akosua K.&nbsp;Darkwah)<p>Over the course of 2021, the University of Ghana and Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will undertake a study to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young women’s experiences working and selling through online platforms in&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>Women in Ghana have a long history of participation in the economy as workers and owners of enterprises. Therefore, the nature of Ghanaian women’s work, including the extent to which it is empowering, has long been of interest to researchers. With the increasing digitization of work, more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, questions about the content and impact of women’s work have gained more urgency. This background informs our study of women’s platform livelihoods in Ghana, using a female empowerment approach. The study also builds on previous work on platform livelihoods by both Caribou Digital and researchers at the University of&nbsp;Ghana.</p> An Overview of Ghana’s Digital&nbsp;Economy <p>Ghana’s mobile phone and internet penetration rates are 140% and 66.8% respectively, and its social media rate is 23%. On the African continent, Ghana ranks third in private sector digital platforms after Nigeria and South Africa; it has a total of 72 platforms, 42% of which are local in origin. Ghana’s ranking on the UN’s E-Government Index (EGDI) score is also impressive. The EGDI is a weighted average of normalized scores of three dimensions of e-government, specifically the scope and quality of online services, the extent of development of telecommunication infrastructure and the inherent human capital. In a 2018 survey, Ghana was the only African country to transition from a middle-level to a high-level EGDI.</p><p>Ghana’s achievement on these indices can be partly attributed to a range of government policies aimed at improving the e-print of the country over the last decade and a half. Among these <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/govt-launches-digital-platforms-for-business-transactions.html">policy initiatives</a> is the National ICT for Accelerated Development Policy designed to promote the participation of young people in Ghana in the global digital economy. The government has also rolled out training programs to provide young people with skills to participate in the gig economy. One such initiative, the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/gov-t-recruits-3-000-persons-under-digital-marketing-and-entrepreneurship-programme.html">Digital Marketing and Entrepreneurship Program</a>, offered a three-month training course for 3000 young people who were then to be absorbed by Ecobank, a Pan-African financial company. In the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/ghana-news-migration-to-digital-economy-still-on-course-veep.html">digital transformation of public services</a>, such as in the renewal of national health insurance, the government itself offers a source of employment for young people with digital&nbsp;skills.</p><p>There are also non-state actors that support young people interested in digital technology. A pioneer in this respect is <a href="http://www.meltwater.org/">Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST)</a>, which was set up in 2008 to provide training, mentoring and financial support to potential tech entrepreneurs. More recent examples include <a href="http://www.ispacegh.com/">iSpace Ghana</a> which received an award from Google in recognition of its diversity and inclusion programming. Many of these training organizations are, however, located in Accra, <a href="https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/412821598381054828/Ghana-DE4A-LOW-Res.pdf">limiting opportunities</a> for individuals living outside the capital. The city is also the site of the <a href="https://www.moc.gov.gh/accra-digital-centre">Accra Digital Centre</a>, a technology park, and <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/14/africa/google-ai-center-accra-intl/index.html">Google’s first AI centre</a> on the continent.</p><p>While a <a href="https://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/412821598381054828/Ghana-DE4A-LOW-Res.pdf">2019 World Bank Group report</a> describes Ghana as an average performer in terms of global entrepreneurship and innovation, some of its digital companies have gained global recognition, including mPedigree, mPharma, Logicel, Rancard Solutions and SoftTribe, the last of which is owned by Herman Chinery-Hesse, a man who has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/26/new-africa-ghana-software-chinery-hesse">called Africa’s Bill Gates.</a> Currently, there are 96 active digital commerce platforms in Ghana, <a href="http://access.i2ifacility.org/Digital_platforms/">about half (53) of which are of African origin</a>. The <a href="http://access.i2ifacility.org/Digital_platforms/">most common</a> of these are freelancing platforms and rental platforms such as Airbnb. Indigenous platforms that have made an imprint on the landscape include <a href="http://www.esoko.com/">Esoko</a> which started as a service to provide content support to farmers. There are also a range of E-commerce shops, some of which are businesses designed entirely with digital platforms in mind, such as <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/innovative-business-models-in-covid-19-era.html">Wear Ghana</a>, and others as <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/melcom-launches-online-shop.html">additions to traditional stores</a>. Since the pandemic, some businesses are organizing webinars that allow them to operate in a safe manner andalso harness skills and knowledge worldwide. An example is the <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/ghana-s-agribusiness-industry-to-benefit-from-macfrut-s-virtual-trade-fair.html">virtual trade fair</a>,organized for the fruits and vegetable industry.</p><p>The country has a fairly robust electronic payment infrastructure to support online commerce. By 2017 estimates, mobile money transactions are used primarily for remittances (43%), payment of utility bills (8%) and wages (7%). Nonetheless, close to 99% of transactions still involve cash, although the pandemic led to an increase in cashless financial transactions, with a <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/covid-19-spurs-growth-in-mobile-money.html">50% growth</a> in the amount of money sitting on mobile accounts between June 2019 and June 2020. The availability of mobile money transactions has encouraged the development of other services such as <a href="http://www.peoplepensiontrust.com/">micro-insurance</a> for low-income earners in the informal&nbsp;economy.</p> Who is engaged in platform livelihoods in&nbsp;Ghana? <p><a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/platform-work/">Platform livelihoods</a> are “active human efforts, sometimes combined with tools or assets, deployed to create value outside of the constructs of a stable employer-employee relationship, mediated by the infrastructure and accompanying logic of digital platforms”. Platform livelihoods are made up of platform work (e.g. Glovo food delivery or working on Upwork.com) and platform&nbsp;sales.</p><p><a href="https://researchictafrica.net/%20after-access_the-state-of-microwork-in-africa/">A study</a> by Research ICT Africa in Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa suggests that, in general, people with university education are not attracted to platform livelihoods because of lower earnings relative to other work opportunities available to them. However, this depends on labour market conditions in individual countries. Even in Ghana where platforms are dominated by workers and sellers with secondary education, it may be seen as a viable livelihood opportunity even by university graduates. <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/68716/">One study</a> describes a young Ghanaian graduate who quit his job to work fulltime for Upwork.com, a freelancing platform. While he earned a higher income than he might have in non-platform employment, he reported working 48 hours without sleep to complete a task on time, mindful that client endorsements could greatly undermine his future work&nbsp;options.</p><p>Although the number of individuals involved in platform work in Ghana is fairly low, women are well-represented in this form of employment. We do not have sex-segregated data across the different forms of platform livelihoods in Ghana, but there are some statistics that give us some indication from studies of specific forms of platform livelihoods. The<a href="https://researchictafrica.net/%20after-access_the-state-of-microwork-in-africa/"> survey by Research ICT Africa</a> in seven countries in Africa estimates that 2% of Ghana’s population is involved in platform work and, further, that slightly more women (2.1%) are involved than men (1.9%). However, men and women tend to be engaged in different forms of platform livelihoods. Uber is a good example of this phenomenon. The company<a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/accra-becomes-city-467-next-smart-african-city-to-offer-uber.html"> set up shop in Accra in June 2016 </a>and <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/uber-extends-services-to-kumasi.html">extended its operation</a> in 2017 to Kumasi, the second largest city. By 2018, it had registered <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/uber-partner-drivers-in-accra-hits-over-3-000.html">over 3,000 driver partners</a> on its platform. Although the company publicly declared its commitment to <a href="https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/uber-to-engage-1-million-female-drivers.html">recruiting female driver partners, </a>its driver partners remain almost exclusively male.</p><p>The few existing research on platform livelihoods in Africa indicate it is a sector dominated by young people. We do not have the statistics to confirm this for Ghana, young people are often the target of various initiatives by the state, business owners and development partners to improve young people’s access to platform work. With funding from the Mastercard Foundation and Solidaridad, the Springboard Road Show Foundation is running a <a href="https://core.com.gh/">Coronavirus Recovery and Resilience Program (CoRE</a>). This program offers young people a guide to sustainable livelihoods in a post-pandemic world. Others have gone a step further to support women to set up online businesses. For instance, The Mastercard Foundation, through its Young Africa Works program, has partnered with the Ghana Enterprise Agency and Lokko House to set up an <a href="https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/Business/235441/Ghanaian-women-owned-enterprises-to-benefit-from-Retail-and-Online-marketplace">online retail shop</a> that will enable women-owned and -led enterprises to promote their products and connect with customers internationally.</p> Researching Gender and/in Platform Livelihoods <p>Despite their participation in the sector, Ghanaian young women’s experiences of platform livelihoods and its implications for their lives is an underexplored subject. Our study will examine the extent to which participation in platform livelihoods empower Ghanaian women. It will also explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women’s participation in platform work and sales. The focus will be on young women aged between 18 and 35 years living in urban communities where the digital infrastructure is fairly well developed. What are women’s experiences of working on platforms? How has this changed in the wake of the global pandemic? Above all, what are the enabling and constraining factors for meaningful and dignified work for female platform workers and sellers in Ghana? Specifically, how successful are policy and programmatic initiatives in boosting young women’s participation in this sector and also ensuring that their experiences are empowering.</p><p>In order to ask these questions, we will use a mixed methods approach. In addition to content analysis of online newspapers, we will employ a range of qualitative methods including expert interviews, in depth interviews, and focus group discussions with young female platform workers and sellers. We will also survey young women performing platform work across different segments.</p><p>We will adopt participatory video storytelling as part of the research methods, to allow us to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers. We will provide them with the tools (a phone, video training and mentoring) to tell their story in their own words. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">See our previous participatory video storytelling work&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>We are looking forward to this research and would welcome any feedback at anyidoho@ug.edu.gh and adarkwah@ug.edu.gh.

<p>You need to move money, but with that comes risk. How do you know a customer has enough funds available in their account? The answer: balance checks. With balance checks, you can guarantee that a customer has sufficient funds to facilitate confident money movement. And with live balance checks, you can get the most accurate, most up-to-date account information. Let’s dig deeper into how that works.</p>
 What Are Balance Checks? 
<p>Many payment solutions rely on balance checks to ensure that an account has the funds necessary to make a payment. For card payments, this comes in the form of a network authorization. For ACH transfers, balance checks help mitigate financial risks like payment failures, overdraft fees, and NSF fees, all of which can happen if an account holder tries to move money they don’t have.&nbsp;</p>
 Why Implement Balance Checks? 
<p>Balance checks deliver visibility into a customer’s bank account balance so payment facilitators can move money confidently and mitigate risk. Implementing balance checks into your workflow can produce benefits like:<br>
</p>
 
 Streamlined payment experiences 
 Reduced <a href="https://www.finicity.com/what-is-ach-6-fundamentals-to-get-you-started/">ACH payment</a> errors 
 Higher rate of payment success 
 Mitigate money lost due to payment failures 
 Better decision-making thanks to more accurate, up-to-date data 
 Improved consumer experience with fewer fees and more successful payments<br>
 
 
<p>Altogether, balance checks help payment facilitators build better experiences for consumers that in turn yield better business outcomes.</p>
 How Finicity Enables Live Balance Checks for Streamlined, Lower-risk Account Funding 
<p>As part of our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">Finicity Pay</a> solution set, we offer several balance check options so that payment facilitators can enhance the payment experience and move money confidently. Some balance checks are cached, meaning that you receive lightning fast account balance data with timestamps. For the greatest accuracy, live balance checks deliver real-time, instant balance information at the moment of the request. This might be ideal for higher value or riskier payments.</p>
<p>Our live balance call delivers real-time balance information (both cleared balance and available balance) complete with time stamps directly from a consumer’s financial institution. And thanks to the speed of our high-quality data connections, you can get that important balance information in seconds.</p>
<p>For use cases that may not require a live balance check, we also offer balance checks that occur throughout the day at regular intervals so you can retrieve lightning fast results.</p>

Chart of the&nbsp;week  More Facebook&nbsp;clones  Stuff happens   1. It’s all about&nbsp;creators Tech YouTuber Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips, Photo: Linus Media&nbsp;Group<p>And when it comes to the creator economy, it’s about tools, not the actual influencers.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/content-creators-venture-capital.html">the&nbsp;NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>The creator economy, which provides digital tools to influencers and helps them run their businesses, is a huge, largely unexplored market. The venture capital firm SignalFire estimates that 50 million people around the world consider themselves content creators, while the technology news site The Information estimates that venture capital firms have invested $2 billion into 50 creator-focused start-ups so far this&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Subscription services like OnlyFans and Patreon, where fans pay creators for access to premium content, also helped investors realize there was a strong business case for building tools for creators. Now the word “creator” has become a buzzword, appended to all types of businesses to attract investors. So much so that Alexander Finden, a tech entrepreneur, coined the term “creator washing.”</blockquote><blockquote>“There are more creator economy start-ups than creators,” Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, which invests in early-stage tech start-ups, joked on Twitter in&nbsp;April.</blockquote><p>It’s never been easier to be a creator — from content creation to discovery and distribution to monetization. The next big phase though will be all about giving creators better and direct access to their trusted communities and giving them ultimate control of their creations.</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/content-creators-venture-capital.html">Hello, Content Creators. Silicon Valley’s Investors Want to Meet&nbsp;You.</a>   2. Facebook gets it, but they’re playing&nbsp;catchup <p><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22577734/facebook-1-billion-youtube-creators-zuckerberg-mr-beast">Here’s Vox</a> on Facebook’s concerted effort to attract (and pay) creators:</p><blockquote>Facebook has nearly 2.9 billion users, so lots of people use Facebook to reach that giant audience. But Facebook wants even more people posting more stuff on its platforms, so it’s going to pay out $1 billion by the end of 2022 to encourage creators — people who make internet content for fun and profit but generally aren’t running full-fledged media companies — to make stuff for Facebook and Instagram. The impetus here is clear: Facebook wants more engaging stuff on its apps, and it’s also trying to compete with the likes of TikTok, Snapchat, and&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>But it’s worth noting that there’s a meaningful difference between Facebook’s newest gambit and the one that Google’s YouTube has been using to great success: Facebook, for now, is giving creators a lot less&nbsp;money.</blockquote><blockquote>When you make stuff for YouTube, you get a chance to make money the same way YouTube makes money — from ads that run next to the videos you upload to YouTube. At Facebook, though, there are two different pools of money: One is generated by ads connected to the videos and photos you post on Facebook, and the other is generated by ads everywhere else on Facebook. The first pool is the one that Facebook’s creators can access. The other one is really, really, big. And that’s the one Facebook is keeping all for&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>This is one of those that’s a little easier to understand with visual aids. So: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urtFrxDUV6c">Here’s a YouTube video by Mr. Beast</a>, the site’s most popular creator. YouTube gets paid for the ads that run before and during the clip, and Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old behind Mr. Beast, gets 55 percent of the revenue those ads generate.</blockquote><blockquote>YouTube can also make money other ways, like selling banner ads on its homepage. But the vast majority of its money comes from ads attached directly to the videos it shows to more than 2 billion people every month. So YouTube is directly aligned with the people who generate the stuff that powers&nbsp;YouTube.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Which means there’s a real money gap for creators who thrive on Facebook versus those on YouTube; it’s why top YouTube creators like Donaldson stick with YouTube instead of trying to branch out onto other platforms. And it’s why YouTube says it paid out $30 billion to its content partners over the last three&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>So while Facebook has users and communities, that lack of alignment will continue to hurt its ability to attract top creators to its platform.</p>  <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22577734/facebook-1-billion-youtube-creators-zuckerberg-mr-beast">Facebook wants creators, but YouTube is paying creators much, much&nbsp;more</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html">Inside Facebook’s Data&nbsp;Wars</a>   3. What’s up with&nbsp;Discord? <p>It’s not all about advertising though — a line Discord has stuck&nbsp;with.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">Here’s the&nbsp;WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord nearly tripled its revenue last year solely by selling subscription access to exclusive perks for users. By contrast, the companies behind other free online hangouts — including Facebook Inc., Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. — primarily sell targeted ads built around sharing users’ personal information.</blockquote><blockquote>In an interview, Discord co-founder and CEO Jason Citron, 36 years old, said the company has balked at the advertising model favored by its peers because ads would be too intrusive. People use Discord to hold conversations in real time, he said, as opposed to passively reading, making or commenting on posts. He also said he thinks that consumers in general dislike ads and don’t want their data shared with&nbsp;brands.</blockquote><blockquote>“We really believe we can build products that make Discord more fun and that people will pay for them. It keeps our incentives aligned,” he&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>Again with the aligned incentives.</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">What Is Everybody Doing on&nbsp;Discord?</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/discord-buys-sentropy/">Discord buys Sentropy, which makes AI software that fights online harassment — TechCrunch</a>   4.

Gerald Horst, PwC’s Digital Identity team leader in EMEA, is to deliver a presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4602" title="Modernizing the Customer Journey">Modernizing the Customer Journey</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Gerald some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>Why is there an increasing interest in digital transformation and how has the pandemic impacted digital transformation projects?</p>
<p>
Well, every year, PWC surveys CEOs across the globe about their strategic priorities in this “new normal”. This year, actually more than 5,000 CEOs, which is more than ever before, responded, and by the way, half of them were our CEOs from Europe. And first of all, we found out, most of them are very positive about the economy and the business outlook for their respective firms. And almost half of them are investing with double digit numbers in digital transformation, especially since most of these companies started their transformation efforts due to the pandemic. By the way, digital transformation, we defined it as any large-scale change to the way a company operates their business, and that is supported by the development of an enabling technology. So, why are companies investing in digital transformation? </p>
<p>We learned from the investigation that -and many of them are already on a transformation journey - that they are hoping to realize different benefits in two years from now, including cost savings, revenue growth, product innovation, product enhancement, gathering data and improving their decision-making. But what is apparent is that the organizations want to transform to make the best of technology advantages. There is lot changing: AI, 5G, and they want to use digital to enhance the customer experience, provide a more competitive set of products and services to their customers, generate data and improve, their offering by creating customer insights and really acting upon the information they have at hand.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are companies doing right when transforming successfully?</p>
<p>
It's interesting because we also wanted to know by surveying companies and understanding their digital transformation who actually the winner are. And winning means growing in a disruptive market, achieving the objectives that they set out for themselves at the beginning of the transformation, and we asked them specifically about what the success factors are. And we got over 500 responses from CEOs, and there were five key things: First and foremost, is that the winning companies actually put [the] customer at the center of the transformation. They really, really relentlessly focus on the customer experience. They know their customers very well and they understand the customer needs and behaviors. </p>
<p>Secondly, they also understand that trust is a key market differentiator. So a winning companies have a clear purpose in life, and they keep the promises to their customers and to their employees.  </p>
<p>Thirdly, the winning companies are the ones that are investing in enterprise-wide process and data capabilities. They connect from front-end with back-end. They secure their critical infrastructure and enable all that through key technology implementations. And this is probably one of the most difficult tasks because doing company-wide activities [and] going after a company wide objective, requires companies to really break down the silos. Both functional and political. So that's all about stakeholder management. </p>
<p>Fourthly it's about leadership. I mean, CEOs who sponsor digital transformations, they need to play an active role in the transformation and they should not delegate. And then last but not least, of course, the role of technology. We must acknowledge that as much as technology is supporting the vision, it is also the ability to differentiate themselves by using that technology well. Like I said, much focus is on AI and 5G, yet winning companies have more focus on technologies that enable the digital experience for both their customers and their employees than to focus on technologies that drive efficiencies and savings.  
</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Given that there is increased investment in driving online business, why is Consumer Identity &amp; Access Management a critical success factor in any digital transformation?</p>
<p>
So, like I said, companies that are going through a digital transformation and who actually are the “winning” companies, they put the customer in the center. Relentless focus on customer behavior [and] on customer needs. If you're in an industry, you know what customer identity and Customer Identity and Access Management is all about. Companies that are successful in transforming, are clearly looking for a common set of factors when they select technologies: ease of use and faster processes are considered the most important attributes to encourage adoption of technologies by customers, and [that] makes them the most essential features to get really right upfront. And implementing Customer Identity and Access Management is providing exactly that, and moreover, it optimizes security and privacy capabilities, which is adding to the trust factor. Like I said before, trust is a competitive factor, and this brings us to the topic of Zero Trust.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What is the relevance/value of a Zero Trust approach to security in this context?</p>
<p>
Well, identity really is the new parameter. If you look at it from a customer's perspective, I was doing business online, but also it's the new parameter from an organization's perspective that is securing its business. It has been investigated that by 2023, I believe 75% of security failures will result from inadequate management of identity. So access and privileges. This is growing. I mean, we can see a staggering amount of hacks, attacks etc. happening every day. We are learning fast from many breaches that cyber-crime has actually become an industry, and the breaches are mostly the direct result of weak or compromised access and identity management processes. So I've discussed the topic of Zero Trust over the past year quite a few times in webinars. It's what actually stands for “trust nobody”[or trust] nothing [that] comes from both internal and external networks. So from this, identity is the new parameter. We need to verify the identity of the requester before granting access – [that] is clear. And we need to make sure that any access provided is compliant with rules regulations.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How should organizations go about balancing user experience, cost, and security requirements?</p>
<p>
Right, now we know from experience, that our clients need to find the correct balance between customer experience, security, and costs when they are transforming the front end and when they're introducing consumer identity and access management solutions. This needs to involve a lot of stakeholders, ranging from financial, to IT, to marketing, to compliance and security. And as such, you need to really break down those silos in organizations. Functional [and] political silos, to get them all aligned, and to enable their company-wide transformation. And this means that you have to work on having a common vocabulary and have the stakeholders understand each other. For that purpose, we at PWC, we really looked at this at this challenge and we developed over the past two years a customer identity game, which is a form of a gamification that is very innovative and accelerates the start and the facilitation of the identity programs that we are doing with our clients and the technology implementation that come from it. And by playing games with our stakeholders, they do actually come to this common vocabulary, and they really understand each other. They understand the role of digital identity and the strategy they have to automate related [to] onboarding as an example, much faster than before. And the design and implementation of solutions is also much done, much more effectively and playing games is fun.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What types or organizations are leading successful projects in terms of integrating marketing, CRM, and CIAM?</p>
<p>
Well, I mean, my answer would say that all business to consumer companies are adapting to changing customer and market conditions. So, they are really implementing consumer identity and access management programs. They're integrating it - well, they're implementing CRM solutions, whether they're integrating or not, that's I think a little bit further down the road. But of course, you've seen that in financial services, and also in retail, but especially in financial services, banks, insurance companies, they have been implementing Consumer Identity and Access Management way before others due to competitive pressures, but also [due] to [the] compliance needs they have.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you see CIAM becoming increasingly important in future for online business models?</p>
<p>
Well, absolutely. I think, you know, like I said before, what you see is that companies are going through digital transformations for a number of reasons, that the companies that are actually doing that successfully, need to put the customer in the center of that transformation.  </p>
<p>They need to understand what their customer actually needs. It's all about ease of use, it's about building trust. It's about automating processes and making it agile and speeding up those processes. So yes, CIAM is going to be increasingly important for that, because basically that's what CIAM is offering. It's, it's offering ease of use, it's offering faster processes, it's offering trust by means of security and privacy capabilities. Yes, so I do believe that CIAM is increasingly gaining importance. It actually is a critical success factor for any digital transformation that is going to be successful.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Do you think this will be influenced by that fact that platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow are increasingly taking over Identity &amp; Access processes?</p>
<p>
Yes, of course. Clearly, platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow that you mentioned are increasingly supporting clients to transform their businesses into online business models, which is why these providers themselves also are offering wider and deeper IAM and CIAM capabilities than ever before. And as PWC, we have both, you know, both these platform teams and skills, and we have these identity teams and skills in house. We get more questions from clients that are utilizing Salesforce platforms, for example. And they ask us to investigate whether a CIAM from Salesforce can actually deliver the ROI that they are looking for.  </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What can attendees of EIC expect in your presentation?</p>
<p>
I look very much forward to being a Munich. I hope that it will be a physical event and I really hope to present [on site] and I look forward to that. I will, in my presentation, make clear that implementing powerful Customer Identity and Access Management and integrating marketing and Customer Relationship Management functions with Customer Identity and Access Management, if done well, of course, is [a] critical success factor for any digital transformation. And it will help business owners achieve the ROI that they're looking for. I will also share how to get there in terms of an effective way to implement CIAM and integrate a CRM. And especially I will focus on how to break down those silos, those functional and political silos - bring stakeholders together, manage their expectations, keep them aligned. And thirdly, I will discuss a very interesting client case, basically to clarify my messages, all that in 20 minutes, making identity matter, together with PWC. I look forward to it. Thank you. </p>

<p>Our latest article gives you a quick overview of the european eKYC space and what solutions offer the best user experience.</p>
 Understanding the eKYC mix in Europe 
<p>The digital banking revolution in Europe has ushered in a new way for banks and fintech to acquire new customers to create an end-to-end good user experience. As new digital experiences removed customer pain points from sending, saving, and investing money, customers soon became accustomed to frictionless digital banking journeys. In addition to maintaining a frictionless customer experience when it comes to KYC, banks and fintech must also adhere to and navigate the sometimes disparate national and EU AML regulations while using the latest and most flexible technologies that fit within their tech stack. Fortunately, several eKYC solutions, such as bank identity, AI-based identity, and agent-based identity, offer a superior user experience, adhere to regulation, and utilize future-proof technologies.&nbsp;</p>
 eKYC in Europe: what to consider 
<p>Approaching KYC in Europe requires a range of considerations. The first core lens, regulation, requires banks and fintechs to focus on a national and EU level. While the EU level serves more of a “one size fits all model”, AML requirements at the national level vary. For example, in the UK, banks and fintechs can use automated solutions to perform an eKYC, but in Germany, the regulator requires a video-based solution for eKYC. At the EU level, banks and fintechs must adhere to AMLD 5 and ALMD6. AMLD 5 came into force in the EU in 2018, and required all EU member states to transcribe the directive into their own legislationby the 10th of January 2020. This direct expands the scope of AML requirements and aims to streamline the AML procedure across member states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another core consideration is if the customer already has an existing banking relationship. Customers applying for their first financial product in a country often require a branch visit. But, customers who have a current banking relationship can avail of quicker onboarding services, such as MobileID in Sweden or ID confirmation via the current banking account number in Spain.&nbsp;</p>
 How can a bank or fintech offer a compliant, superb user experience onboarding? 
<p>Understanding the many lenses of the customer or user experience is critical when assessing the right eKYC in digital financial services. A good user experience is characterized by several factors and attributes such as efficiency, visible and relevant help and support, error prevention, and consistency. Within Europe, a number of eKYC options are available that not only adhere to local and regional regulations, but allow banks and fintechs to offer a superior onboarding user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common type of eKYC, which provides a high level of usability, is <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">agent-based authentication</a>. This type of authentication, either run in-house or via specialized eKYC companies, sees the applicant speak to a qualified agent who completes the identity and document check. From a user experience perspective, it offers an incredibly high amount of convenience, as applicants can typically undertake the agent-based video call at a time that is convenient for them. This solution is increasingly popular and relevant as new customer segments feel more comfortable with digital banking and completing tasks in digital channels that were once only available in the physical world before Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One solution with high potential in Europe is using existing bank account identification to fulfill eKYC requirements. The solution leverages an applicant’s existing bank account details and identity, backed by open banking technology. To complete the three-step process, a customer presents a valid ID, completes a micro-transfer money transfer within the existing online banking platform, and lastly confirms their details. The bank account identity solution is an efficient process, provides little room for error, and provides a high level of consistency. The entire experience can occur within one or two applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-based identification</a> often combines machine learning, AI, NFC, and biometrics capabilities to provide a highly accurate and quick eKYC solution. This type of identification is often the quickest to complete, and is future-proof as the solution is able to evolve based on million of datapoints feeding the algorithms. AI-based identification is a great solution for banks or fintechs already employing AI or data-driven products and experiences because it provides a high level of brand and usability consistency.&nbsp;</p>
 Finding the right balance in between UX &amp; banking regulations 
<p>The digital financial service space is growing more competitive by the day, and offering customers a seamless, innovative and relevant user experience is quickly becoming a hygiene factor. While designers and product owners are inspired by the user experience of non-regulated tech companies, such as Spotify or Netflix, banks and fintechs must ensure they abide by not only national, but regional regulation around AML. AML requirements, specifically KYC and customer identification have historically been a cumbersome, manual and time consuming process in physical and digital onboarding and therefore risk disrupting what an otherwise exceptional user experience is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a range of eKYC options, including AI-verification, bank account verification, and agent verification are becoming increasingly utilised across Europe to fulfill AML requirements, but offer seamless onboarding, with innovative solutions that align with forward-thinking brands. These solutions prove to be a win-win-win; for the bank or fintech, for the customer, and for keeping the financial services industry a safer place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introduction: Inflation And Economics</p>Inflation Has Been A Major Topic Of Discussion Globally Specifically In The United States, But What Is Inflation?<p>Our globalized and homogenized economy has witnessed excessive inflation since the The Great Recession which began in 2008 and its impact cannot be overstated, but what is inflation? Inflation, by definition, is the process of sustained increasing costs over a period of time. Inflation occurs when a currency like the dollar or the Euro loses value over the course of a specific time-frame: simultaneously, goods begin to rise resulting from this economic occurrence. Inflation, over the course of the last forty years, has seen substantial debate where participants have argued its negative elements as much as its positives. Economists throughout the last century have argued that inflation occurs when the supply of money is greater than the demand of money. Inflation at a moderate rate has been argued to boost consumer demand and consumption, under the premise that higher levels of spending are crucial for economic growth and expansion. Even famous economist John Maynard Keynes argued that inflation helps prevent the Paradox of Thrift, which leads to delayed consumption. But how can inflation be a drag and negative on the economy, lets find&nbsp;out.</p>Purchasing Power Of The U.S. Dollar: Is This Economic Paradigm Sustainable?<p>Inflation, by design, accompanied by a sustained increase in prices, leads to the erosion of purchasing power. Essentially, if a consumer does not consistently expand upon their purchasing power through the acquisition of monetary instruments, inflation can cause their purchasing power to plummet over the course of time. An increase in prices leads to a ubiquitous impact throughout all sectors of the economy: this includes the cost of doing business, borrowing money, mortgages, government bond yields and much more. If inflation has both positive and negative impacts on the traditional economy, how would this economic phenomenon affect a new digitized homogenized economy; this economic system being cryptocurrency. Inflation has resulted in negative setbacks to economic systems since the dawn of civilization, can Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies fix inflation, and how does inflation in traditional markets affect cryptocurrencies?</p><p>Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency: An Economic&nbsp;Savior?</p>Bitcoin VS. The Dollar In Real Time: A Question Of Value And Inflation<p>It is evident that the US dollar and many fiat currencies have lost substantial value over the course of their respective time-frames, can Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies be the answer to this economic dilemma? Bitcoin has consistently proven itself, surrounding economic valuation, to be a perfect hedge against fiat inflation “though Bitcoin has seen massive erratic downtrends, its consistent trajectory over time remains upward. Bitcoin, by design, is meant to combat inflation through two methods, its total supply will be no more than 21 million, ever throughout time and every four years, the amount of Bitcoin that can be mined is reduced by half. Investing and holding Bitcoin and other blockchain projects have been an enticing prospect for individuals who realize the detriment to purchasing power that high inflation rates can create. Resulting from inflation, the fiat in a consumers bank account consistently depreciates in value over time, whereas many cryptocurrency projects have created of deflationary measures to prevent runaway inflation: the burning of excess token supply has been one answer to this problem. Bitcoin and Ethereum has offered investors an alternative to the loss of purchasing power, but how are these cryptocurrencies less prone to runaway inflation? It is crucial to understand such a&nbsp;notion.</p><p>A Brief History Of Inflation: The Complexity Of Bitcoin: The Anti-Inflationary Paradigm: Decentralized Control</p>Cryptocurrency Design: The Coexistence And Equilibrium Of Healthy Inflation And Deflation<p>It has become evident over the course of history that countries have had their economies ruptured by their respective national governments. During the late 1780’s, France, under King Louis XVI, experienced rapid runaway inflation resulting from the monarchy consistently printing money to finance the American Revolution. This was a major factor on how King Louis XVI came face to face with the guillotine and Europe witnessed an entire continental upheaval from a political, economical and social standpoint resulting from the outcomes of the French Revolution. Within the 21st century, the global community has witnessed many nations that have nearly collapsed because of government manipulation of their respective economies; Venezuela and Zimbabwe are the first nations that come to mind. Bitcoin fixes this&nbsp;notion.</p><p>Bitcoin, by design, is non-tamperable, immutable, decentralized, trustless and free from government manipulation. Bitcoin cannot fall prey to state and federal governments adjusting interest rates or printing more money to achieve political or monetary policies. Bitcoin, like gold, is seen as a digital store of value that allows for decentralized peer-to-peer transference throughout the globe for extremely low costs. Bitcoin is an incredibly scarce commodity, by design, only 21 million will ever be created and there are almost 8 billion people on the planet in the year 2021. Scarcity, amalgamated with intrinsic value, leads to upward growth over the course of time. Simultaneously, it is easy to predict when a specific amount of Bitcoin will be minted; by the year 2140, all the Bitcoin in the world will be mined, whereas gold, although it is scarce, can consistently be found or discovered at anytime. Bitcoin’s design is a paradox by nature, amalgamating the positives of inflation and deflation. Inflation occurs because more Bitcoin is mined but resulting from the reduction of Bitcoin being mined over time, the economic instrument’s inflation rate will also decrease. However, it is incumbent to recognize that not all cryptocurrencies have the same economic paradigm as Bitcoin surrounding inflationary and deflationary design.</p><p>Stablecoins And Alts: Inflationary Impacts On Cryptocurrency</p>Stablecoins Are Cryptocurrencies That Are Pegged To The U.S. Dollar Or Another Form Of Fiat: How Does This Impact This Category Of Cryptocurrency<p>Cryptocurrency has become an ecosystem of ecosystems, perpetuating the expansion of diverse digital economic models and tokenomics that have conceived of lush and vibrant digitized economic systems, but how does inflation affect stablecoins and “alt-coins?” An increasingly popular category of cryptocurrencies, known as stablecoins, are pegged to the U.S. dollar and are incredibly useful in times of market corrections, collapses and downtrends, but how does being pegged to a fiat currency affect your investment? Since these stablecoins are pegged to fiat currencies, they’re at mercy to the inflation rates that these currencies succumb to. In essence, your investment will be directly correlated with inflation rates of traditional currencies. However, many stablecoins like USDC and DAI have created paradigms that combat this notion of inflation through economic incentives and&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The design of many stablecoins have conceived of a paradigm to prevent the recurring onslaught of inflation and have sought to garner a solution to this issue by offering annual percentage yields, similarly to what banks used to offer to their clients and customers. Simultaneously, DeFi technologies have allowed for investors to lend their stablecoins for an annual interest rate for their respective loans, enabling investors to enjoy compounding interest. In Nigeria and Zimbabwe specifically, Nigerians and Zimbabweans have been turning to stablecoins for protection against inflation which has ran rampant in each country over the last ten years and it is important to reference that Nigeria’s inflation rate has become an aggregate average over the last ten years of a staggering 12%. Simultaneously, these stablecoins also enable users to send digital currency with near-zero transaction fees. Stablecoins allow for individuals who’re prone to runaway inflation in their respective nations to protect their savings through annual yielding stablecoins that are pegged to the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins, a category of “alt-coins” have created a bastion of economic trust for individuals who seek refuge from inflationary onslaught.</p><p>Altcoins such as AERGO, Cosmos, Algorand and Quant have proven during the latest downtrend that economic incentive and interest towards these cryptocurrencies are vibrant and expansive; in a time of constant downward price spirals throughout the cryptocurrency markets, these coins have not lost nearly as much of their respective all time high valuations as other cryptocurrencies and this is important to reference. Although alt-coins can be more risky when it comes to investment prospect, their economic yields that result in economic price discovery during bull-markets cannot be overstated. For many retail investors, altcoins are the driving force to wealth if invested properly and with projects that have utility and hype behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>Conclusion: Bitcoin And Cryptocurrencies: The Great Inflation Hedge</p>The Great Inflation Range: A Vison Of A Sub One Bitcoin Inflation Rate<p>Currencies throughout history has succumbed and witnessed the onslaught that runaway inflation can have on nations, empires, monarchies, republics and dynasties, but today, we have a technology that specifically combats runaway inflation through a variety of methods, and that currency is Bitcoin. By design, Bitcoin aims to amalgamate the positives of inflation and deflation, preventing governments to manipulate it to pursue political or monetary policy or gain and also Bitcoin combats runaway inflation through the economic principle of scarcity. Stablecoins have also become a bastion to protect the net worth of hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, specifically in the developing world where economic aid and preservation are needed most. It is evident that cryptocurrencies have become a hedge for investors throughout the world since its inception in 2009, one year after the grand economic collapse known as The Great Recession.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

_A well-designed house not only fits its context well but also illuminates the problem of just what the context is, and thereby clarifies the life which it accommodates — Notes on the Synthesis of Form_

There is an unofficial design canon at Urbit. If you were a fly on the wall, you would hear the name "Christopher Alexander" regularly mentioned around the office. Christopher Alexander is an architect, albeit one who isn't taught at most architecture schools. However, his work encompasses far more than what is usually understood as "architecture". Alexander's work is concerned with the production of functional beauty. What's remarkable about his books is that they are not empty philosophical manifestos—Alexander gives specific, actionable guidance on creative problems. His best books are manuals for how to construct forms that are "alive". Alexander threads the needle between highly specific instruction and generalized abstract concepts—his success at this task can be seen in his influence on fields outside of architecture, from computer science to network theory. In his most recent work, Alexander touches upon subjects ranging from religion to math and connects it all into a theory about how the universe functions. But people read him for less lofty reasons: to build a house that is beautiful, design a comprehensive programming language, or figure out how to approach a complex problem. In this post, I'll give an overview of Alexander's work and hear from some Urbit staff about his relevance to software development.

Alexander's first book, _Notes on the Synthesis of Form,_ detailed a new way to approach the design process. Released in 1962, it incorporated networks, set theory, language, and math into a new method for accurately modeling and solving design problems. Although Alexander was an architect, the book was concerned with fundamental issues: how do you solve complex problems with hundreds of interconnected variables? The answer lies in decomposing the problem into subsystems and then "diagramming" those subsystems back into a singular integrated form. The process of decomposing a set into [highly-interconnected subsets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_structure) involves a significant amount of computation—Alexander wrote a computer program for the IBM 7090 mainframe which was described in his 1962 paper _HIDECS 2: A Computer Program for the Hierarchical Decomposition of a Set with an Associated Graph._ But this was only half of his design process; after the creation of subsets which are the fundamental units of the design problem, the subsets must be diagrammed. This second half of the process involves integrating and synthesizing all of the variables within a single subset into a conceptual diagram. These fundamental diagrams are then integrated and combined _themselves_ into a single diagram which is the final result of the process. The diagram below is Alexander's solution to the problem of designing a village in India with a huge number of variables and constraints.

_Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ can be seen as embodying many of the tensions in 1960s America. Computers were seen as a suspicious technology which embodied the institutionalized science that created the nuclear bomb and cold war era tensions. These suspicions were understandable: computers were massive esoteric machines housed in entire rooms of university and government buildings. They were physically and mentally inaccessible to the average American citizen, while the elites who did use them were held in contempt by the populace. Student protests against being just another cog in "the machine" or "IBM card" were partly right—at this point in the early 60s, many intellectuals were interested in [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics:_Or_Control_and_Communication_in_the_Animal_and_the_Machine) and the [mathematical modeling of "human" problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Games_and_Economic_Behavior) and Alexander drew from these fields frequently in his book. However, when _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ came out in 1964 computer culture was shifting towards an alliance with the counterculture—a cultural and technological process that would culminate with these massive pieces of institutional technology becoming "personal computers". He criticized those who wished to keep math and computers away from human creativity: he saw the possibility of computers yoked to creative human beings. He believed this symbiotic approach to technology was necessary—without a new approach to design, the world would continueto produce the ugliness endemic since the industrial revolution. According to Alexander, a designer could only successfully solve this problem by combining his creativity with the analytic and computational power of machines. Through his books and [presentations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98LdFA-_zfA), Alexander would have a lasting impact on object-oriented programming and [pattern based thinking in software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).

In _Notes on_ _the Synthesis of Form_ Alexander applauds the buildings and towns of many primitive societies but he notes that there is no hope of a return to this "unselfconscious" state. Therefore, modern people must develop a new design process to reach the same end. But what is this end that Alexander is trying to achieve? Alexander states his aim negatively in _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_ as "the absence of misfits between a form and its context". An [apophatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophasis) statement might be good enough for mystics but, for someone like Alexander who was concerned with precision, a positive statement was necessary. His positive statement wouldn't come until 1979 with the publication of _A Timeless Way of Building_.

In 1975, Alexander would begin publishing his most famous book series which included _The Timeless Way of Building_ and _A Pattern Language_. In these works Alexander took a more holistic approach to creative production and placed less emphasis on design models. This new approach cemented the importance of culture as the substrate that supports a people's inherited "pattern language". Just like a spoken language, a pattern language is developed incrementally over time by people who adapt to the same local environment. Alexander wrote that "a pattern language gives each person who uses it, the power to create an infinite variety of new and unique buildings, just as his ordinary language gives him the power to create an infinite variety of sentences". _A Pattern Language_ is an attempt to create a new language from observing the dialects of buildings around the world. Alexander recognized that there were large-scale patterns between people and the buildings they found beautiful—a productive tension between specificity and more general patterns common to all human beings. Alexander's pattern language is therefore more general than historically generated languages. The "pattern language" approach is now native to many software developers: seeing solutions as complexes of layered and interconnected systems.

_A Pattern Language_ is the book that is closest to an instruction manual. It is meant to take the prospective builder all the way through the process of designing and constructing a building, neighborhood, or city. Alexander writes about the macro-patterns of cities and the micro-patterns of buildings, from road design to doorknobs. Alexander wanted to enumerate patterns that interlock and produce beauty at different scales while still being as precise and actionable as possible. In _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, Alexander was concerned with how to best model reality in order to solve a problem, while _A Pattern Language_ focused on the production of a vernacular that would allow people to produce beautiful buildings.

![](https://media.urbit.org/site/posts/essays/patternlanguageexamples.png)

Underlying these different pattern languages is a deep, precise, and objective appreciation of an important quality of human existence—what Alexander calls "the quality without a name". This "quality" is the ultimate goal of Alexander's work. Greater efficiency and instrumentality cannot be ends in themselves. For Alexander, it is a moral imperative to save the world from ugliness and to make human culture match the natural world in beauty, complexity, and aliveness. It is described in _The Timeless Way of Building_ as "the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named". The "quality" cannot be named not because it is a vague or airy concept, but because "the quality is too particular, and words too broad". Nevertheless, Alexander makes an attempt to circumscribe the concept with the words alive, whole, comfortable, free, exact, egoless, eternal.

Alexander would say that a Japanese temple and a German church are both approaching the "quality" from different histories and cultures. They are examples of two vernacular languages developing in parallel. The similarity between two modern cities is an example of how we've been severed from our pattern languages and therefore the "quality"; we are forced to design from barren earth. Global homogeneity is a symptom of disconnect from both temporal and spatial order—it is the death of our inherited languages.

![](https://media.urbit.org/site/posts/essays/timelesswayexamples.png)

_The Nature of Order_ is Alexander's most recent book series and explores the metaphysical implications of Alexander's thought. According to Alexander, the failure of the modern built world is because we have learned to view the world as fundamentally dead. Alexander makes an argument that is close to [hylozoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hylozoism) or [IIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory): all structures have varying amounts of aliveness (an aspect of the "quality"). Because of the modern worldview that sees all structure as dead we have become blind to this deeper aspect. The basic component which makes structures alive are strong and varied centers. Furthermore there are fifteen fundamental attributes of centers which allow them to network and become alive. These fifteen abstract units are what patterns are composed of—patterns that are then woven into languages (this process of formalizing implementations as higher-level abstractions should be familiar to any computer scientist). _The Nature of Order_ is the most philosophical and [spiritual](https://www.firstthings.com/article/2016/02/making-the-garden) of Alexander's work and ties together his overarching preoccupations: how to solve complex human problems and why the task of making the world beautiful is important.

You might be wondering how Christopher Alexander is relevant to Urbit?

That depends on who you ask.

**Galen (~ravmel-ropdyl)**

&gt; I suppose the main thing is that most designers tend to become fixated on the mechanics of what they're building. Most design theory is about how things are made, not what it's like to live inside of them or actually rely on them on a daily basis. Alexander is much more concerned with the first-person experience of inhabiting a place or a building. I guess his approach is just much more empathetic which means it's also more practical. He's concerned with _how people actually live_ and how their environment evolves alongside them.
&gt;
&gt; We live, work, and develop on Urbit. We're often the first people to notice bugs because we are the end users ourselves. Alexander makes the point that old buildings were responsive to feedback because the architect was also the inhabitant. This tight feedback means that the system as a whole is dynamic and alive. We want Urbit to be a house that you live in and make yours, because unlike all the other software you use, your Urbit is actually _yours_.

**Josh (~wolref-podlex)**

&gt; _The Nature of Order_ has had a big influence on my thinking. At first, the idea of all physical structures being alive sounded like something out of a new age bookstore. But not only do I think that Alexander justifies this claim; it started to make intuitive sense when I looked closely at my experience.
&gt;
&gt; When I first read _The Nature of Order_ I was living in an industrial neighborhood of San Francisco—the scale of the buildings and streets felt inhuman and everything was made of metal, glass, and concrete. I chose to leave. I moved into a 100+ year-old flat and the difference was immediate and visceral. The space felt like it was designed from experience rather than _ex nihilo_. The apartment was meant to be lived in, surrounded by public spaces where strangers could safely spend time outdoors together.
&gt;
&gt; If physical objects can have the quality of "aliveness" so too can information objects. Alexander's book is alive. Many of the software projects I've worked on have been cold fish. Keeping this quality in mind is an important part of my decision making. I want Urbit to be a living structure.

**Édouard (~fabled-faster)**

&gt; I enjoy telling people unfamiliar with Urbit and interface design with respect to Urbit, that the object of our work is essentially that of designing an environment "like a piece of paper".
&gt;
&gt; Consider how paper as a constrained environment is one that yet can bear nearly any visual expression imaginable—apart from containing drawings or human-made marks, paper can be used to display photographs, paper can be multiplexed to form lenticular holograms, paper can be folded into a crane, etc.
&gt;
&gt; The "sheet of paper and its resulting forms" I manifest as a design ideal here is what Alexander might refer to as a "semilattice". A mathematical term he co-opted to describe an ideal structural relationship between elements in a system, as opposed to a "tree", which is a top-down structural system that forces elements into rigid categorical constraints. [In his own words](https://www.patternlanguage.com/archive/cityisnotatree.html):
&gt;
&gt; &gt; _For the human mind, the tree is the easiest vehicle for complex thoughts. But the city is not, cannot and must not be a tree. The city is a receptacle for life. If the receptacle severs the overlap of the strands of life within it, because it is a tree, it will be like a bowl full of razor blades on edge, ready to cut up whatever is entrusted to it. In such a receptacle life will be cut to pieces. If we make cities which are trees, they will cut our life within to pieces._
&gt;
&gt; A city is a good ideal to maintain for the construction of a new internet and notion of personal computing, but I've tended towards my own interpretation of a piece of paper as a semilattice-embodying object due to its accessibility and ability to be imagined by anyone, designer or not. Our object of design is that of a receptacle of life, of deep expression, of multiplexed possibilities. When I imagine an Urbit in the not-so-distant future, I imagine it as a _method_ (to contrast against those who pin software's expression down to "tools" or "functions") by which I can become "whole" again in a digital context, in all my complexity.

Christopher Alexander wanted to collapse the distinction between those who live in buildings and those who design them. Urbit wants to do the same thing with software—in order to not produce ugliness, we should live in what we build. Although we have personal computers now, all of our data is housed in enormous warehouses that make the industrial computers of the 1950s look tiny. What we think of as “our information” actually belongs to someone else and, more often than not, is weaponized against us. Alexander’s moral imperative can be taken and applied to our digital structures. We need to become close with our software again.

Marketplaces have been around for centuries, but as they become digital, they have drastically expanded in scope and variety. Photo via Wikimedia: a Javanese market place in <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Javanese_market_place.jpg">Indonesia</a><p>Recently at Caribou Digital we have been working on several projects exploring youth employment, entrepreneurship, and digital financial inclusion in a changing global economy — an economy shaken by the pandemic and increasingly shaped by emerging digital technologies.</p><p>One of the biggest shifts in the economy has been the rise of digital platforms — digital marketplaces in everything from goods and services to ideas and software, or, in the parlance of the industry, everything from e-commerce and gig work to social media and app stores. Some of the most massive companies in the world are in the business of platforms, which now have literally billions of users. As such, millions of people depend on these platforms to make a&nbsp;living.</p><p>This post updates and refines our approach to “platform livelihoods,” an umbrella term (or lens) we use to connect the broad structural transformations associated with the rise of platforms to the experiences, challenges, and opportunities facing workers, entrepreneurs, and the self-employed. This approach intentionally draws on several elemental activities to join and cross-pollinate between distinct debates in the digital development literature about gig work, e-commerce, the sharing economy, and the attention economy, for while each of these new “economies” is different, they each have platformization at its&nbsp;core.</p><p>The content of this Medium post will also appear on our microsite <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com">www.platformlivelihoods.com</a>, which contains a literature review and details of several of our recent and ongoing projects. We shared an earlier version of this concept in a <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">post</a> called “The Platform Livelihoods Framework’’ in October 2020, written as part of our project with <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala </a>and with the support of the Mastercard Foundation on the <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/qydel2020/">Quality of Youth Digital Livelihoods</a> in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> A broad look at “platform livelihoods” <blockquote>In our view, platform livelihoods are the ways people earn a living by working, trading, renting, or engaging in digital marketplaces.</blockquote><p>It’s an intentionally broad concept, and many terms work together to create&nbsp;it:</p><p>The term “platform” is common in <a href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780062896322/the-business-of-platforms/">industry</a> and <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Platform+Capitalism-p-9781509504862">specialized</a> discussions about the digital economy. There are many typologies of platforms available, but at the broadest level, <a href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780062896322/the-business-of-platforms/">Cusumano, Gawer, and Yoffe</a> (2019) make a useful distinction between (a) innovation platforms — software (like an operating system or suite) that runs other third-party software and (b) marketplace platforms — digital hosts, usually businesses themselves, that connect buyers and sellers of goods, services, or labor in two-sided or multi-sided markets. Social media platforms can be understood as either (2a) a special kind of marketplace platform or as (c) a close cousin — monetizing attention to user-created or creative content via advertisements.</p><p>Platformization is powerful and increasingly common, but never neutral. With the platformization of almost every kind of market (including labor markets) comes new “logics” — new structures, rules, incentives, and pressures. Platformization makes new winners and losers, scrambles value chains, and alters age-old relationships among labor, capital, and the state. For the digital development discussion, we are more interested in marketplace and social media platforms, as shown in our approach’s emphasis on “digital marketplaces.”</p><p>“Livelihoods” draws on a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/095624789500700106">broader discussion</a> in the development literature. As a concept, it is broader, more fluid, and more flexible than “jobs” or even “work.” “Livelihoods” better encompasses part-time, casual, and informal work, and is sensitive to combinatory practices in which several activities and skills are necessary for survival. Rather than emphasizing a specific role or job title, livelihoods involve making a living as a set of strategies to combine assets, capabilities, labor, and social resources.</p><p>Here’s how “platforms” and “livelihoods” connect: when combined, they refer to more than gig work. The broad umbrella of “platform livelihoods” suggests that there are many ways to earn a living and many ways in which platforms are becoming involved. To convey this heterogeneity, we’ve settled on a view which focuses on a few elemental livelihood activities — on what people do — rather than on what platforms provide. These are working, selling, renting, and engaging.</p>  Working links most closely to “gig work” and is perhaps the most prominent and hotly debated example of platform livelihoods. Individuals rely on platforms to match their labor to compensation outside the contexts (and any protections) of employer-employee relationships.  Trading maps onto e-commerce and social commerce. Individuals or small enterprises offer products and services to customers via marketplace platforms and/or social media. Almost every microenterprise involves trading — wholesalers, retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and even artisans and artists can sell their products and services via platforms small and&nbsp;large.  Renting is the monetization of assets via a platform. Lending or leasing a tractor or truck by the hour or day, or offering a room of one’s house on Airbnb all fall under this kind of asset utilization, as does lending (renting) money on peer-to-peer loan platforms.  Engaging has, literally, captured the online world’s attention: Instagram influencers, YouTube and TikTok content creators, even affiliate marketers getting commissions for well-placed clickable ads. All of these can be seen as engaged in platform livelihoods, too. The key element distinguishing this platform livelihood activity from the others is that it involves at least three parties besides the platform: the creators, the audience, and the advertisers. Through a remarkable, though often problematic, combination of platform design, scale, algorithmic weighting, and (often) targeting data, the result is an “attention economy,” in which engagers can prosper by being compensated for bringing attention to content (and/or to the ads alongside that content).  <p>This view of “many livelihoods” touches almost every sector of the economy. Indeed, many familiar roles are actually combinations of these activities. Take, for example, the ride-hailing driver who owns their car, drives nine hours a day via two different platforms, and rents their vehicle to another driver in the evenings. Their efforts are better understood as a combination of renting (assets) and working (labor) rather than as the application of labor alone. In this view, it is best to avoid assuming that people are exclusively renters or traders or engagers; instead, many will combine these practices in distinct ways to pursue their distinct livelihoods.</p><p>We situate these activities “in” instead of “by,” “via,” or “for” platform marketplaces. These platforms aren’t merely tools that workers and sellers can use, but structures they must navigate. Nor are these individuals engaged in activities “for” the platforms as employees or agents; individuals and small firms operate without employer-employee contracts. For now, “in” best describes how individuals pursue livelihoods within the contexts (affordances and constraints) at least partially established by platforms.</p> Advantages of the platform livelihoods lens  The lens is broad, making it easier to see connections between different livelihoods <p>The breadth of “working, trading, renting, and engaging in digital marketplaces” is part of what makes the concept of platform livelihoods useful.</p><p>There are robust and ongoing policy conversations about platform workers on labor platforms (summarized, for example, in this recent <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/research/global-reports/weso/2021/WCMS_771749/lang--en/index.htm">ILO report</a>) and about platform sellers and e-commerce (summarized, for example, in this recent <a href="https://unctad.org/webflyer/digital-economy-report-2019">UNCTAD report</a>). But the literature and policy conversations about platform work and platform sales rarely seem connected, despite commonalities and overlaps in how platform logics change markets, and how power and prosperity is allocated within them. To be clear, we don’t want to challenge or replace the frames employed by these existing inquiries. Instead, we aim to complement and put them in dialogue, drawing new connections between&nbsp;them.</p><p>Meanwhile, economic developments, such as the mega-merger of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/gojek-and-tokopedia-merge-to-form-goto-group/">Gojek and Tokopedia</a> in Indonesia, mean that in some cases, workers, sellers, sharers, and creators are bound up together in the same platform ecosystems. <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/business-law-blog/blog/2017/04/e-scraper-and-e-monopsony">The</a> “<a href="https://bfaglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/BFA_FIBR_Nov8_WhitePaper_20171220.pdf">superplatform</a>” or “<a href="https://www.theweek.in/theweek/business/2021/05/20/super-apps-will-take-amazon-reliance-rivalry-to-next-level.html">super app</a>” presents a different environment for livelihoods, collapsing several economic sectors onto a singular interface with interconnected data about users accruing to the platform itself, and may require different policy responses than distinct, sector-specific platforms.</p> The lens allows assessments of people’s experiences. <p>Together with Qhala, we conducted a review of 75 primary research studies of platform workers, traders, renters, and engagers from throughout the majority world/emerging markets. We drew on frameworks from the <a href="http://decentwork.bilsbd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Decent-Work-Indicators.pdf">ILO</a>, <a href="http://hummedia.manchester.ac.uk/institutes/gdi/publications/workingpapers/di/di_wp71.pdf">Richard Heeks</a>, and <a href="https://www.juliezollmann.com/are-new-jobs-good.">Julie Zollmann and Catherine Wanjala</a>, coding studies to identify “<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/results-by-element/">twelve elements</a> — the kinds of experiences that individuals share and value when discussing their livelihoods with friends, family, and even <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">the occasional researcher</a>. They are a mix of economic, subjective, and broader human development experiences”.</p><p>These elements can prompt attention not only to earnings and access, but also to how the experience of platform livelihoods intersects with human development goals such as gender inclusion, social protection, and opportunities for advancement and fulfillment.</p>Figure 1: Twelve experience elements of platform livelihoods The lens helps count and compare roles and vocations <p>When compiling the literature review, we offered “a landscape of <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/results-by-livelihood-type/">nine illustrative types</a> of platform livelihood,” <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">noting</a> that “these are roles that individuals or small enterprises can fill, rather than ‘business models’ or the names of specific platforms.” Our argument remains that these nine types, while not comprehensive, “represent enough of the diversity in platform livelihoods to make two key distinctions. These types mix local and global (digital only) markets,” and “some of these roles are for individuals seeking work and offering their labor. Some of these roles are for small enterprises and even small farms, looking for new sales channels and new ways to connect with markets.”</p><p>But this map is only one of many we could make to list, identify, and contrast different kinds of platform livelihoods. Notice the switch in the illustrative map from elemental activities (working, trading, renting, engaging, etc.) to more specific roles, industry sectors, and types. These labels better approximate how we might count and differentiate among those with and those without platform livelihoods.</p>Figure 2: Nine illustrative platform livelihood types<p>Further complicating this enumeration are the ways in which people fractionally mix livelihood activities. If a person works as a teacher during the week and a freelancer via a platform on the weekend, is that person a platform worker? If a restaurant relies on delivery platforms for 30% of its sales, is that business a platform trader? What if the same business had to stop in-person dining during the pandemic, and was getting 90% of sales through delivery platforms? What if that business uses three different delivery platforms, deriving fractional earnings from each? As we detailed <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/fractional-work/">in our literature review</a>, several studies point to how platforms may play a partial rather than exclusive role in many people’s livelihoods.</p><p>Similarly, sometimes seemingly individual accounts are actually “<a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/214203/1/169088360X.pdf">hidden MSEs</a>” or otherwise represent <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/hidden-hierarchies/">hidden hierarchies</a>. Freelancers can maintain a single profile with high ratings, and then subcontract work. Airbnb hosts may employ a housekeeper. Small online retail shops may have an assistant or two. Are these other workers, each more or less invisible to the buyers and the platforms themselves, pursuing platform livelihoods as&nbsp;well?</p><p>Indeed, given how broad these activities are, and how they govern the variety of products and services digital giants like Facebook and Google provide, it can be difficult not to classify anything done for work digitally as a platform livelihood. For example, people can learn their crafts via watching YouTube videos or run an entire business on a Google suite, but these activities don’t involve directly matching buyers and sellers. We think it is best to restrict platform livelihoods to the activities that directly involve exchanges of value — transactions — between buyers and sellers. That is likely how the platforms see their role — they don’t always expect a 100% share of anyone’s livelihood, but they do seek to provide the infrastructure to facilitate as many transactions as they can, to generate revenue through advertisements, transaction fees, subscriptions, etc.</p><p>That said, we acknowledge that there are other elements of people’s livelihoods that aren’t easily understood as transactions at all — for example, cultivating family support and connections, gifting instead of exchanging, supporting instead of lending — that are also core parts of social life, and are increasingly also mediated by platforms, whether via mobile money like MPESA, social sites like Facebook, or purpose-built sites like GoFundMe. (For recent work in this space see Sibel Kusimba’s <a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=31200">Reimagining Money</a>). We would be interested in exploring and discussing whether these behaviors might be better considered a fifth elemental livelihood activity.</p><p>Regardless, this discussion of specific vocations or livelihood types underscores how any efforts to enumerate those involved in platform livelihoods will face definitional challenges — tough decisions of where to draw the lines between platform livelihoods, other digital livelihoods, and livelihoods more broadly. On the other hand, this lens helps bridge the arbitrary gap between an individual worker and a small enterprise, and helps us be sensitive to how platform livelihoods often coexist with fractional and/or non-digital ways of earning a&nbsp;living.</p><p>Our <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">assessment</a> in late 2020 was that “the early research and policy literature has been concentrated in platform work, especially ride-hailing, freelancing, and microwork, but in the longer run, platform sales [trading] (whether via marketplaces, social commerce, or search and discovery) may end up altering the livelihoods of a greater number of people around the world.” We’re excited to test this hypothesis in Indonesia. With the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, <a href="https://dfslab.net/?preview_id=2&amp;preview_nonce=56eb6290fc&amp;preview=true">DFS Lab</a>, and <a href="https://riseindonesia.org/">Rise Indonesia</a>, we will be fielding a study in 2021–22 that, among other things, will estimate the proportion of people nationwide involved with platform livelihoods, capturing platform working, trading, renting, and engaging in the same study, perhaps for the first&nbsp;time.</p> The lens allows for deeper dives into new digital practices <p>A recent <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-race-to-digitize-commerce-in-sub-saharan-africa-252b2f977c86">essay</a> by our colleague Bryan Pon helpfully contrasts classic platform e-commerce, where platform hosts set the rules on dedicated e-commerce sites, and bottom-up, appropriated social commerce, where individuals use more flexible social media platforms to sell goods and services. (There is significant attention to this segment among the financial inclusion community, for example, by <a href="https://www.womensworldbanking.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2019_Social_Commerce_Report.pdf">Women’s World Banking</a> and by CGAP, which calls these practices <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/hiding-plain-site-informal-e-commerce-among-women-asia">informal e-commerce</a>.) We see social commerce as a channel or a modality: a kind of platform livelihood activity that can be applied to working (job-seeking), trading (selling), renting (asset-sharing), and, in the case of social media influencers, engaging.</p><p>Don’t forget maps, searchers, reviews, and ads. Paid for the click, rewarded for the link, punished by a bad review — people are cultivating their skills to navigate the platformed dynamics of algorithms. Engagers get paid for clicks, traders and renters promote their brand/business identity, “and as we noted in the <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-3258b05aa83d">previous post</a>, there is often (still) search and discovery. Millions of small businesses pay for advertising on Facebook and Google and other social media platforms. Many work to refine how their businesses appear on maps, review sites, or other digital databases and apps. These activities, too, support platform livelihoods.”</p><p>This wide range of activities points to the complexity and content dependency of digital literacies as craft. For example, our colleague Jessica Osborn shared a great illustration of this in a debrief of a 2019 <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/live-learning/">Caribou Digital Live Learning</a> visit in China; the team met with several farmers and manufacturers who have had to hire social media managers to keep up with the demands of social commerce.</p>Figure 3: Farmers in China describing their social media and e-commerce initiatives<p>But for those without the wherewithal to hire social media specialists, the “digital literacies” or <a href="https://mse.financedigitalafrica.org/2019/01/platform-practices/">platform practices</a> demanded of a small business may be as diverse as the platform landscape itself — the success of a even a tiny microenterprise may increasingly depend on a mix of placing ads and appearing in searches, on conducting authentic social commerce, and on navigating formal digital marketplaces. To link back to the “livelihoods” perspective, this represents a set of new skills and strategies that gig workers, the self-employed, and entrepreneurs must all acquire, refine, and deploy in ways that earn them a living in platformed markets.</p> Conclusion <p>There are many organizations and researchers involved in studying and building policy around the activities this post calls “platform livelihoods.” The community of practice is broad, as are its perspectives and&nbsp;frames.</p><p>Our goal with the lens of “platform livelihoods” isn’t to refute or diminish the existing frames and debates about gig work, e-commerce, or any other element of an increasingly platformed economy, but rather to bring together disparate parts of this arena, to spark conversations and share knowledge. Therefore, we hope the concept is useful to&nbsp;you.</p><p>Please reach out to us with questions and suggestions for the next revision, and watch for new studies on youth livelihoods, gender, platform agriculture in Kenya, and the quantitative Indonesia research to be posted to our website soon.

The world is in the midst of a shift in how markets function, with implications beyond the digital development discussion. It is our hope that this lens, and the contrasts and commonalities it may reveal, will inform conversations and efforts to make the digital economy more inclusive.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/platform-livelihoods-working-trading-renting-and-engaging-in-digital-marketplaces-b144ffcc1141">Platform Livelihoods: Working, trading, renting, and engaging in digital marketplaces</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/fisher">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>This week, Microsoft made official its agreement to acquire Threat Intelligence vendor RiskIQ in a deal rumoured to be worth around $500m. It is not an unusual event; Microsoft has absorbed five businesses already in 2021, and usually it is to acquire a discrete technology it deems useful or sometimes to push into emerging markets.</p>
<p>This latest acquisition falls into both camps. While Threat Intelligence is not an emerging in the normal sense, it has acquired a new importance in the last 18 months as global cyber-attacks reached a new level of intensity. The fact this has run in parallel with the global epidemic is no coincidence – criminal gangs thrive on vulnerability.&nbsp; In this case it has also thrived on the sudden switch to remote working and the opening up of millions more internet facing endpoints.</p>
 Why make the acquisition now? 
<p>As the world’s largest supplier of business software, Microsoft will be fully aware of the threat to its customers from this current wave of ransomware; more sophisticated and aggressive than previously recorded. Governments around the globe have now listed ransomware as a systemic threat to national security and economic wellbeing. It is deadly serious.</p>
<p>Ransomware attacks have been successful in part because of the openness of today’s IT infrastructures. But business needs openness and the complexity of applications, architectures, IoT connectors, digital identities running across multiple clouds and hybrid cloud environments. This is a positive development as it means that organizations are embracing leading edge technologies to embrace collaborative working, automation, and deliver innovation.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been working to ensure that its platforms are compatible with the new openness and remote working, and takes security seriously. It makes sense to acquire a Threat Intelligence capability, a move that is commercially driven as much as as adding capability that will help its customer base defend against ransomware and other forms of cyber-attack.</p>
 What is RiskIQ? 
<p>RiskIQ is among several leading Threat Intelligence companies that have emerged in the last decade; other well know names include FireEye, InfoBlox, LookinGlass, IntSights and Recorded Future. All offer analysis and interpretation of global threat traffic and enable advance warning of possible attacks, adding an extra layer of cyber defence for organizations. Key to this is tracking of internet facing endpoints targeted by cyber criminals.</p>
<p>RiskIQ was a good fit in that it already had close ties with Microsoft through connectors and support for Azure Sentinel SIEM – it is also relatively cheap if the $500m purchase price is accurate. The RiskIQ mission statement of “safely bringing people together, connecting people across the world” might sound a little trite but it’s a laudable ambition and chimes well with Microsoft’s own goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft already had an endpoint protection play with 365 Defender, but RiskIQ offers much more than monitoring activity at endpoints and applications. RiskIQ helps customers discover and assess the security of their entire enterprise attack surface through connections in the cloud, AWS, other clouds, on-premises, and from the supply chain. Its <a href="https://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/internet-intelligence-graph/" title="Internet Intelligence Graph">Internet Intelligence Graph</a> deploys “virtual users" that simulate human-web interactions to map relationships between internet-exposed infrastructure worldwide.</p>
 What does the acquisition mean for Microsoft customers? 
<p>Several Microsoft customers will already use a Threat Intelligence platform from one of the existing vendors but for those that do not, and particularly for SMBs the integration of RiskIQ technology and intelligence gathering into O365, Azure, Active Directory, Teams etc. is something to be welcomed. Microsoft has a good record on integration, and this should be quickly offered as part of the Microsoft universe to all customer levels. For Microsoft it means a great new marketing tool to convince customers that it has their back in the fight against ransomware, now and in the future. Stopping ransomware by plotting its path and patterns before it can hit home is a great defensive move – once Ransomware is in and activated, it’s pretty much game over as we are seeing across the world.</p>
 Will it be a success? 
<p>In short, yes. Integrating RiskIQ across the Microsoft stack will add undoubted cyber security value for its customer base. Even better for Microsoft it will allow them to offer a robust and trusted integrated Threat Intelligence platform in competition with RiskIQ’s former competitors. More worrying for them, the Redmond software giant can easily afford to offer Threat Intelligence as integral part of its overall security marketing strategy for O365 and beyond, in the name of keeping the Internet safe for business. Quite an option to have.</p>

Managing the granting and revoking of access is paramount to enabling effective risk management. Enforcing distinct access control requires an interconnected access management system that aligns with use case policies, regulations and commercial models.




 




As we move towards a digitally connected everything, policies and risk management is becoming increasingly more complex. What we used to do for government and enterprise, we will soon be doing for households as people contend with smart homes, cars, appliances, wearables and the range of identities involved.




 




Join this KCLive event to explore the symbiotic relationship between security and risk. Thought leaders and senior practitioners come together to discuss access management strategies that are the need-of-the-hour to kick-start the digital transformation journey.




 





 Everything will be tokenized 




Our CEO &amp; Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> will be joining the agenda to discuss what access and risk means in a world where  “everything will be tokenized”.




 




We’re on track towards a world where everything that can be, will be tokenized. Tokenization plays a critical part in enabling more equitable value creation for people, organisations and things. Providing the means to issue and store value, trace provenance, and most importantly achieve consensus to instantly trust.




 




However, in order for this tokenized world to emerge we first need the infrastructure for people and their digital twins to participate in equitable and fair ways. This will include digital identity, verifiable credentials and payments.




 




Over the past year <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> has been working on the increasing connections between enterprise and the decentralized world. This session will feature some of the use-cases, practical steps, insights and learning from along the way, including case studies from <a href="https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au">eftpos</a> and <a href="https://hedera.com">Hedera Hasghgraph</a>.




 




You can join this free virtual event is on Wednesday, July 21 2021 at 2PM CEST.

We look forward to seeing you and exploring how we can secure and manage the risk in this exciting new world!

But what is KYC verification, exactly? How has it changed for the modern landscape? Is KYC the same in 2021 as it was in 2020? These are all good questions to be asking, since it’s extremely important to stay on top of these...</p>

 Spherity leads the GAIA-X Identity and Trust group to accelerate the Energy Transition in&nbsp;Europe  Spherity supports the interoperability and portability of data for a future data exchange model in the European energy&nbsp;market <p><a href="https://www.data-infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html">GAIA-X</a> is a project initiated by Europe for Europe and beyond. GAIA-X is creating a proposal for the next generation of a European data infrastructure: a secure, federated system that meets the highest standards of digital sovereignty while promoting innovation.</p>As part of GAIA-X, Spherity supports a secure data infrastructure for the energy industry. Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@sigmund?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sigmund</a><p>The “energy data-X” consortium has been qualified as one of the 16 winning consortia for the next step in the GAIA-X funding competition. The core principle of the consortium is to build a secure data space for the energy industry that enables secure and sovereign data use and establishes a foundation for innovative business models. Spherity leads the Identity and Trust group to build an infrastructure for a future data exchange model in the European energy market. Establishing a large and comprehensive energy data space enables interoperability and portability of data and data-driven applications within and across various&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>The “energy data-x” project aims to build a prototype data space for the energy industry within the European Energy and Climate Policy frame. This enables secure and sovereign data usage while enabling data-based business models for market partners. Four focal points will be central within the project in the upcoming&nbsp;years:</p>  AI technologies will be used to utilize data for grid operation processes such as power and load flow forecasts.  Algorithms for preventive maintenance and plant availability forecasts will be optimized based on plant and operating data.  Smart meter gateways are being further developed at the endpoints of the energy system to communicate sensor data as an edge device in a star-shaped manner in the GAIA-X data&nbsp;space.  New approaches to the realization of market communication should enable more time synchronization, efficiency, and transparency.  <p>The project consists of 15 strong energy ecosystem partners contributing to data-driven innovations that also support European energy and climate policy goals.

			 Ernane Luis is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>Brazilian guy with a lot of stamps in the passport, as well as a Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in producing Ethereum DApps. I also have a Master’s degree in Computer Science. I am a highly motivated and efficient professional with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>During the process of writing my Master’s thesis, I realized my passion for blockchain, which led me to search for blockchain projects and eventually brought me to work at Tokeny.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>When I started working at Tokeny, the product was in its early stages, and that was the challenge I was looking for. Working on the product, from inception to delivery in production, was a great sense of accomplishment. My day-to-day work goes from reviewing code, to actual development, to integrating microservices, to fixing bugs. In the end, we are producing creative and effective customer solutions by aligning technology goals with business goals.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Freedom. Having lived and visited more than 35 countries, I have gained a taste of freedom, and that’s what I will search for, to live a life as free as possible. And blockchain technology just fits perfectly for this lifestyle. So I am very happy to be part of the revolution of the internet and decentralized technology.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>People on this planet could live a life that fulfills their sense of freedom. There, people could get off their own hamster wheel forever. That’s a very personal sensation, but we all share as humans.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Nothing. I believe in decentralization and that chaos is necessary to create order. I may by making things worse. A single mind making decisions for all humans is a bad idea. We all have different needs and what is good for me might not be good for you. I rather see mankind make progress based on their mistakes.</p>

<p>In the 17th century, the Dutch Republic (present day Netherlands) was one of the world’s leading economies. The country ranked among the top financial powerhouses of the day, boasting of the highest per capita income in the entire world from about 120 years, from 1600 to 1720. (The Dutch financial system was, in fact, the most advanced of its time.) Then, circa 1630, something odd happened.</p>

 Droits et travers en matière de propriété&nbsp;: Micro-traités avec la&nbsp;Terre  Repenser nos responsabilités envers la nature grâce à l’intendance des&nbsp;terres <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/property-rights-property-wrongs-micro-treaties-with-the-earth-9b1ca44b4df">[AN ENGLISH VERSION OF THIS TEXT IS AVAILABLE HERE</a></p> Le droit vivant sur une planète vivante — préface de John&nbsp;Borrows <blockquote>Nous devons redonner de la vigueur à nos relations avec la&nbsp;terre.</blockquote><blockquote>Sur la ferme où j’ai grandi, j’ai appris que nous dépendions du monde naturel. Le sol, les semences, l’enneigement, la pluie, la chaleur, les insectes, les oiseaux et une centaine d’autres éléments influaient sur la façon dont les plantes poussaient et les animaux se développaient, ainsi que sur notre mode de&nbsp;vie.</blockquote><blockquote>Les expériences et les enseignements de mes grands-parents sur la réserve n’ont fait que renforcer cette notion. Comme dans d’autres systèmes autochtones, le savoir anishinaabe était alors transmis d’une génération à l’autre pour nous aider à bien vivre. Mes grands-parents nous ont appris que les poissons, les cerfs, les grenouilles, les loutres, les tortues, les lapins, les herbes médicinales, la nourriture et la santé humaine sont inextricablement liés dans une toile complexe, essentielle au maintien de la&nbsp;vie.</blockquote><blockquote>Mon expérience sur la ferme et la réserve m’ont amené à comprendre que nos efforts personnels sont indispensables pour encourager et prendre soin de ces relations. Nous avons un rôle actif à jouer pour favoriser des environnements sains.</blockquote><blockquote>Les renseignements dans la publication ci-dessous nous aident à prendre conscience des travaux qui nous attendent.</blockquote><blockquote>Les codes profonds nécessaires au maintien de la vie demeurent bien présents dans la terre et nous pouvons les intégrer dans nos vies contemporaines. Nos relations juridiques peuvent accommoder les changements qui doivent être apportés pour retrouver une vie riche et diverse sur le plan écologique.</blockquote><blockquote>Mais nous devons agir maintenant. La Terre souffre de notre abus et de notre négligence. La souffrance que nous vivons en tant qu’êtres humains vient de notre échec à vivre selon les leçons apprises par nos ancêtres dans de nombreuses régions du monde. En effet, il est impossible pour nous d’agir comme si nous ne faisions pas partie du monde&nbsp;naturel.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3316">John Borrows<br> </a>Chaire de recherche du Canada sur le droit autochtone <br> <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/law/index.php">Faculté de droit de l’Université de&nbsp;Victoria</a></blockquote> S’autodétruire pour&nbsp;vivre <p>Les nombreuses crises qui marquent notre époque, surtout celles liées au climat et au logement, renvoient à un problème plus profond, celui d’avoir rompu notre lien avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>De nos jours, nous vivons tous selon des paradigmes d’autodestruction, que nous soyons Autochtones ou non. Les peuples autochtones ont été systématiquement marginalisés et ont vécu de grandes souffrances en raison du colonialisme et de la Loi sur les Indiens. Et nos façons d’habiter génèrent aujourd’hui des écocides et alimente un système socio-économique de plus en plus gourmand et inégal — et ce tant pour les autochtones que les non autochtones.</p><p>Bien des gens s’entendent pour dire que la COVID-19 ne représente que la pointe de l’iceberg. Alors que la perte d’habitats et de biodiversité prend de l’ampleur partout sur la planète, l’apparition du coronavirus pourrait marquer le début de pandémies de masse répétées. L’émergence de tels virus étant peut-être l’exemple le plus puissant de cette autodestruction (qui atteint maintenant nos&nbsp;corps).</p><p>Il est donc impératif de repenser nos lois et systèmes de gouvernance afin de transformer les liens systémiques et spirituels que nous entretenons avec la terre et la nature. Et nous avons besoin les uns des autres pour y&nbsp;arriver.</p><p>La présente publication repose sur plusieurs ateliers et conversations que nous avons eus avec des leaders autochtones à travers le Canada au cours des deux dernières années. Elle se penche sur la façon de repenser les droits (et responsabilités) de propriété et la protection de l’environnement à la croisée des avenirs civique et autochtone.</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;Du point de vue autochtone, la réconciliation entre les Canadiennes et les Canadiens autochtones et non autochtones exige aussi une réconciliation avec le monde naturel. Si les êtres humains règlent les problèmes qu’il y a entre eux, mais qu’ils continuent à détruire le monde naturel, alors la réconciliation demeurera inachevée.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― Honorer la vérité, réconcilier pour l’avenir&nbsp;: sommaire du rapport final de la Commission de vérité et réconciliation du Canada,&nbsp;2015</blockquote> Les lois sont chargées d’histoire&nbsp;: la relation entre le monde vécu et la&nbsp;loi <p>Les outils que nous avons inventés afin de rendre possible la ‘possession’ de la planète à travers la propriété privée racontent une histoire sur notre vision du monde et nos valeurs. Au fil des époques et dans différentes cultures, des traditions juridiques diverses ont été instaurées afin de solidifier cette vision, mais elle raconte toujours cette version originale d’un rapport au monde, de la place de l’être humain au sein de la nature, et de notre relation (et division) avec l‘environnement qui nous&nbsp;entoure.</p><p>Les traditions juridiques ainsi que les lois ou constitutions qu’elles inspirent ne sont pas une source de vérité originelle. Elles ne sont pas divines. Comme le mentionne John Borrows dans son ouvrage <a href="https://utorontopress.com/ca/law-s-indigenous-ethics-1">Law’s Indigenous Ethics</a>, nous ne devrions pas ignorer les demandes «&nbsp;initiales&nbsp;» des lois. Mieux comprendre «&nbsp;l’origine&nbsp;» de nos cadres législatifs permet alors de saisir les visions du monde qu’ils supportent et si elles sont toujours appropriées aujourd’hui.</p><p>Il est donc important de reconnaître et rendre explicite les histoires, les mondes vécus et les ordres constitutionnels divers qui sous-tendent les perspectives occidentales et autochtones.</p> La loi raconte l’histoire d’un monde&nbsp;vécu. <p>Lorsqu’il est question de réconciliation, le dialogue entre la résurgence autochtone et la décentralisation des perspectives occidentales doit reconnaître l’existence de mondes vécus radicalement différents. Ce dialogue demeurera ainsi ouvert et&nbsp;continu.</p><p>À la manière du <a href="https://www.onondaganation.org/culture/wampum/two-row-wampum-belt-guswenta/">Traité de la ceinture wampum à deux rangs</a> des Haudenosaunee, nous devons viser une compréhension mutuelle, sans intervenir ou forcer une réconciliation. Nous devons laisser place à l’émergence d’avenirs civiques et autochtones distincts, et d’autres&nbsp;communs.</p> Analyse de la situation actuelle&nbsp;: qu’y a-t-il derrière les lois occidentales lorsqu’il est question de la&nbsp;terre? <p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux comme la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» ou le droit civil puisent leurs racines dans le libéralisme. Ce sont les penseurs des Lumières, notamment Thomas Hobbes, John Locke et Jean-Jacques Rousseau, qui en ont établi les fondements philosophiques. L’origine de la pensée libérale prône que la «&nbsp;loi&nbsp;» doit défendre la liberté, le consentement et l’égalité.</p><p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux reposent sur un assemblage de concepts fondamentaux qui dictent une relation précise avec le monde qui nous entoure&nbsp;:</p>  Si vous ne détenez pas de droits, vous êtes&nbsp;détenu.  La propriété s’exprime par des ententes (écrites) entre des êtres humains souverains et autonomes.  La Terre est «&nbsp;la toile de fond devant laquelle les êtres humains vivent au fil de l’histoire.&nbsp;» (Mills,&nbsp;2016)   Une terre passive&nbsp;: la vision occidentale par défaut de la&nbsp;nature <p>Les différents outils législatifs qui s’intéressent au monde naturel tentent surtout d’encadrer des pratiques humaines, alternant entre protection et exploitation. Pensons par exemple aux multiples lois et règlements associés aux industries extractives, agricoles ou touristiques.</p><p>En encadrant des pratiques d’extraction telles que le minage, la fracturation hydraulique et la pollution, l’ensemble de lois environnementales actuel n’est pas réellement conçu pour protéger la nature. Il vise plutôt à réglementer l’utilisation et l’abus de la nature par les êtres&nbsp;humains.</p><p>Dans le meilleur des cas, nos lois défendent une nature à «&nbsp;isoler&nbsp;», alors que dans le pire des cas, elles stipulent les règles d’exploitation d’une nature à «&nbsp;utiliser&nbsp;»</p><p>L’ensemble de nos lois définissent donc la nature comme passive, silencieuse et&nbsp;fragile.</p> Une terre abstraite&nbsp;: la vision occidentale par défaut de la propriété <p>Tant la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» que le droit civil encadrent la propriété comme un ensemble de droits, plutôt que de responsabilités. Des terres sont détenues et des titres de propriété sont transférés d’une personne à l’autre. Il s’agit d’une entente entre personnes.</p><p>La terre est perçue comme étant abstraite et dénudée de sens physique. Elle est absente de l’entente légale et donc de la relation.</p> La terre&nbsp;: une histoire de colonisation <p>La propriété privée, comme mécanisme légal et contractuel, a été et demeure un instrument important de colonisation. Le pouvoir colonial de la propriété privée agit comme un moyen de dépossession et comme un mécanisme menant à la disparition des systèmes politiques et juridiques autochtones.</p><p>L’architecture profonde de nos systèmes vient cristalliser les dynamiques de pouvoir. Faire disparaître la colonisation du cœur même de nos systèmes signifie entre autres de redonner une voix à la terre dans nos instruments juridiques et contractuels.</p><p>Reconnaître le fait que la terre et la nature ne sont pas que des toiles de fond, mais bien des acteurs présents qui “parlent”, vient déstabiliser la primauté de l’être humain, un concept au centre de la pensée libérale occidentale. En d’autres mots, cela remet en question les prémisses de base du monde créé par la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» et le droit&nbsp;civil.</p><p>Les systèmes constitutionnels libéraux parviendraient-ils même à survivre à une relation où la nature est considérée comme&nbsp;active?</p><p>À ce moment de notre Histoire, celui de la crise climatique, nous n’avons pas d’autre choix que de découvrir la réponse à cette interrogation.</p><blockquote>Autant d’arpents de terre qu’un homme peut labourer, semer, cultiver, et dont il peut consommer les fruits pour son entretien, autant lui appartient-il en propre. Par son travail, il rend ce bien-là son bien particulier, et le distingue de ce qui est commun à tous. […] Au commencement, tout le monde était comme une Amérique, et même beaucoup plus dans l’état que je viens de supposer que n’est aujourd’hui cette partie de la terre nouvellement découverte. Car alors on ne savait nulle part ce que c’était qu’argent monnayé.</blockquote><blockquote>― John Locke, Deux traités sur le gouvernement, 1689</blockquote><blockquote>«&nbsp;Le but premier du Gouvernement devrait être de donner à tous les Indiens leur propriété individuelle, et ce, dès que possible.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― Lettre du lieutenant-gouverneur et intendant des affaires indiennes, 11 novembre&nbsp;1878</blockquote> Décentraliser la vision occidentale par défaut/Faire le ménage de notre&nbsp;maison <p>Les systèmes juridiques occidentaux incluent déjà des voies pouvant mener à une relation plus dynamique avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>En suivant celles-ci, les mondes juridiques occidental et autochtone pourraient amorcer un dialogue productif.</p><p>Pluralisme juridique</p><p>Les ordres juridiques libéraux du monde occidental peuvent donner lieu à un pluralisme juridique. L’interaction du droit civil (au Québec) et de la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;» (dans le reste du Canada) en est un bon exemple. Toutefois, il faut faire preuve de grande prudence au moment de réfléchir à la façon dont la loi des colonisateurs peut interagir avec les ordres juridiques autochtones, surtout en ce qui concerne la relation à la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>Incommensurabilité juridique</p><p>Les ordres juridiques libéraux du monde occidental peuvent donner lieu à un pluralisme juridique authentique avec des systèmes qui partagent un cadre constitutionnel commun. Toutefois, il est aussi possible que cela crée une incommensurabilité juridique (c’est-à-dire une incompatibilité) entre les lois des colonisateurs et les divers ordres juridiques autochtones, puisqu’ils émanent de familles constitutionnelles et, au bout du compte, de visions du monde radicalement différentes.</p><p>En tentant de désacraliser les points de vue juridiques occidentaux et d’explorer les nouvelles relations avec la terre qui pourraient en découler, nous devons mettre de côté nos attentes relativement à ce à quoi pourrait ressembler le dialogue entre les ordres juridiques autochtones et un cadre juridique occidental qui entre davantage en relation avec ces derniers.</p><p>Dit autrement, la croisée des avenirs civique et autochtone pourrait ne pas renvoyer à une enquête autonome, mais plutôt à une énigme sans&nbsp;fin.</p> Une autre relation avec la&nbsp;nature <p>L’émergence des Droits de la nature propose une transformation de nos relations avec la nature dans l’ordre légal&nbsp;actuel.</p><p>Cette approche souhaite conférer une identité individuelle juridique à la nature. En donnant à cette dernière un statut juridique actif et autonome, elle constitue un modèle de loi plus écocentrique qui augmente considérablement la présence de la terre dans notre monde juridique. À cet égard, les Droits de la nature constituent une avancée bien réelle dans la tentative de décentraliser les visions juridiques par défaut du monde occidental.</p><p>Cependant, la nature demeure prise dans un discours de droits qui émane du concept que nous pouvons choisir de conclure une entente légale avec elle. À ce titre, la vision par défaut de l’Occident reste bien&nbsp;vivante.</p><p>L’approche des Droits de la nature souligne également le côté artificiel du concept de cadastres conçu par les êtres humains, puisque les frontières des écosystèmes sont insaisissables&nbsp;: où commence et finit la rivière à qui on a accordé une identité individuelle juridique?</p><p>Comme ces droits doivent néanmoins être portés par des êtres humains qui agissent comme défenseurs, il est possible de se demander si cela pourrait avoir une incidence sur le taux de décès des personnes qui se portent déjà à la défense de l’environnement contre des forces économiques pouvant être brutales. En effet, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20190730-more-160-land-defenders-murdered-2018-watchdog">160 personnes land defenders ont été tuées en 2018</a>, une réalité qui n’est qu’une des conséquences visibles des gestes abusifs posés partout dans le monde à l’endroit de ceux et celles qui défendent leurs terres pour le bien de leur communauté et des générations futures&nbsp;: criminalisation, harcèlement, etc.</p>Quelques exemples de Droits de la&nbsp;nature<p>Des Droits de la nature n’ont été accordés pour l’instant qu’à de vastes ensembles. Mais que se passerait-il si nous adoptions une approche micromassive pour instaurer des Droits de la nature, c’est à dire par une mobilisation massive autour de plus petits terrains?</p> Une autre relation avec la propriété <p>Les fiducies foncières communautaires représentent une solution de rechange à la propriété. L’entité juridique prend la forme d’un organisme sans but lucratif qui administre la terre en vertu d’une fiducie perpétuelle afin qu’elle puisse être utilisée en permanence par une communauté.</p><p>Quelques observations&nbsp;:</p>  La terre est réellement présente au sein d’une fiducie foncière communautaire. Il s’agit d’une entente de personne à personne à lieu. Nous y trouvons donc les traces d’un mécanisme contractuel à acteurs et actrices multiples.  Au-delà des droits, il y a une responsabilité envers la préservation et le caractère abordable de la terre à perpétuité.  La terre est présente dans l’entente et les êtres humains ont une responsabilité d’intendance envers celle-ci.  La terre demeure perçue comme quelque chose qui peut être détenu grâce à des ententes&nbsp;écrites.  <p>En tenant compte de ces observations&nbsp;…</p><p>Que se passerait-il si nous donnions une présence active encore plus grande à la terre? Nos mécanismes contractuels de propriété seraient-ils toujours pertinents?</p><p>Que se passerait-il si nous ajoutions des responsabilités envers, notamment, les autres espèces présentes sur ces&nbsp;terres?</p> Qu’est-ce que la propriété de toute façon?&nbsp;: au-delà de l’illusion des droits&nbsp;absolus <p>Les droits de propriété ne sont pas&nbsp;absolus.</p><p>Au Canada, les droits de propriété sont sous compétence provinciale. Ils ont délibérément été exclus de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés (Partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982), ce qui veut dire qu’ils ne bénéficient d’aucune protection constitutionnelle.</p><p>Plus important encore, malgré des histoires largement répandues sur le plan culturel, les droits de propriété ne sont pas absolus. Ils existent conjointement avec d’autres lois et mécanismes, et sont limités par leurs interactions avec ces derniers.</p><p>En d’autres mots, la propriété n’est pas qu’un ensemble de droits, elle est déjà aussi, en théorie, un ensemble de responsabilités&nbsp;: sur les plans municipal, provincial, fédéral, constitutionnel, international et autochtone.</p> Que signifient les titres ancestraux autochtones pour la propriété privée? <p>Qu’est-ce qu’un titre ancestral autochtone?</p>  Une doctrine (constitutionnelle) de la «&nbsp;common law&nbsp;».  Le paragraphe 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 reconnaît et confirme les droits ancestraux, sans toutefois définir ou créer de droits autochtones.  Sui generis&nbsp;: c’est un droit inhérent qui découle des systèmes légaux, sociaux et politiques passés ou présents qui maintient une relation avec les terres ancestrales (avant la colonisation).  Il est «&nbsp;reconnu&nbsp;» et non «&nbsp;accordé&nbsp;» (c’est-à-dire qu’il n’est ni défini par le système juridique colonial ni un produit de celui-ci).  Un ensemble de jurisprudence (voir Calder, Delgamuukw-Gisdayway, Campbell, Haida, Mikesew Cree ou Tsilhqot’in) a été produit pour interpréter la nature et l’étendue de ces&nbsp;droits.  C’est l’antithèse de la Loi sur les&nbsp;Indiens.  <p>Ce que la jurisprudence récente peut nous apprendre sur la propriété privée</p><p>La Nation Tsilhqot’in c. la Colombie-Britannique (2014) a obtenu une déclaration attestant que «&nbsp;le titre ancestral confère des droits de propriété semblables à ceux associés à la propriété en fief simple, y compris le droit de déterminer l’utilisation des terres, le droit de jouissance et d’occupation des terres, le droit de posséder les terres, le droit aux avantages économiques que procurent les terres et le droit d’utiliser et de gérer les terres de manière proactive&nbsp;». (Nation Tsilhqot’in, jugement de la Cour Suprême, paragraphe 73.)</p><p>L’ensemble croissant de jurisprudence sur la reconnaissance et la définition des titres ancestraux en vertu du paragraphe 35 (un droit protégé par la Constitution) permet d’avancer vers un point déterminant où les titres ancestraux autochtones et les droits de propriété privée pourraient se croiser, et où les premiers pourraient venir limiter les&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>La question qui suit pourrait alors se poser&nbsp;…</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;Les titres ancestraux autochtones viendront-ils évincer des intérêts bénéficiaires privés relatifs à la terre, ou les terres privées viendront-elles empêcher que des titres ancestraux autochtones soient attribués à ces terres?&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>- John Borrows,&nbsp;2015</blockquote><p>Comme tels, les titres ancestraux autochtones sont une «&nbsp;coquille vide&nbsp;». Dans le paragraphe 35, les ordres juridiques autochtones donnent du contenu et une signification aux titres ancestraux.</p><p>Il existe plus d’une centaine d’ordres juridiques autochtones différentes au Canada qui ont ou qui auront quelque chose à dire sur la «&nbsp;propriété privée&nbsp;», ainsi que sur la relation qu’entretiennent les êtres humains avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><p>Une plus grande reconnaissance des titres ancestraux au Canada combinée à la résurgence des ordres juridiques autochtones pourraient bien venir transformer ces «&nbsp;coquilles vides&nbsp;» en trous de vers légaux (autrement dit: des raccourcis entre deux univers légaux parallèles).</p>  Parce que la jurisprudence autochtone canadienne nous y mènera un jour ou&nbsp;l’autre…  Parce que le système juridique occidental dominant donne lieu à des paradigmes d’autodestruction…  Et, plus important encore, parce que nous avons une responsabilité en matière de réparation et de réconciliation…  <p>Nous devons renouer notre relation (juridique) avec la&nbsp;terre.</p><a href="https://medium.com/cities-for-people/civic-indigenous-7-0-ec3a9104901b">7 points of convergence: A compass for making&nbsp;kin</a> Des preuves bien enracinées de possibilités <p>L’initiative <a href="https://medium.com/cities-for-people/civic-indigenous-7-0-ec3a9104901b">Civic-Indigenous 7.0</a> a été pour nous un exercise de base où enraciner une conception renouvelée des initiatives écologiques et socio-économiques, ainsi que les mécanismes financiers et de régulation s’y rapportant, à l’intersection des visions occidentales et autochtones. <br> <br> Dans la suite de ce blogue, nous explorons comment <a href="https://medium.com/cities-for-people/civic-indigenous-7-0-ec3a9104901b">les sept points de convergence développés dans le précédent blogue</a> peuvent servir d’ancrages pour la mise sur pied de <a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins</a>, une initiative axée sur la réconciliation avec la nature dans les terrains privés en vue de créer une nouvelle forme de micro-traité.</p><p>Alors que nous nous efforçons d’unir des visions passées, présentes et futures du monde grâce à ces preuves de possibilités, nous savons qu’il pourrait y avoir des tensions et même de la dissonance entre des approches plus technocratiques ou relationnelles.</p><p>Si vous avez des idées sur comment aborder ces tensions ou sur la façon dont les sept points de convergence pourraient servir à élaborer une autre initiative, n’hésitez pas à nous en faire&nbsp;part.</p> Nouveaux voisins&nbsp;: la réconciliation avec la nature commence dans notre&nbsp;cour <p>L’organisme Nouveaux voisins travaille actuellement avec un écosystème croissant de partenaires à la régénération de terrains gazonnés pour accroître la biodiversité, atténuer certaines conséquences des changements climatiques et aider à repenser notre relation problématique avec la nature d’un point de vue municipal (villes&lt;&gt; banlieues &lt;&gt; milieux&nbsp;ruraux).</p><p>Jusqu’à maintenant, Nouveaux voisins et quelques partenaires se sont concentrés sur trois choses&nbsp;: 1. la création de discours (étendre la notion de quartier à d’autres êtres vivants et questionner la stigmatisation des terrains à la pelouse parfaite comme l’option de paysagement par défaut); 2. l’élaboration d’autres approches paysagères par l’entremise de projets pilotes (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nouveauxvoisins/posts/3067756833459642">comme celui-ci</a>)&nbsp;; 3. la création d’outils pour appuyer cette transformation socio-écologique (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">plateforme web et trousse d’outils</a>, bacs à sable réglementaires, mécanismes financiers et fiscaux pour tenir compte des services écologiques créés collectivement, etc.).</p><p>La quête de la pelouse parfaite est profondément enracinée dans notre culture occidentale. Il s’agit de la plus grande culture irriguée en Amérique du Nord et ses conséquences néfastes pour l’environnement sont nombreuses. La transformation socio-écologique proposée par Nouveaux voisins et d’autres acteurs similaires pourrait donc avoir un impact de grande envergure.</p><p>Elle nous permettrait aussi de nous éloigner d’une vision où la nature est gérée par les êtres humains pour en venir à reconnaître les avantages de celle-ci et de ses écosystèmes pour les êtres humains et, finalement, comprendre l’auto-souveraineté de la nature au sein de laquelle ont lieu des échanges métaboliques entre les espèces (y compris les êtres humains).</p> Consultation avec la nature&nbsp;: vers 1 million de cours liées les unes aux&nbsp;autres <p>À ce jour, des Droits de la nature ont surtout été attribués à un site en particulier (lac, rivière, etc. + avec une communauté précise) ou par un État (Bolivie+ Équateur + Ouganda), parfois avec peu d’impact sur le terrain. Il est aussi possible de faire un constat similaire quant aux efforts de conservation écologique.</p>Certains scénarios préliminaires et hypothétiques pour chaque étape de mise en&nbsp;œuvre.<p>En commençant par des actions non officielles, cumulatives et de plus petite envergure, des initiatives comme Nouveaux voisins pourraient créer un mouvement collectif ascendant de restauration écologique/Droits de la&nbsp;nature.</p><p>L’impact serait très restreint si seulement quelques propriétaires participaient. Mais cela pourrait devenir un excellent moyen de coopération avec la nature si des millions de gens à travers le Canada décidaient de prendre part à cette transformation, et s’il existait des outils et des infrastructures pour soutenir celle-ci.</p><p>Des instruments pourraient par exemple être conçus pour améliorer la prise de décisions collective sur le genre d’espèces à sauver en premier en fonction du taux d’extinction, ou le genre de services écologiques à soutenir dans un domaine donné, tout ça grâce aux choix que nous faisons et encourageons collectivement dans nos&nbsp;cours.</p><p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/reconciliation-with-nature-starts-in-our-yards-7f7b71f7630c">Nous avons explorer les options possibles en ce sens dans ce&nbsp;blogue.</a></p> Redéfinir ensemble la beauté pour valoriser l’utilité <p>De nos jours, la plupart des gens n’ont pas les moyens d’embaucher un ou une spécialiste pour transformer leur cour (p. ex. dans un des projets pilotes de Nouveaux voisins, la régénération d’un terrain de 40 mètres carrés à Outremont [un quartier montréalais] coûtait environ 4000 $). D’un autre côté, se contenter de laisser la pelouse pousser et se régénérer sans intervention humaine peut aussi apporter son lot de défis, comme des risques d’allergie ou un certain nombre d’années pour atteindre un aspect sauvage intéressant et acceptable selon les normes culturelles d’aujourd’hui.</p><p>Pour nous débarrasser des pelouses et retrouver un aspect plus naturel, il pourrait nous falloir une nouvelle génération d’instruments et de modèles financiers civiques capables de tenir compte de formes de valeur multidimensionnelles et longitudinales (séquestration du carbone, hausse de la biodiversité, réduction des îlots de chaleur, etc.), et de mettre à profit les capitaux privés et institutionnels nécessaires pour relever les défis environnementaux liés à la remise à un certain état&nbsp;sauvage.</p><p>Il nous faut une meilleure compréhension des différents bénéfices dans une seule cour (séquestration du carbone, hausse de la biodiversité, santé publique, qualité de vie, participation communautaire, sécurité alimentaire, etc.), ainsi que plus d’information sur les valeurs différenciées créées à différentes échelles (une seule cour versus une rue versus un quartier versus une&nbsp;région).</p><p>Les visions du monde autochtones impliquent souvent une philosophie d’interdépendance et d’appartenance, comme l’indique l’expression mohawk Akwe Nia’Tetewá:neren (toutes mes relations). Il est entendu que nous sommes tous liés les uns aux autres et à toute la vie sur Terre. Comment afficher un tel respect pour toutes les espèces vivantes dans notre cour? Comment créer un lien entre la compréhension scientifique des systèmes écologiques acquise au cours des siècles et la sagesse autochtone acquise durant des milliers d’années de relation intime avec le territoire sur lequel nous vivons aujourd’hui?</p>Carte préliminaire des avantages conjoints de Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins Intégrer des responsabilités envers la nature dans les ordres juridiques actuels <p>Selon la recherche et les conversations que nous avons menées avec diverses parties prenantes, il semble que les paliers réglementaires municipaux et provinciaux pourraient être les meilleurs points d’entrée pour reconnaître nos responsabilités envers la nature sur une propriété privée donnée. <br> <br> Sur le plan municipal&nbsp;: Plutôt qu’encourager l’entretien des pelouses (p. ex. une couverture végétale d’une certaine hauteur maximale en cm), les municipalités pourraient déterminer le pourcentage minimum (p. ex. 50 %) de la surface d’une cour qui devrait être réservée à des services écologiques et concevoir des outils pour aider leur communauté à atteindre cet objectif.</p><p>Sur le plan provincial&nbsp;: Les lois actuelles sur le patrimoine semblent un bon point d’entrée, soit en reconnaissant les droits de la nature dans le cadre de servitudes de conservation (comme cela a été fait avec le Community Legal Environmental Defence Fund), soit en proposant des options de conservation juridiques volontaires, comme le fait le Gouvernement du Québec (p. ex. une réserve naturelle, une servitude de conservation, le don ou la vente de propriété, ainsi que la désignation d’un habitat floristique).</p><p>Ces dernières sont accompagnées d’un revenu ou d’une réduction des taxes municipales, mais en général, elles ne s’appliquent qu’à de vastes terrains. Une approche plus collective et démocratique en matière de conservation et de restauration est indispensable. <br> <br> Lois autochtones&nbsp;: Il est possible d’intégrer la sagesse autochtone à d’autres ordres juridiques et, par conséquent, de préparer le terrain pour une éventuelle reconnaissance de la pluralité des ordres légaux. Toutefois, il a été suggéré de commencer par «&nbsp;faire le ménage de notre maison&nbsp;» à court terme avant de prendre part directement à un ordre juridique à titre de personne non autochtone.</p><p>Toutefois, un Autochtone nous a dit que lorsqu’un fonctionnaire de la Ville de Montréal est venu chez lui avec une règle pour mesurer la hauteur de sa pelouse à la suite d’une plainte faite par un voisin, il a mentionné suivre la loi ancestrale de son peuple et ce qu’elle dit au sujet de la relation avec la terre. Le fonctionnaire a quitté la propriété sur-le-champ. Cette anecdote illustre bien la pluralité juridique et la façon dont la négociation entre des traditions juridiques autochtones et coloniales peut se manifester dans le cadre de micro-décisions sur le&nbsp;terrain.</p><p>La prochaine étape&nbsp;: Une conversation avec des représentantes et représentants des différents paliers de gouvernement doit avoir lieu pour clarifier la façon d’intégrer des responsabilités envers la nature dans les ordres juridiques actuels.</p> Travailler à la réconciliation de notre réglementation <p>La réglementation est une des tâches les plus importantes du gouvernement. Elle renvoie à une relation codifiée entre le commerce, l’État, la société civile et la nature, assurant des protections et des terrains d’action adéquats dans tous les domaines. Au moment où nous nous retrouvons à la croisée des chemins face à des défis, mais aussi des possibilités sans précédent, il importe de comprendre que le jeu change et donc, que les règles doivent elles aussi changer, y compris en ce qui concerne les propriétés dont nous sommes locataires ou propriétaires.</p><p>Voici quelques idées de la façon dont cela pourrait se dérouler.</p> La propriété comme un (micro) traité&nbsp;: voir au-delà de la propriété  Sommes-nous capables de voir la propriété comme un traité conclu avec un lieu, plutôt que comme la possession de celui-ci? <p>Pouvons-nous, aux confins de la pensée juridique occidentale, voir la propriété comme un traité plutôt que comme un acte visant la possession privée? Pouvons-nous créer un prototype de microtraité numérique (un traité intelligent), par exemple, qui pourrait interagir en temps réel avec toutes ses relations et responsabilités, y compris les limites déjà en place qui s’appliquent à la propriété privée en vertu de la loi des colonisateurs?</p><p>Posséder une maison et prendre soin du terrain sur lequel elle est située pourrait alors devenir un acte de réconciliation profonde, ou, au minimum, un acte de «&nbsp;préparation&nbsp;» afin qu’un dialogue puisse avoir lieu entre la notion actuelle de propriété privée et les ordres juridiques autochtones par l’entremise des titres ancestraux. Bien que cela ne garantisse pas une intégration tout en douceur des titres ancestraux et des droits de propriété privée, cela pourrait néanmoins stimuler l’interface… ou notre imagination.</p><p>Les voies qui mènent au-delà de la propriété demeurent insaisissables. Cependant, des éléments d’émerveillement précis issus d’un contact préliminaire avec la pensée juridique autochtone pourraient nous aider à ne plus simplement «&nbsp;faire les choses comme d’habitude&nbsp;» et à participer plus activement à la décentralisation de la vision occidentale par défaut. Voici quelques éléments d’émerveillement pour poursuivre la réflexion&nbsp;:</p><blockquote>«&nbsp;En tant que citadins, une part de notre difficulté est d’apprendre comment vivre avec la force de la Terre et de nous laisser conseiller par celle-ci. Allez parler aux arbres et aux plantes pour comprendre le langage, les histoires, la science et les traités de la nature. Et parce que la Terre est vivante, cela veut dire que l’histoire ne peut pas se résumer à “il était une fois en 1701”. Il s’agit plutôt de ce qui se produit aujourd’hui et de ce qui peut se produire à l’avenir. Le paragraphe 35 fait partie intégrante de la loi canadienne et peut nous aider à créer des lois qui n’émanent pas seulement des parlements ou des assemblées législatives, mais qui émanent aussi de nous, qui font partie de nous. Il n’y a pas que les avocats et les juges qui peuvent pratiquer le droit. Nous pouvons tous et toutes le faire. Et nous pouvons commencer en récréant le lien entre les gens et leurs terres. C’est de nous qu’il s’agit. Nous n’avons pas à l’attendre. Le lien est là. Il nous entoure.&nbsp;»</blockquote><blockquote>― John Borrows, extrait de son enseignement près de l’étang, Toronto,&nbsp;2019</blockquote> Communiquez avec&nbsp;nous <p>Nous en sommes encore aux premières étapes de la mise sur pied de Civic-Indigenous 7.0, ce qui veut dire que nous sommes ouverts à toute rétroaction qui pourrait éclairer nos travaux futurs.

<p>In the wake of our <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a> announcement, I’d like to take a look at the guts of our HoloPort Alpha Program — specifically the separate networks and why they matter.</p><p>(Also, this is the hundredth Dev Pulse! An exciting milestone! 🎉 Huge thanks to Amanda, Micah, Klaye, Paulii, Jarod, Lucas, Mary, the dev teams, and all the other people who’ve ever worked on it.)</p> The Holo network: actually three separate networks <p>The Holo hosting dev team will assign all hosts in the HoloPort Alpha Program to one of three networks:</p>  The alphaNet is an alpha release of the production-ready Holo network. From the HPOS to the centralised infrastructure, it runs on code that’s known to be stable — appropriate for production use, though not necessarily performant, feature-complete, or bug-free. It sees a slow update cycle, only incorporating changes as they’re proven to work right.  The flexNet runs on code that includes features and bugfixes that want to be promoted to the alphaNet but need pre-release testing. This will be a mixture of stable and unproven components that will eventually make it into the release once they’re considered reliable. Components could come from the alphaNet, the devNet, or a special branch of the codebase that focuses on just one feature.  The devNet tracks the current state of development and is very unstable. This is where the daily work shows up, and is only used and tested by Holo team members. Automated tests are run on the devNet each night on new features and bugfixes, as well as to catch ‘regressions’ — previously working features that have been broken by new code.  <p>The networks are almost completely separate, from web browser to HoloPort. All the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-to-break-a-holo-app/#a-look-at-how-a-holo-hosted-happ-can-break">centralised components</a> — the web server that serves up the Chaperone script to the user, the matchmaker service that finds the user a HoloPort to connect to, the Holo router that connects the user to their chosen HoloPort, and the proxy and bootstrap services that connect HoloPorts to each other — are replicated so they isolate the alphaNet from the devNet. This keeps bugs from leaking out into the experience of users on the alphaNet, and it prevents resource-heavy automated tests from slowing the alphaNet down.</p><p>The Holo devs are describing this as a huge improvement in their ability to test changes — not only does it contain bugs, but it also vastly simplifies our testing and deployment setup. Each network can be deployed automatically — from the HoloPort, through the centralised infrastructure, to the scripts that run in the user’s browser. These are the kinds of quality assurance upgrades we need right now as we prepare for public alpha testing.</p> Explaining the requirements for the HoloPort Alpha Program  Remote SSH enabled <p>Because the Holo hosting dev team will be the ones choosing how many HoloPorts they need for each network, SSH will be enabled by default on all HoloPorts for this stage of the program. This is a big departure from our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/#holo-progress-hosted-happs-and-host-console">previous approach</a>, so I want to clarify three things:</p>  This is only for the duration of the HoloPort Alpha Program.  We’ll only be using it to switch your HoloPort between networks and perform support diagnostics.  In the future, you’ll be able to turn SSH off any time you like from the Host Console Settings. If you disable it, your HoloPort will not be used in the program — that is, it won’t be serving hApps to users, and you won’t be eligible to receive HoloFuel.   95% uptime <p>In the future, web users’ <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">source chains</a> will be backed up by multiple HoloPorts with an uptime of at least 90%. We’re aiming for 5× redundancy, which will give a total uptime of 99.999%, allowing users to access their app even in the unlikely event that four of their assigned HoloPorts are offline.</p><p>For now, though, each web user only gets assigned to one HoloPort. If it happens to go offline, all the users it’s serving can no longer access their app. That’s why the HoloPort Alpha Program <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">requires 95% uptime</a> as one of its eligibility criteria. This will be adequate for testing purposes; anything less will give an unpleasant user experience. We think this is worth paying for, which is why you’ll be getting a stipend in HoloFuel if you join the program.</p><p>If you’re eager to get involved, head over to the <a href="https://forum.holo.host">Holo forum</a> and watch for announcements in the coming weeks.</p> An invitation: help improve the developer documentation! <p>The folks at <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a>, a Holochain dev shop that focuses on good user experience (you should check out their <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn hApp</a>), also care a lot about developer experience too. They’ve invited everybody with some technical background to join their 24-hour Documentation Drive, starting today at 12:00 UTC (sorry for the late notice). You don’t need to be a Holochain expert yourself; you just need to be willing to dig a little and improve things just a bit.</p><p>It’s no great secret among hApp developers that the learning journey is a bit rough and wild; there’s a lot that could be improved. And the success of the Holochain ecosystem will rest on hApp developers, so this is a low-commitment, high-impact way to help out!</p><p>Join the documentation effort by <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRK45QFtIO749M4ocLX4drKlkGJmxPEIkyzpmbM1l6_mZ7tw/viewform">filling out this form</a>.</p><p>Thanks, Sprillow, for organising this!</p> Dev Camp update: 1000 registrants! <p>We’ve been floored by the level of interest in the upcoming Holochain Dev Camp. That’s a 4× increase over last Dev Camp; interest is accelerating!</p><p>If you haven’t signed up yet, here’s the <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">registration form</a>.</p> Breaking changes in <code>develop</code>: decryption function and <code>must_get</code> <p>If you’re developing your hApp against the <code>develop</code> branch of Holochain, two new breaking changes have landed.</p>  One decryption function, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/x_salsa20_poly1305/fn.x_25519_x_salsa20_poly1305_decrypt.html"><code>x_25519_x_salsa20_poly1305_decrypt</code></a>, had its parameters mistakenly reversed behind the scenes. The fix <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/874">isn’t actually a breaking change</a>; the host function signature and parameter order haven't changed. But if you discovered that you had to swap sender and recipient in order for it to work, you’ll need to swap them back to what the documentation says.  All DHT retrieval functions have been disabled in validation callbacks and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/812">replaced with new deterministic ones</a>. If your validation callbacks need to load dependencies from the DHT, use the new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/2de6183dbeddb0e06d5f7309603bf05d0dfd8bd4/crates/hdk/src/entry.rs#L218-L319"><code>must_get_*</code></a> host functions to protect validation from <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/#guidelines-for-writing-validation-rules">sources of non-determinism</a>. These functions are guaranteed to retrieve something; if there's something wrong with the dependency, they'll short-circuit in the host with the proper error.  <p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@sydneylens?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Paul Carmona</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/spiderwebs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

Credit: CIVIC SQUARE — construction of a neighbourhood grow&nbsp;room Finance at the Climate Crossroads <p>Since the signing of the <a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/english_paris_agreement.pdf">UNFCCC’s Paris Agreement</a> in 2015, <a href="https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechaos2021/">$3.8 trillion</a> has been invested in fossil fuels, and much of the money set aside to ‘build back better’ will not address climate change. The role of finance in both the causes of climate breakdown and how we pull our societies back from the brink is a crucial and hot topic that many individuals and organizations pursuing a low-carbon, climate-resilient, just, and inclusive future are grappling with.</p><p>While Sustainable Finance has emerged in response and has seen significant expansion over the past decade <a href="https://www.environmentalleader.com/2021/01/sustainable-finance-expected-to-see-55-growth-in-2021-says-credit-agricole-group/">with a further 55% of growth forecast in 2021</a>, the practice of taking environmental, social and governance considerations into account when making investment decisions is unlikely to lead to transformative change of the kind required. Not only do ESG investments manifest mostly as a “do less harm” exercise with a focus on risk reduction instead of value creation, but they also <a href="https://www.theasset.com/wealth-management/44067/sustainability-funds-fail-to-live-up-to-their-name">hardly do better than conventional funds</a> in directing investment to sustainable activities.</p><p>The micro-shifts of ESG investing are a step in the right direction but wholly insufficient in the face of the climate and ecological crisis. Mainstream approaches leave much of the prevailing investment logic — the paradigms, structures, and practices of investing — untouched. Incrementalism and tweaks at the fringes of the finance system leave these sustainable investments steeped in many of the same finance orthodoxies that got us to this point of crisis in the first place. Put bluntly, moving our pensions from companies involved in oil exploration to less carbon-intensive industries such as biotech, financial services, or digital technology is not going to drive the transformational changes we need locally and globally. This is why ESG investing has come <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/22/sustainable-finance-is-rife-with-greenwash-time-for-more-disclosure">under increasing criticism</a> in recent months for failing to deliver on its impact&nbsp;promise.</p> The TransCap&nbsp;Approach <p>The shortcomings of the Sustainable Finance movement have been noted by many already, not least one of the partners in this collaboration: the <a href="https://medium.com/transformation-capital">TransCap Initiative</a>.</p><blockquote>“Transformation capital is an investment logic at the intersection of systems thinking and finance practice. It has been designed to catalyse sustainability transitions in the places that matter most for human prosperity — such as cities, landscapes, and coastal zones — as well as in value chains and other real-economy systems. It recognises the world as a complex adaptive system and embeds systems thinking, human-centred design, and sensemaking in all stages of the investment process.”</blockquote>Credit: TransCap Initiative — transformation capital <a href="https://www.climate-kic.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Transformation-Capital-Systemic-Investing-for-Sustainability.pdf">white&nbsp;paper</a><p>This new investment logic presents a critique of the ESG mindset and argues for why we need to push the world of finance to think beyond the singular goal of investment as a means for capital to multiply itself, and instead to focus on increasing the effectiveness by which Sustainable Finance is deployed. It argues that viewing the world through a systems lens and focusing on real assets in the places where we live, work and play — instead of in stock markets — is more aligned with our shared ambition to build not just a low-carbon but also a climate-resilient, just, and inclusive society.</p><blockquote>“Transformation capital intends for investors to deploy capital primarily to create change dynamics that propel a (real-economy) system in a specific direction, both in order to set the system on an environmentally and socially sustainable footing as well as to enable the continued multiplication of capital in the long&nbsp;run.”</blockquote> How this manifests locally <p>But how does that manifest locally? And how does it interact with those who live within the systems these investments seek to change? How can we better connect the financial system to communities in a way that serves them rather than relegates them to a source of value extraction? How can we ensure relationships move beyond the continued multiplication of financial capital as the primary driving force and instead prioritise wellbeing, social justice, and ecological regeneration?</p><p>Conventional investment portfolios systematically avoid opportunities to generate compound value (both private and public) by remaining purposefully divorced from the tangible and intangible assets embedded in communities themselves. Furthermore, they are not composed in a systemic manner through which individual assets can be brought into synergistic relationship with each other so that they generate multiplier effects that amplify their value to the community. A simple example might be a residential fund investing in a rental portfolio in a neighbourhood. The fund manager knows that the attractiveness of the place and their success is partly based on the sense of community and safety as well as the quality of nearby parks, schools, shops and transport connections. But there is no mechanism or incentive for these connections to be&nbsp;made.</p><p>While financial capital is a powerful lever in driving a system’s behaviour, there are other types of capital important to society’s sustainability transition. One of them is ‘community capital’, which manifests in different ways. It can take the form of the relationships of trust within communities that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual and civic benefit. It can be the organisational and institutional infrastructure in which deliberative and decision-making capacity lies within a community and amongst its members. It can even be the combined financial and social investment potential of a community to generate multiple shared value from collective civic&nbsp;action.</p>Credit: CIVIC SQUARE— #TheBigLunch weekender at <a href="http://www.thefrontroom.cc">The Front Room</a>, South Loop Park, Birmingham<p>These types of community capital are rarely aligned in a purposeful way with financial capital flows, sustainable or otherwise. And yet these types of capital and human-to-human interactions are the bedrock of real value creation in our neighbourhoods and communities. Worse yet, there has been a historic and turbulent relationship between financial capital and the people and places it shapes. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/research/economic-rents">Extractive models of financial investment</a> have bred distrust and often directly contributed to the inequities at the heart of the crises we face. Whether it’s through housing developments that privilege profits over affordable, green and comfortable living for all, or high-street chains motivated by shareholder interests over those of the community, the long term risks associated with these investments are socialised and the rewards are privatised — the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis serving as a powerful reminder.</p>Credit: CIVIC SQUARE — exploring modern making methods, small sites and community builds<p>As technology advances, these harmful power imbalances risk being replicated further and faster. The incentives, values and ownership models baked into finance will play crucial roles in <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1408103654863814657">the means of creation and distribution</a>: how behavioural data from mobile phones, public spaces and smart homes is owned and used; or how Artificial Intelligence is developed and applied to our everyday lives; how gene editing is applied and owned in our food system; or even how social media and other online platform that breed polarising content, unsustainable consumption patterns and mass disinformation structure their business models. Whatever the scope of the transition, how it is financed&nbsp;matters.</p><p>This makes it all the more crucial to see sustainability transitions and the finance that drives them through an economic, political, cultural and social justice lens and recognize that these transitions happen alongside — and not isolated from — other structural shifts in society. In other words, sustainability transitions are not just about carbon neutrality, but rather a need to move away from the prevailing logic of an environmentally and socially extractive economy towards a regenerative and inclusive economy capable of fundamentally addressing the most tangible and pressing challenges of the 21st century. As the <a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/just-transition/#:~:text=Just%20Transition%20is%20a%20vision,cycles%20holistically%20and%20waste%2Dfree.">Climate Justice Alliance</a> puts&nbsp;it,</p><blockquote>“The transition itself must be just and equitable; redressing past harms and creating new relationships of power for the future through reparations. If the process of transition is not just, the outcome will never be. Just Transition describes both where we are going and how we get&nbsp;there.”</blockquote> Rewiring capital and&nbsp;value <p>Rebalancing this relationship between communities and finance requires more than just new capital formations, new funds and new grant structures. It requires the systemic rewiring of capital itself, away from asymmetric power, control and value extraction, towards more distributed and democratised forms.</p><p>It also requires a rewiring of how we see value. Reconfiguring the relationships between financial capital and community capital can unleash the multiplicity of equitable returns and co-benefits, recognising that value flows from investments can take many forms, but too few are incorporated into conventional financing models. Reductions in liabilities, for instance the health risks associated with fuel poverty, are rarely accounted for fully. Longitudinal and intangible outcomes, such as increased social resilience from one generation to another, fail to be valued fully when investment decisions are made. The failure to capture these values reinforces a warped view of what constitutes a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ investment.</p>Credit: Dark Matter Labs — <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/bridging-the-gap-infrastructuring-tomorrow-d19971b1f351">Bridging the Impact Investment Gap: Infrastructuring Tomorrow</a><p>If our finance systems are to go beyond capital formations motivated largely by short term, narrow economic returns alone (financial ROI / social ROI that use conventionally static or negatively biased discount rates), and begin to recognise the multiple civic returns possible, there is a need to explore new ways of measuring, accounting and financing for civic value creation for a new symmetry of power and mutuality. It is in this rewiring of capital and value that we can create the systemic conditions for just transitions.</p> Our TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap exploration <p>The intersection of new investment logics (transformation capital), new forms and flows of value (civic value) and the tangible and intangible assets in our communities (community capital) is where our shared exploration sits. It is where we seek to further unpack and explore the tensions and contradictions that their combination surfaces by testing and validating key components of each, and how they intersect.</p><p>The aim is to generate insights and learnings relevant to a diverse range of place-based transitions. While the transitioning of, for example, urban neighbourhoods towards a just carbon neutrality and universal wellbeing will be different to transitioning rural land systems towards sustainable and ecologically enriching uses, there will be common challenges and relevant points of connection to draw&nbsp;from.</p><p>We have purposefully brought together a collaboration that spans a diverse set of vantage points, knowing that diversity is strength and that to work in complexity is to embrace entanglements and often conflicting perspectives.</p><p>The <a href="https://medium.com/transformation-capital/transformation-capital-systemic-investing-for-sustainability-693cb1190da?sk=c7a5cc7f3e8da34c37d9dd0466dbc38c">TransCap Initiative</a> is a collaborative space for developing, demonstrating, and scaling systemic investing in some of the places that matter most for human prosperity — such as cities, landscapes, and coastal zones — as well as in value chains and other real-economy systems. We apply systems thinking, human-centred design, and the principles of mission-driven innovation to explore how financial capital can catalyse the transformation of systems in service of a low-carbon, climate-resilient, just, and inclusive future. The TransCap Initiative is currently convened by the <a href="https://www.climatekicfoundation.org/">Climate-KIC International Foundation</a>.</p><p><a href="https://thirtypercy.org/">Thirty Percy Foundation</a> and <a href="https://lankellychase.org.uk/">Lankelly Chase Foundation</a> are philanthropies passionate about systemic change, climate justice and place-based transitions to a future that is regenerative and just. We have a history of supporting ambitious, values-aligned partners through grant funding, and of challenging systems that enable excessive accumulation of wealth at the expense of social and ecological wellbeing.</p><p><a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> is a strategic discovery, design and development lab working to transition society in response to technological revolution and climate breakdown, focusing on the institutional innovation that sits between the systems and structures that shape society. This includes reimagining new place-based institutions with capacity for collective sense-making, implementing, and financing of regenerative projects, to re-coding wider value models through contracting in order to harness the potential of placed-based transitions.</p><p><a href="https://civicsquare.cc/">CIVIC SQUARE</a> is based at the heart of a neighbourhood in Birmingham, we are focused on 21st century regenerative civic and social infrastructure that underpins how we respond together to our growing societal challenges equitably. We do this through our key mission areas of the public square, neighbourhood lab and creative and participatory ecosystem we seek to work in a number of ways alongside our neighbours and local community, making the invisible visible through uncovering the dark matter, investing in the radical reimagination of our systems through the dream matter, and giving it playful, participatory, everyday, accessible form in the ordinary&nbsp;matter.</p><p>The strength of this collaboration is that each partner brings perspectives and assumptions that have some common ground but aren’t completely aligned. The point is to collaboratively explore the tensions that arise and, from a position of empathy and humility, work towards reconciliation that can further the cause we broadly&nbsp;share.</p> Working out-loud <p>We want to recognise our privilege in this work and avoid falling into the trap of building a knowledge base in isolation of wider stakeholders, including those within neighbourhoods and communities who will help determine the shape and feel of each place-based transition. Our intention is for this exploration to build upon existing knowledge and inspire a wider ecosystem of stakeholders to continue to develop and test out new ideas in a way that builds a ‘movement-of-many’ capable of displacing dominant systems of investment and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>To that end, we will be ‘working out-loud’ over the course of this collaboration. Partners will take it in turns to write a WeekNote, sharing learnings as we&nbsp;go.</p><p>You can find the TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap WeekNote&nbsp;<a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/TransCap-x-CivicValue-x-CommCap-WeekNotes-4e4acb5764af4e749d6463b097d3c0f4">here</a>.</p> Our shared enquiries <p>To guide us over the next 6 months, we have co-developed a set of shared core enquiries that capture what we feel are fundamental questions that need further exploration.</p>  How can we best challenge the modus operandi of investors and guide those with aligned intentions towards new logics, practices and instruments adaptive to different contexts, communities and scales of transition?  How can we best build the capacity for change amongst communities, intermediaries and investors that address historical tensions between capital and societal interests, as well as legacy lock-ins that remain deep-rooted causes of the&nbsp;crisis?  How can we best develop new financial, technical and participatory innovations, which not only systemically rebalance the agency of change from financial capital towards community capital, but are transferable / translatable across multiple different boundaries and scales of ownership (e.g. urban neighbourhoods but also rural land / bio-regions)?  <p>What sits behind these three leading enquiries are a set of cascading enquiries that represent our collective ‘hunches’ for where further work could have&nbsp;value.</p>  How might we best build the capacity for change amongst communities, intermediaries and investors that address historical tensions between capital and societal interests, as well as legacy lock-ins that remain deep-rooted causes of the crises we&nbsp;face?  How might we navigate the tension between urgency for action and the deeper shifts required to deliver equitable systemic change that is grounded in historic and cultural inequities?  How might an ecosystem of investors be nurtured to provide different types of capital that serve local, just climate transitions in different ways?  How might new investment logics address ownership, wealth and power concentrations that drive extractive models of financing, while supporting new economic thinking relating to revenue, risks and&nbsp;returns?  How might ‘participatory imagining’ practices help establish investments with shared intention, in a way that builds legitimacy across all stakeholders involved?  How can new ways of measuring the quality of investments drive rigour and legitimacy (and comprehensively account for its multiple benefits beyond financial ROI)?  How can minimum viable prototypes, proxies and proofs of possibilities help make abstract concepts and ideas around new investment logics tangible to a diverse group of stakeholders?   Towards tangible actions and longer-term proofs of possibility <p>As a collective, we are committed to working towards concrete action in the near term, while maintaining a broader perspective for ‘movement-building’. Our principles for implementation are set out&nbsp;below:</p><p>Short term impact with long term&nbsp;horizons</p><p>This initial exploratory phase will inform what can be implemented in the next 12–18 months. This recognises that the time to make the transformational investments necessary is long overdue and urgent, and also that communities want to see positive changes sooner rather than later. But these short term actions must also be deliberate in how they act as steps towards a radically different future, rather than extending the status&nbsp;quo.</p><p>Testing approaches at multiple layers of&nbsp;systems</p><p>Emerging ideas and actions will focus around investment logics and fund structures, but also institutions and people. Crucially, to support innovation at those levels, ideas will also include innovation of the technical instruments that can enable these new&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>Place-focus</p><p>Given the very broad ambitions for this collaboration, we plan to initially focus on one place — Ladywood in Birmingham — to help ground our thinking. This is in part because CIVIC SQUARE is rooted here, is working alongside neighbours in the area and has long term commitments to exploring new models of social infrastructure, community retrofit and more in the area, but also because as with many neighbourhoods facing the challenges it is, the transition needs are great. That’s not to say that we won’t be considering other local contexts and types of transitions concurrently and over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Matching top-down and bottom-up</p><p>We must find better ways of linking finance — which typically wants a standardised model to which large amounts of investment can be applied — with communities, who typically require a bespoke approach tailored to their needs and may need relatively small amounts of capital at a time. We will explore other examples of how this challenge has been overcome and that have been able to deliver meaningful, scaled outcomes.</p><p>Creating a long-lasting platform for sustainability transitions</p><p>In times of adversity, community capital has a direct relationship to the ability of neighbourhoods to adapt and cope with change. Therefore, implementing the changes required to make sustainability transitions happen will require accountable, empowered and securely-resourced local partnerships or even new institutions to be established. We will explore how these institutions might emerge and also be sustainable over the long term and not be entirely dependent on potentially changeable political agendas.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you’re interested to learn more from this collaboration, or are exploring similar themes and issues relating to the topics outlined above, please feel free to reach out to our designated points of&nbsp;contact:</p><p>Dominic Hofstetter, TransCap Initiative <a href="http://dh@transformation.capital/">dh@transformation.capital</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/dhofstetter_x">@dhofstetter_x</a></p><p>Immy Kaur, CIVIC&nbsp;SQUARE</p><p><a href="http://immy@civicsquare.cc">immy@civicsquare.cc</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ImmyKaur">@ImmyKaur</a></p><p>Tom Beresford, Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs</p><p><a href="http://tom@darkmatterlabs.org">tom@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/t_bez12">@t_bez12</a></p><p>Jen Hooke, Thirty Percy Foundation</p><p><a href="http://jen@thirtypercy.org">jen@thirtypercy.org</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/jenhooke">@jenhooke</a></p><p>Dominic Burke, Lankelly Chase Foundation</p><p><a href="http://dominic@lankellychase.org.uk">dominic@lankellychase.org.uk</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/_dominicburke">@_dominicburke</a></p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/financing-sustainability-transitions-in-search-of-a-new-civic-led-orthodoxy-1e615288309f">Financing sustainability transitions: in search of a new, civic-led orthodoxy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>You must have heard the words “cryptography” and “public-private key” in the context of data security. But what are they really? And why should you&nbsp;care?</p><p>To answer these questions, let’s get a bit into the basics of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and its application in a digital identity framework called <a href="https://hackernoon.com/self-sovereign-identity-whats-the-big-deal-6i1a37z3">Self-Sovereign Identity&nbsp;(SSI).</a></p> What is Public Key Infrastructure? <p>In simple terms, public key infrastructure is a framework for encryption and digital signatures that ensure secure communication between two entities. The use of encryption algorithms and private-public key pair make this framework highly conducive for the secure transfer of&nbsp;data.</p> Encryption <p>Encryption is done with a mathematical algorithm that takes a typed text as its input and runs it through mathematical permutations to create a long output with alphanumeric characters, thereby making it difficult to break or <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">hack</a>&nbsp;into.</p><p>Asymmetric encryption is a kind of encryption implemented with a private-public key&nbsp;pair.</p> Public and Private&nbsp;Keys <p>A pair of keys, called the public-private key pair, work in tandem with each other, such that you can’t use one without the&nbsp;other.</p><p>As the name suggests, the private key is kept private by an entity while the public key is shared with the recipient(s).</p><p>Let’s understand this with an example where John and Mary are communicating with each&nbsp;other.</p>  John initiates a conversation with Mary and asks for her public key, which Mary shares with&nbsp;him.  John writes a message and encrypts it with Mary’s public key and sends it to&nbsp;her.  Since Mary has the associated private key, she decrypts John’s message using her private key and reads&nbsp;it.  To respond, she asks for John’s public key, which he&nbsp;shares  Mary encrypts the message with John’s public key and sends it to&nbsp;him.  John decrypts the message with his private key and reads the&nbsp;message.  <p>Since it’s impossible to decrypt a message without the associated private key, there’s no motivation for hackers to intercept it. This is what makes PKI a secure way of communicating over open networks like the Internet.</p> Role of PKI in&nbsp;SSI <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is a philosophy where you own your data, store it in a place of your choosing like a digital identity wallet, and share it with just the entities you want&nbsp;to.</p><p>There are many ways to implement SSI using cryptographic keys, and in this article, let’s look at two&nbsp;methods.</p> Using a Unique Digital Identifier <p>In this implementation, a unique digital identifier (typically a large number) is also generated along with your private-public key pair. You must register the public key and the unique digital identifier on the blockchain while the private key can be stored in a digital&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>At the time of authentication, the system looks up the unique identifier and the associated public key while you prove the ownership of this identifier with your private&nbsp;key.</p> Using Digital Signatures <p>Another implementation is through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/demystifying-decentralized-identifiers-dids-2dc6fc3148fd">decentralized identifiers</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a>.</p><p>There are three parties to this process and they&nbsp;are:</p>  Issuer — The entity issuing a credential such as a government ID  Holder — The owner of the credential, i.e., the entity on whom the issuer generates the credential.  Verifier — The entity that checks the validity and authenticity of the credential presented by the&nbsp;holder.  <p>The issuer signs a verifiable credential with its private key, encrypts it with the holder’s public key, and sends it to the holder. Next, the holder stores this VC in an identity wallet and can decrypt it using his or her private key to access the&nbsp;VC.</p><p>At the time of verification, the holder creates a verifiable presentation that can include one or more credentials and digitally signs it with his or her private key, and encrypts it with the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.</p><p>The verifier decrypts the VC and checks for authenticity using the public keys of both the holder and the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Thus, these are how the public key infrastructure framework is used for implementing <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">SSI-based applications</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

We can think about the future of AI in three different ways. So we could of course think about it from the technological advancements, which are happening right now, and really speeding up at a rate that we haven't seen before. So there are advancements in AI in conversation and cognitive use cases, towards analytical use cases, towards integration and automation for all sorts of moving things: into cars, into robots, into drones, and then of course connecting all of these together in the processing side of these. In just about any industry you can think of, there are really strong and sometimes surprising advancements here in AI. And so that future is really driving forward at a rate that's quite exciting. We could think about the future AI from the regulations standpoint too, and that's really going to have a huge effect on what AI will become and how it's going to be integrated into our businesses and our lives.</p>
<p>There are of course, many different frameworks around the world. There's not all that much legally binding regulation that's out there, but on the horizon, there is a recommendation for a regulation which has been put out by the European commission. We'll talk about that a bit more in depth later. We can think about the future of AI as it's being shaped by business. There are so many use cases here that are really working towards the process optimization side and assisting in decision-making, assisting in transferring information into a way that can support fast decision-making. So these three things are really creating the future of AI - so we could say technology, their regulations and its applications in business.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What do the regulations indicate about AI's future?  </p>
<p>
If we consider the journey that AI has been on and the journey that regulation has been on concerning AI, it's gone from frameworks and ethical statements about how AI should relate to and be a part of human society to where we are now. And today, there is a clear cut proposal for regulation from the European commission, and this could be adopted sometime in the next year to two years, so we're of course not in the place where we have legally binding regulation in the European union yet, but it's on the table. If we think about what this regulation is actually trying to do, it's working to harmonize the use of AI, and its development across the European union. So it's very typical of EU regulations. There needs to be a standard and interoperability between all member states.</p>
<p>What's quite interesting is they go into a tier based system on the risk that any AI system could potentially give to any of its users or any stakeholders around it. It breaks it down into regulations for systems, which have an unacceptable risk and how to deal with those, and what counts as an unacceptable risk and then down to high risk, limited risk, and then finally to minimal risk. And so we're moving towards a little more clear cut understanding of how AI is going to be used in our societies, and what's going to be acceptable and not, and what the penalties for that will be. So that's obviously very good in terms of removing uncertainty, but that's of course, laying down some boundaries, and with boundaries its going to bring oversight, need for governance and accountability here. So both sides of this you can argue are going to swing wide the gates without so much uncertainty, the future of AI as much brighter because it's clear what is acceptable and what is not. On the other hand, [there’s] a more limited take on the future of AI, because of course there are horizons and boundaries, which should not be crossed.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How are enterprises getting AI into their business?  </p>
<p>
Businesses have a few options for bringing AI into their systems and processes. The first could be point solutions, and these are AI systems that have been developed and trained to do one very clear, specific job, or to meet one very clear, specific use case. This could be anything from the health industry detecting malignant tumors in images and scans to supply chain management, to anomaly detection for a specific use case. These are all wonderful and great and meet a very specific and defined need, but of course, if you think about the spread of companies, which will need to be developing these solutions, it's endless and every situation, every scenario that a company may encounter, would like AI to solve that problem or to step in or to support these uniqueness factors are so great that we're never going to come to the end of different point solutions. </p>
<p>Another option has turned up in what we're calling AI service clouds. Now these are cloud solutions that deliver the whole range of machine learning development and governance tools, as well as the computing power and the cloud power behind it. These options tend to be really good for organizations which want to create their own point solution for their own scenario, and so these are becoming quite interesting. AI is being brought into the product itself to help automate and structure the process of selecting a model and going through training and validation, then through the lifecycle management and the ML ops [Machine Learning Operations] side. With that, businesses are able to either go for the point solution, something which is already designed for a very clear, specific use case, or they can be a bit more creative and design it themselves with the support of an AI service cloud.   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Flip the script, what does AI mean for our future?  </p>
<p>
We've been talking about what the future of AI is, and of course what's impacting that, but we have to think about this as a relationship. What does the impact of AI mean for our future? And for us, it's going to mean a much higher dependence on data, and we're already in this data-driven world. Every day it's bringing us closer to having more data-driven insights, to being able to collect data from across the organization to break down silos and use this in really smart ways. AI is going to accelerate that and bring quite measurable benefits from that, which is only going to speed up the process. With that higher dependence on data, we have to have more resilient data value chains and governance around data. This is absolutely essential and will be even more so as we speed up this process.</p>
<p>And of course, AI is many, many things, and it's such an ambiguous term, but you can think of it as a form of communication because AI is bringing information into a form which can be used to make decisions. And so that's a form of communication, or of course you have the natural language aspects where you're being able to communicate your needs in a more natural way, rather than coding, querying or just using keyword searches. All of these methods of communication and bringing communication more into our daily business processes is going to bring to light the need for transparency. There's going to be more opportunities to ask the questions of how was that data collected, or why was that decision made, or why does this impact me in the way that it does?   Those aspects, the dependence on data, the need for then governance and security of that data, and then transparency into our heightened ability to communicate, are going to be some outcomes of AI in our lives. </p>

<p>Blockchain Commons has released Gordian Seed Tool, a new iOS app that allows for the creation, storage, backup, and transformation of cryptographic seeds is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple appstore</a>. It is an independent, private, and resilient vault, which can protect the most important underlying secret used by most cryptocurrencies: the cryptographic seed.</p>

 Read More 



<p>Though most wallets focus on the private keys used to unlock their cryptocurrency transactions, Gordian Seed Tool takes a step back and allows you to manage the fundamentals upon which private keys are built: entropy and seeds. You can use coin flips, die rolls, card draws, or iOS randomness as the entropy to generate your seeds, or you can import them from other applications. Using those seeds, Gordian Seed Tool can then derive unique, non-correlatable public and private keys as you need them.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The focus of Gordian Seed Tool is to protect your seeds. It does so by supporting new approaches to security such as QR-based airgaps, where you store your secrets on a closely held device that isn’t fully networked, such as an offline device in airplane mode, or a strongly protected device like the secure enclave in Apple’s iPhone and more modern Macinotoshes. You then communicate with that device primarily through QR codes or text that can easily be transmitted across that gap of air. Your seeds are thus protected by modern mobile-device security such as data encryption, trusted hardware, and biometric access protection.</p>

<p>That data encryption comes about through Apple’s trusted encryption routines. Seed Tool then adds resilience through integration with iCloud. If your choose for your mobile iOS device to have a network connection, its seeds will be stored in iCloud using end-to-end encryption. If you lose your device, you can retrieve those seeds with a replacement device logged into the same Apple account. (If you prefer, you can also use a cellular networked device, such as an iPod Touch or wifi-only iPad, leveraging airplane mode, to entirely ensure that your seeds never leave your device.)</p>

<p>You’ll be able to easily identify your seeds using the Blockchain Commons <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2021-002-digest.md#object-identity-block">object identity block</a>, which includes a visual lifehash, a human-readable name, an icon, and an abbreviated digest. Put them together and you should be able to recognize each seed at a glance.</p>

<p>Besides generating seeds, storing them, and backing them up, Gordian Seed Tool can also transform your seeds. It can derive popular Bitcoin and Ethereum public and private keys from your seeds, answer requests for other derivations,  encode seeds as bytewords, BIP39 words, or hex, or shard them into SSKR shares and save them to different locations or as social recovery with your family, friends and close colleagues. Your seed is the basis for a whole tree of secure data, and Gordian Seed Tool gives you access to all of it.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool is just one of several Blockchain Commons apps that demonstrate the Gordian principles of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness. The <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> offers a way to store confidential QRs such as 2FA seeds, SSKR shares, and (for that matter) cryptoseeds. Our forthcoming Gordian Cosigner will demonstrate how to easily manage Bitcoin transactions across an Airgap.</p>

<p>Options for Nano&nbsp;Backers</p><p>We’ve made the difficult decision to offer all Nano backers either a full refund or the possibility to upgrade to a HoloPort or HoloPort+. This decision comes in the aftermath of a global shortage of the component we need to manufacture the Nano. After exploring various scenarios, we’ve come to the conclusion that it is simply not workable in the short term, nor to the benefit of our backers to continue waiting. Further, to put our attention on an alternate option for the Nano at this time would pull our focus from delivering the Holo hosting network along with our key applications.</p><p>Over the past week, we were able to secure components for another limited batch of HoloPorts and HoloPorts+, which means that Nano backers who choose to upgrade now will have the chance to join Alpha testing later this year. The HoloPort and HoloPort+ are proven units on the Holo network and they keep our testing and support focused on delivery of Beta mainet. Also, we can provide an estimated timeframe of delivery for these&nbsp;ports.</p> What are my options if I purchased a&nbsp;Nano? <p>Since the earliest days of the Indiegogo campaign, it has been our policy to give refunds upon request for any order not yet shipped, inclusive of shipping fees. That is still the case and we want to start by offering you a&nbsp;choice.</p><p>We will send emails to all Nano backers, which will allow you to tell us if you’d like to upgrade to a HoloPort or HoloPort+, or receive a refund. For those who wish to upgrade, we’ll begin sending invitations to upgrade along with Nano-credit details, ensuring that those who supported us in the Indiegogo Campaign get the earliest option to upgrade. For those who prefer to receive a refund, we’ll begin processing those requests within a&nbsp;week.</p><p>So, if you’re a Nano backer: Check your email and let us know which option you prefer. If you didn’t receive an email, please reach out to help@holo.host and we’ll be sure to get you a link so we know your preference.</p> The Backstory &amp;&nbsp;Details <p>Over the last months and years there has been a lot of hard work put into the Holo hosting infrastructure, and the HoloPort operating system (HPOS), and if you have been watching closely, it shows. HoloPorts are reliably upgrading and performing for the majority of our early testers, our new HoloPort Alpha Program will bring many new people into the testing process, and we’re expanding the Hosted Elemental Chat testing to over 100 HoloPorts and more than 250 people in the coming&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Throughout the design process for our infrastructure, we’ve simultaneously worked to ensure that it supports the lean hardware of the Nanos. This has been challenging but rewarding, as we were the first people in the world to get the Nano’s motherboard working with the Linux kernel we used to build HPOS (the HoloPorts Operating System). This progress will prove useful down the road with regards to future Nano projects.</p><p>While we had our heads down hard at work during the pandemic, however, there were many changes in the electronics hardware industry that included extreme shortages, price shifts, and major delays. This has meant larger players in the market are stockpiling chips to ensure their ongoing supply chains, and chip suppliers are giving preference to those customers. The specific processor that the Nano was designed around has been unavailable to our motherboard manufacturer since before our initial tests late last year, and we’ve now been told it is unlikely it would be supplied until the very end of this year. So despite being ready to manufacture the Nano since Q4 2020, we would have been unable to deliver until 2022 at the earliest.</p><p>When considering the changing landscape around Nano manufacturing, as well as changes to the hardware and compatibility with the HoloPort operating system, it became clear that pushing to ship Nanos that late could negatively impact the Holo project timeline as it would inevitably slow down the release of the Holo infrastructure and require additional testing of HoloFuel, the Host Console, and the Publisher Portal. We further believe that better lightweight options will be designed for the network as the supply chains ease up and more chips and processors become available again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>While there are some similar dynamics at play for the HoloPort and HoloPort+, we were able to coordinate with our manufacturing partners to secure the components required for additional limited supply of HoloPorts that could be delivered this calendar&nbsp;year.</p> Why this was a Difficult Decision <p>1) We don’t hold the commitments we’ve made to our community lightly.</p><p>The majority of our Nano backers joined us during the Indiegogo campaign. You have been incredibly supportive and patient for years. By demonstrating your support, you have helped show the world that there is deep interest in creating a more distributed world and accessible internet infrastructure.</p><p>Later, others of you purchased Nanos on our online store. Many have followed the project first, through periods of design and testing as well as crypto market swings and then, throughout a global pandemic. The continued acceleration of interest in this work demonstrates a demand for cooperative and collaborative technologies that function peer-to-peer. Your continued support has kept us motivated and strong in our resolve as we began delivering apps and infrastructure to bring this vision to fruition.</p><p>Our intention has always been to deliver the Nanos to you. And we think that pivoting at this juncture will mean greater success for the project on the&nbsp;whole.</p><p>2) Demonstrating Holochain working on lightweight devices will show the possibility of P2P apps connected to the physical&nbsp;world.</p><p>Nano’s remain an important strategy for Holo. They demonstrate the capacity of micro devices working in the Holochain P2P ecosystem, which we believe is central to its disruptive potential. A great example of that is RedGrid’s plans for Holochain in their clean energy grids. Lightweight devices lay the foundations of Holochain as a major player in the Internet of Things (IoT) space with massive opportunities for partnerships with governments, universities, and the private&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In fact, that is why we wanted to make Nanos available — to spread the seeds of small computers using Holochain around the world. So while we are adjusting course for this moment, know that the lightweight, micro device as a strategy is not gone, but simply moved to a later milestone on the Holo&nbsp;journey.</p> To sum it&nbsp;up <p>A sincere thank you. Specifically to all of our Nano backers. We know it hasn’t been an easy wait for many of you and that this news might be, well, a bit of a bummer. But we hope you take comfort in knowing that your support has made a true difference in demonstrating a long-term demand for people to host P2P applications on the&nbsp;web.</p><p>Also, join us at tomorrow’s AMA (15 July 2021) as we talk about what is next for Holo infrastructure testing and Holochain P2P apps. <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/RFsluzvz">Submit your questions</a> ahead of&nbsp;time.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/holoport-nano-update-afa053f17ba6">HoloPort Nano Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Skytale sees 25% better signup and activation after adding Magic&nbsp;auth <p>2017 and 2020 have a lot in common in the crypto world, specifically meteoric rises in price of major tokens like Bitcoin and&nbsp;Ether.</p><p>But the two bull markets were different in one major&nbsp;way:</p><p>In 2017, the price increase was largely driven by increasing interest from retail investors, while <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-s-2020-explosion-is-not-the-2017-bubble-again">2020’s surge was associated with increased institutional involvement</a>.</p><p>This increased institutional interest in crypto has created dozens of new opportunities for startups like <a href="https://www.skytale.finance/">Skytale</a> to step in and serve the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Skytale, a portfolio company of Berlin-based venture studio <a href="https://nextbigthing.ag/">Next Big Thing</a>, is a tracking platform for small and medium-sized enterprises — small businesses, investors, family offices, and more — to manage their crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>They recently chose Magic to handle their authentication needs, and I spoke to Skytale co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emariotti/">Enrico Mariotti</a> to learn how Magic is helping them ship faster and manage customers’ crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Demystifying crypto&nbsp;tracking <p>Despite crypto’s rise in popularity, Enrico says the industry is extremely fragmented and confusing for companies who want to get involved. He estimates that companies are losing “$1 billion due to fraudulent &amp; manual transaction tracking.”</p><p>By securely integrating with major crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, Binance, and Uniswap so far), Skytale aggregates a business’s crypto portfolio in one central place. They then classify your crypto transactions in different categories — like <a href="http://mint.com">Mint</a> does for personal spending — and export the data to Quickbooks or another accounting software of&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Finally, Skytale provides a business analytics platform for SMEs to visualize their crypto activities — also accessible via API for customers to build custom data analytics tools.</p> Shipping auth 10X&nbsp;faster <p>Ever since first hearing about Magic from a friend, Enrico told&nbsp;me:</p><blockquote>“I fell in love with Magic links immediately”.</blockquote><p>With a tight goal to launch their MVP in Q2 of 2021, Skytale was looking for a simple auth solution and realized that Magic was exactly what they were looking for, and then some: an auth solution, but also a backend, with integrations with modern blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Binance and&nbsp;Celo.</p><blockquote>“In a matter of days, we were able to authenticate users without writing almost any lines of code, offering enterprise-grade security.”</blockquote><p>Since implementing auth with Magic, Enrico tells me they’ve seen a 25% increase in successful signups and user activation.</p><p>Here’s what the login flow looks&nbsp;like:</p><blockquote>“This is a specific tangible example of a great partnership in which we could be focused on our core features, while very important features could be delegated to our partner.”</blockquote><p>Skytale’s vision is to create a world of open finance where there will be no difference between transacting with fiat or crypto assets, both for corporations and individuals.</p><p>And thanks to Magic, that vision is approaching very&nbsp;quickly.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs/skytale-sees-25-better-signup-and-activation-after-adding-auth-with-magic-43c8c8f0d284">Skytale sees 25% better signup and activation after adding auth with Magic</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/magiclabs">Magic</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDnow makes onboarding even easier with automated KYC combined with real-time AML screening and monitoring</p>
<p>Munich, July 15th 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, introduces automated AML (anti-money laundering) screening to its comprehensive platform. This feature enables a combined screening of users against certain global watchlists to make a risk assessment and to avoid violating various sanctions. The solution is able to screen a person’s identity against PEP (politically exposed person) lists, sanctions lists, global watchlists and adverse media at regular and self-selected time intervals. This allows the IDnow platform to monitor thousands of AML lists concurrently and in real-time.</p>
<p>IDnow integrates this additional step into its platform in order to reduce complexity and to make the KYC (know your customer) flow smoother, quicker and even more secure. The highly automated process spares companies from uploading data for the monitoring as the information was already collected during the identity check. With the option of ongoing monitoring, based on an individually set rhythm, businesses can maintain current risk profiles of their customers and perform the customer due diligence.</p>
<p>“The new streamlined process accelerates the onboarding flow and offers a better user experience”, says Vikas Seth CPO at IDnow. “The addition of AML screening and monitoring is further expanding the IDnow platform and marks another strategic step on our way to become the leading European platform for all identity needs.”</p>
<p>As a first step, AML screening and monitoring will be offered for IDnow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, the automated identity verification solution within IDnow’s platform. Furthermore, it will be offered for all our identification methods in the future.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021, IDnow acquired French identity technology provider ARIADNEXT as well as German identity Trust Management AG. This enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Europe.</p>

To discuss this significant milestone, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was interviewed in Global Banking and Finance. According to Li jun, since our MainNet launch three years ago, decentralized identity solutions and secure data management have become increasingly important. Every day, individuals make millions of transactions online. Despite increased dependence on online services, privacy and security have not advanced in tandem. Every day, we see new data breaches involving the exposure of millions of users’ sensitive personal information, yet people rarely stop to question how companies and services are collecting and using their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At Ontology, we want to empower users to take back control of how their digital identity is managed online, where their data is stored, and how it is protected. Our mission is to provide a decentralized identity framework that uses blockchain technology to redefine trust and challenge the status&nbsp;quo.</p> KOREA IT Times — <a href="http://www.koreaittimes.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=106900">Exclusive Interview, Li Jun, Founder of Ontology: Public Blockchain Specializing in Decentralized Identity</a> <p>McDonald’s customers in South Korea and Taiwan recently had their personal data exposed after hackers accessed internal files. In a statement, McDonald’s said it would work with security experts to identify ways to further enhance its existing security measures. Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, who was interviewed in Korea IT Times this week, believes that breaches such as this lay bare the need for companies to invest in decentralized blockchain solutions to ensure the highest levels of privacy and security when it comes to sensitive customer data. Individuals can protect themselves using Ontology’s decentralized digital identity solutions that allow them to control how their data is&nbsp;shared.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> for all of our decentralized solutions across identity and data, or keep up with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a>.

 Our Harbingers highlight Ontology’s growth since the launch of our MainNet, three years&nbsp;ago. <p>Ontology has become a truly global <a href="https://ont.io/community">community</a>, covering 30 languages across multiple countries and continents. Ontology’s global reach is, in part, thanks to our Harbingers, the exceptional leaders that help Ontology continue to grow its community and ecosystem, making it a leading blockchain for management of decentralized identities and data. Currently, we have 10+ Harbingers helping manage our communities across several platforms including Telegram, Discord, Reddit, Line, and&nbsp;Kakao.</p><p>Let’s take a tour of Ontology’s ecosystem with our Harbingers.</p><p>On June 30, 2018, Ontology MainNet <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/an-open-letter-to-the-ontology-community-ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched-3f08185bec">version 1.0</a> officially launched. It represented a new generation of high-performance public blockchain, including complete distributed ledgers and smart contract systems support, supporting public chain customization and chain network collaboration, and continues to provide common modules in various distributed applications. Thirty-three candidate Ontology Triones Nodes from six continents facilitated the launch, promoting the establishment of an open-source collaborative distributed trust ecosystem.</p><p>On June 30, 2019, Ontology’s <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-klein-bottle-contest-opens-today-a-chance-to-win-up-to-100-000-ong-9f77caf7967c">sharding</a> design was completed and we were the first to launch a cross-chain <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-testnet-released-86b34352aa42">TestNet</a>. We launched a grand “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-klein-bottle-contest-opens-today-a-chance-to-win-up-to-100-000-ong-9f77caf7967c">Klein Bottle</a>” technology challenge for the global community, attracting the attention of many developers at home and abroad. At that time, we had begun to take a global view and participated in the formulation of a number of international standards including IEEE, ISO and ITU-T. Adhering to the principle of trust first, we established a trust collaboration platform supporting a wide range of business scenarios, and continued to expand our global community.</p><p>On June 30, 2020, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-celebrates-two-years-since-mainnet-launch-b58ff682fa54">Ontology MainNet 2.0</a> launched, designed to support robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability whilst enabling developers to provide solutions for enterprises. ONTO Wallet version 3.0.0 also launched, integrating Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, ONT ID, with its mobile data client, enabling users to verify credentials and manage their identities, independently. Meanwhile, details regarding Add-on Store, SAGA and OpenKG were announced, one million<a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1275941780232589313"> NFTs</a> were distributed to global communities, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/strengthening-ontologys-governance-and-staking-economic-model-245faf02107a">new governance and staking economic models</a> were introduced, all of which have brought more choice and greater benefits for node parties and staking&nbsp;users.</p><blockquote>Ontology has matured a lot since I became a Harbinger. The development of Ontology’s tech has coincided with growth and enthusiasm within the global community that has blossomed in recent&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>—— <a href="https://twitter.com/dilipishara1990">Dilip</a>, Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySrilankan">Sri Lanka</a> Community</blockquote><p>Ontology recently celebrated the third anniversary of its MainNet (current version 2.2.0) launch. When the team discussed the theme for the third anniversary, two keywords stood out: DID and Data. Some people are still confused by these terms. In the following sections, our Harbingers outline Ontology’s mission from three facets: user, business and developer.</p> Part 1: User-oriented <p>Focusing on users’ needs and real&nbsp;data</p><p>Ontology centers around identity. As early as 2018, “identity” was still a relatively unpopular niche in the blockchain industry. Many people were confused by Ontology’s focus on identity: “Why do we need to pay attention to identity?”, “Don’t we have our own identities, already?” With the concept of decentralized identity becoming more and more popular, technology giants such as Microsoft have begun developing their own decentralized identity protocols. Decentralized identity solutions address the pain points in various industries by using on-chain identity solutions, whilst fostering trust and cooperation. Credit cards and credit scores have become an important part of social life. Good credit can bring many conveniences and even immeasurable value, and can effectively reduce the high cost of dealing with people. At this time, the public’s attention to identity is not limited to ID card, passport, driver’s license and other information, but more concerned about whether they have a universal, glittering and properly protected “pass” in the virtual&nbsp;world.</p><p>Personal data has become immensely valuable in the digital age. Centralized media platforms compete to gather as much user data as they can. The problem is that users are not always aware of how their data are being used (or the kinds of data that are being collected). Centralized storage of private data also invites security risks from bad actors. Ontology’s decentralized identity system, ONT ID, enables users to create a self-sovereign identity on the blockchain. ONT ID, based on the W3C decentralized identification specification, blockchain and cryptography, can quickly identify and connect people, financial assets, and objects. Most importantly, ONT ID is not subject to any centralized authority and gives users complete control over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>A decentralized identity encompasses myriad forms of data. Every day, our activities on the Internet produce a digital footprint. Some data remain secure whereas others may be leaked. It is getting harder and harder to protect data from online attacks. Even the largest multinational corporations and social media platforms are not immune to data theft. At Ontology, we believe that everyone’s data is their most precious resource. Your data constitutes your identity and your portrait. In this context, our goal is to empower users by providing them tools to obtain self-sovereign control of their data. Ontology does not save users’ data like centralized technology companies. Instead, it offers users full control over if and when to share their data with third-parties.</p> Part 2: Business-oriented <p>Ontology’s roadmap and solutions for enterprises</p><p>In April 2018, we released our first <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/elaborating-on-the-ontology-roadmaps-18100c449402">roadmap</a>, which described the principles of our “chain network system” and “trust ecosystem”.</p><p>At that time, we wrote: Ontology has two strategic lines: one is a new generation of high-performance public chain and chain network system, and the other is the distributed trust cooperation platform and ecosystem. Blockchain solves the problem of trust, but its underlying layer cannot satisfy the needs of all participating entities. In order to support business scenarios in the real world, it also needs a large number of common modules to provide various types of distributed trust services that can support real business scenarios, such as a decentralized identity framework (ONT ID), distributed data exchange protocol (DDXF), and distributed credit evaluation system (OScore). Only when these two components are integrated together can we have a distributed collaboration platform that can support real businesses.</p><p>We remain committed to this core vision to provide effective solutions in combination with various real business scenarios. At present, we offer solutions in several sectors including <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">mobile travel</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123?source=collection_detail----5e10d5c26b55-----12-----------------------">inventory and logistics</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-microworkers-partner-to-enhance-global-freelancing-marketplaces-adef34dbe2f9">job market</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/on-the-move-new-adoption-of-ontology-in-the-new-energy-logistics-vehicle-industry-9f46c1da0c4">enterprise data certification</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/250-million-pieces-of-ogq-digital-asset-content-to-be-housed-on-the-ontology-blockchain-428d385092ba">digital content</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">music copyright</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483?source=collection_home---4------2-----------------------">KYC &amp; identity</a>.</p><p>Commenting on Ontology’s breadth of service offerings, our Ontology Harbinger from <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyTradingOfficial">Trading</a>, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySlovakCzech">Czech and Slovak</a> Community, <a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">Dumont</a>&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>Ontology has become a global leader in decentralized identity and data management solutions. It has remained committed to its overarching vision and continues to advance its roadmap. I expect the Ontologyecosystem to continue expanding, incorporating more use-cases and partners, whilst remaining attentive to its online communities.</blockquote> Part 3: Developer-oriented <p>Ontology infrastructure and technology</p><p>We are committed to building an underlying infrastructure platform to provide developers with efficient and easy-to-use practical technology.</p><p>Ontology 2.0, released last year, has the leading advantage of enabling developers to provide complete solutions for enterprises. Wasm-JIT, Multi-VM and Layer 2 technologies are deeply integrated in this version as well as ONT ID 2.0. Based on these cutting-edge technologies, the problems of capacity expansion, performance, compatibility and personal data privacy can be solved easily. The Add-on Store for developers is provided in this version, which enables developers without previous experience in blockchain to start building&nbsp;easily.</p><p>In this year’s MainNet version, after several months of EVM (Ethereum virtual machine) research, design and development, our technology team has introduced an Ontology virtual machine compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It features an account system, virtual machine and Web 3 API. Users can use applications and wallets all-in-one place, based on Ethereum, and developers can use contract development tools such as Truffle and Remix to realize seamless connection and ecosystem expansion of the chain. So far, our Multi-VM supports four kinds of smart contracts (NeoVM, Native, Wasm, EVM), an industry-first. Developers can enjoy Ethereum ecosystem on Ontology chain, with lower gas fees and faster block production.</p><p>In the past three years, we have published technical articles through our social media channels, and continue to educate, helping more community partners understand blockchain technology.</p><blockquote>It has been a pleasure to help Ontology grow over the years. We have cultivated an open and encouraging community that is welcoming of new members and happy to provide support to those with questions about recent developments. I’m excited to see where Ontology goes in the second half of 2021 and&nbsp;beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>——<a href="https://twitter.com/EmilioburFdez">Emilio</a>, Ontology Harbinger, <a href="https://t.me/OntologySpanish">Spanish</a> Community</blockquote><p>Facing users, enterprises and developers, we believe that technology and ideas can enhance all aspects of life. We remain committed to this belief and continue to move forward on the road toward mass adoptions of blockchain and decentralized identity and data management solutions.</p><p>We are very grateful to the Ontology Harbingers for their dedication and enthusiasm towards fostering an open and welcoming global community. We are always looking for passionate people to join us in spreading Ontology’s vision. Recently, we detailed our Harbinger Program v2 to further expand and grow Ontology’s community and ecosystem around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Learn what it takes to become the next Ontology Harbinger with our updated <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">guide</a> and become part of our global community, today!</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.3: Securing Provenance and Trade of Cultural Artifacts, with Dr. James&nbsp;Hester <p>Can blockchain help us maintain and secure the storied value of what we bring into the world? Let’s ask Dr. James Hester, Head of Ontology at Mattereum.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>For this episode, I invited Mattereum’s Head of Ontology, Dr. James Hester, former museum curator and medieval arms and armor expert, to discuss a unique area of the Mattereum project with the curatorial side of things. We discuss the use of Mattereum Asset Passports to secure provenance and trade of cultural artifacts, starting with the launch of passports and NFTs for three distinct historical and cultural artifacts.</p><p>Assets Live on OpenSea: <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr</a></p><p>Track: “Optimist” by Zoe&nbsp;Keating</p>  James Hester’s Journey From the Humanities to Crypto [00:01:02]  The Storied Value of Things [00:03:57]  The Dark Seedy Underbelly of the Art &amp; Antiquities World [00:06:43]  Asset Passports in the World of Antiquities [00:11:13]  Asset Passports Bring Composability to Trade [00:20:47]  Tokenizing Cultural Artifacts [00:22:01]  From Static Inventories to Liquid Markets [00:28:36]  Launch of Three Cultural/Historical Artifact NFTs [00:30:30]  Artifact NFTs in the Marketplace [00:34:51]  The Importance of Innovating Within the Material World [00:36:55]   JAMES HESTER’S JOURNEY FROM THE HUMANITIES TO CRYPTO [00:01:02] <p>Garrison: I’ve been really looking forward to talking to you about the curatorial side of the Mattereum project and the Asset Passports. Would you mind introducing yourself to the listeners and giving a little detail on your background?</p><p>James: Sure. Sure. I’m James Hester I’m Head of Ontology for Mattereum which is a very fancy inflated way of saying I’m in charge of the department that gathers together all of the information about the objects that we onboard and figures out how that information is best presented in the Asset Passport.</p><p>And I came about this position and came to Mattereum through a very kind of roundabout way. I’ve known Vinay for quite some time, for over a decade. And prior to coming here my career was primarily in the museums and heritage world. I’m a historian by training and most of my previous roles have been either in education in museums or in the curatorial collections management side of&nbsp;things.</p><p>My primary role prior to coming on board with Mattereum is I worked in the curatorial department for the Royal Armories museum here in the UK. And the role that I finished up with them is pretty much a dream job if you’re a medieval nerd like myself, which was, I was their curator of collections looking after their collection at the Tower of London. Just a bit of extra background, my particular area of specialty that I trained up in is arms and armor. A lot of my previous work is with antique weapons and armor and that sort of thing. So working at a gig like the tower is pretty much the holy grail of museum gigs for someone such as&nbsp;myself.</p><p>But I then wrapped up a PhD again working with medieval swords, documenting and trying to figure out what we can learn by examining the objects more closely and see what that can tell us about how they were actually&nbsp;used.</p><p>And so on the other end of that, Vinay invited me to come on board with Mattereum because they were looking for somebody who was basically an objects guy. In a company that’s entirely populated by tech types and lawyers and crypto folk, having somebody that had a very firm grounding in how to work with objects, what’s important about them, how to gather and organize the information about them. Vinay saw my skill set as being ideally suited for that. So he brought me on board. So it’s the absolute, last thing I would have expected to do at the other end of a PhD, dealing with medieval swords, but it’s been quite a ride these last three years and it’s been quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s amazing. Having someone who’s like a genuine expert on the kind of museum curatorial side of things that has an eye for historical detail&nbsp;,and detail about these objects, and important information to secure about them moving&nbsp;forward.</p> THE STORIED VALUE OF THINGS [00:03:57] <p>James: Yeah. Because essentially the way I always say it is that a historian at the most basic level is basically a storyteller. It just so happens with the stories they tell happened to be true for the most part. It’s often said that history is an art rather than a science cause it’s not just the kind of gathering and reporting of facts, but it’s the interpretation of them, understanding connections and causality and all that stuff as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And you could really apply the same thing when it comes to working with objects. I’m not a, I’m not a typical kind of hitting the archives, looking at financial records from the 14th century kind of historian. I’ve worked with things. Things are what interests me. And really, what makes things interesting to me and presumably I hope to others is the stories that are behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>It’s what makes something more interesting than say, another exact copy of the same thing that didn’t have the same story. Paper napkins could be exactly the same, come out at the same factory, but one of them suddenly becomes much more significant because once upon a time, Picasso drew a little doodle on one of them and didn’t on the&nbsp;other.</p><p>And so as a result that napkin has an aspect of its story that makes it just a little bit more interesting to many people. And personally, I think all objects when it comes to trying to understand them and in the case of what we do here, trying to document them, it’s a matter of teasing out that&nbsp;story.</p><p>What is it about these objects that makes them interesting. Obviously from a commercial standpoint, what is it about these interesting facts that could perhaps make them more valuable than other examples of the same thing? And so it’s this process of chipping away and teasing out that story and then learning how to build it in a way that you can present it properly to other&nbsp;people.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. And it’s the challenge of maintaining that story or protecting that story around these objects over time. That’s at the heart of a lot of friction in the arts and antiquities trade. You hear stories all the time. There’s a story that you sent me of a small museum in France where over half of its collection were forgeries and they spent like almost $200,000 to acquire those paintings. And you hear stories like that all the&nbsp;time.</p><p>It’s a challenge to keep a track of the story around any object, whether it’s a cultural artifact or&nbsp;not.</p><p>James: Yeah, absolutely. As you say, you have situations where unless people are really carefully maintaining a record about an object, then, it may be very well-documented as to its past, but then yeah just no one keeps up that process. And so over time it’s it’s later history falls through the cracks and then falls to other people later down the line to have to backtrack and try to rediscover this because people didn’t keep the fire burning, so to&nbsp;speak.</p> THE DARK SEEDY UNDERBELLY OF THE ART &amp; ANTIQUITIES WORLD [00:06:43] <p>And then also you’re absolutely right. That in a world where it is the stories that make an item valuable there’s of course the temptation to make up stories about things in order to artificially create value for things that aren’t actually valuable in the same way as ones where those stories are&nbsp;true.</p><p>And this is the great seedy underbelly of the kind of art and antiquities worlds that’s just gone on forever. Like so many things it’s an arms race, it’s a constant back and forth of the industry finding ways in order to better authenticate and deter fraud and prevent fraud to happen. And as soon as these new measures are released and put into play, people are already well underway of trying to figure out ways to undermine them and get around them and that just goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And up until now a good deal what cuts through that essentially amounts to what an old mentor of mine just used to refer to as connoisseurship, the ability in this world, which has historically been very traditional and I wouldn’t go so far as to say neophobic because they do make use of new technologies when they come up. They take their time in kind of fully appreciating them because they’re very old establishment. They’re used to doing things in a certain way. “Thank you very much. And it’s been just fine for centuries.”</p><p>They’re used to doing things the kind ofslow, tried and true way. And so in that world, a good deal of the what cuts through the dross and tries to arrive at the truth is essentially informed scholarly opinion about these things. These are your great experts and your great dealers and your specialists in these areas that your art historians who make very considered informed pronouncements about objects. And these are pretty much held to be gospel until new information comes to light that might either update or upend it. It’s very similar process to I suppose the sciences or academia where it kind of trickles ahead as new information comes to light and as kind of specialists stand on the shoulders of giants and build up more of an understanding about things. Which it works quite well, but we are human and humans are fallible.</p><p>So at times even the most skilled expert can make a bad call or not have all the information to hand. It’s a good system, but it’s not a perfect one. And unfortunately we’re getting into a world where we’re dealing in these objects in a much more fast paced environment. The online sale world compared to your trusted local dealer or the auction house having the ability to have a solid understanding about what could potentially be dodgy and what seems right. Having the ability to make that call right then and there, as opposed to having to take the time to seek out an expert and rely upon their assessments and everything becomes trickier. And even for things such as the illicit trade and in art and artifacts, there are very well established mechanisms in place, but they’re not&nbsp;perfect.</p><p>So for example, the two kind of paragons of the criminal activity revolving around the art and antiques trade is the art loss register on one hand and the Interpol art theft database on the other. And so these are the two go-to places where most museums and galleries and auction houses, if anything comes through there as part of their due diligence checks to make sure that everything’s above board with the objects, they’ll typically run it through one or both of these databases to see whether or not a flag comes back saying this is recorded as stolen, or this has been recorded as having some suspicious provenance where could have been, say, spoils of war or illegally trafficked or this has been flagged as a known forgery and that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>So that’s usually the first port of call and they’re very comprehensive. They’re very well-trusted. They’re industry standards. But they’re not perfect because all they’re able to do is give people a certificate saying that at the time that they were asked to check, there were no red flags about the subject in their database.</p><p>Something could flag up the day after and it would be, it wouldn’t necessarily have an impact on that because it will have fell out of that immediate purview. So there’s little things like this that make it not a perfect system. And it’s all the more prone to failure in a very fast paced environment.</p> ASSET PASSPORTS IN THE WORLD OF ANTIQUITIES [00:11:13] <p>Garrison: So that brings us to new solutions that are designed with existing institutions in mind in terms of how they think and the details that would be necessary for them to actually use such a system. With Mattereum, we have the Asset Passports, the bedrock that everything else has kind of built on top of. And there are many use cases that arise from that. Could you describe what an asset passport&nbsp;is?</p><p>James: I guess the easiest way to describe an asset passport is essentially container for batches of information about an object, all of which are backed by warranties provided by the people who give that information. So it draws information from as many different sources as can be found and as are able to offer up information. So it allows you to get a completely comprehensive view of what an object is. Not just in terms of its description, but every relevant bit of information related to the object. So things like compliance standards, authenticity paperwork, research records, you name it. If there’s something that’s connected to an object, it can be represented in the Asset Passport and we can draw that information from as many different sources as there&nbsp;are.</p><p>So what that allows us to do is build not only a very comprehensive picture about the object, but also a very — I’m gonna use the magic blockchain word, decentralized — picture about this object, because we’re able to draw it from multiple parties. Not all of which will necessarily be the seller who has a financial interest in bigging up the&nbsp;object.</p><p>So it allows us to kind of source information from loads and loads of neutral parties which greatly reduces the possibility of bias or outright fraud sneaking into the object’s record. The people that provide this information we refer to as Certifiers. So every Certifier who weighs in on some aspect of the object presents their information in the form of a warranty on the accuracy of that information. And they set all their different terms of their warranty, and they can customize that however they want. So they set what the maximum liability they’re willing to assume connected to the warranty. So in the event that there’s a dispute about it, this is how much they’re willing to pay up to in damages if the information causes consequential loss. They’re of course able to ask a fee in exchange for providing this warranty. So they set that, and then all the other terms, like how long the warranty is good for before it needs renewing, et cetera, et cetera. So we gather together all of these warranty backed bits of information, and we stick them all in the passport each in their own&nbsp;section.</p><p>And somebody who has some kind of interaction with the object, whether it’s a buyer, but not just a buyer, this could easily be say a courier for the object who needs to be certain about certain aspects of it as part of their paperwork or insurance and stuff. Or if someone wants to securitize it or tokenize it or do any other number of things where part of doing whatever it is they’re doing they need to be certain about certain bits of the object. They then can subscribe to any or all of these warranties on the information before they either buy or otherwise interact with the object. And so when they do, they’re protected by these for any of their for their activities. And then down the line, if something comes to light where some of the information turns out to be inaccurate, then there’s a dispute resolution system that kicks in where we have arbitration panel at the highest end that will examine all of the evidence and come to a decision as to whether or not either party was in the wrong, or the claim had merit or not, and then decides whether or not there’s any kind of recompense that’s to be dealt out as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>And so our hope is that mechanism does two things. One, by virtue of it being as rigorous as it is — because we try to be very rigorous in terms of the standards by which the information is gathered — we hope that acts to deter attempts to bring fraudulent information into the system, just because people know from the outset that they’re taking responsibility, and indeed financial responsibility for this stuff for anything they put down in there. So we hope that’s enough to deter people from trying to play a funny business with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Skin in the&nbsp;game.</p><p>James: Exactly, Exactly. But at the same time, unfortunately, we can put up a universe of deterrants and people are still gonna try to jump the fence and try to pull a fast one now and again. So when that happens and it is discovered, the other mechanism kicks in, which is our rock solid lines of accountability, as far as who is responsible for what in terms of the information.</p><p>So if somebody does remain undeterred by our standards and still tries to sneak faulty or fraudulent information into the system. When that is found out they’re on a hook they can’t wriggle off of and they’re going to be responsible for that quite possibly financially. Our hope is that that combination has sufficient teeth that it will deter and reduce kind of fraud in the system for objects that go through our ecosystem.</p><p>I can relate a couple — we were very pleased about a month ago that our system seems to be functioning properly. I won’t go into specific details of course, but we had two customers who initially came to us with some very interesting objects of quite high value. One a museum grade piece of natural history and the other was an old master painting that was valued at at least eight&nbsp;figures.</p><p>Garrison: Wow.</p><p>James: yeah, so it was both of which were like nontrivial objects and we gave them the general rundown of: okay here’s the information we need, here’s how we need it to be packaged for us. Go away and gather this and this under these standards, here are going to be the terms. And so they went away to start gathering the information. And within a few days, both of them wrote to us very cordially of course saying that unfortunately they were going to have to back out because in the process of doing the work we asked them to&nbsp;, information came to light that cast some doubt on to the authenticity of the objects. They were, out of a sense of discretion, decided okay, we’re not going to take a chance on these so sadly, we’re going to have to bow&nbsp;out.</p><p>Obviously that’s unfortunate because, they’re two customers that we would like to have worked with, but at the same time I’d be lying if I didn’t say it was quite exciting because it means our mechanisms are actually working. It’s making people, making people really do the work where I think in some other cases, people motivated by the potential kind of commercial value of it might just be tempted to cut some quarters or phone in and be like, “Oh yeah, I’m sure it’ll be&nbsp;fine.”</p><p>It made them stop and think twice about: is this really worth it? And they decided it wasn’t. So to me, in a way that kind of proves that at least to a limited extent, the standards that we’re trying to establish are doing their&nbsp;jobs.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s great. I like how within the Asset Passport creation process and how it functions — because it’s basically like a living document. It’s not a static thing. around it can change the information within it can change, but there’s a cryptographically secure evidence chain of any alterations or new developments around&nbsp;it.</p><p>James: Exactly. So you can never change the records in there. You can just add on to them and amend them. And because it goes up on the blockchain, you have a nice clean kind of digital paper trail as to what information was added when, and by whom and all of that. So you can see when information was added, which from a kind of collections management standpoint is really quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>And this is a point that I talk about with my museum colleagues a lot is the use of the blockchain in this function is that kind of like records management could potentially be hugely useful for people in the museums or the kind of the antiques trade for doing their due diligence checks, which is usually an extraordinarily tedious and lengthy task because the typical rules, for museums and dealers and auction houses at any, anytime an object comes into their possession, even if for museums, it’s a loan. So it’s not even a new acquisition. The receiving body is required to do a due diligence check, which is basically to track the thing’s provenance from now as far back as humanly possible, ideally to the things creation. Which obviously for super old objects is just a nonstarter, but it’s to go back as far as we have reasonable records to&nbsp;go.</p><p>And that process, even if it’s well understood, even if these are very high-profile objects, that process has to be repeated in some way shape or form every single time this object changes hands. Just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s the bane of curators. Just to do this&nbsp;task.</p><p>So the possibility of having an objects provenance record to date securely stored somewhere like a blockchain means that for due diligence checks, you could simply produce the evidence of the existence of that record on the blockchain up to a certain date, along with the warranties or the vouchers that it’s accurate and well-documented information. So at that point, the remainder of the due diligence check is just filling in any potential gap from then to now, which makes the job significantly easier. So usually when I tell my colleagues about this, their eyes start to grow very large and excited cause it would really be quite a huge improvement to what is otherwise at the moment a very tiring&nbsp;task.</p> ASSET PASSPORTS BRING COMPOSABILITY TO TRADE [00:20:47] <p>Beyond just the kind of the selling of objects, the passporting technology and the use of the blockchain for object records management has so many wide wider implications that would be really useful just in the field in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Garrison: And something that I find really interesting is how the asset passport it’s not a singular thing. There’s many different facets to it. But the way you’re able to kind of program value flows around an object as well as social interaction. So like the social protocols around certification and trade and vaulting all this stuff, has a nexus from which it operates. To kind of dig into things you can build on top of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We covered one: there’s the more decentralized version of expert certification you mentioned earlier. One phrase that’s come up to describe that is a Trust Communities, which to people who are familiar with blockchain and some blockchain concepts. You can think of it as like a mini DAO but it’s a mini DAO around certifying the authenticity of an object over So it’d be really interesting to see how that kind of evolves. And the use cases that surround&nbsp;that.</p> TOKENIZING CULTURAL ARTIFACTS [00:22:01] <p>And then there’s another thing that’s really important to mention is the tokenization. You also mentioned that briefly. Could you describe how an object, once an Asset Passport has been generated, how does it become tokenized? How does it become an NFT that you can see on a marketplace?</p><p>James: Sure, Sure. A bit of history first: the original incarnation, if you will, of Mattereum, the Asset Passport was essentially the standalone creation. We were aware of the existence of obviously of tokenization and another things that were kicking around in the ecosystem at the time but our plan at that point was to allow the Asset Passport to become this base foundation layer that really just nails down what an underlying object is. And then people could then take that and do all sorts of other clever stuff on top of that. And they could do the tokenization, securitization and everything, having a lot more solid confidence and understanding as to what the underlying object beneath all of that actually&nbsp;was.</p><p>So originally our plan was to leave all that other clever stuff to other people and we would just provide that nice solid foundation underlayer. And it’s only been more recently that we’ve taken another look at the notion of the NFT and thought about the possibilities that it could have being made a slightly more integral part of the process. So that’s in the kind of, I guess you’d call it the MK II version of the Asset Passport, where it is now a more integrated part of the process rather than this extra things that aside. Because we’re dealing with actual, real physical objects, as opposed to a kind of digital objects, which most of the NFTs that people are hearing about that are all the rage at the moment, it’s mainly kind of digital property that’s being represented by these things. For us, the underlying properties, actual, tangible, physical objects, we took a slightly different approach to conceiving what the NFT is and how it functions. The easiest way I tend to explain it is, for us an NFT functions as kind of something like a cross between a warehouse receipt and a vault key, if you&nbsp;will.</p><p>As you said, first, we create the Asset Passport for the object, it’s complete, comprehensive definition of what the thing is in all respects. So once we have that foundational layer, then we create, we mint the NFT which is paired to that object. And the fact that act has been done becomes yet another warranty in the passport. So there’s a whole separate warranty about the NFT creation saying a unique non fungible token has been created that is paired to this object, and only this object, and we have all the details about the NFT and the mechanisms that we’ve designed in order to verify that this entity corresponds to exactly this object and vice versa. So that’s all into that warranty. And then, one of our requirements is that in order for that NFT to be live, that is, to be able to be sold and transferred, what have you. The object itself has to actually be out of circulation. It has to be securely vaulted in a neutral suitably secure facility.</p><p>So for a lot of the objects that we’re dealing with this tends to be things like specialized art storage warehouses of which there are many around the world that fulfill this service. These same places will house other types of objects: wine, luxury goods, pretty much anything within reason of certain exceptions, of course. And there’s loads of different places that provide that service for different classes of objects. Once we have evidence from the object’s owner that the object has been securely vaulted essentially out of their immediate custody, then we activate the NFT. And the reason we do that is it in a way it’s just as much for their kind of protection and reduction of risk as it is for the potential buyers, because what it takes off the table is any possibilities of either side either accusing or being accused of trying to pull a bait and switch saying, this isn’t the object that it’s supposed to be, that was delivered to me. Or reduces any accusations of NFT owners saying, “I went to try to claim the actual object and the owner refused to give it to me.” And all these potential headaches that could come from redeeming a digital item in order to take possession of a physical&nbsp;item.</p><p>While the NFT is out in the world, being sold or transferred, the object itself is safely stored somewhere that greatly reduces if not eliminates the possibility of the owner trying to pull a fast one at the last minute. So once somebody purchases that NFT, what that entitles them to most of the time — because the advantages, because the NFT business is such a new thing we have the ability to basically customize what the terms of the NFT are to whatever people want which is quite nice. But generally speaking, our default is that a possession of the NFT entitles that person to take physical custody of the object if they so&nbsp;choose.</p><p>So the NFT owner has two things that they can do with the NFT. They can continue to sell on the NFT which is obviously more liquid than trying to sell the physical object. So it can pass around as many hands on various auction sites. Basically it can travel at the speed of the internet through as many hands as you can imagine. Until at one point, somebody who has the thing decides that they actually want the physical object. At which point they redeem the NFT, at which point it is frozen and rendered unable to be transferred around.</p><p>And then that person can either walk up to wherever it’s being stored and pick it up in person or arrange to have it delivered or what have you. So they take control of the object. You can think of it as a one in one out scenario where, if you imagine this dichotomy between the object and its corresponding NFT, whenever one of them is out in the world, the other one is safely stored away or rendered dormant. So then later down the line, if our person who has picked up their object decides that they want to sell the NFT again, they simply repeat the exact same process. They vault the object, notify us that it has been done so, at which point we then can reactivate the NFT and the whole process can repeat itself&nbsp;again.</p><p>And that can go back and forth for the entire life of the&nbsp;object.</p> FROM STATIC INVENTORIES TO LIQUID MARKETS [00:28:36] <p>Garrison: Yeah, that’s great. And it also seems like there’s a, a pretty good value proposition here for museums and galleries um, to Turn like they’re illiquid inventory and stock, and actually be able to create a market for&nbsp;it.</p><p>James: Yeah, I’ve been hearing kind of early noises about this from some of the big museums. Especially with the pandemic, a lot of museums are quite in dire straits in terms of funding and stuff. So they’re all looking for ways to try to replenish their coffers. And I have heard that there are some that are trying to dip their toes into the NFT pool to see what kind of possibilities could exist. And so there are some who are essentially selling either individual one-off or kind of small batch, limited edition runs of NFTs that are somehow tied to say a very prominent work of art. And obviously it doesn’t grant the NFT owner the ability to take ownership of the work of art, but it grants them kind of certain rights to say reproduce images of it or&nbsp;display.</p><p>In other ways it almost acts as basically a kind of sexy digital, new version of the kind of patronage system where they become a better factor towards the well-being of that work of art. And perhaps they’re recognized somewhere as a result of that. And as a result of all that being tied to an NFT, that person has the ability to sell on that benefit package much more easily than if say they were a trustee or, a normal kind of donor to a museum. So Yeah. There’s a lot of exploration being done apart from just NFT equals you being able to take possession of the object as far as some of the other kind of rights and benefits that can be conferred that places like museums are looking into. So yeah, there’s a universe of possibilities that this could be of immense benefit to the industry.</p> LAUNCH OF THREE CULTURAL/HISTORICAL ARTIFACT NFTS [00:30:30] <p>Garrison: Coming up here as soon, Mattereum is launching an NFT collection. Three very distinctive and diverse artifacts. Could you go into detail about&nbsp;that?</p><p>James: Yes. Yes. Everyone has those moments when you know even if you enjoy your job, everyone has those tasks that are given you as part of work where you get to really just truly play. And this was that for me is essentially Vinay gave me a very generous budget and told me to go shopping. He says, “James, you know the art and antiques market, you have a, decent tastes and decent kind of breadth of knowledge of different things. Here’s a generous chunk of money. Go and acquire three cool objects for the company for us to passport and use as Guinea pigs for you know, applying the Asset Passport to this&nbsp;sector.</p><p>I get to go on a shopping spree and it was marvelous. And I was quite happy with the objects that I came across. So as you say, there were three&nbsp;objects.</p><p>One of them is a limited edition. I believe this one is number three of a run of 20 etching signed and numbered by none other than Salvador Dali, very famous modern&nbsp;artist.</p><p>Another was a bronze statuette of the Tibetan Buddhist wrathful deity Acala. That one was dating from we reckon the turn of the 19th century, early 20th century. So it was a really spectacular piece of this wrathful Buddhist deity. I’m sure there’ll be pictures available so you can take a closer look at it yourself, or indeed you can see the Asset Passports when they&nbsp;launch.</p><p>And then the third one, which I think has everybody quite excited, was a stone hand axe. Like a prehistoric flint chipped axe that’s meant to be grasped in the hand and is used as a basic tool that was found in an excavation I believe sometime in the early 20th century if memory serves in France, in Southern France that is dated to roughly we reckon somewhere between 350 and 500,000 years old. And it’s a truly spectacular piece. It’s an amazing condition. The workmanship is truly impressive. And these things came to my house before they were brought off, sent off to art storage. So I get the chance to do like a proper inspection and to hold them myself. And that was the one that really kind of made my hair stand up on end, like actually holding this tool. That’s, you know, some of our earliest hominid ancestors and someone had made this thing almost half a million years ago in France. It’s quite a spectacular piece.</p><p>Garrison: It’s also crazy to think about. A weird way to frame it, but like the atoms that make up that hand axe are older than probably any other material that surrounds you, whether it’s apartment or the neighborhood, it’s just this object from a very long, distant past that’s, impossible for us to even, you know, conceptualize like kind of timeline.</p><p>James: And when you stop and think about it, when you have something that’s like capital O old like that, and you hold that in your hands and you think, Okay, on the one hand, half a million years is a long time, but when you also stop and think about it, the fact that we’ve gone from a half a million years to building rather impressive but far from primitive stone tools, to space travel, being fairly routine, computers in our pockets that are millions of times more powerful than than anything even our parents generations could have imagined growing up. Going from there to where we are now in the space of half a million years from the wider picture of things, that’s the blink of an&nbsp;eye.</p><p>That’s a rather impressive to think. And I’m very fond of saying to Vinay that I find this whole process quite cool that we’re taking what is arguably one of mankind’s oldest and earliest kind of tools and we’re onboarding it and presenting it to the world through the medium of one of mankind’s most current kind of cutting edge tools and technologies.</p><p>So in a way it’s like book-ending human ingenuity really.</p> ARTIFACT NFTS IN THE MARKETPLACE [00:34:51] <p>Garrison: How will people interact with these NFTs and these Asset Passports, like in practice once these are launched and active. How do people actually interface with&nbsp;them?</p><p>James: Most people will be familiar with where you go to find listings for NFT sales and auctions. Most notably places like OpenSea, for example. So the NFTs themselves will be listed in the normal marketplaces for these things. And once you go to the listing for these objects, in the description you will find explanation to the fact that this object has also been issued with a Mattereum Asset Passport, and it provides a link where you can go and visit the passport.</p><p>And that’s actually an important part of ensuring the security of making sure that the passport is forever tied to that specific NFT and vice versa. So we use what we call a bi-directional link mechanism. As I said, if you go to the NFT listing for the object, you will find the link to that object’s Asset Passport. So you click on it from there and it’ll take you to the Asset Passport and in the Asset Passport, in addition to as I mentioned before the warranty asserting that the NFT has been created and here’s the terms of the NFT and all of that, there is also a link in the passport, which takes you to where the NFT is listed. So a way of verifying that you’re not dealing with either a fraudulent NFT or a fraudulent Asset Passport is to go through that whole loop. So say from the NFT listing, you click on the link to the passport, you go to the passport and then from the passport, you click on the link to go to the NFT listing. It should take you back right where you started. And we do that so it prevents the ability to try to slot a shoddy NFT or passport in between that process, because it’s baked in from the start. Both are created at the same time at the point of launch. So that’s the way we verify that this NFT is inextricably tied to this Asset Passport and its&nbsp;object.</p> THE IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATING WITHIN THE MATERIAL WORLD [00:36:55] <p>Garrison: Yeah so we’re coming up on the hour here. I think we covered quite a bit. I think this is a very exciting use case for NFTs and a lot of people focus on like the digital art side things, and there’s some, you know, multimedia with music and stuff that are quite interesting, but having something that deals with the material world which is something this show is very, particularly focused on. New ways to kind of program value flows and structure social interaction — these protocols around goods and services, to secure trade and make it more efficient, more accessible, more ethical production and consumption and stuff like&nbsp;that.</p><p>All of this stuff arises from this kind of, infrastructure that’s being laid out. So it’s really exciting.</p><p>James: Yeah, I agree because, I maybe I’m biased having spent my life working with tangible things, but I have the sense that we have this new this new technology, which has immense potential, but I think the danger is if we fall into the trap of allowing this technology to allow us to become even more, I suppose ethereal in our lives than we already&nbsp;are.</p><p>There’s so much of our lives that already that’s intangible and not basically just exists as bits in a computer. And of course that has its uses, but it’s also, to me, it’s a point of weakness at times, because it means that, when you come right down to it, it’s&nbsp;air.</p><p>So to me, I think it’s while it’s important that we use the technologies in those areas in order to improve it, I think it’s also important that we use this in order to perhaps better ground ourselves in our physical world. Because, until we start uploading our brains to computers, we exist in Terra firma and we better get used to&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so I think using it in order to better our relationship with the physical world and the physical things around us is I think an equally important use for this than just making things more digital and more ephemeral. I think that’s a side of things that until recently has become, has been underappreciated. One of the reasons that I’ve felt so drawn to Mattereum is Mattereum seems to recognize that’s just as important. So it’s a banner that I’m prepared to&nbsp;carry.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, I agree. Designer David Rudnick calls this Digital Prime versus Physical Prime thinking, and in crypto is largely Digital Prime mentality. It’s all about digital value around these different assets, but, you know, projects such as, you know, Mattereum and others that are emerging are trying to leverage this technology to improve, you know, physical conditions and secure physical trade of goods, which is the vast majority of all the value on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>James: It’s the single most human activity and it’s not going anywhere anytime&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Garrison: yeah, it’s a really exciting to see what people build moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>James: Thanks. Yes, definitely.</p><p>Garrison: All right. It was a pleasure to have you on the&nbsp;show.</p><p>James: Oh, it was a pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me Garrison.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. And I’ll definitely poke you to come back on down the line your, yeah. Your perspective is very unique um in terms of your uh, in terms of your background.</p><p>James: The token humanities refugee in a sea of tech and crypto people.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. Fantastic.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-3-161aaa2b1937">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep.3:</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

All music courtesy of Zoe&nbsp;Keating.</p><p>For this episode, I am joined by Michael Parenti, also known as Exiled Surfer. He’s the comms strategist at Mattereum and core contributor to the Bitcoin DeFi Platform, Sovryn.</p><p>I’m also joined by Penguin Heilman, founder of Defiant Pixel Society and Never Touch Fiat Again, an art project that uses Mattereum Passports to bind gold bars to digital art NFTs. In this conversation, we cover a wide variety of topics, from the value of gold to the prospect of bringing gold and other commodities to the blockhain. We then get into the form, function, and philosophy of the NTFA project. As well as the transformative potential of NFTs and blockchain in the art&nbsp;world.</p> On the Value of This Yellow Rock [00:00:56] <p>Once upon a time, there was an explosion. Two neutron rich stars collided in a death-spiral dance, creating a supernova. Within the cosmic dust clouds and gamma ray burst from the celestial explosion were neutron rich heavy elements, including an elemental dust. Shiny, yellowish in color, and malleable.</p><p>In time this dust found its way across the universe and was woven into the masses of planets, asteroids, and other celestial bodies. On one particular planet this shiny yellow rock caught the eye of a curious and crafty homosapien, thus beginning our strange relationship and affinity to&nbsp;gold.</p><p>For millennia cultures across the world have ascribed value to gold in numerous forms: from collectibles fashioned into jewelry, to physical coinage, to global reserve currency,to inflation hedge in turbulent economic times. Before the abandonment of the gold standard gold reserves held by central banks formed a much larger portion of the monetary base, the backing value of issued fiat currency. Since then the proportion of fiat issue to gold with held collectively by banks has risen dramatically.</p><p>In December 2019, the amount of money issued above the value of gold held in reserve reached $25.25 trillion.</p><p>So I just wanted to set the stage. Short history of gold from, big bang to the present day. It’s a very interesting subject that you can tie into global monetary policy to inflation hedge in a pandemic.</p><p>Penguin: So if I may kind kick off the question about some of the important use of gold aside from what you stated the most obvious to me as a computer user is the use of gold in electronics. And the fact that we’ve got 48 billion connected devices this year, and each one of them has about $2 worth of gold in it. Gold is so critical for making all the electronics for the lack of corrosion, the way that the efficiency of the conductors is critical to pretty much every connected device, as well as any regular device, even without a connection. So TVs, smartphones, even the ATM machine that you get paper currency out of has a dependency on gold and gold is also extremely used in the industrial space. So every space rocket that we send out there, every space mission is dependent upon gold for aerospace parts. So aside from just looking pretty, the material properties of gold have limitless applications to our everyday lives that we can’t live without. So, it’s understandable that it was such a critical part of monetary policy, even before we understood how to use it fully, because we can’t create more of&nbsp;it.</p><p>The uses are pretty much limitless and it’s really hard to replicate. So those are some of the key reasons it’s been valued since we started digging it out of the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah I think it’s fascinating that it has so many uses or that we’ve found so many uses for it over literally thousands of years. That kind of scale and variety is something that not many elements actually&nbsp;share.</p><p>The Bretton Woods Agreement was an attempt to establish like the first global monetary system. It was post-WWII, the idea was that the USD would be the main currency establishing foreign exchange rates. The idea at the time was that the USD was backed by gold and that was kind of part of the negotiation around that. And then in seventies you have this kind of deviation from the gold standard, and this might move away from a more asset backed economy to a debt based one. So I was wondering if you Michael or you Penguin have any thoughts on that kind of shift in terms of it being kind of like a very fundamental seismic change in the systems that inform our lives&nbsp;today.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: I don’t think that gold is ever going to go away as a means of exchange or a store of value because of all the properties that Penguin listed first of all. But I think the use case can, find alternatives with technological solutions like we see with&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>I don’t think that Bitcoin will ever replace gold as well. Because of all of the properties that, that we’re familiar with: the scarcity of supply, the deflationary aspect of it. We can’t really say that gold is deflationary. It’s really an economic question of how much is being, mined which is also controlled by cartels and eventually we’ll get off the planet and there’ll be other gold. It’s not the only gold in the universe. So I think that both have their use cases. Monetary value is like any other value, it’s a consensus, right? So it’s a shared, it’s a shared consensus. It’s a shared illusion. And I think what’s interesting about cryptocurrency now is you can “Choose Your Illusion” basically to quote the Guns ‘n Roses album so to speak, right. Not use your illusion, but choose your illusion. So the question becomes what things are gold good for, what things cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin good for? What are the specific use cases for&nbsp;them?</p><p>I think that gold will always have a cultural relevance across the planet. We’re experiencing the building of a new social consensus which has been enabled by electronic technology. What is really interesting about that is that ability to mine Bitcoin, or to create a hash or call a hash or do a Bitcoin transaction also depends on gold, so to speak&nbsp;,because this it’s a technological solution that depends on computers which use&nbsp;gold.</p> Asset vs. Debt-based Economy | Challenge of Deflationary Financial Systems [00:07:54] <p>Penguin: I also want to kind of touch on the asset versus debt-based relationship&nbsp;, basically a trust-based economy versus an asset based economy provides. So with a asset-based economy, it’s naturally deflationary, right? We’re not making more gold. We can dig more of the gold, but there’s a finite amount. And the amount in circulation is dependent upon how much people have done, but things like a debt based economy is entirely based on trust. So the World Bank prints money. They say, this is how much money we think you can reliably pay back. And the payback mechanism is also based on trust. You get a credit rating based on how reliably you’re able to maintain your&nbsp;debt.</p><p>So if we’re talking about Ethereum and crypto and Bitcoin, it’s really critical for it to be trustless and to not have someone telling you the value of it because everyone needs to use it. Everyone needs to establish that marking and basis for what they say is the asset value. So where something like gold, it’s a hard asset. You actually have to transfer a physical item or rights to that physical item. It’s not simply changing bits on a spreadsheet. Hard assets are unique in the fact that they’re non fungible a lot of times. Like this specific gold bar, when we’re pairing it with art, is going to be like this specific gold bar. It’s weight is not reflective, but they are still fungible in the fact that a hundred grams of gold is a hundred grams of&nbsp;gold.</p><p>And so we’ll have that kind of standard for value by using gold versus if I give you a hundred dollars in 10 years there’s no telling how much that a hundred dollars is going to be due to inflation.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So I think that brings up an interesting point when we’re talking about asset-based or debt-based economics. Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary currency, a deflationary asset. And this puts it in direct contrast with inflation in terms of borrowing.</p><p>So in addition to working at Mattereum I work together with a decentralized finance platform called Sovryn. And we were talking yesterday about how it is that we could increase people borrowing Bitcoin in a bull market because people like to borrow Bitcoin in a bear market because it’s going to go up. But they don’t really want to borrow it in a bull market because you might have to pay back more and nobody’s really solved this I think yet in the crypto space: how it is borrowing a deflationary asset is going to work. The models aren’t there yet. I guess there’ll be some sort of derivative token that you’re borrowing that’s backed by your Bitcoin would probably be the most logical solution. So kind of things that like BlockFi does. They’re essentially paying yield on loans based on stable coins, centralized stable&nbsp;coins.</p><p>So, so that’s sort of like a stop gap solution. And, if you, I guess we’re talking about how to get to Bitcoin backed stable coins to solve that issue, but I don’t know. What do you think Penguin? How do you think that, that borrowing can work with a deflationary base money standard?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. So when we get into really complex things like that, there’s a lot of kind of moving parts, especially with like arbitrage opportunities in different platforms, having the same kind of assets. So we kind of see that the market naturally find an equilibrium and that arbitrage is like really critical to keeping everything fair and balanced.</p><p>So, when prices go up, people will see the gap in other places and want to buy there because they know it’s cheaper here. It should actually be this price. And so as that programmatic balance gets established, I think things like deflationary tokens they increase over time. It’s not a great idea to borrow a deflationary token when you could use your holding in the deflationary token to borrow a stable token. And so in that way, usually I will peg my holdings and then you can borrow based on if you think that the assets are going to go up and down. There’s a whole bunch of different DeFi tools for things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: I think one of the most interesting things that I’m seeing in the DeFi space is that people are borrowing now just enough on their crypto holdings to be in debt so that they have no capital gains to be paid, which is a very, savvy approach and pretty much how it is that oligarchic money continues to exist through generations is that we have this debt-based economy and debt-based taxation. We’re not doing something like Tobin taxation, which would be much more logical, just a micro taxation on every transaction, whatever currency or asset it was. At the point of transaction there’s still this, intention that people’s gains should be taxed. And that’s also part of the roots of Bitcoin, the libertarian ideals of anti taxation and things like that. So I think these sort of developments in the space really interesting.</p> Bringing Gold and Other Commodities to Crypto Using Real-World Asset NFTs [00:13:37] <p>But what we should probably be talking about Penguin you and I, is we started the dialogue I guess at the beginning of the year on how it is that we could use Mattereum’s Asset Passport technology to, enable the frictionless movement of gold together with Lohko. And now that’s come to fruition. But let’s talk about the essential underpinnings of why it is that we’re attempting to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>And what’s the logic behind&nbsp;it?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. So, I mean real-world assets being governed and managed by smart contracts is the main thing that kind of brought us together and is like an application for owning data. So Bitcoin itself has a limited use case. We’re using like Ethereum for a lot of our tokenization and rights managements, specifically using the Mattereum Passports to help control the warranty and claims process and kind of all the legal process is established in the passports, which do the legal paperwork for saying: this NFT and this wallet are now the owner of these real world assets. So by using the technology and ownership that cryptography and like Bitcoin kind of revolutionized, we’re now taking that ownership to the Ethereum layer and like wrapping Bitcoin and we can then purchase usable ownable tokens that we’re pairing with gold in this instance.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Yeah. And so the reason behind that Garrison is, we can go back to the “all boats rise and fall with the price of Bitcoin in crypto,” right? So Bitcoin is supposedly an uncorrelated asset to the degree to which that’s actually true or not has a lot to do with perception of Bitcoin at any given&nbsp;moment.</p><p>But essentially Bitcoin has also its own oligarchy of people that got in from the beginning, who got it free on Bitcoin faucets or got it when it was at 12 cents or 32 cents and were foresightful enough to hold it for the years where they have 30%, 30000% gains and whatever. So we call them whales in the space, people who have large holdings and Ethereum was the first ICO actually in the cryptocurrency space, it was launched on&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>You had to be able to use Bitcoin and have Bitcoin to buy into the genesis sale of Ethereum. So all of the early Ethereum people were essentially Bitcoiners. Some outsiders came in and outside investment as well, made their way through Bitcoin and able to get Ethereum.. But still everything rises and falls on Bitcoin’s performance and how it is that whales and large holders are arbitraging in the market against stable coins or against Ethereum or other assets as well. I mean, there’s numerous ones now that are available for people to, to, play the big casino with. So the logic behind bringing gold into the system is pairing the two hardest money assets that we have right now on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>So solid physical gold, Bitcoin with its capped supply, and it’s hash rate from proof of work security securing the network. It’s taking those two use cases and qualities of money and pairing them together on a second layer solution which is the metadata that’s tied to an NFT that resides on the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>And so it’s a very hybrid construction. You have the hard money of gold. You have the hard money qualities of Bitcoin, and you have the programmable money layer of Ethereum. And you bring all those three things together. And what you’re doing is you’re creating a frictionless, permissionless, borderless ability to arbitrage in and out of fiat, into crypto and between&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>And so it brings essentially gold as a commodity into the crypto space. And hopefully over time reduces volatility is essentially the argument. If the only commodity in crypto is Bitcoin, then of course, there’s these fluctuations. But if you bring gold into the equation, then we’re reducing volatility of cryptocurrency and making it something that’s more, more attractive to&nbsp;people.</p><p>Further on, Mattereum Asset Passports can obviously be used for real estate. So this is probably the most important commodity to bring into the ecosystem into the sector, is real estate and gold. If that makes any&nbsp;sense.</p><p>Garrison: Absolutely. The physical asset economy is like trillions of dollars. It’s absolutely massive. currently dwarfs the market cap of crypto as a whole quite a bit. So like the prospect of being able to bridge those two, we’re able to bring, real estate on chain, gold on chain. The way that will kind of manifest in DeFi maturing DeFi, bringing more stability. It will be amazing to see that happen. And I think at this point, and especially with the work that Mattereum is doing and the growth of the DeFi space at large. It’s kind of inevitable that these two worlds are going to just become enmeshed.</p><p>Penguin: think one of the other key takeaways is that what’s the utility of your NFT? Is it purely aesthetic value? Is it purely based on the reputation of the artist? And so we are kind of combining those two because we’re using the hard real assets and also the aesthetic value of the art. So that, when you buy the art say your favorite artists that you really like gets canceled in the future. At the very least you’ve got the gold value backing his NFT and there is an actual hard utility for the NFT that you bought aside from just you like the picture that’s on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Well, I think it goes even further than that. I mean, if you want to talk about being on the cutting edge. With Never Touch Fiat Again as a meme, as a message for people to disconnect from the current financial paradigm. These first NFTs, regardless of how good or how bad the art is, or how known or how unknown the artist is, they are gonna have just by virtue of being the first one are going to have a value in the future. They’re a scarce asset, the first 10 gold backed NFTs tied with art and it’s interesting watching nobody really ever had a clue what is going to be the first use case post currency for blockchain tech and all of a sudden in the last year,&nbsp;boom.</p><p>I mean, NFTs have been around since the beginning of Bitcoin Bitcoin can even be called the first NFT in a certain way. We had Mastercoin, color coins, Namecoin was probably the first actual NFT in the space. But here it is that we have this whole economy now, which is disintermediated. Rights organizations, right? No copyright holders has disintermediated distribution networks disintermediated galleries. All of these things that are happening around NFTs are happening because of artists finding a new way to monetize their creative stream on a peer-to-peer level where there’s always been a a mediator between&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so if you take that like a step forward, gold is probably the most anonymous currency on the planet. Gold sellers, the gold network have, maintained the ability to just to buy and sell gold without any idea. You don’t need an ID. If I go into a jewelry shop here in Vienna, they don’t ask me for an ID to buy gold or to give me cash back for the gold. There’s no KYC on that. And so the interesting aspect of the Never Touch Fiat Again implementation of gold backed NFTs is it enables you to move in and out of fiat currency in the most anonymous way possible globally. Very interesting in terms of remittances, right?</p><p>Garrison: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So if I want to send a Gold NFT to a guy in Morocco, right. And makes the claim, gets the gold, and goes and goes into a shop, in the bizaar and gets his fiat money in whatever currency is local and the same way in the other direction. So it’s a very, very interesting and very legal, so maliciously compliant a way of moving in and out of fiat and crypto via gold is a phenomenal advance in the space, I&nbsp;think.</p> E-gold: A Chapter in the History of (Gold-Backed) Digital Currency [00:22:40] <p>Garrison: Yeah. The Gold NFT is the latest iteration of trying to digitize gold ownership, access to gold online. People have been trying to crack the code on this for decades&nbsp;now.</p><p>One interesting case study is E-gold in the late nineties. Anonymous digital currency backed by gold, denominated in grams of gold, that was secured and various faults around the world. And it worked. In fact, Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta, his first time transacting in a digital currency or quote unquote cryptocurrency before Bitcoin was E-gold. And some of the technology used for that, uh, the contracting around E-gold was built by Ian Grigg, inventor of the Ricardian Contract, which is the mechanism for how you basically bind a digital asset or a contract with a piece of software and have it to where there’s dispute resolution and all the legal warranties were kind of coupled together.</p><p>But it’s interesting is that the frameworks that were used in creating that between E-gold itself and the contracting system that Ian Grigg built on top of it is now being kind of revitalized in the context of blockchain and cryptocurrency and smart contracts and Ricardian smart contracts. We’re in the just most recent chapter of the interesting story in the history of cryptocurrency.</p> Crypto: Civilizational History in the Making [00:24:15] <p>Michael&nbsp;: So, I guess the hardest thing for me in being involved in the space from the beginning and having been on the mailing lists where bitcoin was being discussed and E-gold and Liberty Dollars, all of these different things being involved with cryptographers. And then being in the day-to-day pace of working in crypto, which is like rocket speed, you know, is everything here just moves so&nbsp;fast.</p><p>There’s this churn of new people coming into the space. Who’re getting interested in the narrative, getting interested in the tech are starting to wrap their heads around the ideas and the concepts is having to go back then always and be at. So wherever the cutting edge is where we’re at, right is always have to go back and say, Hey, this is 30 years of history. Bitcoin is now 12, 12 years old. And it came out of distinctly the experience with BitGold. It was a response to that. And all of the things, other things that were happening, Adam back writing Hashcash. All of these things being accepted now at the base layer of Bitcoin and the base layer of Ethereum with programmable money has a very long history of trial and error and adversarial thinking.</p><p>And it is the most secure network to date for state level threat. I don’t see how, if, when, or where Bitcoin will ever not exist or any of the other chains that have been started. Once they’ve been started, there’ll be some guy in a garage with a 20 19 mining rig who will keep&nbsp;??? Coin alive by running it on three computers, just the way that people keep old cars&nbsp;alive.</p><p>We’re just at the beginning of a civilizational history taking place and developing around money that is as old as, the original reference, the Rai stones themselves. It’s just the current implementation of protecting your assets or securing your assets or having some efficient way of determining what value is. Right now, we live in an adversarial environment between the state and the individual. I don’t anticipate that society is going to stay this way. Civilization is a wave that goes up and down. And I do think that we’ll come back to an era where the individual has more rights and the state has less rights and corporations have less&nbsp;rights.</p><p>I think we’ll reach a better equilibrium and the hope of hardcore, OG Bitcoiners and cryptographers is that the state and institutions co-opt what Bitcoin is and use it to make society fairer. Not co-opt it the way that entities like Coinbase do with seeking regulatory approval to be a custodian in between people and their assets in the same surveillance capitalism model that we’ve had for the last 50&nbsp;years.</p><p>Those are the true enemies, the ones that are looking for using the power of the state to enforce a custodial relationship, rent-seeking relationship between people and their assets. I don’t think that’s always going to be the case though. And my hope is that all the things that we’re working on and now with gold, right. Pairing these things together in these models are gonna empower people and eventually power, empower the state again to serve the the interest of people more than they have been in the last half&nbsp;century.</p><p>Garrison: With blockchain we have the first credibly neutral system for value transfer. And it can allow a combination of institutional transparency, but also maintaining individual privacy.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: That’s the old, that’s the old cypherpunk value. Right? So, so transparency for institutions, privacy for individuals. And it’s actually exactly the opposite right now. Institutions have privacy and individuals are forced to be transparent. If you want to talk about a flippening, that should be the true flippening. Not between Bitcoin or Ethereum or between Tron and Ethereum or between, whatever flavor of anything.</p><p>The true flipping should be the crypto approach as a whole versus thefiat by decree approach. Right? So I like to talk about fiat not only as a currency, but as the institutional structures that we’re living under. The governance structures, thereby decree, you’re born at a certain place on the planet and you have no choice as to what it is are the rules that govern the rest of your life. If you stay in that country. It’s by decree, it’s not by&nbsp;choice.</p><p>So non fungible systems, let’s talk about the DAOs as well, right? That have governance tokens that don’t necessarily have a value. These are consensus rule sets that people can, that people opt into. It’s by choice. And this is probably the most exciting thing for me, aside from the permissionless of it is, as we started the top of the episode, it’s “Choose Your Illusion,”, right? Which set of consensus rules do I want to live under? And whether they have a real world asset that’s tied to them as they are with the the Mattereum Passports or not, they’re just completely virtual representation, I have the choice and everybody else has a choice. It’s pretty phenomenal development actually.</p><p>Penguin: Definitely.</p> Programmable Value with NFTs [00:29:36] <p>Garrison: So it’s something that we kind of, we mentioned briefly, I’d like to kind of dig into it a little bit more, this notion of kind of creating like a hybrid asset. If I had talked to an artist friend of mine about like the prospect of minting a gold backed NFT attached to his or her art, that’s a lot of new, that’s a lot of new concept and language kind of being thrown at them if they’re not too savvy with crypto or with&nbsp;gold.</p><p>So I was wondering, what would be the process of kind of binding an actual, gold bullion with a digital art. What that would look like in practice.</p><p>Penguin: So, I’ve been dealing a lot with like mainstream artists and onboarding them into crypto outside of this particular gold project that I’m doing now. And one of the big things that I’ve found is that NFTs are like an additional paint brush and they give an artist a new way to express themselves and explore ways that they can add value to their creations, and adding something like hard asset to back your creations, as well as further their additional tools that we provide to creators to provide value and understand kind of how their paint brushes and tools are working. What does it mean to own data and what kind of data can you provide in that ownership? How can you manage your&nbsp;rights?</p><p>And so we see a lot of that, right? People assume that they might have commercial rights over it. And it’s up to the artist to define what is the rights guaranteed by their works. And I think this is an evolution of exploring what’s possible with digital ownership.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: So, so this provenance. Not only the provenance, but the programmable aspect of the smart contracts, the Ricardian contracts that it offers people is — so I like to use the example: I sold the first tweet about Ethereum on a platform called Cent for $21,000. And the way that Cent is programmed is that I get a percentage of every successive sale every time that NFT gets sold in the future, I get 10%. And so let’s say it gets sold for $210, I’m going to get another 21 and let’s say it gets sold then by the next guy for half a mil, I’m going to get another 50 grand. Every time I’m going to get 10%. We haven’t even seen the beginning of granularity of all the proofs of concepts that are out&nbsp;there.</p><p>You have streaming payments, you have rights splits. All of the different ways that people have split income, either for shares in a company. You can look at each individual NFT if it’s started programmatically as literally like as if it was a company. And we’re exploring this as well at Mattereum, is that each individual object that’s tied to a passport can be essentially a corporate entity that at its inception has ways to fractionalize its ownership and the income that’s generated from it. And then to have the automated arbitration system and warranties. The future is very exciting. We haven’t even beginning to see the use cases. We’re just exploring them and doing MVPs at the&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Kind of exciting stuff actually.</p><p>Penguin: Very exciting.</p><p>Garrison: Is there anything else you guys want to cover? Is there kind of coming up on the hour&nbsp;here?</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Unfortunately I have another call right at the top of the hour. I could just drop off and you guys just continue recording.</p><p>Penguin: Thank you so much, Michael. I think your input has been critical to the podcast. So thank you and your help along with the project in general. So I really appreciate your perspective and everything. So thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;: Well. Proof is in the pudding. Right. Okay. So yeah, you guys just go ahead and continue on. I’m going to drop off and get over to the other&nbsp;calls.</p><p>Penguin: Great. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><p>Michael&nbsp;:&nbsp;Okay.</p> The Never Touch Fiat Again Project by Defiant Pixel Society [00:33:47] <p>Penguin: So I’d like to specifically talk a little bit about the NTFA and Never Touch Fiat Again project if that’s all right. And kind of describe some of the ideas behind some of the art and also kind of where it’s coming from. Obviously this is more about the art side of things than the gold side of things, but I think that would be a really cool side of the story to tell as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely.</p><p>Penguin: So the idea behind NTFA’s art style, as we look back a far dystopian kind of view of the world, and we specifically like Idiocracy and like what happens to society? It falls down to kind of the wealth and w what, like, I see gold still being an important part of the world, even when everything’s falling&nbsp;apart.</p><p>So we use kind of be the symbology of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall,” a dystopian future. So our lowest denomination is actually the Piggy Bank. And so The Wall and Pink Floyd used a pink floating pig balloon. And so I also, and I’ve adopted that as like this menacing balloon that has the figure of a child’s piggybank as something that we’re all kind of like really familiar with but you know, when it’s floating over like a factory that’s producing a whole bunch of smoke. It’s got a little bit of a different context. And so we use that as like the smallest space for our gold, because, as one ounce, because essentially you break your Piggy Banksy as we call it, and you would claim your one ounce of gold. So that’s kinda like the base level value that we have in this&nbsp;one.</p><p>And then the second idea is instead of breaking their piggy bank. We have the space cowboy. So in that one it’s a guy walking around in an astronaut outfit covered in bling. He’s sitting on a rock and he’s got his gold chains and it’s well, what would a street astronaut be doing in the future? Is he protecting himself because he doesn’t want people to see his face? Is it because, he’s so baller he went to the moon and just kind of like in the future, there’s still like gonna be like this whale kind of guy, even when things fall apart. I felt that it was much more like street friendly. So even though he’s worth 50 grams of gold, he’s still a character rather than&nbsp;a</p><p>Garrison: So is this like a collection of like discrete works of art that are tokenized and they’re going to have gold backing them, like each of these things that you mentioned?</p><p>Penguin: We have specific allocated bars of gold. So the actual video and NFT will have your specific gold bar on the side with your serial number. So each one, each NFT is unique and specifically references the asset and then has the link to the Asset Passport, which has the guarantee over rights for it. So all of the data that contains: which gold, where is it stored, who owns it, how does it transfer, how do you get it out? Those are all baked into the metadata and whoever is the current owner will have paid the fees for the Mattereum Passport to update the owner. So that is how those are&nbsp;linked.</p><p>And then the top dog NFT that I have is called the Vector 777. And so that NFT specifically came from a poster that I remember as a kid growing up. And so does Vector car, as you probably do not know, was a clone of the Lamborghini Diablo from the nineties. And so use all the same parts in the same engines, but it was made by like a sister factory to Lambo. They only made 20 to 40 of them a year and Lamborghini had a big licensing disagreement with them where they didn’t want it to look exactly like a Lambo. So they had to like make a super custom version of the Lambo with all the Lambo parts handmade every year, so completely unsustainable. But, and it was a V12 engine. So I remember as a kid, I had a friend that had a poster of one of these cars and right above the headlights, they had machine guns. So it was like a super-modified one like that. And it was just like this super futuristic car, like when I was a kid and I’ve never really seen it in a poster like&nbsp;it.</p><p>So what we did with the Vector 777 was we took it an upgrade further. Instead of having machine guns above the lights, we put a Soviet rocket launcher on the back of a Vector. And so we figured, When you’re driving around with a hundred grams of gold, you need a little bit more protection.</p><p>And so actually on our website, we made a really funny, cute animation where if you press the button, it says “Click to Win.” Animated version of the Vector will drive across the screen and shoot a whole bunch of rockets, which then take out a&nbsp;city.</p><p>Garrison: Okay.</p><p>Penguin: So we had a lot of fun with kind of the art ideas and I had an amazing team that helped me so I had some famous artists graphic artists, some pixel artists, some people that were really great at videography. and we all worked together to build this project. And it was a lot of fun doing it. And w we definitely tried to reflect that fun in our art style. So each one of these NFTs that I’ve described is like a 3d spinning card. We’ve paired music with them as well. And we’ve timed the music. So there’s like a loop animation and yeah, that’s the art style and kind of idea behind the NTFA arts and the specific amounts of gold that we are offering for those&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Garrison: And where can people interact with&nbsp;these?</p><p>Penguin: Yeah, So right now we have not minted the NFTs. We are doing the final minting right now. So you can view a preview of what the NFTs would look like and the website at NTFA.io. That’s Never Touch Fiat Again dot IO. So, yeah, and we are targeting July 4th for having all the Asset Passports finalized and the minting done. So, July 4th is the official launch where we will take down the previews and add the NFTs available for purchase.</p><p>Garrison: How many are there in the collection?</p><p>Penguin: So there’s a single a 100 gram Vector. There are two 50 gram Space Cowboys, and there are four Piggy Banksies at 1 oz. Total of&nbsp;six.</p><p>Garrison: It just goes to show like the amount of like experimentation that’s happening on the NFT front right now. Cause like, taken out of context, like what we just described a lot of people would be scratching their heads. But you’re basically describing tying an art project that is also a technological project that has like some social commentary woven into it and it’s backed by gold. It’s such an interesting kind of blend of various things. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it cause like the kind of experimentation in terms of like future art projects or, how people do merchandising for their albums or their books or&nbsp;movies.</p><p>This kind of multimedia type of thing. I think that’s also tying in physical assets. It just it’s, the possibilities are.</p><p>Penguin: Yeah. Also for future releases, we’re looking to bring in other top name crypto artists. So I’ve got a whole bunch of connections in the scene. And so I I don’t want to put anyone on the spot, but we’ve got two other artists that should be releasing bars with this as well. So that ties directly into what you’re&nbsp;saying.</p><p>It’s more about the experience and the blending of the technology with the monetary policy than it is any one aspect of it. And it really is kind of like that value proposition for NFTs as well as really providing an experience to owning these tokens. So, a lot of them were kind of like fast art and for some platforms and we made sure not to do that where we’re artists, and we pretty much took as much time as we could to get them done in an effective manner. As I said, we had famous artists. So this specific set Marco, MLIBTY is his acronym, “My life is better than yours” helped out with some of the art and then the rest of the team are from Defiant Pixel Society, which is my art collective that I&nbsp;run.</p> NFTs: A Powerful Medium for Patronage and Provenance of Art [00:43:47] <p>NFTs has been a really powerful way, and even just Web3, to enable creators to get control over their community and not let major corporations or people to exploit them, because that’s the way the system&nbsp;works.</p><p>Specifically. If you consider something like an artist, traditionally an art house or a rapper — there’s so much paperwork and control that go into their works that they get such a small fraction of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, there’s a lot of gatekeeping. And so much of the value that they create is siphoned away from them because there’s so many intermediaries.</p><p>Penguin: And they’re lucky if they get any percentage of their sales and if they do, they’re not looking at over 10%, they’re looking at 1 or 2% of sales and we have the complete opposite approach in Web3. I try and give them as much money as they can. And so like Defiant Pixel Society, they keep 90% of it and 10% of it goes to the organization, that they are also part of, so they get a share of that money as well. And then that way, like anything that we do together also enhances the group. So yeah it’s completely flipping it on its head. Now the creators get all the value and there’s no one in between them and their audience. So it’s been a huge paradigm shift that really has helped compel me to make this my life&nbsp;now.</p><p>Yeah. I think even one of the bigger things that we’ve seen is that people that were mainstream artists are realizing that they can capture their secondary market as well. I think about all the bands that sold CDs, right? And then we had businesses that popped up to do secondary sales, none of those bands back, any money for&nbsp;them.</p><p>Imagine every time someone sold their CD at Amazon or Discogs, they got 10% of that sales or how much they defined their worth royalties. So we’re seeing that people that even existing creators and new creators are having revenue streams from their work that they would have otherwise missed, complete upside&nbsp;for.</p><p>When you sell your work originally, you don’t get the full value of it at the auction value because, it’s like the primary source. I can imagine like Picasso. What did he sell his works for. He’d go to a place. And he said, “I’m Picasso I’m going to paint you this thing and maybe it’ll be free. Right. But so at that time, the cost of Picasso’s work is the price of a dinner, but now you take it and the Picasso estate doesn’t get anything if you sell a Picasso, you know what I mean? And there’s even like these copyright laws that after a certain time your work’s now public domain, anyone can make your work,&nbsp;Picasso.</p><p>And in this way the original artists and the original creators will still get value. Even if it enters public domain a hundred years from now, if they’re using this NFT contract, the royalties are such that part of that sale will go to their wallet for royalties. So a hundred years later, you sell a Picasso for $100 million and 1% of that still goes to the PIcasso&nbsp;fund.</p><p>Garrison: The possibility here is being able to program value flows and social interaction around goods and services. The combination of NFTs and Asset Passports allow you to do this with gold bars or a Picasso painting or a gold bar attached to a painting. Like there’s so many kind of combinatorial possibilities there.</p><p>Penguin: Well even like going back to the provenance issue, right? Like to prove that a Picasso was made by Picasso. It’s going to take a whole bunch of experts, it’s going to take chemical analysis. It’s going to take all these things to try and disprove this is not Picasso. Picasso didn’t do this. Your paint was from the wrong age and with provenance and it being on chain, you could say no this was made by Picasso’s wallet.</p><p>Even like the Mona Lisa, right? One of the most famous pieces of that. I mean, there’s a rumor that it was destroyed by the Nazis in WWII. We don’t have any way of verifying that the Mona Lisa that we have isn’t a copy of the Mona Lisa. That this is the original one. We all assume that it is a true one because it’s the accepted understanding.</p><p>And that’s also something that isn’t something that we would have to trust with the blockchain. If she had a hardware wallet ingrained in her frame that identified this is the asset it’s in this wallet. There’s a distinct difference between having the Mona Lisa and having a knockoff. So in this way, we’ve never really had that in history: to be able to identify with certainty antiquities and place where exactly they came from, when, who made them, like the entire history of them, where did it go from here? And I think that’s one of the huge innovations that NFTs have that is not apparently obvious. People think it’s the same as downloading a picture on the internet and the picture is on the internet, but there’s a distinct owner of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a combination of provenance and patronage. The NFT itself has a programmable agreement like a contract, if you will, to be like equity splits when it’s bought and sold in the market, percentage goes back to the creator or even anyone else. Really looking forward to seeing like what, people like yourself and everyone else in the NFT community build in the years&nbsp;ahead.</p><p>Penguin: Great. Yeah, Thank you for having me in this opportunity to work with Mattereum and also present my project today. Now it’s been amazing bringing the gold and NFT projects together. So I’m having a lot of fun and I’m looking forward to another amazing&nbsp;year.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Take care&nbsp;Penguin.</p><p>Penguin: Thank you.&nbsp;Bye.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-2-from-asset-backed-finance-to-art-with-a-message-2faa1538b4bc">The Future of Stuff Podcast Ep. 2: From Asset-Backed Finance to Art with a Message</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What is Smart Property? Join us as we explore the radical and perhaps inevitable idea of smart property in our&nbsp;world.</p> EPISODE SUMMARY <p>What is Smart Property? This impromptu discussion between Garrison Breckenridge (@gbharlequin) and Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta (@leashless) explores the idea of smart property as an inevitable evolution of digital commerce. We explore what smart property is in practice, some widely different use cases (wedding planning?), the relationship with the sharing economy, the distribution of power in such a system, some privacy and security concerns, and the prospect of programming social interaction and value flows around goods and services.</p> EPISODE NOTES <p>Outline</p>  What is Smart Property?  What Makes Smart Property Viable&nbsp;Now?  The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding&nbsp;Planning  Why Blockchain?  On the Risk of Corporate Dystopia  Smart Property as Technology for Structuring Social Interaction  Smart Property: A Software Update for the Sharing&nbsp;Economy  Smart Property Privacy &amp; Security | Cultural Differences in&nbsp;Adoption  Three Smart Property Use&nbsp;Cases  Ownership in a Smart Property World: Rental vs.&nbsp;Sale  Smart Property and Gold NFTs: A Starting&nbsp;Point   What is Smart Property? [00:00:00] <p>Garrison: So let’s talk about smart property. It’s something that’s been brought up, throughout the Mattereum project at various points. Mattereum is very focused on creating new ways to access, utilize property or under utilized property. So that it’s more, more widely utilized and not sitting dormant. There has been a lot of use cases in the supply chain business to business type of thing, but even like intellectual property rights around like music and stuff like that. But the idea of smart property is kind of fluid, you know, it’s kind of a, more of a mental model, the thing that the project is building towards. So I wonder if you could describe your definition, what you think smart property&nbsp;is.</p><p>Vinay: So smart property is property where you can buy it, sell it, collateralize it, and most importantly use it using software APIs and specifically search. So if you think of something like Uber or Airbnb, these things are rudimentary forms of smart property. You take your apartment, you bind it to an app. The app lets people rent it. And the app takes care of the payment and the availability of the bookings and pre-commitments and the identity and the insurance and all the rest of that stuff. Critical things about smart property is you have to be able to search and you have to be able to actually close the contract for being able to do it&nbsp;online.</p><p>And then what the contract allows you do — a typical thing is rental, but that’s only the very, very thin end of the wedge. That’s just the beginning of what smart property makes possible.</p> What Makes Smart Property Viable Now? [00:01:39] <p>Garrison: When people hear smart property, they may think of like, smart city. They may have some kind of semantic web between smart city, internet of things. People have been talking about it since the nineties, different machines, different systems ubiquitously connected over the internet sharing information and value in some&nbsp;way.</p><p>What makes smart property a possibility now?</p><p>Vinay: Doing anything that involves real property, you need a legal framework. So smart property, to function, has to also involve smart contracts. And it has to involve specifically smart contracts which are seen as being legally enforceable. So if I create a legal commitment to pay for a house that I’m going to rent on Airbnb, there’s force of law behind that everybody understands a contract has been formed and the fact that they don’t give you the house that’s a breach of contract on their end. And the enforceability of these contracts is critical. You can’t have smart property without there being enforceable smart contracts. And now that we have enforcement of smart contracts from Mattereum, then you can build smart property as a layer of applications on top of those enforceable Ricardian smart contracts.</p> The Logistical Nightmare of Wedding Planning [00:02:55] <p>Garrison: And so the listeners have an idea, like what smart property would be in action. What would be an example you would&nbsp;give?</p><p>Vinay: So the example that I give is wedding planning. So wedding planning is one of the most nightmarish activities in the entire world. Because if a single thing goes wrong, it’s the end of civilization, right? Full-scale chaos will result and it’s a million moving parts. And all of those parts are very emotionally important to somebody and there are a whole bunch of different stakeholders that have to be satisfied.</p><p>So it’s a very complicated thing. And professional wedding planners are getting paid a sodding fortune for solving that problem. So what happens if you’re trying to do wedding planning and you’ve got smart property is you could basically build up a multipath matrix of possible solutions. Here’s venue A, here’s venue B, here’s venue C. In venue A, we want to rent these tables, these chairs, we want this caterer, we want this transport solution. We want this hotel booking. We want so many rooms from this one, and then this other hotel, we want so many rooms&nbsp;there.</p><p>You can secure an option on every single thing that you want. So you basically say I’m going to give you 25 bucks for every day until I make a decision about this, but you have to hold this slot open for me. So you option everything you need for pathway A, everything you need for venue B, everything you need for venue C. And if you hit a point where you can’t option the stuff that you need because venue C it just turns out there’s no way to sort out the transport arrangements, then you say, okay, I’m going to execute the options that I took on venue A. Now everything will lock together. So the ability here is to build up interactions between different contracts when you need all of them to come into place before something has utility. And this happens all the time, right? A huge amount of the stress of doing anything that looks like wedding planning is the fact that we don’t have the ability to pay for options. You want to maybe go and visit your uncle who lives in Paris, right? You need to basically option a flight now. Can pay 25 dollars to option this flight. And if he confirms that his vacation days came through when he thought they were going to come through, you execute the option on the fight, and now you’re booked and everything’s great,&nbsp;right?</p><p>It’s this ability to take processes where there are tons and tons of dependencies, turn the dependencies into option contracts, group the option contracts together until you have a solution, and then once you have a solution, execute all of the options. Bringing that kind of capability out of like heavy engineering and finance into ordinary everyday people’s lives will be completely revolutionary.</p><p>And it’s particularly true in anything that involves a whole bunch of people trying to do anything together. We want to go on some trip — seven people want to go rafting in the Yukon. If only five of the people can make it that time, then you know like you’re not going to take the&nbsp;trip.</p><p>So implicitly, everybody is taking out options on everything. And it’s a huge social disaster if three people have bought their tickets and then two people drop out and the whole thing goes to hell in a hand basket, because we don’t have this ability to take out options to secure the possibility of doing something and then later to execute your options once everybody else has booked their tickets and we know that it’s on. So one of the things that smart property gets to is optionality. And that’s only one of half a dozen fundamental operators that we get in a smart property environment that we don’t have in the real world right now, except inside of esoteric corners of engineering and&nbsp;finance.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, I’m just imagining things that are usually like a logistical nightmare, whether it’s like a film production or a band going on tour where there’s a lot of different kind of points of interaction, different, agreements imagining what it would look like if all of those kind of just happens seamlessly where you knew exactly what the available options&nbsp;were.</p> Why Blockchain? [00:06:43] <p>So a great basic question for people who aren’t familiar with blockchain or cryptocurrency or smart contracts: what is it about these particular sets of technologies that make it suitable for building these smart property systems, as opposed to just, you know, more centralized databases and programmable scripts that run on&nbsp;those?</p><p>Vinay: So the critical thing about this is it’s just a complexity problem, right? If every vendor that you want to work with has their own API running on their own database, then your software, whatever agent you’re using, has to know all those different APIs for all of those different pieces of software before it’s able to go out and successfully do something like booking for a hotel room. The thing about the blockchain is, once you’ve gotten the capability to connect properly to the blockchain within that, it’s very simple to then trigger actions. So the blockchain forms a kind of shared backbone which all of these things interconnect to rather than having every single thing be configured differently in a way that just makes life difficult when you’re trying to get things done. It’s complexity control on the software side that is really the advantage of the blockchain here. Plus the ability to do things like escrow payments. Now that’s a very simple thing to do in a blockchain. Like literally escrow is one of the first things that the blockchain gives you. And that’s fundamentally useful when you start trying to do these kinds of very complex transactions in a much smoother and cleaner&nbsp;way.</p> On the Risk of Corporate Dystopia [00:08:12] <p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s also a, certainly a security thing, having a shared credibly neutral system for not only, recording transaction data, but also being able to facilitate transactions. The idea of a smart property system, that’s used widely in a lot of different contexts, different industries, all over the world. If it was run by Google or Facebook or Amazon, that’d be an incredible amount of, you know, centralized corporate power over how we create value or interact with our stuff. And that will be almost like a cyberpunk corporate dystopia situation right&nbsp;there.</p><p>Vinay: Yeah. Yeah. I think that’s a fair way of describing the risk. Smart property is an inevitability, everything is heading in that direction because it’s just what happens when you take software, and you take property, and the two things connect to each other. And, there’s an enormous screaming demand for it, it’s just not a demand that has found it’s language.</p><p>Garrison: It’s what Mattereum has been doing is like building a lexicon, shared language to be able to unpack these really complicated ideas.</p><p>Vinay: Absolutely. And I can’t remember whether it’s Kevin Kelly or Stewart Brand, one of the old great godfathers of the internet culture basically said, look, if you’re interested in discovering new things what to invest in, you go where they’re forming new language. Where things are happening that require you to create new words, that’s usually a fundamental, profound innovation because they’re having to invent new language to talk about what they’re doing. You know that something new is happening.</p><p>So the smart property thing is there is a dystopian version of it. And the dystopian version of it is things like Android phones: constantly reporting back to Google, gives you a bunch of services, takes all of your data, doesn’t really works for you, works for them. And they can arbitrarily decide what does or doesn’t stay on your phone. That thing where Amazon was taking copies of 1984 off people’s Kindles. Yeah. That’s an example of like smart property done wrong, but this is not what we’re trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>This actually happened, there was some kind of contractual problem with that edition of 1984 and they pulled it right off people’s Kindles. That’s&nbsp;amazing.</p> Smart Property as Technology for Structuring Social Interaction [00:10:27] <p>I want to talk about the historical inevitability side of this, right? One of the Mattereum team has a service which holds his physical things in boxes in their warehouse, and when he needs something, they’ll just deliver it to wherever he is for a price. And this is perfect tooling for a&nbsp;nomad.</p><p>I bought a new printer. The printer, as far as I can tell is in continuous communication with headquarters and it will probably do things like sell me ink when it begins to run out of ink. I’m fairly sure that every time it gets a paper jam, this has been reported to HQ like, “Oh, I have a paper jam.” This is smart property, but it’s not really what we want from smart property. What I want from my smart property is I can say to my friends, “Hey, you can print things at my house. And it has an interface where I can extend you the right to print something in my house and if you’ve got something you want to show me that’s better shown on paper, it just appears boom, it comes out of my printer that morning. And to get that to work, I need to be able to give you the right to talk to my property. I need my property to be able to tell you whether it’s got the right kind of paper in it. I need to be able to indicate to my property that I’m using it for something else. It shouldn’t run your print job right now. That’s what we want.&nbsp;Right?</p><p>You want to be able to fix your grandma’s computer. You want to be able to borrow your friend’s car, and the way that we do all this stuff right now, it’s very hands-on, it’s uninsured, it’s complex, and it takes a lot of things which are machine to machine jobs and turns them into human social jobs. If you want to borrow somebody’s car, you could spend two hours going around and talking to them and having dinner with them. And then just somewhere at the end of that, you’re like, “Hey, can I borrow your car, man?” And it’s, “ Oh, why didn’t you just ask?” Or you could punch into the app, “I want to borrow your car: 35 bucks for the insurance, $200 for the mileage and gas.” “Hey, you want to borrow the car? Yeah, no problem. Fantastic. We just hit the option and I’ll get you turned on. Beep. Like the software supports the sociability because it provides us with a nice framework for the exchange. So we don’t have to try and construct the framework from the exchange in a society that doesn’t really have that as a&nbsp;norm.</p><p>This smart property becomes a thing that supports social interaction around goods rather than things that substitutes or removes the social interaction. A good example of that is like electronic dating sites. Tinder or whatever it was, there are a whole bunch of people that could theoretically been going out to bars, getting into relationships, to put it mildly. But Tinder provided them with a framework for doing that, which previously didn’t exist, and as a result it just lowered the necessary activation threshold for people to be able to go out there and have some&nbsp;fun.</p><p>Garrison: They were able to like filter their experience in a way, like it wasn’t like in the same way that, you know, filter search results when you’re looking for information online, online dating sites, you filter it through various settings or bits of information.</p><p>Vinay: But also it also gave them like institutional support. It provided a certain amount of structure in the interaction like eBay provides structure in the interaction. People can just post on their blogs what they’ve got for sale in their garages, and it would be equivalent to eBay once you combine it with Google search. But people sort of need a little bit of help getting over the social awkwardness of doing these kinds of&nbsp;things.</p><p>And that’s what the platforms fundamentally provide is they provide a little bit of social help by structuring the transactions between people. They provide a structure for interaction and with a structure for interaction, people are much more willing to interact with each other than without it. It’s actually a big support and a big help for people to have a little bit of a structure to work inside of and I think all cultures use this kind of semi-formal setting as a way of stabilizing human interaction.</p><p>Think of like formal dances. You go back 50, 100 years, formal dances go, “May I please have this dance?” That kind of structured interaction was a way of basically managing the risk of people interacting with each other. It reduced social anxiety and it’s the same thing with buying and&nbsp;selling.</p><p>Think of street markets, right? The street markets, you have a structured format, which is somebody rents a booth at a street market, they come down, they put all the crap out of their garage on a table. And then people knew that the purpose that they’re there for is to buy, right? The person knows that the purpose of that there is to&nbsp;sell.</p><p>So when it comes to the social interaction, picking the thing up and saying how much becomes very easy, right? But I come round to your house and I pick something up and say “How much?” it’s going to get weird, you see what I’m saying? So the formalism of this is a street market and the structures, the interaction between people to make it commercial is exactly like if you were on Tinder, you are here to go on dates, that means that we can talk to each other. If you’re on eBay, we’re here to sell something. If you’re on Chat Roulette, you’re here to have random interactions with weirdos on the internet or something like that. I’ve never used Chat Roulette. But what I’m trying to say is that the need for structures to lower the anxiety in doing something new socially is one of the critical things that the app economy has really&nbsp;gotten.</p><p>If you and I have an interaction through the car rental app, even if we are friends and we go skiing together, I know that the topic of conversation is I want to rent your car for a week. And I know that you’re interested in discussing that or you wouldn’t have it listed in the app. So the way that I see smart property is that smart property will basically take a set of social interactions between people, right? Social interactions between people about things, and it will lower the anxiety and the complexity and the risk — legal risk, insurance risk, all the rest of these kinds of risks. It will lower those risks to the point where people are willing to have conversations with each other about property. “Can I borrow your tent?” “Hey, do you have a microphone?” Obviously if you’re on the other side of the world, this is less useful, but for most people, if you’re in a city, anything that you can imagine needing is probably in your apartment building if you have the ability to ask somebody for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, like borrowing a specific tool instead of, just ordering on the first link you find on Amazon and it’s being shipped in a container, like all of those resources that went into summoning an object to you, you could just, if you had the means, you could just have it in your hands in an hour within a quarter of an hour where where&nbsp;live.</p><p>Vinay: And gone again after you stop needing it. The critical thing is getting rid of the stuff afterwards. You need a colander right. You have six people coming over for dinner and you’re going to cook a bunch of spinach. Your colander is not really big enough. It’s going to make a heck of a mess so you want to use it for the presentation of the dinner. The spinach is in the big colander. “ Anybody in my apartment have a colander?” “Oh yeah. Flat 37. They got a colander.” You go down and you’d knock on the door. They hand you the colander. You have a two minute conversation with them. You go, you use it, you wash it, you bring it back. Their life has slightly improved. Your life has substantially improved. You pay them $1.50 for the privilege of using their colander.</p><p>Sounds ridiculous right now. Sounds ridiculous right now. But you’re an American. The older generation, right? The kind of Americans over probably 70, 60, grandparents’ age, they’ve got like two metric tons, three metric tons of stuff in their garages and attics right. Ubiquitous. And the older Americans are the more physical things they own, and a lot of it’s in boxes that haven’t been opened for 20 years. Industrial mass production, advertising, but no automated inventory management. They own so much stuff they can’t even remember what they own. And the result is chaos. If that generation had smart property, where they could just have borrowed these things from their neighbors when they needed them one time. You want to trim your hedges, how many hedge trimmers does a neighborhood need?</p><p>Garrison: Just&nbsp;one.</p><p>Vinay: Just one. And so for our generation the place where this really comes into its own is things like video projectors. Half a dozen times a year, you probably would quite like having access to a $3,000 video projector. And if you could get access to a $3,000 video projector for 30 bucks a night or something like that, you’d probably do it fairly casually, and it gets delivered just like the pizza and the beer get delivered.</p> Smart Property: A Software Update for the Sharing Economy [00:18:37] <p>Garrison: Yeah, this kind of like communal inventory management example that we had there, it reminds me of the sharing economy. What’s the link&nbsp;there?</p><p>Vinay: The thing with the sharing economy is the sharing economy never really worked and it never worked because it had an inventory problem. You needed to manually list all of your stuff inside of the sharing economy databases. They weren’t interoperable. And there was always this question of who owns the data. The way that smart property will work is the manufacturers will provide the initial asset passports for the physical objects that you’re buying. So I go to Amazon, I buy a chainsaw, right? They ship me the chainsaw to my house. And into my wallet they also ship an NFT, which has a connection to an asset passport, which has all of the attributes of the chainsaw: what it is, how powerful it is, where you get spares for it, how it has to be maintained, safety instructions, all of that stuff arrives in a bundle attached to the NFT that’s now in my wallet. If I decide that I’ve used this chainsaw for a season, then actually what I need is an electric one, not a gasoline one. I just take my chain chainsaw and I drag it onto the eBay icon on my phone. I take my chainsaw NFT, I drag it onto the Ebay icon in my wallet. Are you sure you want to sell this&nbsp;item?</p><p>Yes. Auto creates a listing. Makes me go through a quick questionnaire. Whether the thing is in the condition that it was when I bought it from, how often I’ve used it. Twice. How long did you use it for? Two days each time. Have you ever had to change any of the components? No. Go through the little inventory check. Boom. Sold. So if I have to go and put all of the attributes of the chainsaw into the system in the first place, the inconvenience is enormous. Selling the thing becomes work. But if all the information is prepackaged with the chainsaw, we don’t have to take responsibility for creating the asset identity for the chainsaw. All we’re doing is passing the asset on. So we take all the labor of creating the initial asset passport to define the thing and all that goes to the manufacturers because they’re going to do it once for every chainsaw they make. And this is the critical thing that was missing in the sharing economy model. All the labor that had to be done to document what was for sale is the thing that killed the sharing economy. It was the hardship of trying to figure out what was going on. Whereas if I have something that simply digs through your email box and pulls out every single thing that you’ve bought from Amazon and asset passports it for you automatically if there’s already a template for that object, it’s just reduce the inconvenience and reduce the inconvenience and reduce convenience. We make it easier and easier for people to get paid. And at some point there’s a crossing where suddenly smart property is a&nbsp;thing.</p> Smart Property Privacy &amp; Security | Cultural Differences in Adoption [00:21:23] <p>Garrison: Yeah. I’m just imagining like in video games, like MMO RPGs, like when you drag your inventory, you hold click and drag it to someone. And then that character, who’s an actual person behind that avatar has that digital artifact. Thinking of almost like the same thing but with actual, like actual ownership of the physical object being transferred in that interaction is really interesting.</p><p>Because I like to always explore the you know the kind of light and dark or the complex things that will inevitably arise around these things. I’m really interested. If you have a global inventory management system, obviously the notion of privacy — if someone had like a profile use the MMO RPG, as an example, some games, you can go walk up to another character and you actually see what they have. You can literally see their inventory and negotiate a trade or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>Now the parallel with the smart property system, if you’re able to do that, then you would know what everyone owns or at least the things that they own, which is part of the smart property system that could potentially lead to some people, depending on objects that they have, as vulnerable to theft or potentially violence. For example, using like the gold-backed NFTs for example, if you knew that someone had tokenized gold bullion with the capability of literally taking physical custody that’s obviously kind of a&nbsp;target.</p><p>Vinay: Somebody come around to your house and steal it from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah. Looking at like, you know, the parts of the system that would need some particular attention in terms of like security. Have you thought about how do you protect people? Obviously there’s an open participatory nature and there’s a lot of communities that would like thrive on that. I’m thinking like co-ops for example, different cooperatives around the world because that social structure by by its nature is already in tune to that idea of sharing what we have for the betterment of everyone in the co-op. But there’s other contexts where people will look at that as opportunity to prey upon people. So I wonder if what would have to be built to safeguard. I guess it’s like radical transparency versus radical privacy in relation to smart property. What are your thoughts on&nbsp;that?</p><p>Vinay: This is going to be very culturally dependent, culturally sensitive. Norway for example, till pretty recently, you could recently inspect the tax register to figure out what everybody in Norway was paid. It’s only very recently that they stopped doing that. Whereas if you did that in America, that would be an unthinkable invasion of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Japan, a super low crime society. Dubai, super low crime society. These systems could be pretty transparent. You try and do this stuff in Brooklyn, you’re going to have a whole different set of problems. Gary, Indiana. It’s like, hmm, okay. Maybe I don’t want to tell my neighbors quite so much about what I have for sale. So the way that I would see it working in tougher societies is that you’re going to do this with intermediaries, right? I say, “Hey, I need a colander. Or take something like a diesel generator. I need a diesel generator for three days. System says somebody has a diesel generator. We can have it delivered to your house. Yes or no. Yes: a courier arrives, hands me the diesel generator, I use the diesel generator, a courier arrives, picks it up, takes it away. End of story. Simple as that. Simple as&nbsp;that.</p> Three Smart Property Use Cases [00:24:46] <p>Garrison: Yeah, the smart property thing there’s so many ways to look at that topic, examine it. For you personally, are there like use cases that you find very interesting? Obviously there’s everything from the business- to- business and supply chain side of things. There’s friendly neighborhood inventory management with colanders. But is there anything in particular that you find interesting?</p> 1. PARENTAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT [00:25:11] <p>Vinay: So the places where I think this is completely revolutionary are basically three things. The first is everything to do with parents, right? Parents are just the most burdened-by-stuff people in society. The kids constantly grow out of everything that they’re wearing and they get bored with their toys. And the kids have no notion that things need to be new and special and fancy. They’re not like teenagers, they’re not whiny about that stuff. You get them pair of pants they’re going to put the pants on. So pretty much everything for children under about the age of 10 should be smart property. The clothes, the toys, the push chairs, all the rest of that stuff. All of it ought to be just a free floating pool that parents just pull things out of, use, and then get rid of when their kid grows out of it or gets bored with it. And that alone. Think of the quality of life difference if you can constantly lease for your kids new things and all it costs you is getting rid of the old things and having to pay 20p. Because it could be incredibly cheap. If you have some squeaky rubber duck, that thing is going to be in good shape for 15 years. The cost per hour of play with the squeaky rubber duck by a three-year-old kid is like a millionth of a cent. Whereas the cost of buying it, storing it when the kid gets bored, negotiating with the kid about getting rid of it, and then finally get rid of it, dumping it in a charity shop. It’s twenty-five dollars in addition to the price of buying the thing. So everything to do with kids, just a seamless surface of smart property and an enormous pool, sterilize it with UV light or whatever it is before it’s given to the new parent. No problem. So that’s pool number&nbsp;one.</p> 2. PROFESSIONAL TOOLING [00:26:56] <p>Pool number two is what I would call prosumer tooling. I quite like the idea of screwing around with a 3d printer. I don’t want to spend two grand on a 3d printer. If somebody would rent me a 3d printer for a month, with all the bits that go with the 3d printer for $200, I would probably have to have $200 worth of fun with the 3d printer, and then somebody would come and take it away again. You want a chainsaw. You want a router. You want a big printer. You want a video projector. The ability to casually rent high-end equipment for one-off occasions or for experiments or for projects. If you live in a big city and you could get hold of basically everything manufactured by capitalism for say 1% or 2% of its cost per day of&nbsp;use?</p><p>$6,000 camera, right? If you have a $6,000 camera and it costs you $60 a day to rent that camera, that might be worthwhile at the one percent point. it went from the 1% point to the tenth of a percent point, right? If the camera is going to be used solidly for five years, the camera per day could be rented for thousandth of its value. Five years would be 1800 days. The camera’s being rented every day. Somebody going to pay a thousandth of a percent of the camera for using it. So at that point, maybe it’s $6 a day to get access to a $6,000 camera. And at that point, for sure, this is worthwhile</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, it’s a tighter coupling of the use of a thing and the value of the&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Vinay: Exactly. And at that point, like how much more experimenting around would you do with high-end systems if you could rent them for somewhere between a tenth of a percent and one percent of their asset value? You want to do some mountain biking, you’ll have the best mountain bike, then you get rid of it. You want to watch some movies? Hey, my cousin’s coming over. My cousin’s a film buff and he’s going to be here for three days and we’re going to watch the whole Star Wars trilogy. Boom. We’re going to rent a high end projector. You’re having a party, we’re going to have a real PA,&nbsp;right?</p><p>You want to brew beer, right? But he’s going to come round with 3,000 bucks worth of brewing equipment and they’re going to charge you $42 for the six weeks. You’re going to pay a few hundred bucks for high-end equipment or brewing&nbsp;beer.</p><p>Point is we want to try things. We want to do experiments. We want to reach out. We want to do things which are novel. And right now the only model that we have is you buy all the equipment, you don’t know whether you’ve got everything you need, you try and use it, and at the end of that process, you either get stuck with it or you have to resell it. And it’s a pain in the butt. It’s almost like turning stuff into part of the experience economy. I want the experience of owning a laser cutter. I don’t want to own a laser cutter. I want the experience of owning the laser cutter. Then I want the laser cutter to go away. Unless I suddenly discovered that I’m a laser cutter hobbyist and I really want to have one, and then I buy it. And this is just a different way of relating to the fruit of capitalism.</p><p>Garrison: The design space around all this, all, this is really fascinating because it’s so embedded in not just objects, but like the social structures around them and the spaces in between objects, not necessarily the objects themselves. A book I started reading recently, Medium Design by Keller Easterling, is about that very thing. How, like there’s a whole, you know, design space around how we structure like infrastructure or build cities. And there’s actual like, you know, power relationships that are woven into how things are built. It’s almost like a call to action to, look at interdependency of things within a system and building in such a way that you account for that. It’s a very like cognizant thing that you’re doing. So I imagine smart property is like a building block towards building these things is you can kind of, to put it one way, program interactions around objects depending on what your goal&nbsp;is.</p><p>You set the parameters and it’s this, digital, physical artifact. It’s this object that has like a digital counterpart you know, exchanging hands. Yeah, it’s just super fascinating. Like the use cases around that are basically limitless.</p><p>And then you get into intangible property because we’ve talked a lot about physical property in this conversation, but intangible, like intellectual property, for example, could use the same&nbsp;tooling</p><p>Vinay: It certainly could. I’m obsessive about physical property because physical property is the nut that we have to crack if we’re going to fix our environmental problems. But you can certainly imagine doing this for intangibles.</p> 3. SPECIAL PROJECTS [00:31:41] <p>I want to talk about the third thing. I said there were three big areas of use, right? So everything to do with kids, everything to do with access to pro equipment, the third category is everything to do with special events. And I don’t just mean special events like weddings, funerals, this kind of stuff. I also mean special events, like projects. You’re going to move house. For the first six months in a new house, you want a big box of tools to fix all the things in your new house. You want a drill. You want a saw, you want some saw horses. You want a big ladder. You might want plastering kit. All the rest of that stuff, new house stuff, six months of being in a new house and having all that stuff. You’ve done everything you’re going to do to that place, you’ve painted and you’ve waxed and you’ve polished and all the rest of that stuff. And at that point, you don’t need the new house kit anymore. All you can use one small toolbox with a screwdriver and a&nbsp;spanner.</p><p>So there are large projects in people’s lives. I am going to build a deck. Bring to me the deck kit. You use the deck kit for three months. You have successfully built a deck. Everything is done. Get rid of the deck kit. And that model, right? You’re going to build a garden shed, right? You’re going to need a bunch of garden shed tools. You’re going to build a deck. You’re going to do a bunch of deck tools. You’re going to paint the outside of your house. You’re going to need a bunch of stuff there. So a human makes an intention to do a big, special, complicated thing. The human is then going to do that big, complicated thing in exactly the same damn way that every other human did&nbsp;it.</p><p>You’re going to go to YouTube. You’re going to watch the same video that everybody else does, they’re going to tell you how to do it the same way everybody else does, and then you’re going to be left buying the same things that everybody else bought. Just close the damn loop. I am Bob. I’m going to show you how to build a deck, by the way, you can get Bob’s deck building kit from any of the following places. They’ll deliver it to your house. You will use it. When you’re done, they’ll take it back again. Boom, boom. So we take the knowledge, the tools, the raw materials, and we integrate these into new class of services.</p><p>Garrison: And you’re able to bundle these services in a way — not only the services, but the resources underlying them — in a way that it’s more efficient. You’re not, there’s people that undergo like a bunch of, projects like building a deck or something. And they, they either buy, because they’re not experts, they buy too much or they buy so many different tools. They may not even end up using them, but they still have them. And there’s just laying&nbsp;dormant.</p><p>Vinay: Oh, you finished the job. And at that point you’re not going to build another deck. Why do you need the professional screw gun? And if eBay worked the way that we want it to work, all this stuff would just go to eBay and it would vanish and there’d be no problem. That’d be fine. But it doesn’t work that way because we don’t trust the condition of the things we buy on eBay. And eBay doesn’t think in systems. And yet when we do things, most of the things we do much like the way other people do them. We need most of the same things that we need. How hard can it be? You’re going to fix your bike. You’re going to need the bicycle repair kit. It has all the things you would require to disassemble and reassemble a bike. At the end of that process, you know that the oil has run out almost on the bike repair kit, the next person to rent that kit, the oil has been replaced by the time they rent it. And if this stuff is available in the short delivery time, like three hours, next day at worst, but let’s say three hours, you’re out your bike breaks, walk home with your bike, and by the time you’ve arrived home, the bike kit is already ordered, and it will be there in an hour and a half, and now you can fix your&nbsp;bike.</p><p>It requires population density to be able to do this. We’re not going to be able to get this kind of relationship with matter in rural areas until you’ve got like magic drone delivery, but in a big city, how easy is life if it works this way? And then you also get spaces. So suppose that you’ve got something like car repair, car repair, you might need more stuff than anybody is going to deliver to your house, and you might need things like those kind of lifting jack things that you use for things like pulling out an&nbsp;engine.</p><p>If you take smart property and you extend it to the notion of smart locations… I need to do the following thing to this car. What are the places I can rent where they have the tooling to allow me to do this? I want to rent a place where I can make a dress, right? Lots of women into dressmaking. They’d like to do it. They don’t want to keep all the stuff in their house. They only do it once in a while. They decided they’re going to do that. You rent 16 hours of dressmaking time over three or four weeks in a place where everything is there, right? Rentable, shareable studios and workshops: smart property.</p><p>Sharing economy looked at doing all of this. Sharing economy just didn’t have the necessary technologies and platforms. Too much complexity, too much cost. The overheads are too high. It was just too hard. Blockchain, asset passports, NFTs, smart contracts, enforceable smart contracts, blockchain based insurance. I can make my way down the list of all of the new things that we’ve got now we didn’t have 10 years ago in the first run to talk about sharing economy. There just wasn’t the infrastructure. Now there is. As a result, dramatically easier to do this. It’s still going to be one of these things where we’re going to start and we’ll do a bit and do a bit, do it, do a bit, but if you ask me where we’re going, we’re moving into a relationship with physical matter which is almost as fluid as our relationship with information.</p><p>And what we’re talking about is something that looks like streaming property rather than having to buy property.</p><p>Garrison: Yeah, really interesting. I never heard that framed that way. New language. We’ve come up with new language.</p> Ownership in a Smart Property World: Rental vs. Sale [00:37:18] <p>But one thing I want to dig into because I think it’s really important is the idea of ownership in this sort of, kind of fluid property system where everything’s circular and very efficient, but who owns this stuff? It could be worrisome if somehow you know, for example, if like Amazon looked at it like a growing smart property system and was like, “ Oh, why don’t we just buy all this stuff? And then we’ll earn profits on what everyone’s doing. You understand what I’m&nbsp;saying?</p><p>Vinay: Right. What happens if the people own nothing and everything is rented. So what you have is a constant concentration of wealth in the hands of the people that actually own the property.</p><p>Garrison: Yup.</p><p>Vinay: What is the price of renting everything? Do you wind up in a position where you just don’t have any access to stuff because you don’t own any stuff? This is why it’s critically important that these systems are peer to&nbsp;peer.</p><p>If we’re in a position where the only way that you could get access to the vendor side of these smart property systems is by being a big corporation with massive insurance and regulation all the rest of that stuff, you wind up in a kind of dystopia where nobody can afford to buy anything and everything is rented all the time where people are constantly poor because the property bills are impoverishing them. Think of our camera example, right? A high-end DSLR is certainly good for five years. I think all of my camera units, at least 10 or 12 years old. I bought it very secondhand on Amazon. It’s fantastically durable, nothing wears out. It’s solid state. As old as the lenses aren’t broke, they last&nbsp;forever.</p><p>So how much should it cost to rent a camera? 10% of the camera’s value a day? 1% of the camera’s value a day. A tenth of a percent of the camera’s value a day? Somewhere in there, there is the real costs of renting a camera. Let’s add 10% to that for profit. Hell, let’s add 30% to that for profit. So 5,000, $6,000 of camera, five years of use, five years worth of days. You know, what is that? Just about 2000 days, right? 2000 days, $6,000, $3 per day, profit call it two dollars, 40% profit margin. Actually one dollar 30% profit margin. So now it costs $4 a day to rent a $6,000&nbsp;camera.</p><p>The only reason that’s not how the world works is because we keep losing the cameras or they get stolen or people treat them badly and so on. So all those things create problems. There is another way of structuring the smart property economy that doesn’t have these problems, and I’ll come to that for a second, but I want to talk through the price thing for a second. So right now if you look at professional camera rental, it’s not $4 a day for a $6,000 camera, right? It’s brutally expensive. So if you’ve got a situation where there’s very little regulation of these markets and people can just do what they like, the prices will be kept low because people that have equipment will rent the equipment. Competition will keep the prices down and the quality up and the systems will be reliable. That’s basically the hope. That what you don’t wind up with these monopolies and oligarchies that are artificially inflating the price of rental for physical equipment.</p><p>Garrison: Less distortions.</p><p>Vinay: Less distortions. Now, the other way of doing this is we actually don’t do rental at all. And this is my preferred way of doing smart property. My preferred way of doing smart property is not to have rental markets at all, and to have everything be sale. And this is really where we close the loop on where the blockchain comes&nbsp;in.</p><p>This part is real important. So I want to get access to a $6,000 camera. I could rent it. The problem then is if I break it, I now owe $6,000 to the person that I was borrowing the camera from and we’ve got insurance claims and complexity and so on. And I might be careless because it’s not mine. I’m just renting it. It’s just a rental. Drive it like a rental. So the alternate model here is that I don’t drive like a rental because I bought it. I see a camera. It’s had 53 previous owners. It’s got a recent condition report from somebody that runs a camera shop. I buy the camera for $6,000. I use it for three weeks. I sell it again for $6,000. Why? It’s a $6,000 camera with three more weeks of wear on it. Maybe it depreciates by $3 a day for that period. So I bought it for $6,000 and I sold it for $5,900, having used the camera for three weeks. $3 a day depreciation. If the camera has a life span of five&nbsp;years.</p><p>So if we turn it that way around, where everything is being bought, used, and then sold again. And we have perfectly efficient markets for buying and selling these things, then we don’t lose a bunch of value because eBay charges 10% and because people doubt the goods on eBay and the doubt discount is 20% because you’re going to get ripped off once in a while. If we correct for all of those systems so the resale value is very approximately the same as the purchase value plus appreciation plus wear and tear, then you can build this entire model of this kind of streaming asset economy without having to take the step of turning everything into rental. And it massively simplifies the legals. It massively simplifies the politics. You don’t wind up with nearly the same opportunities for exploitation. And at the end of that process, you just wind up with secondhand markets which are so efficient they replace the rental markets. And the only way that we could get that kind of efficiency that I’m aware of is to use the blockchain for this stuff. Scaled blockchains will make this possible.</p><p>Garrison: Sounds&nbsp;good.</p><p>Is there anything else we want to&nbsp;cover?</p> Smart Property and Gold NFTs [00:43:09] <p>Vinay: The first piece of smart property that we have believe it or not is gold bars which are being sold by our partner Lohko from a vault in Singapore. And what you buy is an NFT on OpenSea for an ounce or a 10g gold bar. And pretty soon it will be a kilogram gold bar. And after that will be a 400oz gold bar. But what you buy when you buy the NFT is the right to have the physical bar delivered to you or equivalent value, if you choose. And it’s a numbered, allocated bar, so when you buy the bar, you own the bar. Your bar with your number is in the vault and they owe you that&nbsp;bar.</p><p>Now that is an approach, right? That is the simplest form of smart property because the smart property never leaves the vault except one time then it’s no longer smart property. It’s just plain old property. So if we were in a position where we were doing this at scale, the thing in the vault it might not be a gold bar. It might be a Rolls Royce or a caravan or a jet pack. And, you buy and sell the NFT. “Hey, I might need this jet pack, so I’m going to buy the NFT for the jet pack, and I’m going to rent the NFT to other people that might want to use the jet pack, but I’m going to be the owner. And then when I need the jet pack I’m just not going to rent it in the days when I need it and then I’m going to go down there and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>And the line between the gold bar that sits in the vault and the jet pack that is constantly being taken in and out of storage and maintenance. It’s literally just some escrow contracts and some storage and maintenance. Legal frameworks. The semantics. Everything else. It’s exactly the same model. Here’s the NFT. Here’s the physical object. The NFT gives you the right to use the physical object. It’s just we start with the simplest example, which is gold where it stays in the vault and people tend not to take it out. Over time, more and more, it will be things which are moving in and out of storage, and then things which have no storage they’re just always in the hands of somebody who currently uses&nbsp;them.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/achieving-financial-resilience-with-gold-and-crypto-70f7a7ea91c3?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------">https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/achieving-financial-resilience-with-gold-and-crypto-70f7a7ea91c3?source=collection_home---4------1-----------------------</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-future-of-stuff-podcast-ep-1-what-is-smart-property-with-vinay-gupta-b1b42793e57">The Future of Stuff Podcast: Ep.1 What is Smart Property? with Vinay Gupta</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>While the chaos of 2020 wreaked havoc in many industries, the housing and mortgage markets boomed. Mortgage rates <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/refinance-demand-jumps-105percent-annually-as-mortgage-rates-set-record-low.html">set 15 records</a> in a single year as they dropped, encouraging equally record-breaking volume. In mid-December, mortgage applications were 26% higher than the previous year, while refinancing applications were up 105% from 2019. With rates still low, demand remains high, even with climbing costs and low inventory. On top of all the widespread adaptation required last year across the board, lenders have been sprinting to keep up with this high demand. The solution? Accelerated digitization of the lending process.</p>
<p>And artificial intelligence (AI) is opening the door to even more possibilities.</p>
 New Trends In The Mortgage Lending Market 
<p>Volume trends in the mortgage lending market are continuing in 2021. <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/housing-trends/">Bankrate reported</a> that the slowdown usually experienced by the market in the winter was far less noticeable this year, which implies that the first quarters of ‘21 will continue to see high demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Low rates haven’t been the only factor driving high mortgage lending volume. As social distancing became the norm across much of the economy, employees worked from home. And even as coronavirus cases dropped in some areas, <a href="https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-switching-remote-work-long-term/">many companies</a> announced a transition to long-term and even permanent work-from-home. This transformation has encouraged some employees, who were previously restrained by a daily commute, to move into a new home. As Bankrate puts it, “demand is especially high in neighborhoods outside of downtown city cores, as increasing work from home and virtual learning requirements have driven many homeowners to favor space over on-the-doorstep amenities.”</p>
<p>High demand, for all its reasons, is butting up against rising costs and low inventory. Low rates appear to be sufficient to encourage continued sales, despite <a href="https://www.realtor.com/research/december-2020-data/">median home prices</a> now rising above $340,000. This combination of factors means that we’re likely to see a competitive housing market persist over the coming months.</p>
<p>On top of factors driving high demand, other trends in the mortgage lending market are fostering change. For example, social distancing, quarantines, and lockdowns increased consumer adoption of digital and remote solutions. US <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/quarterly-online-sales/">ecommerce sales</a> jumped 37% by Q3 2020. Utilization of telemedicine and remote diagnostics increased. Remote education relied on digital learning solutions, as well as virtual communication tools like Zoom. Consumers, especially digital natives, were already expecting and becoming accustomed to digital solutions in many industries. Why wouldn’t they expect the same in mortgage lending?</p>
 The Digital Mortgage: How Mortgage Companies Are Adapting 
<p>With demand and market competition so hot, lenders are looking for ways to streamline their processes and keep up with consumers and potential homebuyers. The solution? Digital adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this high-demand mortgage lending market, mortgage companies may need one thing above all else: time. They need to cut cycle times, allowing for more loans to be processed. They need to save borrowers time to keep them satisfied. Traditional paper-based mortgage processes tend to take more time and involve more friction. Digital mortgages, on the other hand, streamline not only the mortgage application, but the entire lending process, removing high-friction back-and-forth with borrowers through digital verification solutions.</p>
<p>Digital verification solutions enable mortgage companies to adapt to high volumes and empower consumers along the way. Where paper-based verifications require borrowers to dig up old documents to verify creditworthiness, digital solutions powered by open banking, AI, and consumer-permissioned data, allow borrowers to quickly and securely share all the financial data necessary to get them a loan. Digital verifications enable mortgage lenders to automate and streamline workflows, all while delivering borrowers with a convenient, simple, digital-first experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to challenges revolving around time, today’s mortgage lenders are facing another issue in a physically-distanced world: trust. Borrowers are frequently navigating the mortgage application process or refinancing remotely, without meeting agents, sellers, buyers, and loan originators. Lenders can empower borrowers with a consumer-centric experience that enables them to control and benefit from their financial data. Layer that with <a href="https://www.finicity.com/data-aggregators-cra-fcra/">secure, consumer-centric data sharing principles and protocols</a> and lenders can build with borrowers valuable relationships founded on trust.</p>
<p>Some mortgage companies implement a digital solution here and there, but there’s a difference between doing digital and being digital. Any digital solution will of course help streamline processes and update workflows, but a completely digital workflow informed by a company-wide digital-first strategy enhances mortgage companies with consumer-first experiences that accelerate growth and increase ROI.&nbsp;</p>
 Why High Demand For Mortgages Needs A Digital Mortgage Solution 
<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Digital mortgage solutions</a> streamline the verification process and, by extension, the entire origination process. That streamlining cuts time from the origination and leaves more time to process more loans. A necessity in today’s high-demand market. As Allen Taylor of <a href="https://lending-times.com/2019/09/27/digital-lending-how-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-are-making-a-difference/">Lending Times </a>notes, leveraging digital solutions and AI models will “likely drive the greatest overall efficiencies, both reducing costs and boosting revenues. This enhanced efficiency can be used to drive competitive position and ultimately higher profits.”</p>
<p>As purchase volume and demand rises, <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/news/corelogic-reports-a-26.3-year-over-year-decrease-in-mortgage-fraud-risk-in-second-quarter-of-2020.aspx">so do chances of fraud and risk</a>. Fortunately, digital mortgage solutions reduce fraud and overall risk by connecting directly to secure financial institutions and getting the most accurate data from the most reliable sources.&nbsp;</p>
 How Digital Verification Is Facilitated By AI<br>
 
<p>The digital verification enabling streamlined digital mortgage owes part of its efficiency to artificial intelligence. This doesn’t mean that Watson or Alexa are performing your digital income verification. Instead, artificial intelligence leverages machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks to mimic human intelligence and predict, optimize, and automate tasks that were once performed manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ai-vs-machine-learning-vs-deep-learning-vs-neural-networks">IBM explains</a>, “Perhaps the easiest way to think about artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning is to think of them like Russian nesting dolls. Each is essentially a component of the prior term.” In brief, fundamental terms, here’s more on each AI component:</p>
 
 Neural network – Algorithms that mimic the neurons of a human brain. Consist of an input, weights (how correct or incorrect the input is relative to the task), a bias (or a threshold), and an output.&nbsp; 
 Deep learning&nbsp; – A multi-layered neural network. With more layers, artificial intelligence can produce a more accurate output from data fed into the network’s input.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Machine learning – Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is fundamentally the “<a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2016/07/29/whats-difference-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-deep-learning-ai/">practice of using algorithms</a> to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.” The machine learns to perform a task instead of being run through hand-coded software routines. “Classical” machine learning involves training the machine learning model to learn based on specific, labeled datasets fed in so the AI can distinguish between data inputs. This is also called “supervised learning.” “Deep” or “unsupervised” machine learning, on the other hand, involves AI learning without a labeled dataset by identifying patterns in data inputs. 
 
  
<p>In mortgage lending specifically, AI performs income, employment, and asset verification after a lender connects to a borrower’s bank accounts following a consumer permissioning experience. Once the consumer gives the borrower permission to access their financial data, that data enters the AI’s machine learning algorithm and the AI outputs information based on the task. For example, digital income verification involves the AI recognizing an income stream from financial transactions, and cleaning and categorizing data for a clear output that displays a borrower’s income situation.</p>
<p>Digital verification, powered by AI, automates what loan officers and underwriters once had to do manually. That automation enables lenders to, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesrealestatecouncil/2019/10/30/three-ways-ai-will-impact-the-lending-industry/?sh=523134816899">Forbes</a>, “reduce underwriting overhead and delays, which increases profits per loan.” In fact, <a href="https://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/applications-technology/day-1-certainty">Fannie Mae</a> has found that digital, AI solutions save up to 8 days for asset validation and up to 12 days for income and employment validation. Ultimately, AI-powered digital verification enhances the entire lending process, delivering a more streamlined experience for customers, and reducing risk while increasing ROI for lenders.</p>
 Finicity Can Help Your Mortgage Company Improve Their Process: Here’s How 
<p>Through our Finicity Lend solution set, we leverage AI capabilities to help lenders meet high demand. Our open banking platform, powered in part by artificial intelligence, identifies tradestreams in consumer-permissioned financial data and delivers cleaned data, ranked by confidence, in easy-to-read reports to lenders. Finicity Lend delivers valuable real-time data insights on:</p>
 
 Income 
 Employment 
 Assets 
 Cash Flow 
 Transactions 
 Statements 
 Scoring Attributes 
 
<p>These data solutions not only streamline the lending process and better enable lenders to meet high demand, but they also reduce risk and improve loans by enhancing decisioning. Finicity’s real-time data connections ensure high accuracy so that you get the clearest picture of a borrower’s financial situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in addition to the standard verification of income, employment, and assets, lenders can also get a more comprehensive view of a borrower with Cash Flow analytics. Cash Flow leverages artificial intelligence to identify tradestreams not traditionally considered in risk assessment, but that enhance a lender’s understanding of a borrower’s financial habits with a clear view of how money moves in and out of borrower accounts.</p>
<p>We want to make sure you get the most out of Finicity Lend and that your mortgage company can help its lending process reach its greatest potential. To that end, we offer best practices training to facilitate a smooth integration of Finicity solutions into mortgage platforms and an effective transition to a fully-digital mortgage process. We’re not just here to offer products; we’re here to be a resource so you can get the best results.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is helping lenders integrate digital mortgage solutions that don’t just meet high demand, but dominate it. With the all-star team-up of AI and open banking platforms, consumers can benefit from their financial data and increase their chances of getting a home loan, and lenders can enjoy enhanced decisioning and ROI, as well as an innovative workflow that hones their competitive edge. Don’t take our word for it. Check out <a href="https://www.finicity.com/lend/">Finicity Lend</a> and see for yourself what AI can do for you.</p>

By many measures, America is badly in need of competition <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/briefing/us-economy-biden-competition-order.html">According to the NYtimes’ David Leonhardt</a>, a boost in competition is badly&nbsp;needed:</p><blockquote>The U.S. economy has been less dynamic in the 21st century, by many measures, than it was in the late 20th&nbsp;century.</blockquote><blockquote>Fewer new businesses are starting. Existing businesses have slowed the pace at which they hire new workers (as the chart here shows). Workers are less likely to switch jobs or move to a new city. Companies are investing in new buildings and equipment at a lower rate. And small businesses make up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/opinion/big-business-mergers.html">a shrinking share of the&nbsp;economy</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Together, <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160916_searle_conference_competition_furman_cea.pdf">these trends</a> suggest that the economy suffers from a lack of fair competition, many economists believe. Large corporations are often able to increase profits not by providing better products than their rivals but instead by being so big that they exercise power over workers and consumers. The government also plays a role, through policies that protect existing companies at the expense of start-ups and new entrants into an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The lack of competitive dynamism plays a role in many of the U.S. economy’s biggest problems: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/10/opinion/us-economy-stagnation-growth.html">the disappointing economic growth</a> of the past two decades; <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W270RE1A156NBEA">the declining share</a> of output going to workers; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/opinion/income-inequality-upper-middle-class.html">rising income inequality</a>. It also helps explain the new concern — among both Republicans (like Josh Hawley and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22561157/ken-buck-antitrust-apple-amazon-facebook-google-cicilline-jim-jordan">Ken Buck</a>) and Democrats (like Elizabeth Warren and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/books/review/antitrust-amy-klobuchar.html">Amy Klobuchar</a>) — about the power of big business.</blockquote> 3. A bunch of those initiatives are aimed at Big&nbsp;Tech <p>Some relevant bits from <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">the Fact&nbsp;Sheet</a>:</p>  Announces an Administration policy of greater scrutiny of mergers, especially by dominant internet platforms, with particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by “free” products, and the effect on user&nbsp;privacy.  Encourages the FTC to establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of&nbsp;data.

He proposes a different vision, which he thinks offers brighter possibilities, centered around the concept of equality and non-demagogic appeals to patriotism.</blockquote> 6.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/hegde">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>
Michele Nati,  Head of Telco and Infrastructure Development at the IOTA Foundation, will participate in panels on Decentralized Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Michele some questions about what he will bring to the panels.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Are we entering a new era of identity with decentralized identity?</p>
<p>
Absolutely. Yes, we are changing the way we generate identities, we manage identities and we verify identities and we access services. So the European Commission is already looking forward on how to change this. There are new regulations, that are currently under discussion on how to reform the identity space, especially, state identities moving from a centralized approach toward a more decentralized approach where identities can be issued by government, but also be verified across different government without direct interaction of offices, adding bureaucracy, adding administrational burden. And on top of that collect credentials and attributes that allow people to show who actually they are in a trusted way, what attributes their identity brings forward to access services, i.e., to be verified for age restriction whenever it's needed. So this can happen now in a much more decentralized way rather than centralized.</p>
<p>So the European Commission itself is looking at how to expand and adapt the initial eIDAS network, which was a network between member states to create and issue state identity for digital services that was still relying on a centralized concept. And now it's moving towards a decentralized view. Now they start to look into employing ledgers – as they call them, where we know there are distributed ledger or blockchain technologies – to be the underlying trust rather than the members themselves, that guarantee a person is who they claim to be when they travel, when they move, when they try to access services across different states in Europe. </p>
<p>And that's just the start. We see this way of people moving and being trusted across a border as well across countries, across oceans hopefully. Things like this are happening also in other countries, in other continents. And one of these reforms of eIDAS will also culminate with what is the introduction of actually digital wallets. Digital wallets that people will carry with them with their mobile phone, to carry not any more currency, not any more credit cards, debit cards, or tokens like somebody is doing for payments, but carrying their identities, their identity credential that they can present, that they can use to access services. </p>
<p>So, imagine I go to a doctor and I want to show what I actually need assistance for in a foreign country. There is no more need for the doctor to go and look for this in my origin countries, to make phone calls but get this from my wallet as a credential that everybody can trust because it's been issued by central trusted authority in my country and verified using a ledger (like IOTA).   </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The current status quo revolves around centralized, federated identities. As decentralized identity initiatives gain momentum, do you see the two forms of identity coexisting? How do you see this confrontation playing out? </p>
<p>
So that's a very good point. And it’s also actually one of the reasons we still see a bit of a delay in the new concept of decentralized identities moving forward. Because the idea before was all or nothing. So one identity or the other, and that's not actually the way I see this going forward. The way it's a complementarity. Of course, there will be cases and scenarios where identities like this concept of self-sovereign identities can be self-issued. So identities decentralized now self-sovereign is basically an identifier that is immutable on a ledger and a public key in terms of cryptography. </p>
<p>A private key is always controlled by the subject who created the identity. So there is no more need for a government – let's say – to create that identifier, it’s the number of my passport let’s say. So anybody can create that and can start to collect credentials, but there will be use cases in which it will be enough to collect a credential that states: “It's me.” And they have some features or attributes like: “I live in a country” or “another country” that can come from other identities that can sum up and say: “I can say that Michele lives in this country or that country because of interaction with him”. </p>
<p>But there will be also use cases where I need some other authority that have done proper KYC of me that have verified all the aspect of my identities or legal or any other position like state identity that can say: “Actually, Michele is who he claims to be”. Credit card issuer, debit card issuer that will do KYC. So this will create not a different identity. It will create a credential that sits on top of this decentralized system that adds more value to my attributes because it comes from an established authority that have done controls, have done proper KYC. It’s a bit more value, a bigger value. So it's a different level of assurance when I interact with a third-party. </p>
<p>So long story short, there is no competition, in my opinion. There is a complementarity, there is integration of this technology and what the identity was in the past, and new identity will be in the future with a central point being the person controlling it. But there will be still a role for centralized identity providers to start to issue new credentials and empower citizens and people to manage them and present them. So, there will be the need of course, to re-invent some of the business models that exist in the domain. But of course, I see this as a complimentary landscape that will come together for a greater good. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You will be part of a panel discussion at EIC – centered around the application of decentralized identity in eCommerce. Could you provide a sneak peek into the topic of discussion? </p>
<p>
Absolutely. We [IOTA Foundation] are working on this project called ENSURESEC. It's a European project founded under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/what-horizon-2020">Horizon 2020</a> Framework. It's an innovation action. So you actually try to establish new technology and test their viability in the market for creating innovation and creating also better processes. And we are actually tackling the eCommerce infrastructure having in mind also to create a more seamless way for the digital single market infrastructure that Europe is building up in a way that is trusted across countries. And the one way that we see one of the barriers – basically the difficulties – for small and medium companies to basically be part of an eCommerce marketplace, because they have either to rely on third party and they have to build their customer base. When this comes, they bring also a lot of data about their customers, especially if you think about small and medium enterprises selling age-restricted items or items that are only being sold (like drugs and medicine) and dispatched [only] to people that have the right requirements. That all of this requires the small company to either be with a bigger player, or be able to evolve a new infrastructure that is secure to maintain all this personal data, all this sort of information that exposes the risk of cybersecurity [threats] for them. </p>
<p>So with decentralized identity, we are exploring the opportunity for them to still have the same knowledge of their customers, still able to verify age still able to verify any other feature before providing whatever the customer is aiming to buy with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials. So this knowledge, this information is not anymore a burden for them to create, so they can speed up and lower the body of friction to be part of a digital single marketplace. So this is one example.  </p>
<p>We are also testing decentralized identity, not only for persons, but also for a company itself. So if a company has to open up an eCommerce store, again they [will] need to prove they have enough cover of any liability. This information also requires checks and what is best then a bank – that also has a knowledge of the logging book, accounting book of an SME – [to] issue a credential toward the marketplace operator for the company to operate in a way that's seamless and the proof that a company can receive finance credit and trade finance, and so on and so forth.   </p>
<p>So, there are a few ways we are exploring this to use decentralized identity in creating a more, let's say dynamic, frictionless eCommerce infrastructure, and still maintain the security that eCommerce should provide. Because these days more than before with the COVID experience, lockdown, we rely on eCommerce much more than before and more and more will be in the future. </p>

 By Li Jun, Founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, public blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and&nbsp;data <p>We see that it was the third anniversary of your mainnet launch at the end of June, congratulations! Could you tell us a bit about why decentralized identity and data solutions have been the focus of Ontology’s vision over the past three&nbsp;years.</p><p>Since our MainNet launch three years ago, decentralized identity solutions and secure data management have become increasingly important. Every day, individuals make millions of transactions online, whether they be related to social media, banking, ecommerce, or work. Despite this increased digital migration, privacy and security have not advanced in tandem. Every day we see new data breaches involving the exposure of millions of users’ sensitive personal information, yet people rarely stop to question how companies and services are collecting and using their&nbsp;data.</p><p>At Ontology, we want to empower users to take back control of how their digital identity is managed online, where their data is stored, and how it is protected. Our mission is to facilitate a decentralized identity framework that uses blockchain technology to redefine trust and challenge the status&nbsp;quo.</p><p>What are some of the strategic partnerships that have informed your success over the&nbsp;years?</p><p>Strategic partnerships have been highly valuable for creating technical use cases of our decentralized solutions over the last few years and in reflecting buy-in from key industry players. We were proud to partner with Mercedes manufacturer Daimler last year to launch the “Welcome Home” app for automobiles, which uses Ontology’s bespoke digital identity and decentralized solutions through a personalized identity management system.</p><p>In the blockchain world, we have been delighted to see the integration of Ontology’s solutions on other public chains including Ethereum and other mainstream public blockchains.</p><p>What are Ontology’s plans for the future and how does your development of an Ethereum Virtual Machine feed into&nbsp;this?</p><p>Decentralized identity and data will remain the key focus of Ontology’s offering as we move forward. As well as this, we recently announced the integration of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which will connect our trusted decentralized identity solutions with millions of developers and users in the EVM-based blockchain ecosystem upon completion, later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Our goal is to establish seamless interoperability between the Ontology and Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. This is a big step towards allowing all blockchain projects to easily adopt Ontology’s DID solutions into their products.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>As you likely already know, the UK Gambling Commission set out to put in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/new-gaming-regulations/">new regulations in the gaming industry</a> with a focus on online gambling in May 2019. These new regulations aimed to make gambling safer and fairer, with one of the key changes being increased strictness around age verification.</p>
<p>Gambling operators must now verify customer age before the customer is able to deposit funds, gamble using their money, use a free bet bonus, or access any ‘free to play’ versions of gambling games. This comes as a rather large shift, as operators could previously take 72 hours to verify customer age, and, while the operators could not issue pay-outs during that time, the user could still use the platform while waiting for a verification result.</p>
<p>This, among other changes, has had a huge impact on website operations, creating several issues that may be very difficult to overcome. Let us take a look at some of the biggest changes from the new regulations and their impact on gambling operations in the UK.</p>
 Increased Barrier to Entry 
<p>One of the biggest issues in gaming in the UK was caused by the new regulations is an increased barrier to entry for customers. Previously, potential users could sign up to a website and instantly place bets, play games, or partake in any other activity.</p>
<p>However, operators are now required to verify age before providing access, meaning it is impossible for users to instantly play. This causes multiple problems for the user, from struggling to provide the required information, to simply getting bored of waiting for verification or even forgetting a website they signed up for altogether, as they must now wait for verification.</p>
<p>This will no doubt hurt the number of users signing up, as well as the overall conversion rate of signup to bets placed or games played.</p>
 Higher Operating Costs 
<p>With these new regulatory requirements comes an increase in the UK gaming industry’s operating costs. Players will no doubt flock to websites that can verify their information the quickest, meaning speed will be key to attracting new customers.</p>
<p>With every customer having to be verified on signup before they can place a deposit, it will be in every operator’s best interest to make the process as quick and painless as possible.</p>
<p>Whether this means hiring staff to manually validate data or investing in a verification platform, costs will rise.</p>
 How IDnow’s AutoIdent Solves New UK Gambling Regulation Issues 
<p>Along with providing a new set of regulations, the UK Gambling Commission also recommended for operators to consider using AI or biometric applications to identify players. These ID-Powered identification tools would provide a seamless onboarding system, reducing verification times and lowering the threshold of human error.</p>
<p>IDnow’s AI-Powered ID verification tool, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, is the perfect solution to the issues created by the newest gaming regulations in the UK. IDnow uses artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents, with a key focus on round security and uncomplicated application for the customer. It makes the process as straightforward as following simple on-screen prompts and completing verification within minutes, boasting a conversion rate of over 90%.</p>
<p>IDnow is also very proud to be recognised by winning the EGR Awards 2021 and we were also in the Headline Category Compliance &amp; KYC Supplier.</p>
<p>“A very impressive entry and a good submission. They understand the potential of technology but also that human instinct is important is key to successful solutions.”</p>
<p>This would both greatly reduce the barrier to entry, as well as overall costs. Users could sign up and be verified by AutoIdent in minutes, all while being guided every step of the way by the program. There would also be no need to use staff to manually check documents, as the AI-Powered ID verification tool would do just that, and IDnow specialists are always available for a manual review, in the unlikely case it is needed. With already having a strong presence in the UK market IDnow expanded with a UK entity in mid-2020.</p>
<p>IDnow already has partnerships with prominent companies such as Klarna, Paysafe, Macropay, Holvi, N26, Allied Irish Banks as well as some of the leading gambling operators such as Entain, which owns Ladbrokes and Coral, Lottoland, Kindred Group, etc. With a strong team and years of experience, IDnow’s AutoIdent is the perfect way to adapt to ever-tightening gaming regulations.</p>

<p>KILT Protocol aims to secure an initial Kusama parachain slot, planning to bid for slots in the 6–10 range. KILT’s team has been hard at work building and testing our technology so that we can launch with significant functionality, rather than adding core elements later. Here’s an update on KILT’s strategies towards network&nbsp;launch.</p><p>The long-awaited parachain auctions have started and, like all of you, we’ve been watching with interest.</p><p>Behind the scenes we’ve been focused on building and auditing our technology, and fine-tuning a token economy that could enable and incentivise functionalities in the network while aiming to avoid the pitfalls of high inflation. Here’s a brief outline of what we’ve been up&nbsp;to.</p> The Tech <p>As promised by Kusama, we can all expect chaos. However, we also like mitigating risk! So we decided to take the time to test our parachain in close to real-life scenarios, doing load testing, figuring out edge cases of the token economy and trying to break the Relay Chain. We surely were the project spending most time on the Westend testnet — thanks to Parity for all the time and engagement!</p><p>As a result of this preparation, at launch KILT’s parachain will already include significant activated functionality: staking and our initial token&nbsp;economy.</p><p>This means staking will be possible on KILT from genesis. To enable this, we selected and set up the first group of collators who are being onboarded now. We are thrilled by their commitment to KILT and enthusiasm for the protocol at this early stage. Further details on the KILT’s Initial Collator Programme to follow&nbsp;soon.</p><p>After the successful golive of the network, the number of Collators will be increased gradually and becoming a Collator will become permissionless.</p><p>As we <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">announced last week</a>, KILT will launch as a Limited Delegated Proof of Stake (LDPoS) network. This variation of proof of stake will allow token holders to delegate their stake to the collators. We chose this mechanism as part of a carefully-considered token economy that aims to have relatively low inflation, promoting the efficient use of resources and contributing to the long-term economic stability of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We have engaged external security firms to audit and test our token economy implementation, so it’s ready for the early days of KILT’s parachain. We look forward to sharing a detailed outline of our token economy in the near&nbsp;future.</p> Obtaining Our Parachain Slot <p>To date the crowdloans have been extremely successful, with the first five slots anticipated to capture close to 10% of the current KSM supply, which is approximately 11M tokens. In reality the supply is much lower, because half (5.5M of the 11M) of the current distribution is needed for staking to secure the network. So 20% of the available 5.5M KSM in circulation is now locked up by the first five slots, not taking into account some free float and&nbsp;hodlers.</p><p>Watching the auctions over the past four weeks, we came to the following conclusions:</p><p>We anticipate the momentum with crowdloans to continue through the next few slots and have created a strategy for how to best optimise our entry point while building for the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We want KILT to be decentralised and run by community governance. We believe that the stability of the KILT network is best reached by independence from market fluctuations and from short-term adoption.</p><p>An important factor for this is the ability of the network to fund all its necessary resources itself, in the long run. These are the options we are currently reflecting on:</p> Self-funding <p>As preparation for our launch on Kusama, months ago we accumulated an amount of KSM we believe will be a reasonable long-term average price for a slot. By self-funding this amount, KILT would ideally have the resources to bid for any subsequent slot without further crowdfunding, as the locked KSM is returned at the end of a lease. In addition to generating stability and low inflation, this would make KILT independent of short-term market fluctuations.</p> Crowdloans <p>There are two things to consider regarding crowdloans.</p><p>First, the momentum in the price of Kusama parachain slots may continue in the short term, making it unwise to over-commit self-funding, and sensible to create a crowdloan.</p><p>Even more importantly, crowdloans provide a way for the community to participate and therefore we could begin the process of decentralisation — even before KILT’s mainnet launch. To accommodate this option without introducing extra inflation into the system, we have reserved 3% of the initial distribution of KILT Coins for a crowdloan boost for our first&nbsp;slot.</p> Future Kusama&nbsp;Auctions <p>In the Kusama ecosystem, when the first round of 48-week slots ends, we assume that the number of total slots will have greatly increased while the total distribution of KSM will have increased much less, due to the KSM inflation. So we expect that the slot price will be at reasonable levels at that time, and may be comfortably achieved by our self-funding provision, allowing greater freedom to KILT governance.</p> Entering Polkadot <p>Additionally, we have worked out a Treasury scheme that we envision will create a secure source of self-funding for KILT’s future parachain slots on Polkadot, as determined by community governance. Stated simply: KILT Coins will be minted into the Treasury on chain over a long period of time. The blockchain’s governance mechanism shall potentially be able to trade these KILT Coins for DOT, building up a DOT treasury on the KILT blockchain that could be held and used for subsequent community-initiated biddings for Polkadot parachain slots. We are continuing to refine this concept, which would add another utility and interesting use case for DOT as well as a new approach for our ecosystem. More details will be outlined in our forthcoming token economy document.</p><p>Note that there will be only one KILT Coin. If KILT’s blockchain governance bids on a Polkadot slot, the new Polkadot blockchain will hold the same balances.</p> The Way&nbsp;Forward <p>At this point in time, the duration of the pause between Kusama auctions 5 and 6 is yet to be communicated. And we realise it may be a matter of weeks or even months, depending on how much chaos will be observed. While we (and other projects!) are anxious for auctions to proceed so we can launch, we will use any additional time to add even more functionality to KILT’s blockchain on Day&nbsp;One.</p><p>As ever, we are extremely grateful for your continued support and patience, and look forward to bringing KILT to the world as soon as possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilts-parachain-plans-an-update-efb9a9e35394">KILT’s Parachain Plans: An Update</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In more good news for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">data privacy legislation</a>&nbsp;in the US, the Colorado Legislature&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/colorado-privacy-act-passes-professionals-ponder-effects/">passed the&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;(CPA) on June 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colorado joins&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">California and Virginia</a>&nbsp;in having comprehensive privacy legislation.</p>



<p>Like the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>, the CPA gives consumers some significant rights to control their personal data:</p>



  Consumers will be able to opt out of the sale of personal data and the processing of their data for targeted advertising and profiling purposes. Consumers will also be able to authorize another person to opt out on their behalf.&nbsp;  Consumers will need to consent (opt in) to companies processing “sensitive” personal data, which may include information about their&nbsp;religious&nbsp;beliefs, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and physical or mental health.  Consumers will be able to request that companies delete their personal information or correct it for inaccuracies.&nbsp;  



<p>But Colorado goes further than California and Virginia in some areas; for example, by providing for:&nbsp;</p>



  Rigorous limitations on secondary uses of data and the requirement for opt-in on those uses. Companies will have to state the purposes for which they’re collecting information and not change purposes later.  Banning companies from using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">dark patterns</a>, which are intentional UX features of websites and apps designed to make it harder for users to do what they want, either through complexity or deception. Dark patterns are like traps to get more of users’ personal information and to tempt users into buying products and services.&nbsp;  A&nbsp;“universal” opt-out mechanism which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/06/10/why-colorado-s-privacy-bill-may-be-big-mountain-climb-marketers">commentators</a>&nbsp;say is like the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/global-privacy-control?r=US&amp;IR=T">Global Privacy Control</a>solution. This means consumers can opt out of data collection for advertising purposes across all services at once rather than opt out separately at each site or company they access.&nbsp;  A 60-day cure period in which companies can fix any mistakes in compliance. This cure period will be phased out in January 2025.  



<p>The CPA will apply to any organization doing business in Colorado or targeting Colorado residents with their products and services, which processes or controls the personal data of more than 100,000 consumers a year or derives revenue from selling personal data and processing or controlling the personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.</p>



<p>Fines for non-compliance can be up to $500,000.The CPA will come into effect on July 1, 2023.</p>

			 Public Blockchains Are Now Suitable for Financial Institutions<br>
 
<p>A blockchain is a network, it is an ecosystem. It is a group of people who agree to safeguard a ledger and validate digital transactions with the same technical consensus. A blockchain is a shared infrastructure that users can access at any time and use on demand.</p>
<p>Launching a new or private blockchain means that you need to start a whole ecosystem from scratch, where all participants must trust the node owners, and the consensus mechanism.&nbsp;Private blockchains are like intranets. Public blockchains are the new internet of value.</p>
<p>We understand that public blockchains can be scary for financial institutions, as they are used to controlling and securing their own infrastructure. But we need to understand, a blockchain is inherently more secure than any centralized server. That’s why we launched Tokeny almost 4 years ago, to create a decentralized system where our users can benefit from the best of both worlds:&nbsp;the security and interoperability of public blockchains and the control from private blockchains.</p>
<p>We have made public blockchains suitable for financial institutions:</p>
 
 Control:&nbsp;if it is decentralized enough, you don’t need to control the nodes of the blockchain, you need to control your token smart contracts. We allow this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">T-REX protocol</a>. Rules are encoded in the tokens and you can perform actions at any moment on the tokens you issued, even if they are not in your wallet. 
 Compliance:&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">ONCHAINID,</a>&nbsp;all your stakeholders are pseudonymously identified on the blockchain. You can therefore encode transfer rules, give permissions, manage authorizations the way you want in order to apply compliance rules. 
 Security:&nbsp;with no incident in years, public networks like Ethereum are now recognized as secure and decentralized by the majority of large financial institutions, service providers and regulators. 
 Gas fees: public blockchains are on demand, but you need to pay when you use it. For this, you usually need some crypto-tokens in your wallet, and the price per transaction depends on several factors that you cannot control or anticipate. With our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-has-solved-the-problem-of-gas-fees/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_T4ix9Bcw-9bq0y5t_rfG7g7qAmw1LNbQFrBTTY10LlC0rew1DZ9_tOpCXNCxJkzUUuCfo">Gas Tank</a>&nbsp;feature, you don’t need crypto in your wallet anymore. And, we even pay the gas fees for you on Polygon! 
 Privacy:&nbsp;blockchain data is pseudonyms, you can see addresses, but no names. Thanks to our identity system ONCHAINID, you can change your wallets easily without losing your assets, making your identity harder to trace. Mostly, investors want more transparency, they want proof of the total supply, they want to know if there are many movements or not, they want proof they can trust the issuer, especially when you reach a global audience of investors. 
 
<p>We are ready to help you benefit from this new infrastructure enabling digital transfer of value.</p>

<p>In today’s society, everyone has experienced the need to rely on third party agents to handle matters for us. For instance, you may authorise lawyers and real estate agents to act on your behalf when buying a beachfront villa (lucky you!). When travelling to Mongolia, you may also authorise a local travel agent to book a yurt for your stargazing trip.</p><p>However, it is difficult to authenticate whether a third party agent has the proper authorisation, or will only conduct themselves within the instructions given to them. Trust has always been an issue — relying on an agent comes with risks — forgery of signatures, overuse of authority, and uncertainty about an agent’s real authority are classic risks that we are all familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>One way to overcome these problems is for the person or entity seeking to authorise a proxy (for the purpose of this article, let’s call them “Principal”) to use <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> to appoint verifiable proxies. This is called “proxy issuance”</p> How Verifiable Credentials are Used for Proxy Issuance? <p>In proxy issuance, the issuer is an entity (individual/organization) that authorizes another person or entity to act on its behalf by issuing a verifiable credential (VC) to that person or entity (called the “holder”). The holder is the party who has the authority to act on behalf of the issuer. The verifier is the entity that checks the validity and legality of the holder to act on behalf of the&nbsp;issuer.</p><p>Let’s understand the workflow&nbsp;here.</p>  Firstly, the issuer (Principal) and the holder (agent) create a unique set of private-public key pairs. The issuer generates a VC, digitally signs using its private key, and encrypts the data using the holder’s public&nbsp;key.  This VC is sent to the holder who can decrypt it using his or her private&nbsp;key.  Next, the holder can choose to save the VC in a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital identity&nbsp;wallet</a>.  When needed, the holder compiles a set of VCs like date of birth, government ID, etc, along with the proxy authorization, into a verifiable presentation that is digitally signed with the holder’s private key and encrypted using the verifier’s public&nbsp;key.  The verifier can decrypt [the verifiable presentation] using its private key and validates the digital signature of both the issuer and the holder using their respective public keys to ensure the authenticity of the issuer and the holder. Once verified, the holder becomes eligible to act, and disclose limited and pre-approved information, on behalf of the&nbsp;issuer.  <p>Here is a real-world example.</p>  John is an American individual who has traveled to Singapore and is unable to return to the US in time for a board&nbsp;meeting.  He decides to authorize his brother Sam to vote on his behalf, and issues a verifiable credential for this authorization  On the day of the board meeting, Sam creates a verifiable presentation with John’s authorization VC and his identity proof. The same is verified by the board chair who approves the proxy. Finally, Sam casts a vote on John’s&nbsp;behalf.  <p>In this example, John is the issuer, Sam is the holder, and the board chair is the verifier.</p><p>Here’s how a possible VC could look like. This VC was generated from Affinidi’s <a href="https://vc-generator.com/">VC Generator app</a>.</p> {<br>  "type": "MetaCredentialPersonV1",<br>  "data": {<br>    "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": [<br>      "Person",<br>      "PersonE",<br>      "MetaPerson"<br>    ],<br>    "name": "Bob Belcher",<br>    "receivedCredentials": {<br>      "<a href="http://twitter.com/type">@type</a>": [<br>        "Role",<br>        "ReceivedCredentialRole"<br>      ],<br>      "startDate": "start",<br>      "endDate": "end",<br>      "aggregatorDID": "did:elem:...",<br>      "typesSome": [<br>        "type 1"<br>      ],<br>      "typesAll": [<br>        "type 2"<br>      ],<br>      "typesNot": [<br>        "type 3"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsSome": [<br>        "context 1"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsAll": [<br>        "context 2"<br>      ],<br>      "contextsNot": [<br>        "context 3"<br>      ],<br>      "issuerDIDIn": [<br>        "did 1"<br>      ],<br>      "issuerDIDNotIn": [<br>        "did 2"<br>      ],<br>      "receivedCredentials": [<br>        "vc 1",<br>        "vc 2"<br>      ]<br>    }<br>  },<br>  "holderDid": ""<br>}  Benefits of Using Verifiable Credentials for Proxy&nbsp;Issuance <p>The big question is, should you use verifiable credentials for proxy issuance?</p><p>Yes, because it addresses many of the problems that come with the traditional principal-agent problem.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the benefits that come with using verifiable credentials for issuing&nbsp;proxies.</p> Reduces Forgery <p>One of the biggest problems with appointing agents the traditional way is forgery. An agent can easily forge a principal’s signature. Verifying parties may simply choose to rely on the signature presented to them. Any additional authentication methods may require the verifying party to contact the principal — which may not be possible, or time and cost intensive.</p><p>VCs overcome this problem with digital signatures that are secured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">Public Key Infrastructure</a>, where a pair of private and public keys are used to ensure that the verifiable credential was issued by the principal to the agent, and not by a person purporting to act as the principal.</p> Creates Trustable Data <p>Many times, verifying entities like banks and financial institutions do not have trust in the proxy appointment process and may not trust agents for important transactions. This causes inconvenience to both the issuer and the verifier, as the issuer may not be able to travel personally to meet the verifying entity.</p><p>VCs may overcome this impediment by creating a reliable way to verify that a proxy has been validly appointed, through the process of securing the credential with the digital signature of both the issuer and the holder, so the verifier can be assured of the authenticity of the proxy’s credentials.</p> Quick and&nbsp;Easy <p>Sharing and authenticating VCs are quick and easy, and take less than a couple of minutes to verify. Since the VCs are machine-readable data, they can be read quickly by the verifying authority’s machine and verified almost instantaneously.</p><p>There are no more long wait times and background checks with VC-based appointment of&nbsp;proxies.</p><p>Overall, using VCs for proxy issuance is easy,&nbsp;, promotes trust, and follows the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> principles of control over one’s data and selective disclosure.</p><p>Here’s an example of a VC-based proxy issuance <a href="https://devpost.com/software/daver-proxy">implementation</a> that was submitted for <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-pocathon-2021-announcing-the-winners-40b2a5a79fa4">Affinidi’s PoCathon&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.

 Centralized data management is outdated and vulnerable to hacking, says Li Jun of Ontology. Here’s how blockchain can make data more&nbsp;secure. <p>A recent <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/">study</a> on cybersecurity statistics revealed that data breaches exposed 36 billion records in the first half of 2020 alone. If we stop and think about that for a second, it is truly staggering. Users are currently the most vulnerable they have ever been, with the global pandemic exacerbating the risks of fraud as people are forced to increasingly operate online. With the migration of services online has come an increased responsibility to manage the way data is&nbsp;stored.</p><p>Traditionally, different sectors have used centralized paper or spreadsheets on internal computers to house information and data sets. However, as we have seen, increasingly sophisticated technology has led to a higher risk of threats to private information, especially when housed on centralized systems. Moving forward, it is essential that businesses and individuals invest in decentralized solutions to store and manage data. On a macro scale, end-to-end technology run on blockchain enables private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. From an individual perspective, investment in decentralized digital identity solutions can help users take back control of how and when their data is shared, especially when the current systems are not taking adequate precautions to protect their&nbsp;privacy.</p> The risks of centralized data <p>Despite unprecedented developments in technology over the past 30 years, many of the systems that underpin the way we share and manage data are frighteningly outdated. Within the healthcare sphere, it is still common practice for hospitals to store patient data on centralized systems. This means that large portions of sensitive patient information are too often stored on computers and spreadsheets with limited security.</p><p>Recent <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/to-pay-or-not-to-pay-hse-faces-a-choice-between-two-evils-following-cyberattack-1.4568665">events</a> within Ireland showcased the inherent risks of housing data like this, as hackers infiltrated the Irish Health Service Executive’s (HSE) centralized systems and stole significant quantities of patients’ personal information. Screenshots and files of patient information were then posted online in a bid to extract a ransom from the government. Reflecting the significant dangers of ineffective data management, the national healthcare service was forced to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/13d33a08-ce83-4f8a-8d93-a60a5e097ed8">suspend</a> the majority of its IT systems, causing significant delays and issues for millions of patients at a time when the country was trying to curb its Covid-19 cases. The issue has remained high on the political agenda, with the fallout still being felt by patients, healthcare professionals and the government more than a month&nbsp;later.</p><p>From a security point of view, the implications of this breach were huge. Thousands of people reported receiving <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/hse-hack-scammers-5443123-May2021/">scam</a> texts and emails in the weeks after, suggesting that their information had been shared or sold online. Indeed, sensitive data is a highly valuable resource and can be used to blackmail and discriminate when placed in the wrong hands. On a more global scale, the housing of personal information on centralized social media platforms has led to devastating data breaches over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>Most recently, tech giant Facebook exposed the private emails and numbers of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2021/04/06/facebook-data-breach-heres-what-to-do-now/?sh=6e91234b5708">533 million users</a> by making changes to its security systems. Since then, there has been a proliferation in scam calls and texts to people across the world, as well as reports of identity <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/20345/its-time-to-address-your-data-security-the-same-goes-for-your-bank">theft</a>. In this age, where the fabric of our civilization is underpinned by technology and online interactions, it is more important than ever that companies and individuals work to ensure their private information remains secure and&nbsp;private.</p><p>Without the correct protections in place, centralized systems become dangerous houses of sensitive information. Reflecting this, a study by the <a href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/money/2021/05/24/what-you-should-shredding-and-why/5162830001/">National Association of Information Destruction</a> found that 40% of resold electronic devices contain personally identifiable information including usernames, passwords and credit card information.</p><p>As it stands, consumers have limited knowledge of the huge risks inherent in inputting personal data without any oversight of where it is stored or who can access it. Elsewhere, a study by the Pew Research Center found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81% of participants</a> said that t<a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/a-more-privacy-first-web/">he potential risks they face because of data collection on the internet outweigh the benefits</a>. Despite this, users still have to provide sensitive personal information to websites which then house their information on ineffective centralized systems that are highly susceptible to breaches.</p> How decentralization can protect data&nbsp;privacy <p>As people increasingly conduct business, socialize, and communicate through the internet, greater checks must be in place to ensure that their privacy is protected and that they control what information they share online. Going forward, a move to decentralized identity solutions is essential to ensure data privacy and security. By facilitating end-to-end technology run on blockchain, decentralized solutions enable private information to be shared securely, while users remain in full control of their data. In contrast to centralized solutions, decentralized systems ensure private data remains immutable and secure and is only able to be shared when outlined users consent to provide information.</p><p>Moving forward, any system that is required to store significant swathes of data, whether that’s in healthcare, finance, or the media, must invest in this technology. But it must work both ways and it is also important that individuals take personal responsibility for protecting their own sensitive data. By investing in digital identity solutions, users can take back control of how and when their data is shared, limiting the capacity of hackers and large corporations to collect information that is not authorized. There are many applications that allow users to securely manage their digital identity by storing it on a platform or mobile with a private key that grants access to the verified user&nbsp;only.</p><p>With the proliferation of the online world and the internet economy, privacy and effective data storage have become all the more important. Current centralized systems cannot protect user information and ensure privacy and data security. To remedy our current vulnerability, it is essential that businesses and individuals invest in decentralized solutions in order to ensure that their most personal information is protected. Decentralized data platforms and digital identity solutions are essential in the fight to protect user data and must be leveraged in order to create a more safe and sustainable data driven ecosystem.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With the Mattereum Protocol <p>The global fine art and antiquities trade is struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model. To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in this space, we have vaulted, passported, and tokenized three distinct artifacts, securing their provenance and trade so their storied value is never&nbsp;lost.</p><p>A story goes that the eccentric master painter Salvador Dalí would — in lieu of paying his restaurant bill with cash — draw a quick sketch on a napkin or one-dollar bill to hand to the staff instead. While this can be seen as certainly odd (true to form) or perhaps even rude (doesn’t help pay the waiter’s bills), one thing is certain: Dalí’s personal brand was and still is capable of a strange alchemy of turning a mundane material into an object of historical and cultural&nbsp;value.</p><p>Which begs the question: If the story of a thing is essential to its value, how do we chronicle this story? How do we ensure that a Dalí piece doesn’t become separated from its history, and consequently, it’s value? Not only for fine art, but for all manner of cultural artifacts?</p><p>The caretakers and curators of works of art, who are often wary of incorporating new technologies into their practice, are struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model around their stock. To work, the solution must be designed with the realities and particularities of their profession in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Enter Mattereum</p><p>To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in the global art and antiquities trade, Mattereum Head of Ontology and former museum curator Dr. James Hester acquired three different cultural artifacts to be vaulted, passported, and tokenized:</p>  A 350,000 year-old stone hand axe excavated from&nbsp;France  A 19th-20th century bronze statue of Buddhist protector deity&nbsp;Acala  A signed and numbered etching by Dalí&nbsp;himself  <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0</a><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Trust Communities, and Real-World Asset&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p><p>Let’s walk through how these three objects were onboarded onto this system. By doing so, we will also unpack the value propositions for the $60 billion fine art and antiquities market.</p> Asset Passports: Securing Identity and Provenance <p>In short, an Asset Passport is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification (with core data points provided by the owner, such as vaulting&nbsp;status).</p><p>Other warranties that may accompany an asset may include a reference to the particular tagging system used for in-person authentication of the item (such as scannable NFC chips affixed to the object) or the token smart contract if the object has been tokenized and “uploaded” to an NFT marketplace.</p><p>For example, the warranties tied to the passported and tokenized etching of Dali’s “Le fuite de Satan” (The Flight of Satan) can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.ph.dali.fuitesatan.1974.129773.3.20/#02_NFT">here</a>:</p><p>Using the Ricardian framework designed by Mattereum Chief Scientist Ian Grigg, all of the legal and digital agreements around these objects are bundled together, signed on the blockchain and stored on IPFS, establishing a secure record of provenance.</p><p>In practice, the Asset Passport aggregates warranties and object data using established best practices. Designed by a former museum curator, experts in the field will appreciate the attention to detail that goes into generating these passports. The dispute resolution and insurance baked in also provides peace of mind for professionals outside&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>It is important to note that the Asset Passport is not a singular or static thing, but an integrated structure composed of software and legal elements which will evolve over time along the object’s journey: a living document.</p><p>An incredible utility of an asset passport is in its composability, the capability of programming value flows and social interactions around the object. Let’s take a look at what we can build on this foundation.</p> Trust Communities: Crowdsourcing Expert Certification <p>In 2018, the Terrus museum in Southern France discovered that over half of its collection — around $190,000 worth — were in fact forgeries.</p><p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd</a></p><p>Unfortunately, stories like this are common in the arts and antiquities world. The sophistication of forgery has only improved over time, and institutions are having to adapt their practice accordingly with methods such as chemical analysis. But despite best efforts, if there is even the slightest chink in the armor, the system will remain vulnerable.</p><p>The prevailing method for certifying fine art and antiquities is a disconnected, patchwork process of consulting specialist firms with data logged in separate silos around the world. This lack of a shared inventory database presents a fundamental flaw at the infrastructure level. There is no single source of truth or a collective means of aggregating this data over time. Until&nbsp;now.</p><p>Once an Asset Passport has been generated, it can give rise to some interesting applications: such as Trust Communities, a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized expert certification that elegantly brings assets from zero history to storied value with built-in legal warranties, insurance, and dispute resolution.</p>Trust Communities<p>By bringing together multiple third-party sources of information on objects, it is possible for an object’s Asset Passport to contain several independent assessments of its authenticity, provenance, and condition. This would enable buyers to get a broader perspective not limited to centralized firms. Experts can also hold each other to account to safeguard against erroneous claims. Through this distributed framework of crowdsourcing expertise, trust becomes a feature powered by community, not simply a risk to be mitigated.</p><p>To further secure this peer-produced, multiplayer approach, all expert certification is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Even if they are not employed by one of the main firms (and wouldn’t this be great for former curators to leverage their experience?), the fact that these experts are willing to put skin in the game and put their own money behind their assessments will not be overlooked by serious curators and collectors.</p><p>The Trust Communities model can aggregate individual expertise with institutional expertise over time, allowing an unprecedented level of trust in the trade of these objects and an ongoing revenue stream for curators, caretakers, and other professionals in the&nbsp;field.</p> NFTs: Bringing Liquidity to Static Inventories <p>In many cases, most of a gallery’s assets are not on display for the public but rather secured in vaults on location or somewhere else entirely. In this state, these objects cannot generate any value. They remain illiquid, static&nbsp;stock.</p><p>Enter Physical Asset&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>A Physical Asset NFT is a unique digital token that denotes the right to take physical delivery of an object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an actual object, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability.</p><p>Turning the NFT into an actual warranty claim within the Asset Passport allows it to denote true ownership of an underlying good in a systemic way rather than what would amount to a mere promise by a stranger on the Internet. The token contract becomes a fundamental part of the deal, with execution of the agreement now deferred to the smart contract. Also, in the case of systemic fallout (software exploits on the protocol or application level) the legal agreement within the passport provides a source of truth for all parties and arbitrators to refer&nbsp;to.</p><p>NFTs connected to an Asset Passport allow any vaulted object to become a liquid, globally-tradable asset. Like the aforementioned <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">artifact collection</a> now live on&nbsp;OpenSea:</p>Live on the OpenSea Marketplace<p>The ease through which these NFTs can be traded allows for truly liquid ownership of otherwise static stock, opening access to cultural capital and providing museums and galleries with a compelling new business&nbsp;model.</p> From Zero History to Storied&nbsp;Value <p>It is our hope that by taking these objects through the full Mattereum Protocol — from assigning an Asset Passport, to vaulting in a secure art storage facility, to generating an NFT to be sold online — dealers and galleries will see how this new technology can benefit their own work and adopt it is an industry standard for the global inventory management of cultural artifacts</p><p>With blockchain-based cryptographic authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, the Mattereum Protocol can resolve the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued the fine art and antiquities markets for generations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/from-zero-history-to-storied-value-securing-and-unlocking-the-art-and-antiquities-markets-with-355e1c3c318">From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Building Civic Tech: A new frontier of our&nbsp;work <p>This is the fourth in a series of DM notes that we write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #4 is a reflection on a new frontier of our work: civic technology development, or how to make things in a complex&nbsp;world.</p> DM’s trajectory: becoming practical strategists and experimental developers <p>When Dark Matter Labs started in 2016, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">our provocation page</a> presenting various visions around the future of civic infrastructures was the core of what we did, which made many people believe we were essentially a think tank. We are not not that, but we are a lot more too, especially as we grew and started crafting these civic infrastructures that we had first only imagined with various partners around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Today, Dark Matter Labs is building a sort of ship, whose form and parts are being imagined, designed and assembled around the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Sometimes, we start by making the systems we work with visible in order to analyse the pain points, underlying drivers and strategic risks of each domain. We build portfolios of experiments to show all the various interconnected ways we could intervene in that system. Out of all of them, we identify the experimental probes to which we can best contribute and work from these starting points to develop and iterate the best initiatives for the targeted domain as well as learn from the system we intervene in.</p><p>Most of our work fall into shared civic infrastructure missions (nature based solutions, spatial justice, mental wealth, etc.) around which we organize internally, in order to maximize our shared value internationally. And beyond each initiative and mission are the shared deep code innovations that we are designing across finance, contracting, data, policy, governance and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This is the dark matter our name refers to; the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the environment around&nbsp;us.</p><p>At that point of the process, our focus shifts from system overview to minimal viable products (MVP), which requires a totally different mindset, posture and process, to rediscover how systems work by now acting within them. This last part is a new frontier for us. It raises questions internally such&nbsp;as:</p>  How do we go from from system change mapping to&nbsp;MVP?  How does this fit within and change our current practices?  What is our added value in this sphere globally?  What are the challenges with the rest of our work (different business model, ways of working,&nbsp;etc.)?   Civic technology development at&nbsp;DML <p>During our DM download on civic technology development, we discussed the need to build the right thing, as well as building the thing right. That is to say: making sure we are setting up partnerships, projects and explorations as places to answer key, difficult questions (as opposed to making a thing our research and modelling tell us we need to make). We talked about how this currently requires an organisational transition as opposed to purely looking at how to set up teams to build digital products. It is a mindset shift that we‘ll have to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>The complex future states, theories and potential answers that we have been communicating to you in blogs and reports are just a starting point for us. We use these starting points to explore, test and iteratively build products/systems, based on the insights we gather as we go. And we’re not precious about whether our original theory was right as long as we achieve the outcome we desire. We look for commonalities that make our products/systems scalable and transferrable.</p><p>You’ve been reading about our theories and provocations in blogs. More and more, you’ll be able to see how we experiment with them and reshape them until they become actual things that you can see in the world around&nbsp;you.</p> What we are learning from some of the civic technologies in the&nbsp;making <p>Proof of concept or proof of possibility, prototype, experimental probe, pilot, MVP — what’s in a name? We are still exploring which methods of testing and developing are best suited for the kind of work we want to accomplish, and so these terms are being used here loosely for the moment. While we clarify our own glossary of terms. Y<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/proof-of-concept-prototype-pilot-mvp-whats-in-a-name/">ou can find how Nesta defines them&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Futurefit — Proof of&nbsp;concept <p>This body of work looks at how we can encourage more collective forms of retrofit and energy efficiency measures, as a vehicle for Covid recovery and a more just, democratic climate transition</p><p>One of the key challenges of retrofit is a distinct lack of open and available building data — both in terms of basic information and in its energy performance. Here our ambition was to make an early proof of concept for an open retrofit data map, combining and cleaning existing public datasets, to show potential places for focus in a retrofit&nbsp;scheme.</p><p>Rather than viewing this as a top-down analytical tool, the aim was to give citizens more information about their buildings, and create a first step in encouraging the self-selection of groups of residents to upgrade their homes. Alongside this process we outlined a new collective service model for a multi-family apartment block to be able to retrofit their homes, reimagining the role of the administration de condominio could play in facilitating this&nbsp;process.</p><p>We’re currently working on the potential next steps of this tool with the Comune di&nbsp;Milano.</p> Nouveaux voisins — Prototype +&nbsp;Pilot <p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p><p>We worked with <a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> to develop the prototype of a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. Many of the functions were inspired by their pilot projects on the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Doing completely analog pilot projects, no matter how small, can help inform the sort of civic infrastructure required to support a broader movement and scaling model for the initiative (see example below from Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins)  No matter how detailed your complex paper prototype is, moving it toward a minimum viable product requires to take a step back and test many assumptions in order to move from what felt like a complex integrated platform to what seems like a very basic one. And that’s&nbsp;ok.   Amsterdam CE — Experimental probe + pilot (in progress) <p>Understanding and unfolding existing legal structure of Dutch law and visualizing the articles and different connections to make them more transparent and easier to understand. With goal to make it easier for lawmakers to make the needed change and transition towards a just circular economy in effective time.</p><p>One of the aims of this initiative is to make laws and their articles to be machine readable and indexable, so it can be easier for lawmakers to see connections and people associated with each law. We are also exploring the needed culture and way of working to use and maintain the tool and its&nbsp;data.</p><p>Learning about the system by trying to change it through an experimental probe of what could be is the stage we are at&nbsp;here.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Laws are tend to be complex and nuanced, it is difficult to label and index to a particular category. We have a created a decision tree to add the needed structure and using degrees and threshold measures to encode the minute&nbsp;details  A regulatory dashboard is only one tool towards a broader cultural shift in how the administration functions, it cannot stand&nbsp;alone  This is not the kind of project that can be done all at once; it requires a team to develop it iteratively to maintain&nbsp;it   TreesAI — MVP (in progress) <p><a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">Trees as Infrastructure</a> establishes nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure, alongside bridges, roads and rail, enabling investment, profitability and sustainability.</p><p>Currently trees and urban nature are just seen as maintenance costs in city budget sheets. We are trying to establish urban nature’s true value in terms of all the benefits they bring and their associated financial value so they can be maintained systematically.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  We better understand which data parameters are needed to give accurate calculations of tree benefits, and cities have completely different data landscape.  There is big need for data informed decision making when it comes to nature based solutions  Cities lack the budget and capacity to create and maintain the needed digital civic infrastructure required  There is an abundance of existing open source tools, however the challenge is how to integrate them best to our needs and for the long term without reinventing the&nbsp;wheel  Open source project does not mean that you just plug and play with it for your needs; it requires significant work and skill capacity in order to adapt it to the intended&nbsp;use   Moving Forward — Key Questions <p>As DM moves into the development of key civic technologies such as the ones presented above, it will require not only that we organize differently internally, but that we also work collaboratively internationally around some of the key following questions:</p>  Because they will need to exist outside the specific domain of market and state, how do you preserve the public good independently of where the capital comes from? How do we subordinate capital to the governance for public&nbsp;good?  Public investments for this work are typically focused on what exactly is needed to do be accomplished. However, many of the challenges we face are too complex to know how to address them at the outset. How do we invent investment mechanisms for the discovery of the public good as we&nbsp;go?  We need very clear do no harm principles of how these civic technologies are developed, used, what frameworks they create and what the implications are. How do we do&nbsp;that?  It has been shown how many AI technologies replicate the biases from the data it was based out of. If we want more power in the hands of communities, how do we create UX and transparency to avoid creating unconscious biases in the behavioural economics it&nbsp;creates?  Maintenance of civic tech when it doesn’t have the security of the state of large private investment is a big challenge. How do we create open and transparent maintenance friendly tech without increasing rent seeking infrastructures for private&nbsp;capital?  How do we insure the sustainability and longevity of these services outside traditional institutional models of&nbsp;support?  How can we be open and declarative assumptions &amp; references so as to create the hypothesis that the decision making can be interrogated and challenged and create accountability for stakeholders?  How do we construct new frameworks of accountability to all stakeholders, both future and&nbsp;present.  How do we build civic tech with open unitary modular blocks of value, adopting a modular design principle in which we subdivide a future system into smaller parts, which can and should be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with other modules or between different systems.

<p>Lack of great user experiences is often raised as one of decentralized identity’s (and public blockchain’s) missing ingredients for ubiquitous adoption. However to arrive at usable experiences across the industry, we first need to reach consensus around basic user personas and mental models, then design and build interoperable system accordingly.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-internets-missing-identity-layer-3934b23b6c22">the internet’s missing identity layer</a>” we took a stab at an acceptable set of personas and solution criteria for this self-described identity&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we also observed how users already interact with identity-related concepts in their day-to-day economic activities, and the artifacts they use as tools to accomplish them.</p><p>This article explores the different aspects of how a typical user understands concepts related to identity through the use of economic, cognitive, and design lenses, as well as through historical observation, and application of first principles.</p> Summary <p>No typical human explicitly understands abstract terms like “identity”. People may intuitively understand such concepts without the ability to articulate what they are, while there certainly are other terms they can explicitly understand.</p><p>We start by defining a few abstract terms such as digital identity, identity systems, social contexts, etc., then move on to explicit ones. As a result of exploring a typical user’s mental models, as well as historical patterns of human economic activities, we identify more innate and explicitly understood concepts such as self-identities, perceived identities, connections, accounts, conversations, messages, etc.</p><p>We then explore how multiple identities play a part in a user’s cognitive understanding of their place within multiple social contexts. We extend this exploration with anonymous and pseudonymous identities for private and task-based contexts.</p><p>Then we explore how identity-related tools and artifacts have historically been used and understood by people. This includes the ways people use artifacts that function as a combination of IDs, credentials, and/or keys. This also includes how people use complementary organization and storage tools for managing large numbers of these artifacts.</p><p>Building systems and applications that operate based on concepts paralleling a typical user’s mental models, will inherently result in better user experiences, as well as a more intuitive understanding of these systems’ underlying processes.</p> Definitions <p>As explained in “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/what-identity-means-e998291668f9">What identity means</a>”, the word “identity” is overloaded on many levels. Few regular users understand abstract words like identity, authentication, credentials, or authorization. So here, let’s reiterate the basic terms and concepts that will be reused throughout this article to discuss users’ consciously or subconsciously understood concepts.</p><p>Identity systems — The identity industry is built upon the development, maintaining and usage of identity systems; Systems which ultimately help us be more efficient and secure our daily transactions and mitigate undesired outcomes such as&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Identity instances — Any virtual representation of persons or organizations in any system, be they digital, paper-based, or&nbsp;mental.</p><p>Cognitive realm — The sometimes oversimplified approach of looking at our cognition as systems and processes, can result in valuable insights. As such the cognitive realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto our mental information space.</p><p>Digital realm — As a subject of interest and source of great societal impact, digital systems are of growing importance in our lives, highlighted by the prominence of terms such as internet, web and so called “cyberspace”. The digital realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto digital systems in the form of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Digital identities — a sub-type of identity instance — within the context of digital identity systems, these are specific instances of an an entity’s representation, a digital twin so to speak. In other words, digital identities, are records of a person or organization within digital systems that are uniquely secured for common low level operations such as lookup, authentication, recovery, sharing,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Social context —aka Social circle — Is both a mental and sociological context that is defined within a well-known social circle. For example, close friends and professional social circles are two completely different contexts with different rules. Accordingly, we mentally identify as separate (yet related) beings depending on this&nbsp;context.</p><p>Self-identity —aka Self — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies the “self” within a given social context. As such, our overall self, is made up of a collection of context-based self-identities which differ significantly. For example the “self” of personal relationships is very different from that of professional social&nbsp;circles.</p><p>Perceived-identity —aka Identity — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies other people or organizations, again within the context of a given social context. Instances of this type of identity are generally represented in external digital or paper-based identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Identity information (fragment) — Additional information associated with an identity that further describes a person, organization or thing, and possibly helps identify it through language, visual or other sensory&nbsp;input.</p>Identity in the cognitive domain<p>In order to design intuitive identity systems for consumers, we necessarily have to align the concepts (and taxonomies) we use to that of our natural mental&nbsp;models.</p> Economic activities and mental&nbsp;models <p>As subjects of life evolution, we are inherently economic individuals and societies, sustained through value surplus. As such our mental models have evolved with significant influence from the economic activities that help sustain us and our societies. Using this view we should look at human mental models of specific types of activities, artifacts, tools as well as mental contexts that are closely related to our use of identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>It can be argued that our minds come equipped with a cognitive identity system, one that intuitively interoperates with the real world, and is sometimes aided by external identity systems, including digital or paper-based ones, together ultimately forming a hybrid&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we touched on the frequent and high-value activities that help us support transactions, and create economic&nbsp;value.</p>Transaction support activities<p>These activities point to five distinct mental contexts involved, namely:</p>  Information (or data) — Is the generalized form of information about the real world, and how we organize and make sense of it. This mental context has to do with mentally gathering, organizing and accessing information.  Identity (self) —Is the context of identifying ourselves to others, within various and specific social contexts. Sometimes this includes self-promotion to enhance others’ perception of us by including trust information such as credentials. This mental context specializes in helping others identify us.<br>Perceived identities and verification are included under connections.  Money (or valuables) — Is the mental monetary understanding of valuables natural to our evaluation of property, transactions and surplus. The mental functions are closely related to identities and connections.  Connections (aka contacts and relationships) — Are the mental social understanding around the state of belonging to specific groups or relationships. It specializes in this understanding and the protocols of mutual expectations that go with building relationships. <br>- Perceived Identities (and verification) — Is the mental context of identifying others (as perceived identities) and verifying them using objective and subjective trust information.<br>There is a clear overlap between the contexts of perceived identities and connections. For simplicity, here we include perceived identities as a sub-context of connections.  Messages (or conversations) — Represent our mental specialization in communication through spoken language, written language or any other media. This context has to do with the mechanics of conversations, specifically in terms of message fragments and&nbsp;replies.  Transaction support activities and mental&nbsp;contexts<p>The above root level concepts are generally and explicitly well understood by typical users. In addition, the following extended list of core concepts are expected to be explicitly understood by typical users, as they seem to represent innate cognitive constructs:</p>  Information (fragment) — Given the composability of information, humans intuitively understand and handle fragments of information for the purposes of mental storing, organizing and retrieving. While a typical user may be unable to articulate what an information fragment is, they can intuitively navigate information systems such as libraries, books, newspapers, and the web.<br>The world wide web is a special case, which has achieved functionality such as digitally publishing, addressing, organizing and consuming public information, through (relatively intuitive) interaction with human&nbsp;minds.  Social circle (or context) —As detailed in our definitions, as humans we are intuitively and explicitly aware of social circles (or contexts) we are a part of. These contexts vary across different groups, common goals and interests, as well as particular relationships with individuals.  Self-identity —Depending on a given social context, we take on dynamic roles which manifests in separate but related self-identities. Simple examples are our roles and identities as parents, siblings, citizens, team members,&nbsp;etc.  Self-identity information (fragment)—For each given social context and self-identity there may be unique fragments of information that we associate with ourselves and potentially present to others. For example we may take on a special nickname for designated social contexts such amongst close friends, or amongst our extended&nbsp;family.  (Perceived) Identity — High level information about another person (or organization’s) is mentally stored for the purposes of identifying that person in future interactions. This is different than that person’s self- identity which belongs to them, however it is deeply affected by how that person presents themselves, and asks to be remembered. Humans may not explicitly know they are dealing with a perceived identity but they can intuitively navigate it, even with help of external tools such as directories and address books&nbsp;etc.  (Perceived) Identity information (fragment) —Each given perceived identity is mentally associated with possibly unique fragments of information. For example we may remember a friend’s phone number, as well as a secret handshake between&nbsp;us.  Connection (or contacts and relationships) —Perceived identities can be mentally stored even without an actual connection or relationship existing. However, existence of connections suggest some state of trust or long term understanding between two parties, or an individual and a group. As such, connections often require varying levels of maintenance.  Account (or perceived connection) —When dealing with businesses that keep track of customers, we often perform the equivalent of opening up an account with them. An account is essentially the other party’s record or mental store of their connection with us. The goal is often for that business and us to help maintain the state of that account in good standing.  Conversation —As part of connections with others we may partake in long-term and short term conversations with them. We may mentally store and recall the state of these conversations, or use external tools such as letters or electronic mail or instant messages to keep track of&nbsp;them.  Message —Messages are the atomic sub-component of conversations, that can be mentally tracked individually. As humans we can intuitively recall specific messages including their contexts, as well as enhance productivity through navigating external tools such as instant messaging or electronic mail.  <p>As a result of the users’ explicit understanding of the above concepts, they are expected intuitively deal with them as digitally represented artifacts.</p> Multi-identity <p>As mentioned in the previous sections, a person’s self-identity is not one static thing, it morphs depending on the context of the social circle or context it is embedded in. Each of these multiple identities take on a well-defined role within their target social context, and may be associated with separate identity information fragments.</p>Cognitive multi-identity<p>A list of some well known social contexts include but are not limited&nbsp;to:</p>  Core — This is what a person means to themselves. It represent ones true relationship to themselves and the core of one’s identity.  Public (social) — This is the most public aspect of our self-identities there for all to see. This context has not commonly existed for everybody before the advent of internet and social networks. An example of the digital representation of our identity in this context is our facebook public&nbsp;profile.  Social (within a given circle) — A context meant mainly for general socializing and forming medium-strength social connections within a social group sometimes bound by factors such as class, geography, beliefs,&nbsp;etc.  Professional — The context represented by professionals working within a given group under the same company, organization, career path, specialization, etc. LinkedIn is the example of a typical online professional social&nbsp;network.  Intellectual — A social arena where people pursue intellectual betterment through learning or thought leadership in order to share. Specific fields of academia fit this context. Also twitter can be typically identified as a leading intellect-based online social&nbsp;network.  Sports — A social community where people may share and consume sports news, reactions and trivia as well as participate in actual sport competitions. The sports team a person plays for, or the sport tournament bracket at the office are examples of such contexts.  Romance (and/or sexuality)— Social networks or mutual relationships based on romance or possibility of finding it. Dating networks or events, as well as people’s romantic relationships are examples of such contexts.  Family (core and/or extended)— Social groups based on family relations, be they small and intimate or larger and more extended. That is, a person’s immediate family including partner and children, or extended family such as grandparents and cousins are examples of such contexts.  Friends (core and/or extended) — A group of mutual friends, a pair of best friends, or the larger circle of old-time friends can make up the friends social&nbsp;context.  Acquaintances — The larger circle of temporary or relatively weak social relationship that we maintain in case they become advantageous at a later time. Networking activities and events are one of the way people participate in this circle and gain new acquaintances.  Retail (or other consumption)— The relationships we have with brands and companies we transact with to purchase goods, products and services. These relationship contexts are often isolated and transactional, although they may be persistent across sessions of interaction.  Citizenship (local, state and/or national)— The social context of belonging, and feeling allegiance to a given locality, state or nation. This often comes with a sense of community and loyalty to the larger&nbsp;entity.  Common interest (or hobby)— A social group brought together by common interests such as a hobby, technology, activity or topic. Such social contexts often benefit from a sense of community.  <p>There are certain task-based relationships where one’s self-identity is not consequential. Often such tasks can be completed using a completely or partially anonymous identity, at other times they can be accomplished using a pseudonymous identity that is correlated across sessions yet unidentified (and uncorrelated to one’s other identities).</p>  Anonymous — A completely unidentified and un-correlate-able one-time-use identity. This type of identity offers maximum privacy benefits.  Pseudonymous — An unidentified persona that is correlate-able by other parties across sessions. It is used when anonymity is desired but some state across sessions is required for interactions to work properly.  Incognito — aka partially anonymous — Is a mostly anonymous identity with some correlate-able or identifiable information, in cases complete anonymity cannot be achieved due to technical or environmental limitations.  <p>For example buying a pack of cigarettes from a convenience store using cash can be done mostly anonymously, however creating content in social media under a well-known private persona with long-term reputation can only be done pseudonymously. Browsing the internet can be performed incognito, that is mostly anonymously, but with minimal information leakage such as with one’s IP&nbsp;address.</p> Identity as a&nbsp;tool <p>Often the way identity concept manifest themselves in the external physical or virtual worlds has to do with how we use “identity” as a tool for accomplishing everyday&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">The economics of identity systems</a>” we take an in depth look at how we historically use identity-related artifacts and tools, and reveal the insight that humans have been using different identity-related tools to accomplish essentially the same set of activity verbs despite having gone through various waves of technologies.</p><p>Artifacts we tend to use under the name ID, identification card, or identity, across different technology waves have historically performed a combination (one, some or all ) of the following functions:</p>  Identification artifact —aka ID (or identification document)— Act as a medium for the user to communicate identifying information such as name, address, etc to another party in order to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.  Credential — Is used to present a claim and/or to promote the user’s perceived level of trustworthiness to a transaction participant, by demonstrating verification by a trusted third&nbsp;party.  Key — Is used to securely interact with a system and access its functions, while the system prevents unauthorized parties from unauthorized access. This is typically done by authenticating the key artifact used, and trusting that the holder was originally granted that same key, or is authorized by the grantee to use&nbsp;it.  ID functions mapped to tools and&nbsp;verbs<p>When dealing with a large number of these artifacts and tools, we often resort to using additional tools meant for organization and access. These specialized tools seem to naturally fit how we mentally organize and access related concepts. For example for physical tools like hammers and wrenches, we use complementary tools such as tool-belts and toolboxes to either temporarily store and immediately access them, or store them for longer term safe-keeping and&nbsp;access.</p><p>Similarly, for artifacts such as IDs (identification document), cards, keys, payment cards, or contact cards we utilize similar storage and organization tools such as wallets, keychains, and rolodexes.</p>Tool, tool-belt, toolbox analogy for identity system artifacts Conclusion <p>Our ultimate goal of understanding the mental models of typical users is building intuitive identity systems and applications. They need to operate based on parallel concepts to the mental models described above in order to achieve better user experiences and intuitive interactions.</p><p>This article expands this understanding first by taking a stab at identifying concepts that are likely to be innate to human cognitive constructs. It explores how multiple identities innately make up people’s understanding of themselves. It also touches on the common patterns of artifact and tool usage, as well as complementary storage and organization tools.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/how-humans-understand-identity-367200ae9591">How humans understand identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity">Universal Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter is no longer effective. The nature of the corporate network is changing with mobile and cloud computing.

					<p>In 2019, Trinsic launched the first verifiable credentials platform, enabling developers to easily implement digital trust into any application for the first time. Since then, our APIs have been used by more than 2,000 developers and supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through this period of growth and by working closely with our customers, we’ve learned what is needed to take our platform to the next level, and we’re thrilled to announce the largest upgrade to our platform since its launch. The next version of the Trinsic platform is 10x as accessible, 100x more performant, and 1,000x more scalable. And it is available now. Keep reading to see how you can start using it.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing Trinsic Core 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Before diving into the specifics of the platform upgrade, we need to introduce a new term. Up to this point, we have referred to Trinsic’s APIs for verifiable credential exchange as simply the Trinsic platform. Moving forward, we will refer to these APIs as Trinsic Core. We decided to name our API platform Core because it underpins all of our current and future products. Trinsic Core is infrastructure for digital trust in the same way that Stripe is infrastructure for payments or Twilio is infrastructure for communications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our original tech stack, Trinsic Core v1, is what our customers use today and as mentioned above, supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world. Core v1 uses JSON credentials, CL signatures native to the Hyperledger Indy SDK, Hyperledger Aries exchange protocols, and DIDComm v1.¹</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, as the size and complexity of our customers’ use cases grew, there were scaling and performance requirements that the original open source codebases for verifiable credential exchange listed above were not able to meet. And that is why we have built Trinsic Core v2—the largest upgrade to our digital trust infrastructure to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, we will continue to support Trinsic Core v1 which is generally available now by signing up for a free <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> account. With that said, we invite all current and new customers to try out Trinsic Core v2 and experience the future of digital trust infrastructure.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What's new with Trinsic Core v2 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Trinsic Core v2 meets the scaling, interoperability, and performance enhancements our customers, and the world at large, need to deploy verifiable credentials in production. It uses the latest standards that are emerging as the de facto, next-generation standards for verifiable credential exchange. These include JSON-LD credentials, BBS+ signatures, and decentralized identifiers. To learn a little more about each of these specifications, click on the drop-down below.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>JSON-LD credentials</a>
					 
					 <p>We follow the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#json-ld">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, so there’s no vendor lock-in when using the Trinsic. We use an encoding format called JSON Linked Data so that the data within a credential can be described using self-contained URIs.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>BBS+ signatures</a>
					 
					 <p>The BBS+ Signature Suite provides the capability to perform zero-knowledge proof disclosures on datasets. When used in tandem with a verifiable credential, these signatures empower individuals to prove things about themselves with minimal data disclosure.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Decentralized identifiers</a>
					 
					 <p>Taken from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, a decentralized identifier is “a portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef”.</p> 
				 
								 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					The chart above lists out the open source specifications that make up Trinsic Core. The specifications that are included in Trinsic Core v1 is in the "Current, in production" column. You can use Trinsic Core v1 today by signing up for a free Trinsic Studio account at studio.trinsic.id. Trinsic Core v2 is in the highlighted yellow area. Our beta release of Trinsic Core v2 (the second column) is available for customers to start using now.

					<p>For verifiable credentials to achieve adoption at scale, they need to be easy to implement for developers and easy to adopt for end users. As we move forward with Trinsic Core v2, we are getting closer to making the user experience of sharing verifiable credentials as seamless as using Apple Pay. Trinsic Core v2 has the following advantages that will help make this a reality:<br><br></p>  Scalability: Trinsic Core v2 can support tens of millions of people using their credentials several times per day.  Performance: Trinsic Core v2 enables near-instant verifications (&lt;200 milliseconds).  Accessibility: Trinsic Core v2 makes it so that digital wallets are available across devices, browsers, and platforms. People will be able to access their credentials from any device, and developers no longer have to write an entirely new framework from scratch to integrate digital wallet capabilities using their preferred language.  Built for Ecosystems: Trinsic Core v2 was developed from the beginning to integrate with <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>, the only product developed specifically for providers of digital trust ecosystems.  Unopinionated technology: While our initial beta release supports the latest standards such as JSON-LD verifiable credential data model, BBS+ signatures, and DIDComm v2 messaging formats, Trinsic Core v2 is architected from the beginning to be agnostic to ledger, transport, payload, signature scheme, etc. That means over time, Trinsic Core will easily allow developers to tailor their preferred technical standards to their ecosystems.

         Tokeny Has Solved the Problem of Gas Fees  8 July 2021             
	 
		 
			<p>For a long time, gas fees have been a huge issue for public blockchain users; especially within the Ethereum mainnet in the past 12 months. While crypto users complain about the high and unstable gas fees preventing them access to DeFi, financial institutions are struggling to quantify their future costs and how they will add crypto tokens to their balance sheet if they enter the public blockchain space.</p>
 What are gas fees? 
<p>First, let’s walk you through some basic knowledge of gas fees. Gas fees are the cost of transactions on the blockchain. More precisely, they are the fees you pay as a blockchain user to reward the individuals and companies securing the network.</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum uses a consensus protocol called Proof-of-Work (PoW). It is an algorithm that sets mathematical computations for miners to solve. Once those puzzles are solved by miners, new transactions will be encoded into a block and added to the blockchain. When a miner finds the correct answer, they can produce a block and receive gas fees as a reward. Miners are the individuals and companies that participate in this process with powerful computers. Furthermore, their computers often conduct the ‘trial and error’ method to find the solutions. It requires strong computation power that runs day and night, all around the world.</p>
 Gas fees are unpredictable and complex 
<p>As each block space is finite, miners will obviously pick the highest gas fee bid transactions to prioritize. Therefore, you will need to overbid on gas fees to get the transactions validated quickly. Your transaction is therefore in competition with others, and also depends on the value of the crypto token you must use to pay (e.g. ETH on Ethereum). Paying for the infrastructure only when you use it is great, but not being able to predict how much you will have to pay is obviously an issue. It is difficult to define operational costs and how to recharge them to clients. Basically, it requires a whole process for institutions to buy crypto at a reasonable price, store them in secure wallets, and, at the same time, make them available for their employees when they perform actions on security tokens. On the other hand, some institutions are not even allowed to buy and keep crypto due to regulation or their own risk policies, or accounting difficulties.</p>
 Tokeny made gas fees disappear 
<p>For a long time, we’ve been looking for solutions to solve the gas fee issues. Because we believe that public blockchains are valuable as ecosystems, we didn’t want to start issuing security tokens on private or nascent blockchains. Obviously, our customers were not alone in facing these gas fees issues, millions of users and developers needed to fix this as well. That’s mostly why amazing new solutions came up recently in the market, such as sidechains, layer 2 solutions and other technical improvements, leveraging the decentralization of Ethereum but validating transactions differently, mostly with Proof-of-Stake mechanisms.</p>
<p>After long research, tests and discussions with people involved in the industry, we decided to make our EVM compatible platform evolved in order to issue, manage and transfer security tokens on the Polygon network. In April, we <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-solutions-and-polygon-enter-a-partnership-to-improve-accessibility-of-security-tokens/">partnered with Polygon</a>, a layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-​compatible blockchain networks. With Polygon, the gas fee has been reduced by over 10,000 times. It now costs less than $0.01 per transaction.</p>
<p>While the cost of transactions is no longer the issue as the gas fees become so low, the complexity of the process remains. Users still need to go to cryptocurrency exchanges to buy MATIC – the crypto token used to pay the gas fees on Polygon. The problem with this process becomes more complicated for financial institutions, as some don’t even know how or where their balance sheets will include these crypto-costs going forward.</p>
<p>It was therefore clear to us that the key to getting traditional players and investors to embrace tokenized securities is to provide them with a better user experience by making the gas fee process disappear. To achieve this goal, we have developed a solution called the “Polygon Gas Tank”. Basically, the system monitors the balance of MATIC tokens in issuer’, agents’ and investors’ wallets. When it falls below the balance threshold, the Polygon Gas Tank will top up the wallet with more MATIC tokens automatically, and for free. As a result, our users always have enough MATIC tokens to cover their gas fees. In other words, we’ve got this covered, users don’t need to pay any blockchain transaction fees anymore.</p>

		 
	 
          
	 
		 
			<p>With the Polygon Gas Tank, performing operations and transferring security tokens becomes easier, faster, and free. By making the complexity of blockchain disappear for all stakeholders, true financial inclusion and mainstream adoption of tokenization is on the horizon.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/resch">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>
Patrick Parker, innovation-driven entrepreneur as well as founder and CEO at Identity Management and Cloud Security firm EmpowerID, will deliver a keynote presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4605" title="Patrick Parker Keynote">Complexity Has Reached a Tipping Point in IT – What Can We Do About It?</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Patrick some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do you think that complexity has reached a tipping point in IT?</p>
<p>
From our experience, large customers typically have 3,000 to 5,000 different applications that the IT staff have to manage, provision, control access. And end-users in these organizations interact with hundreds of these applications. So really the IT staff being able to be properly trained and understand the security models and how to grant and manage security in these thousands of applications has become overwhelming. Most of these organizations have outsourced this role to staff in other countries, that have a high turnover rate. So it's always a new employee and the new employees coming in and they're managing access requests for hundreds of systems, for which they're not trained. For each of these systems, they have to have native permissions, which is a huge risk as they are going into these systems as a superuser.&nbsp; They're not very well-trained. They may not be in this job for very long, and they have to make sense of these access requests to try to grant the user permission in these systems. It has really become an impossible task. The turnaround time has become extremely slow. The frustration for end-users and often at errors on the side of just over permissioning and giving the users too much access to try to just close the ticket.</p>
<p>It also makes it extremely difficult for managers, because managers are business users. They know what the users should be able to do as part of their job, but translating that into the technical entitlements that they are prevented from these systems and enabling them to make a decision is often just a guessing game. The technical entitlements have no real relation or meaning as to how they, what they grant the user, the ability to do on a day-to-day basis and what would be the risk of that, and whether it's appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the same thing goes for auditors. They are investigating to see our people within our risk policies. Do they just have the access they need? What have they been doing? Again, looking at low-level technical audit logs of transactions, looking at these technical entitlements – there is too much data for it to be humanly possible for them to accurately assess risk compliance and to keep this all in check. It is just becoming overwhelming and it's only growing more complex as we move to the cloud. As digital transformation causes an outsourcing of best of breed for each area of the enterprise to different applications, this is an ever-expanding universe of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the risks of complexity in our IT Infrastructure?</p>
<p>
One of the major risks of the over ever-growing complexity within our IT organizations is over permissioning. This has become dramatically worse as we've moved to the cloud. Cloud platforms have extremely elaborate and idiosyncratic security models, which are specific to each of the platforms. Google GCP has a different model than AWS than Azure and the various systems like SAP. Each one has an ever-expanding set of services they offer. So the typical cloud administrator for these platforms only actually utilizes less than 1% of the permissions, which they hold at all times. This creates a very large population of super users, which are always on, always armed, and open to attack. So this large amount of standing privileges is a huge security risk for organizations who are hackers have access to these publicly available systems, where if they compromise any of these accounts, they have God-like permissions and could do very destructive actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, another major risk is just end-user frustration, what might lead to something called the great IT slowdown where end-users and managers are overwhelmed by the complexity of dealing with IT systems. They really want to do the business work in their job, but the percentage of their time that they spend interacting with IT, making requests, dealing with permissions, recertifying access is only increasing. So the end-user frustration will lead to rubber stamping, which will avoid and bypass all of our organization's compliance and security policies. And at some point, the complexity will just reach a limit to where it's really impossible for certain roles to understand as many systems as they're being required to manage, which will lead to breakdowns, human error and vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you solve the challenges imposed by an IT infrastructure that has become too complex?</p>
<p>
I think the one thing we can assume is that the IT infrastructure is only going to increasingly grow complex and to continue its velocity or its path. So the solution to that is really the solution that's been used in many other industries over time. Developers no longer deal with machine-level code. They have abstracted it out so that they're dealing with higher-level objects, functions, the low code movement, allowing users who are less technical to automate processes without actually writing code. If we borrow a term used in business intelligence and data analytics - what we really need is a semantic layer. In business intelligence, a semantic layer is the mapping for your complex data in different heterogeneous systems into a single set of easily understandable business concepts for users. So it really transforms data into meaning and insight. The same thing could be applied here for IT and identity and access management specifically. The complex permissions and actions and activities that users perform in all these various systems, whether they're cloud or on-premise, we really need a mapping layer, a semantic layer so that the business users, the help desk users, the operational staff, and the auditors can deal with a single set of recognizable terminologies so that you can see what a user wants to do and who has access on understandable terms.</p>
<p>As an example, creating a purchase order in various systems, Microsoft Dynamics, SAP, and others, &nbsp;would be delivered by technical entitlements, granting complex and cryptic low-level transactions. If we are dealing at that level, the auditors and the users will have to understand the low-level complexity. But if we're dealing with a semantic layer, then you'll be able to see, I want to create a purchase order, and that's all you interact with. Or if I'm at help desk, I can see in grant the ability to create a purchase order. And then the IAM system is what translates that last-mile delivery of the technical entitlement. So we're dealing with business terms that are readily understandable, that we can categorize the risk that we can recertify. Everything makes sense. And the actual technical mapping of these semantics of these terminology down to the system-specific is hidden from us because we shouldn't have to learn that because it is not really a value add for our job.</p>
<p>Now, this is also a good from a zero-trust perspective because you're pulling users out of having direct interaction with those systems and native permissions and granting them access to a single interface, which hides that complexity. So it reduces the training time. It drastically reduces the amount of information and knowledge that a user has to have to perform their day-to-day duties, which reduces the cost to an organization. It helps on turnover and re-education, and it lowers risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The semantic layer you describe – Is that the Place where AI will come into play?</p>
<p>
Yes. So, so that's another point I had on here. So in AI, there is something called intention analysis and intention mappings, where for a user to be able to talk to AI, it has to be able to say human recognizable terms like “I would like this”. Or if the AI is analyzing activities, it can prevent the low-level information it has to bubble up into something that means something to the user. So it's the same type of mapping that happens on the AI to produce intelligible results and for AI assistance, to understand that human recognizable terms and translate that into the action that it needs to perform.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You propose a semantic layer to simplify IT.&nbsp; Would this model support multi-cloud or hybrid environments?</p>
<p>
Yes, actually, since it is a layer that's outside of anyone's system, it's really what is even more needed for multi-cloud. So if you have a multi-cloud environment, you have Google GCP, which has a very different security model, &nbsp;very complex, that takes someone a long time to learn, which is very different than AWS that has a Jason policy-based model, which is even very different from Azure's role-based and scope based model that the users that are on the front line requesting access, delivering access, fulfilling access, auditing access. They shouldn't have to be an expert in every system. So this layer for a multi-cloud is really even more important to bubble it up into intelligible, understandable results, and also to hide the complexity so that users are doing these tasks in the native interfaces, where they would require extensive training and have native direct unproxied permissions. You're giving them a zero-trust interface where they can perform their activities without having native access and with having a monitoring layer in the middle, which makes it easier for them. But it also adds security for the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Have you already been working on such a layer?</p>
<p>Yes. We've been working on it for about a year and a half now, so we have the mapping layer. One of the key trends is that organizations are trying to get down to activity-based access. So monitoring activities, understanding who's actually using privileges, what are the activities they perform? What are the activities they could perform, where they have access to, but actually never do. That way You can have more of an autonomous access system, which is decreasing the risk profile by trimming out automatically activities that you actually don't do. It can also propose new rules based upon activities of similar cohorts. And if the activities map to technical entitlements that can propose new roles or reshaping of the access policies. So we have the layer in place to be able to have the finest fine-grain permissions, the SAPT codes, authorization object, field values, the Azure, rights and role assignments, everything at the fine grain, to be able to map that up into this semantic layer so that you can immediately look at a person and see that this user can create a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that if I look at that, I could also see if they could create it in Google or AWS, instead of these being distinct technical entitlements that have no relationship, now I can see an activity, create Kubernetes cluster and see exactly who has it across our enterprise landscape, how they're getting it and also activity usage tracking. So if they're executing transactions using those fine-grain permissions, it has meaning now that they are creating it, that meant they created a Kubernetes cluster, and here's the risk associated with that. So, yes, we have that mapping layer built into the product right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Right now it looks like platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow are taking over more and more Identity &amp; Access related processes. If this trend prevails – how would it&nbsp; influence your approach?</p>
<p>
So the rise of the platforms, as far as ServiceNow extending into identity and access management functions, Salesforce and others, these platforms are great general-purpose platforms. They're great for workflow processes, for human-to-human automation and approvals and tracking, for compliance change requests, et cetera, but where they typically fall short, what isn't within their scope, is fulfillment. So we have customers right now, like one example that is fully ServiceNow. They have access requests processes for SAP and other systems, but just to fulfill the access request for SAP, and they have 800 staff in India, which is an extremely huge expense, because ServiceNow can automate the approvals. It can go through different levels, but these systems typically don't handle fulfillment of the technical access. So once it goes to the system owners or these outsource staff, then they have to deal with the complexity of what did the user really mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because users don't know the entitlements. They don't really know what they need. They don't understand the technical aspect and they shouldn't. So this person is responsible for somehow fulfilling this request. And most of that is manual where they have super privileged access. And so the platform vendors aren't extending down to where they really automate fulfillment. Typically that's something they leave out. So you still have the risk, you still have the human factor. And I see these platform products being probably the biggest consumer of the semantic layer, because you need a system that's specialized that can understand and get the fine-grained permission. So it knows who can do which of these human activities. It can track this, but then in the platform system, that semantic layer would ease the process for them. So when users are remaking access requests in a semantic layer integrated approach, they would be able to request the things they want to do and not just service catalog items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They'd be able to tell the system what they want to do. Tell the virtual assistant or the AI, what they're trying to do. If the AI ask them, who shows them users who have the same job function, it could show them not technical entitlements, but the activities these users perform. And they can say, that's what they're trying to get access to do. And then the mapping layer would translate that after the access request was fulfilled into that last mile fulfillment, which the platform products typically do not provide and which increases complexity and costs. So I see a synergy here where they will be major consumers of this new technology.</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>KILT Protocol is designed to be a fully decentralised permissionless blockchain network. That means we are building KILT to evolve into a blockchain that is run by the community, with decisions being made transparently on chain by KILT token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>As is often the case with cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, things can change even before they manifest! <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/consensus-through-collators-kilt-as-a-nominated-proof-of-stake-network-e58c8c4cf8a2">Previously I wrote about</a> how I envisioned the KILT Protocol as a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) network. Since then, we have decided to adopt a different mechanism that better supports KILT in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>There are three major factors we considered:</p>  Since we plan to run in the Polkadot ecosystem (initially as a parachain on Kusama), security is provided by the Relay Chain on the&nbsp;network  We want to recognise the importance of the work of the collators on the KILT blockchain  We want to keep inflation low.  <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, we decided to launch KILT’s parachain on the Kusama network using Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS).</p> Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS) <p>Limited Delegated Proof of Stake (LDPoS) is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism that limits the number of delegators and the number of collators to whom they can delegate their&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In LDPoS, the network will have collators (similar to validators in the Polkadot ecosystem), as outlined in my previous blog. The network will also have delegators. Similar to nominators in the NPoS system, delegators use their KILT tokens to back collators that they trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>In this way, collators can be supported by token holders in the community while they build up their own&nbsp;stake.</p> Collators <p>Collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collecting transactions and building blocks. The blocks of data they verify are passed via the validators to the Relay Chain of the wider network (Kusama or Polkadot) to be finalised and become the state of&nbsp;truth.</p><p>Running as a collator requires some technical skill, hardware and commitment to the project. Collators will be rewarded for every block they verify. The first group of collators for KILT has been selected, and we will have around 16 active collators at launch. This number will increase in the months after mainnet launch, as the network matures. Stay tuned for more news about the members of this Initial KILT Collator Programme.</p> Delegators <p>Delegators would be KILT token holders who choose to back collators with their tokens. In the current model, a delegator will be able to choose one collator to back per account; this may be increased in the future. We’ll be announcing more details about the role of delegators in upcoming&nbsp;weeks.</p> KILT in the&nbsp;Future <p>This plan to implement LDPoS is another step in our goal to optimise the design of KILT as a decentralised blockchain, with the facility to evolve and be self-sustainable over the long term. We will present a detailed outline of the economics of this mechanism in our forthcoming document on the token economy. KILT is implementing LDPoS with the aim of maximising long-term viability, ensuring that KILT’s services will continue to contribute to privacy on the internet for decades to&nbsp;come.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-continuing-evolution-of-kilt-protocol-limited-delegated-proof-of-stake-640403427c48">The Continuing Evolution of KILT Protocol: Limited Delegated Proof of Stake</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>IDnow joins IDunion, the network initiative for digital identities funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, July 8th 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, announces its participation in the IDunion network, which aims to build an open ecosystem for decentralised identity management.</p>
<p>For the IDunion network, central aspects of implementation are security, cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness and privacy compliant use of identity data. IDnow has joined forces with other industry experts through IDunion to drive a shared vision of digital identities that is aligned with European values and regulations.</p>
<p>“We are excited to play a key role in shaping the future of digital identities in Europe with our partners at IDunion and looking forward to working together on secure and economical solutions,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology and Co-Founder of IDnow. “The introduction of a digital identity solution is an important and necessary step for Europe. After the publication of the EU decision on the EU Digital Identity Wallet, we now need to think about a unified infrastructure,” adds Armin Bauer.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, IDnow has been working closely with various regulatory authorities across Europe and supporting standardisation working groups such as the FIDO Alliance or ETSI’s Special Task Force 588 to develop new standards with its expertise.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow is working on a technology to implement digital wallets. With this technology, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. By means of fingerprint or facial recognition (touch or face ID), the data is released for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. As a certified identification service (“Registration Authority”) according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future. Within IDunion, IDnow’s goal is to make the wallet technology compatible with the standards of the IDunion network.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader in identity technology, ARIADNEXT as well as German identity Trust Management AG. This enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Europe.</p>

<p>Introduction: Blockchain Technology Exacerbate Climate&nbsp;Change?</p>Aergo Intends On Being A Net-Zero Carbon Blockchain By 2030, With A Mandate That Block Producers Must Be Net-Carbon Zero.<p>It is evident that the utilization of energy has become a focal, social and political issue that has become a topic of discussion for the last half-century and has expanded well into the 21st century. Recently, there has been massive argument surrounding the efficiency of blockchain and how/if Proof-Of-Work exacerbates an already fragile climate. Blockchain has unfortunately utilized the same amount of energy as 159 individual nations; from a global perspective, that is roughly 75% of all nations that exist on the Earth: a staggering statistic indeed.</p><p>AERGO is looking to solve this issue through its Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake consensus model. AERGO’s blockchain operability isn’t accompanied by centralized mining farms that contribute to energy inefficiencies and non-friendly environmental tactics to create blocks. AERGO utilizes a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake model that mandates block-producers become net-carbon zero and will consistently give preference the corporate entities that perpetuate this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The method of centralized mining farms to mine Bitcoin has become a prominent topic of discussion, as mining is the consequence of this blossoming technology. As the evolution of blockchain has expanded tremendously in the last five years, energy consumption conceived by competing miners and mining farms has also increased as Bitcoin reaches inconceivable prices, which has drawn entities to garner an insatiable desire to mine Bitcoin in large quantities for massive profits. Miners are unfortunately at the heart of this issue that must be resolved to combat climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>Miners: The Life's-Blood Of Blockchain Inefficient Energy&nbsp;Output</p>Is Bitcoin To Blame; Or The Method Of&nbsp;Mining?<p>During the first few years of Bitcoin’s life, its value against the dollar was inherently worthless. Over the last eight years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies valuation as a whole, has skyrocketed tremendously, thus leading larger groups of centralized entities to build mining farms that utilize immense amounts of energy that has lead to this topic of discussion. Imagine, for a second, how much energy output it must take for tens of thousands of miners to solve complex mathematical equations to garner Bitcoin. The underlying technology, blockchain, unfortunately perpetuates this notion because the cost of running a blockchain is passed on through transaction fees. Fortunately, environmentally friendly blockchain entities are emerging such as the Crypto Climate Accord, which AERGO has joined and how plans to become a net-zero carbon blockchain through the transition of net-zero carbon mining through its DPOS consensus paradigm.</p><p>Green Energy Blockchain Mining: Proof-Of-Work vs. Proof Of&nbsp;Stake</p>Green Blockchain Energy Paradigms Are Now Emerging Through DPOS: But How Do POW And POS&nbsp;Differ?<p>There are many methods on how blockchain mining can become environmentally friendly and practically efficient. Solar panels and allowing for mining via the cloud (such as what company Genesis Mining does) are efficient fixes to solve the crypto climate dilemma. Energy efficient blockchain systems have now come to the forefront by eliminating the competition of Proof-Of-Work consensus models by implementing Proof-Of-Stake/Delegated Proof-Of-Stake models like&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>In Proof-Of-Work consensus algorithms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners compete with each-other to problem-solve at a faster rate than the other to mine blocks. A plethora of machines operating consistently, competing with one another, with lead to a plethora of problems, and energy consumption highlights such a notion. In Proof-Of-Stake, “validators” not “miners” validate the network based on the algorithm of the amount of cryptocurrency that is “staked” or provided by the validator to the network. It is important to note that Ethereum is slowly transitioning to a proof-of-stake paradigm.</p><p>AERGO’S Environmental Idealism Into Vision Through DPOS: A Clean Energy Representative Democracy.</p>AERGO’S Delegated Proof Of Stake (DPOS), A Green Energy Model And Representative Democracy<p>Energy efficiency is a major talking-point within the blockchain community, and Proof-Of-Stake models are at the forefront of this growing discussion. Delegated Proof-Of-Stake, however, embodies not only the notions of efficiency and an environmentally conscious consensus model, but perpetuates the concept of representative democracy as well. AERGO envisioned a concept for their blockchain that successfully amalgamated Proof-Of-Work with with the Byzantine Agreement consensus model. In essence, a Byzantine Agreement model guarantees instant block finality while requiring a set of parties to agree on a value even if one of the parties are corrupted. AERGO envisioned a representative democracy that is clean energy and representative to the populace of the network; a community that thrives allows a project to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>AERGO emphasizes the right of generating blocks to set block producers, while allowing a reorganization of these block producers through a finite range. By following a Proof-Of-Stake model with only a limited amount of block producers, AERGO addresses multiple performance issues. AERGO prevents an excessive amount of energy consumption from occurring from an ever-growing amount of block producers like what occurs in a Proof-Of-Work system such as Bitcoin. Simultaneously, AERGO gives a voice to its token holders, an important value proposition in any Proof-Of-Stake network; it gives token holders a voice in their investment and prevents them from staying on the outskirts as voiceless entities who just bought the token. Block producers must produces blocks in the allotted time given and AERGO stakers can freely vote for numerous different block producers (though they can choose one per-day to avoid an excessively dynamic and unpredictable environment for block producers). AERGO has made an important promise to become a net-zero carbon blockchain producer by 2030, and the company has the resources and partnerships to create such a&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Conclusion: AERGO’S 21st Century Mining: Representative Equity, Efficiency And Environmentally Friendly: The Three E’s Of&nbsp;AERGO</p>In Order For Blockchain To Become Mass Adopted, Companies Within Blockchain, Must Contribute And Perpetuate A Eco-Friendly Blockchain Paradigm: This Is The AERGO&nbsp;Vision<p>It is evident that Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake systems perpetuate representative democracy, transparent republicanism, and eco-friendly blockchains. These paradigm of virtues must accompany the vision’s of blockchain companies if we’re to hope for any type of mass adoption. Companies like AERGO, who have recently joined the Crypto Climate Accord (which is inspired by the Paris Climate Accord), will be on the forefront of this idealism through further collaboration with the Accord, providing preference to net-zero carbon companies, and a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake paradigm that eliminates the competition of Proof-Of-Work. This is the AERGO&nbsp;vision.</p><p>If you have an interest in becoming AERGO’s Block Producer, please email <a href="mailto:hello@aergo.io">hello@aergo.io</a></p><p>Helpful Links:</p><p><a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">cryptoclimate.org</a></p><p><a href="https://www.aergo.io/">https://www.aergo.io/</a></p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

The antitrust lawsuit against Facebook gets dismissed Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>We’ve been talking quite a bit about Lina Khan, Big Tech, and antitrust. The big news last week was that a federal judge <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">dismissed parallel lawsuits</a> filed against Facebook by the FTC and a coalition of state attorney generals.</p><p>The takeaway? Legally pinning Facebook as a monopoly is a tough task despite “conventional wisdom.” (And maybe the FTC and state AGs were a bit unprepared for this first go&nbsp;around.)</p><p>As Judge James Boasberg&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>“It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.”</blockquote><p>Part of the issue is the definition of monopoly power — the ability to jack up prices beyond the market rate. But Facebook is essentially free.

And here’s what everyone else is&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: The rulings show just how tough it will be for regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to make their charges of tech malfeasance stick.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, but: It could also strengthen the hand of lawmakers who argue that today’s outdated antitrust laws lack the teeth to restrain the power wielded by Google, Facebook, Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: Antitrust prosecutions remain dauntingly complex and forbiddingly difficult to&nbsp;clinch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/technology/facebook-ftc-lawsuit.html">NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>Courts have narrowed interpretations of antitrust laws over the years, making government cases difficult to win. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of loosening the influence that the big companies have over wide swaths of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>“Today’s development in the F.T.C.’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado and a co-sponsor of the antitrust bills. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”</blockquote><blockquote>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri and a critic of Big Tech, said on Twitter that the court had acknowledged Facebook’s “massive market power but essentially shrugged its shoulders.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-dismisses-government-antitrust-lawsuits-against-facebook-11624907747?mod=hp_lead_pos4">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The rulings dealt a direct, early blow to bipartisan government efforts to pursue Big Tech giants on allegations they have unlawfully monopolized the marketplace. They also served as a reminder that antitrust cases — particularly against dynamic tech-sector firms that offer free, nontraditional products — can be difficult to win before federal courts that have narrowed the reach of antitrust laws over several&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>“This really stings for the agencies,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman. “The FTC and the states I’m sure used the best talent they had to bring these cases, and they have been knocked out at the earliest&nbsp;stage.”</blockquote><blockquote>Even if the FTC is able to successfully amend its lawsuit, he added, “this adds complexity and delay to a case that was already going to be difficult.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/business/dealbook/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The ruling is a blow to the antitrust movement that is gaining momentum in Washington. The biggest takeaway from the case is this: The monopoly case against one of Big Tech’s key players is out of step with the law as currently written. What needs to be established is whether what Facebook is doing, as defined by the law and rulings in other cases, is illegal. The answer seems to be&nbsp;no.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge’s ruling also added evidence for those who say the law is not up to the task of keeping Big Tech in check. Legislative efforts took a step forward last week when the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of reining in tech giants. But this also puts Lina Khan, the Big Tech critic who now chairs the F.T.C., in a tricky spot. If the F.T.C. amends and refiles its case against Facebook, Khan would need to balance arguments that Facebook is violating law as it currently stands with support for efforts, as she has backed in the past, for Congress to introduce new legal&nbsp;tools.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/judge-s-facebook-ruling-embarrasses-ftc-states">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>The milder rebuke of the FTC suggests the ruling may prove a mere speed bump in the government’s case, rather than a brick wall bringing the entire case to a halt. But the rulings are a reminder that, despite the deluge of coverage by the news media about the antitrust battle against big tech, nothing is guaranteed. And that has particular significance for the FTC’s new chair, Lina Khan, who is seen as a critic of big tech. She has previously argued that current approaches to antitrust law don’t address the scope of Amazon’s power. For Khan, and other tech critics, the rulings make it even more important that Congress pass the antitrust bills targeting big&nbsp;tech.</blockquote> 3.

<p>Privacy changes from big tech are coming thick and fast right now. Some are solid privacy commitments, like Apple’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;and Google’s abolition of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">Ad IDs</a>&nbsp;for users who opt out of tracking. But others are underwhelming from a privacy perspective, like Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">planned abolition of third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and its new Google Play&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/googles-safety-section-doesnt-really-keep-pace-with-apple/">safety section&nbsp;</a>which doesn’t raise the bar anywhere near as far as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple privacy labels</a>.</p>



<p>The latest big privacy announcement comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">Apple</a>, with its raft of privacy and security measures to launch in updates&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/">macOS</a>&nbsp;this fall. The new features are designed to help users better control and manage apps’ access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Apple promises users “deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.” And individual control is what is at the core of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;after all, right?</p>



<p>And, we have to say, with these changes Apple has got a lot of things right for consumer privacy. While some of the biggest moves are security measures, we like most of what we see from the privacy ones.</p>



<p>That’s not to say Apple is offering a complete fix for protecting consumer data privacy. Users absolutely still need the privacy capabilities baked into&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and available through&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, which is why we’re going to look at what Apple is offering against what we already offer:&nbsp;</p>



 iCloud Private Relay 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Private Relay is a new internet privacy service that’s built right into iCloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s network provider. All the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays. The first assigns the user an anonymous IP address that maps to their region but not their actual location. The second decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Private Relay is like a VPN or Tor in that it masks data by running it through relays. With a VPN from a quality provider, the user is trusting a single vendor with their data. If they choose vendor wisely, VPN is also a safe and private option.&nbsp;If iCloud Private Relay is thought of as a simplified version of Tor, then wider ownership and control of the relay servers would be desirable.</p>



<p>Apple is asking for trust to deliver this service, which is fine, but it’s not offering&nbsp;choice. The user can only access it from a Safari browser. If all the user does is in the Apple ecosystem and they use a Safari browser, this is a fine solution. But if users want choice and alternatives, they’d look to MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>, and Safe Browser, Safe Browser Extension and the VPN in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safe Browser is a full-featured web browser that isolates user data from the default web browser that comes with their device. Their browsing history, bookmarks and settings are encrypted and never leave the device.</p>



<p>Safe Browser allows the user to open multiple tabs, view full screen video in landscape and portrait, and bookmark favourite sites.</p>



<p>For added safety and privacy, Safe Browser comes with a built-in ad and tracker blocker and a site reputation shield. The site reputation shield checks for known malicious sites on the device and warns the user before they visit them. The user can also enable biometric or PIN access for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform VPN is a completely secure VPN that supports streaming and geographical relocation.&nbsp;</p>



 Hide My Email 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“Expanding on the capabilities of Sign in with Apple, Hide My Email lets users share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private. Built directly into Safari, iCloud settings, and Mail, Hide My Email also enables users to create and delete as many addresses as needed at any time, helping give users control of who is able to contact them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Hide My Email validates MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">multi Sudo approach</a>. Disposable or one-off email like Apple is offering is great, but sometimes users want to link their private email to other privacy capabilities like a&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">virtual card</a>, as they can in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>. If a user is a committed Apple customer and happy to use only Safari and Apple Mail, then this feature is great. But if that’s not the case, then users still need a private email solution with greater functionality. Identity is more than email and that what’s we at Anonyome Labs have known for years. Proof:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">MySudo email</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/secure-communications/encrypted-email/">Sudo Platform encrypted email</a>.</p>



 Mail Privacy Protection&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is good.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;offers similar. A lot of marketeers&nbsp;embed&nbsp;invisible pixels in the emails they send to force email servers to make network requests (e.g. to show that an email was opened and from where). We can’t criticize this Apple move, but it is certainly a case of them doing something second but being very good at convincing users it’s novel. And, again, it’s a nice easy solution for committed Apple customers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved Intelligent Tracking Prevention&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a number of years, Intelligent Tracking Prevention has helped protect Safari users from unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers while allowing websites to function normally. This year, Intelligent Tracking Prevention is getting even stronger by also hiding the user’s IP address from trackers. This means they can’t utilize the user’s IP address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is a good feature.&nbsp;This type of anti-tracking capability is great, and the embedded browser in MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>&nbsp;has this capability too. But&nbsp;where we offer a significant but complementary difference is in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, compartmentalization means&nbsp;categorizing and separating the user’s personal data to reduce the impact when it is compromised. It’s the world’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">most powerful data privacy strategy</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;was created on the exact same principle.&nbsp;MySudo is based around&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a&nbsp;customizable digital identity that intentionally differentiates from the user’s personal identity and mitigates the risk to their highly sensitive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MySudo, our exemplar consumer privacy app, a user can create up to nine different Sudos and use them in any context (e.g. for banking, selling on classifieds, catching up with friends, and booking travel).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Sudo has its own set of attributes and associated capabilities:&nbsp;</p>



  name  phone number  address  email address  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a>&nbsp;for secure shopping  browser profile (all your bookmarks and any cookies that sites set are compartmentalized to the browsing Sudo)  notification settings for phone, email and message  contacts and more.  



<p>The user gives each of their Sudos one or more identity attributes that are different from their personal identity. They can make their Sudo identity a little different (e.g. by having a different phone number) or very different (e.g. by having a different name, email address, phone number,&nbsp;virtual cards, contacts, etc.). They label each Sudo and can even assign a different notification sound to each.</p>



<p>Users structure their Sudos to achieve the degrees of privacy, safety, organization and convenience they need. For example, they might regard their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">medical information</a>&nbsp;as more sensitive than their financial information, and their financial information as more sensitive than who they know. They decide what suits them. (Listen to how two of the world’s leading privacy experts Michael Bazzell and Justin Carroll structure their Sudos in this episode of The Privacy, Security, &amp; OSINT Show:&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/034-our-sudo-strategies">Our Sudo Strategies</a>.)</p>



<p>Sometimes the user might want to let one of their Sudos retain some of the benefits of ‘privacy invasive’ searching and tracking online. Health information is a great example. When researching a health condition, the user may want some level of tracking in order to preserve their search history, mark favorites, set bookmarks, be offered search results relevant to their previous searching, receive discount coupons for remedies, be offered new research material, or even be referred to doctors or hospitals specializing in their condition. By using a Sudo, the user can still have all these benefits, but they’re not correlated to the user’s personal data.</p>



<p>The bottom line is MySudo private browser is more nuanced than Apple’s offering and gives the user more of that granular control Apple is talking about, which is essential to privacy.</p>



<p>Overall, Apple’s latest privacy enhancements are good, and even more great validation that we’re working on the right stuff. Check it out here:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a></p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Dock mainnet has successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) network today. This is a major milestone for the Dock community which can now play an active role in securing and running the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS further decentralizes the network by expanding the validator pool to 50 concurrent validators (there may be several hundred vying for top 50 spots) who are selected based on the amount of Dock tokens they have staked. This also marks a transition to more open governance with token holders being able to elect council members and vote on proposals.<br></p><p>To ensure that the new mainnet is safe to use, we have worked with the security experts at <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a> in partnership with <a href="https://cryptonics.consulting/security-and-diligence/">Cryptonics Consulting</a> to perform an audit of the network. The final report from the auditors shows that all issues identified have been resolved or acknowledged by the Dock team and is publicly available on our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate/blob/master/audit-reports/Dock%20PoS%20-%20Audit%20Report%20%5B20210706%5D.pdf">Github</a>.<br></p><p>Please follow the following links on how to participate in the network as a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nominating-validators-on-docks-proof-of-stake-network/">nominator</a> or a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/how-validation-works-in-docks-proof-of-stake/">validator</a> and we will follow up soon with an additional article on how governance works in the new mainnet. You can also learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a>, and please feel free to reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a> with any questions.<br><br>We hope you enjoy the new mainnet as much as we enjoyed creating it!</p>
