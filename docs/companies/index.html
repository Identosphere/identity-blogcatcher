				<p>The Hyperledger Indy + Aries bundle of technologies, complete with Anoncreds verifiable credential format, was the first production-ready suite of SSI technologies to hit the market. Trinsic’s founding team were key contributors in the <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/agentframework-for-net-joins-hyperledger-aries-14aba357da41">beginnings of the Aries project</a>. Shortly thereafter, Trinsic <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id/status/1232289435317784582">launched the world’s first full-stack SSI platform</a> based on these technologies. Subsequently, that Aries-powered platform has been used in hundreds of proofs-of-concept, pilot projects, and production deployments. Those experiences produced mountains of learnings critical for application developers, infrastructure vendors such as ourselves, and the open source community in our shared goal of self-sovereign identity.<br><br></p><p>As more customers went into production, we gathered their feedback and heard them loud and clear. We made improvements to our platform to address their concerns where it was possible. However, when we realized our customers were facing critical limitations caused by the underlying tech stack, we began developing an updated version of our platform that would reduce our dependency on these technologies and enable a better platform for our customers.</p>

				<p>Trinsic’s goal is to be the infrastructure of choice for developers who are building identity wallets and ecosystems to provide more people access to re-usable and self-sovereign identity. We make complex technology easy to use through turnkey APIs and understandable documentation.<br><br></p><p>As an infrastructure provider, it is critical we build on modular technologies that are scalable and extensible so we can:<br><br></p>  Support a variety of standards as they evolve, including verifiable credential formats like W3C VC Data Model, BBS Signature w/ VCs, KERI ACDCs, and ISO 18013-5 mDLs; communication protocols such as OIDC and DIDComm; and roots of trust such as ION, Ethereum, and traditional DNS infrastructure.  Scale to the volumes and metrics needed by our customers, in terms of throughput, response time, and reliability.  Build developer tools that fit our customers’ workflows, including wallets that are accessible using any device, available in multiple programming languages, and support built-in governance.  <p><br>These are the main motivations behind our development of Trinsic Ecosystems, the next iteration of our platform. Trinsic Ecosystems is built with the lessons learned from production deployments with over 100,000 live, end-users across the world. In addition, Trinsic Ecosystems already has customers using it in production with extremely positive results.<br><br></p><p>While we are investing all our efforts into making Trinsic Ecosystems the best it can be, we will continue to support our existing platform for the foreseeable future. We have many customers whose projects are built on the Indy/Aries stack, and we have every intention of making each of them successful. Moving forward:<br><br></p>  We will eventually sunset our existing platform based on Aries, although we do not have a specific date set for that. When we make that decision we’ll communicate it publicly and work with each team with production deployment on a migration plan.  Other than a few edge cases, Trinsic Ecosystems is far superior to Trinsic’s existing platform, and we will work closely with any of our customers who wish to migrate to ensure a smooth transition.  We are targeting for Trinsic Ecosystems to become the exclusive platform we provide to new customers by the end of the calendar year.  <p><br>For more information about Trinsic Ecosystems and the specific technical differences relative to our existing platform, please see our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/">Migration Guide</a> in our documentation.</p>

												<a>How do I get started with Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>Trinsic Ecosystems is being used in production, and we (and our customers!) couldn’t be happier with the results. We’re working closely with an exclusive set of customers to ensure their feedback makes it into the product rapidly. If you’re interested in building on Trinsic Ecosystems, <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">please </a><a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">reach out</a>.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What about interoperability with Aries moving forward?</a>
					 

					 <p>Interoperability is a keystone of SSI and something our customers almost universally need eventually. Today, Trinsic Ecosystems supports the W3C verifiable credential standard and OIDC-based verifications, which are interoperable in their respective domains, but Trinsic Ecosystems is not interoperable with Aries yet.</p><p><br>We intend on bringing support for Aries interoperability to Trinsic Ecosystems over time. One of the most challenging issues with the Hyperledger Indy/Aries tech is how bundled the current implementations are. Trinsic Ecosystems is built in such a way where we can easily add support for components of the stack separately—and some of these components are on the roadmap already:<br><br></p>  Indy: a legitimate option for anchoring public DIDs  Aries: messaging protocols and interoperability profiles for exchanging data between wallets  Anoncreds: a variant of verifiable credential which is now beginning to be documented and standardized   
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>What should I do if I’m currently using Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>Of course the answer is “it depends”. If you’re experimenting with a proof-of-concept, then you probably don’t have much to worry about. We wrote a document outlining who should migrate, and how, in our <a href="https://docs-v2.trinsic.id/learn/migrate/#motivations-to-build-the-new-platform">documentation</a>. If you’re intending on scaling to users in production or have questions about migration, we suggest you <a href="https://calendly.com/trinsic-product/chat?back=1&amp;month=2022-09">get in touch with us</a> to discuss your situation.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not fix Trinsic’s existing platform instead of build Trinsic Ecosystems?</a>
					 

					 <p>We invested months of time and hundreds of thousands of dollars on improving Trinsic’s existing platform. But we found some of the challenges with the underlying tech caused scaling and performance problems that couldn’t be feasibly overcome. The best option ahead of us was to develop something built from the ground-up with the requirements of real-world, production usage in mind.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Why not wait for the community to fix the problems with Aries?</a>
					 

					 <p>We’re focused on building the best products, period. We don’t have a <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/not-invented-here-syndrome/">“not built here” complex</a> with regard to developments in the SSI the space. Our customers and partners put their trust in us to be objective in our pursuit of the best possible platform. This is our only incentive—we don’t have consulting revenue or other forms of income to sustain us, so if we don’t create the best platform on earth, our business will be at risk.<br><br></p><p>So while we welcome developments of the open source ecosystem, we can’t sit around and wait for improvements like Anoncreds 2.0, which has been discussed for ~4 years, to be completed. If there are solutions that better solve our problems, we have a fiduciary duty to opt for those solutions.</p>

				<p>We are all in this space because we envision a future where users have more control of their identity. At Trinsic, we’ll continue to support technologies that usher in that future as quickly as possible by helping developers build fantastic products that will be adopted. We encourage everyone to share their opinions and experiences using our technology. We hope Kaliya’s analysis will spur constructive dialog in the community that will drive improvements and innovation in SSI.<br><br></p><p>We are happy to engage with specific questions you have on our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ">Community Slack channel</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">Twitter</a> and look forward to the discourse.</p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN Insights, by our Americas Ecosystem Lead, Erick&nbsp;Pinos. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article written by Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead at Ontology.</p><p>Web3 is an interconnected set of technologies, protocols, concepts, and frameworks that represent the next stage of a more decentralized Internet. These past few years, we saw glimpses of a Web3 enabled future through Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Both of these technologies enabled new kinds of online peer-to-peer interactions. DeFi allowed users access to financial instruments without meddling middlemen, and NFTs enabled provable ownership of virtual goods such as in-game assets, digital art, or intellectual property.</p><p>However, DeFi and NFTs are just two verticals of Web3. Other important verticals include Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) for decentralized coordination in the creation of Web3 infrastructure, and Decentralized Identity (DID) for the self-sovereignty of one’s own data while interacting with Web3 services. We can predict what it will take for these remaining Web3 pillars to see similar adoption by studying the history of how the more well-known pillars saw rapid adoption.</p><p>DeFi</p><p>While DeFi became the most popular blockchain use case in late 2020, many of the most popular DeFi projects existed for years before. MakerDAO launched in 2017. Uniswap, Compound, and Aave launched in 2018. 1inch launched in 2019, and so on. You could use these services for their intended purposes, but it wasn’t until yield farming programs were put into place that usage took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Indeed, yield farming took the crypto world by storm in 2020. The prospect of earning tokens with your assets made many a millionaire and captured the attention of many new DeFi projects looking to grow a user base very quickly. As a result, a slew of projects launched in a short amount of time and aimed at capitalizing on this phenomenon. From decentralized exchanges and liquidity aggregators to decentralized lending and derivatives, almost any DeFi project could receive a massive boost in users and total value locked from offering token incentives to provide liquidity to their platform.</p><p>It’s no surprise that offering financial incentives will draw in a large user base, but what about retention? Unfortunately, many DeFi projects implemented yield farming unsustainably, issuing massive rewards through inflation of their own governance tokens, resulting in high but short-lived APYs at the expense of their project’s token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>NFTs</p><p>As the DeFi hype died down in 2021, attention moved to NFTs. It was possible to mint NFTs back in 2017, but it was technically challenging to do so. Even after no-code NFT minting tools became easier to use in 2020, pioneered by NFT marketplaces such as Rarible, it wasn’t until 2021 when prominent artists like Beeple repeatedly sold NFT art for tens of millions of dollars a piece that content creators from all over rushed to mint their art as NFTs in the hopes of earning an income through this new medium. PFP projects pushed the NFT hype forward even more. Why sell one or a few NFT art pieces when you can sell 10,000 programmatically generated variations of the same&nbsp;image?</p><p>For better or for worse, the financialization of a Web3 technology accelerates its adoption.</p><p>That leaves us with DAOs and DID. There are many Web3 projects that use these technologies today. But unlike DeFi and NFTs, DAOs and DID have yet to see adoption on a similar scale, and I believe it is mainly due to the lack of financialization of these technologies. Once it becomes straightforward as to how users can make money with this tech, we’ll see similar hype cycles and corresponding corrections on the likes of DeFi and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Lets see some examples of what such financialization would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>DAOs</p><p>There are many no-code tools that allow for communities to spin up their own DAOs, such as Snapshot for decentralized proposal-making and voting, and Gnosis for multi-sig management of a group’s treasury. In today’s DAOs, community members vote on governance decisions, elect committees, serve as signers on its multisig, etc. But how are they compensated for their time and contributions? Making participating in a DAO financially sustainable for participants is key for mass adoption.</p><p>One such way is through the standardization and automation of bounty programs. Manual bounty programs are cumbersome, with bounty creators needing to write out assignments and claim forms to manually review and disburse payments. If DeFi projects had to onboard liquidity providers one at a time, then manually sit down and disburse yield farming payments to each one, they would have never grown as big as they did as quickly as they&nbsp;did.</p><p>Similarly, bounty programs need to be re-invented like an assembly line. Bounties need to become standardized and easy to post, find, take, review, and integrate back into the main project. We also need to expand the idea of what constitutes a bounty to include tasks and micro-tasks. Designing a logo, voting in a proposal, reposting a tweet, and serving on a committee all should be valid bounties with different scopes and rewards. Once bounties become standardized and processes become automated, there could be as many bounty hunters as there were yield&nbsp;farmers.</p><p>Decentralized Identity</p><p>Currently, data brokers make billions of dollars off of peoples’ data collected via countless terms of service agreements and privacy policies signed every day. You see none of that revenue, and in some cases you can’t even opt out of having your data sold by these data&nbsp;brokers.</p><p>DID is a system that attaches decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for people, entities, and objects with verifiable credentials (VCs) that store properties about those identities. This new structure allows for users to hide their data, selectively reveal it only when necessary, and even charge to access it. This opens up a host of new monetization strategies for users. If you owned your own data, you could benefit from directly selling it. Examples are earning revenue for consensually selling your own data for surveys, targeted advertising, studies, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Scalability comes through the automation of these opportunities and programmatic access to such trusted and verifiable data, with streaming payments sent to the provider on a per-use basis. Such a process is not possible without a solid Web3 foundational infrastructure. It needs to become easier for projects to buy datasets directly from the community directly than from buying datasets from data brokers. And, on the user side, it needs to become easy for users to record and sell their data repeatedly easily to as many buyers as they would&nbsp;like.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>There are a plethora of Web3 technologies and even more projects implementing them. Financialization of these technologies isn’t all that matters to drive mass adoption, but it is a powerful driving force. We must take great care in implementing it sustainably and with properly aligned incentives in place to ensure Web3 develops optimally.</p><p>We are in the early stages and are just beginning to see glimpses of what a Web3 enabled future looks like.

				 In a world where we rely increasingly on digital information, we need to know that the credentials we share are accurate. <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> (or Trust Hubs) will help us verify the authenticity of the information we share by storing digital certificates that can verify the identity of individuals and organizations. These certificates can authenticate online transactions, access sensitive information, or sign documents electronically.&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>Trust Registries will help to reduce fraud and ensure that only accurate information is shared. They will also help build back confidence in the digital economy and enable new types of interactions that are impossible with traditional paper-based systems.</p>
<p>As we continue <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/trust-registry-task-force/">highlighting the importance</a> of Trust Registries over the coming months, the following real-world example from the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-digital-wallets-series/">State of Digital Wallet Series</a> “<a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/further-research-and-effort-digitalwallet-part-10-16/">Further Research &amp; Effort</a>” gives us a great picture of how critical Trust Registries are within digital identity ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>
 A Home Renovation. 
<p>Let’s imagine a home renovation project with three main groups to think about:</p>
 
 Homeowner 
 Contractor 
 City Inspector 
 
<p>Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are accurate. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is honest. Their Digital Wallet needs to prove a few things:</p>
 
 The Contractor was the entity to which the Insurer (the Issuer) gave the Credential. Done inside the Contractor’s Digital Wallet – it uses cryptography to prove that they still control the insurance Credential. 
 That the Insurer cryptographically signed the Credential – letting the Homeowner know that the information hasn’t been tampered with. 
 That the Insurer is a bona fide insurance company, there will need to be a Trust Hub that lists insurers for a particular area for this to happen. 
 
<p>Digital Wallets can do all of the above in just a few seconds while doing other checks. Each party involved has pieces of information that they need to verify.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Homeowner wants to know that they have the proper permits and licences for the job and that their Contractor and employees are fully licensed, insured, and up to scratch.&nbsp; 
 The Contractor wants to know that the Homeowner has the proper permits, licence, inspections and insurance.&nbsp; 
 The City Inspector wants to know that the Homeowner and Contractor have the required licenses, training, and other paperwork. 
 
<p>The paper-based verification process takes so long that few homeowners ever do the checks they should. With digital wallets and the ecosystems behind them, verifications can get done in seconds—while we greet each other in person.</p>
 A critical tool for re-establishing trust 
<p>Trust Registries will be a critical tool for re-establishing trust online. They will help users identify trustworthy websites and online services and help businesses build trust with their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it’s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the confidence we need in our systems.</p>

<blockquote>The International Monetary Fund pitched for a globally coordinated, consistent, and comprehensive approach to crypto regulation through its recent publication.</blockquote><blockquote>The IMF noted that the divided approach to crypto regulations among countries (ban outright or accept with open arms) is resulting in a fragmented global response.</blockquote><blockquote>Although the IMF sees a global consensus on crypto regulation is forming, albeit slowly, the agency is concerned that “the longer this takes, the more national authorities will get locked into differing regulatory frameworks.”</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies have come a long way since Bitcoin, the world’s first cryptocurrency, was introduced in 2009. Having touched a whopping $3 trillion in 2021 from a market cap of a couple of billion dollars in 2013, when there were just seven cryptocurrencies in existence, tells a&nbsp;story.</p><p>Although phenomenal, this incredible growth hasn’t been without its share of problems. For instance, with rising demand for crypto-related products, the failed projects, hacks, high volatility, rug pull, and pump and dump schemes have increased, too.</p><p>Besides, such massive traction has attracted the attention of many traditional financial institutions, which has led to fears of the increasing intertwining of the crypto market and the traditional financial ecosystem. The experts believe that any drastic fall in the crypto market can spill over to the broader financial industry.</p><blockquote>Thus, crypto regulations must ensure consumer protection and keep a check on the industry without stifling innovation.</blockquote><p>Easier said than done. Without global consensus, crypto regulations will just be an equivalent of a toothless tiger!</p><blockquote>The International Monetary Fund, too, pitched for an internationally coordinated, consistent, and comprehensive approach to crypto regulations in its <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Regulating-crypto-Narain-Moretti">latest publication</a>, noting that “the right rules could provide a safe space for innovation.”</blockquote><p>The IMF also pointed out that “applying existing regulatory frameworks to crypto assets, or developing new ones, is challenging for several reasons.”</p> So, what makes Crypto Regulation Complex? <p>There are several reasons: the rapidly evolving crypto market, lack of resources among regulators, patchy data, and an ever-growing number of cryptocurrencies. Thus, global coordination is a&nbsp;must.</p><p>Interestingly, we are also seeing coordination between various actors within the crypto market to make crypto compliance as smooth as possible. Recently, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/partnerships/2022/fis-partners-shyft-network-for-improved-crypto-reg-compliance/">FIS Global joined hands with Shyft Network</a> to enable companies to participate in the crypto landscape while complying with the complex and ever-changing world of crypto regulations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/FISGlobal/status/1499089662744449029?t=7lcSIVxe7OZ6XMjKD0ChAw&amp;s=19">Image Source</a>) No Unison&nbsp;Approach <p>Although the call for crypto regulations has gained momentum pretty recently, not all regulators and authorities have been sitting ducks. The United States, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/travel-rule-will-be-mandatory-in-the-uk-by-23-september-2023">the United Kingdom</a>, Switzerland, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-travel-rule-set-to-be-mandatory-in-the-eu-by-2024">the European Union</a> had introduced or amended legislation to reign in the crypto industry even before the crypto assets attracted mainstream attention. Besides, international agencies, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), too, have published guidelines for the crypto industry.</p><p>How effective all the previous guidelines and regulations have been is a matter of discussion, given that a critical piece was missing: global coordination. For instance, the FATF Travel Rule has been adopted by only a handful of countries, which has compelled the FATF to urge governments to expedite Travel Rule adoption.</p><blockquote>The recent IMF publication also highlighted two vastly different approaches among countries when it comes to crypto regulation. On the one hand, some countries, like China, came down heavily against crypto assets by banning them outright. On the other hand, some countries welcome crypto companies with open arms, such as El Salvador. This results in a fragmented global response that defeats the purpose of regulating digital&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It is not to say that a global consensus is out of the question, as countries are discussing ways to regulate crypto assets in international forums, such as G20, as proposed by a G20 watchdog. So, it’s just a matter of time&nbsp;now.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1546420350560370688?t=BUaw-iZz6g5ffK7y2XW-6w&amp;s=19">Image Source</a>)<p>But the IMF is concerned that “the longer this takes, the more national authorities will get locked into differing regulatory frameworks.” Thus, the IMF is calling for a coordinated, consistent, and comprehensive global response.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot&nbsp;Project <p>Introduction by Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>The project on machine identities led by dena, the German federal energy agency, was finished successfully. KILT served as a core partner in this project by supplying the machine identities and demonstrating the utility of a blockchain protocol in a highly regulated environment like the energy sector. This was an important milestone for us: DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and KILT in general are ready for large scale, institutional use cases that fulfil requirements from regulators. Blockchain technology is finding its way into industry!</p><p>Also of note: During the project we deployed a complete KILT node on a Raspberry Pi-based smart meter, demonstrating the efficiency of Parity Substrate-based blockchains.</p><p>Blog Post by Majella Horan, Lead Writer for KILT Protocol<br><a href="https://www.dena.de/en/home/">dena</a> has released a report on its pilot project on digital machine identities as the basic building block for an automated energy system. KILT was part of the project, providing decentralized machine identities registered on the KILT blockchain and showing how blockchain technology can be used inside a highly-regulated environment.</p><p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> collaborated on this initiative with industry leaders from the energy sector, the digital economy and science including <a href="https://www.energyweb.org/">Energy Web Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.parity.io/">Parity Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.enbw.com/">EnBW</a>, <a href="https://www.eon.com/en.html">e-on</a>, <a href="https://www.riddleandcode.com/">Riddle &amp; Code</a>, <a href="https://www.my-oli.com/en/">Oli-Systems</a>, and <a href="https://www.50hertz.com/">50&nbsp;Hertz</a>.</p> dena Project: Background <p>Government agencies and industry are increasingly looking to blockchain solutions to help achieve effective and compliant digitalization. The modern energy industry faces challenges in coordinating an increasing number of energy-producing and energy-consuming devices in the grid infrastructure, from energy plants to electric vehicles, heat pumps and storage&nbsp;systems.</p><p>dena launched the Future Energy Lab pilot project in 2019 to explore these issues. The goal was to create a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL), a decentralized digital registry that aimed to coordinate and connect devices and energy plants across the German energy&nbsp;system.</p><p>The project incorporated the current smart meter gateway technology, and required creating uniform digital identities for energy systems. It was designed as a three-pronged pilot project to demonstrate the technical, economic and regulatory feasibility of three variants:</p>  Storing the identity characteristics directly at the smart meter&nbsp;gateway  Storing the identity characteristics directly on the&nbsp;device  Storing the identity characteristics in the&nbsp;cloud  <p>All variants needed to meet governmental standards of data security and protection, scalability and privacy in a cost-effective way.</p><p>KILT Protocol was integrated for the first two variants, with the identities to be generated and stored directly on the&nbsp;devices.</p> Digital Machine Identities with&nbsp;KILT <p>As context for the KILT integration with dena, it’s important to understand KILT’s identity framework, which has two key components:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identifies an entity or device (as a fingerprint does for humans),&nbsp;and  Verifiable, revocable credentials that are confirmed by trusted parties (“Attesters”).  <p>In this way, a digital identity can be built for people, machines, services and anything that identities can be built&nbsp;on.</p><p>Standardized digital identities for machines form the basic building block for an automated and reliable energy system. For this pilot project with dena, the machine identities each contained:</p>  A decentralized identifier (DID), which uniquely identified the device,&nbsp;and  The characteristics, attributes or properties that made this machine different from others. These were attached to the DID in the form of digital certificates, or verifiable credentials (VCs). These credentials show the static and dynamic properties of the&nbsp;device.  <p>KILT is pleased to be part of the dena Future Energy Lab project, making a practical and effective contribution to current energy challenges and showing how blockchain technology can be used in a highly regulated, real-world environment.</p><p>The following is a technical description of the project including the technical integration of KILT. The full report is <a href="https://www.dena.de/fileadmin/dena/Publikationen/PDFs/2022/Digitale_Maschinen-Identitaeten_als_Grundbaustein_fuer_ein_automatisiertes_Energiesystem.pdf">published here</a> in German; dena will publish an English version&nbsp;shortly.</p> dena Project:&nbsp;Summary <p>The BMIL pilot project aimed to close an important gap that is currently a barrier to implementing a real-time energy economy using the smart meter gateway and blockchain technology: the lack of digital identities for energy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>One of the key elements was to agree on and test uniform digital identity standards, namely DIDs and verifiable credentials.</p><p>The DID enables end-to-end encryption between digital agents, allowing data to be exchanged between participants and systems without the need for a centralized data silo by establishing a Blockchain Machine Identity Ledger (BMIL) that allows assets to register their identity (their unique DID and verifiable credentials).</p><p>These digital, self-sovereign and decentralized device identities were set up and either stored and anchored on the device itself, or via a digital twin in the cloud, depending on the&nbsp;variant.</p><p>Transmission of the digital identity was implemented in regular operation via the smart gateway infrastructure and could be linked to the BMIL through the installation of a BMIL-compatible smart&nbsp;meter.</p> dena Project: KILT Integration <p>The integration of the KILT Protocol into the BMIL project is summarized here, using the example of the device-centric identity management in conjunction with a dedicated Controllable Local System (CLS) device, the OLI Box. The integration was the same for both variants.</p><p>As the goal was to achieve a high degree of decentralization, the identities were stored directly on the respective devices and anchored on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>In the first step, the private/public key pair is generated on the box. The OLI box’s crypto chip provides the random input for generating the key pair to establish the necessary security and connect the keypair to the&nbsp;box.</p><p>Then the identifier or DID is generated on the device and anchored on the blockchain. The DID document is signed by the box in order to link it to the DID, and is then stored in the DID&nbsp;store.</p><p>Through the claimer application, the credential workflow is implemented on the OLI box. It implements the claiming of properties, the requesting of a credential, the storing of an issued credential on the box, and the sharing of credentials with the verifiers. It can either share the whole credential, or only single attributes via selective disclosure, if the verifier does not need to know the whole credential.</p><p>To ensure privacy, the credentials are not stored on the blockchain. Credentials remain with the device (the OLI box) and are only anchored on the blockchain as a hash representing the data by the issuer of the credential. The anchored credential on the blockchain does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the content and owner of the credential. Via the hash, only verifiers to which the credentials were disclosed can check the validity of that credential on the blockchain.</p><p>The different actors, e.g., the application of the Energy Web Foundation to prequalify device identities for different use cases through VC-based role assignment and others, communicate with each other via the KILT messaging service using encrypted messages.</p> dena Project: Conclusions <p>Digital identities built around DIDs and verifiable credentials provide the new standards needed for identity for governmental projects going forward. This standardization ensures uniformity, contributes to efficiency and security, and allows system services to be provided and called up fully automatically.</p><p>Future research will build on these findings and create services and applications to increase energy efficiency.</p><p>KILT is a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, verifiable credentials and DIDs, providing practical, secure identity solutions for enterprises and consumers.</p><p>Discover more on the KILT <a href="https://www.kilt.io/learn/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> to keep up with the latest&nbsp;news.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-in-action-the-dena-blockchain-pilot-project-a384cb2629a7">KILT in Action — The dena Blockchain Pilot Project</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Can Digital Notarization Solve Digital ID’s Chicken-and-egg Problem? 
<p></p>
<p>Which came first, the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional, linear startup, a platform doesn’t need to acquire just one group of customers. At a minimum it needs two, its consumers and its producers.</p>
<p>But new platforms don’t initially create enough value to attract new users. It’s not economical for consumers to join the platform when there are no producers, and vice versa. This is called the chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
<p>This same problem exists in digital identity. Just switch out producers for issuers, consumers for verifiers, and platforms for ecosystems. And we have ourselves a chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
<p>The business value of credential exchange happens at verifications (e.g., lowered costs, lowered risk/fraud, lowered friction). And for this business value to be created, more credentials are needed in holders’ wallets.</p>
<p>Does the digital ID chicken-and-egg problem get solved by governments issuing ID credentials to their citizens? Must we wait on governments to become issuers to solve it?</p>
<p>What if organizations that currently conduct examinations (e.g., a financial institution does KYC during account opening) can extend their processes into the issuance of credentials?</p>
<p>Or what if digital trust providers (e.g., document authentication) extend their offering into the issuance of machine readable credentials?</p>
<p>Do issuers need to have access to source data (and uniqueness) to become attesters?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, notaries exist to attest to the validity of documents. And this practice is very much trusted by verifiers.</p>
<p>Can Digital Notarization solve Digital ID’s chicken-and-egg problem?</p>
 <br>
About Podcast Episode 
 
<p>Some of the key topics covered during this episode with Dan are:</p>
 
 How does the Chicken-and-egg Problem relate to digital identity? 
 Is there a dependency on Government IDs to seed the marketplace? 
 Are unique identifier databases required to become a credential issuer? 
 What is Transitive Trust? And how does it differ from how trust gets established otherwise (e.g., through backend API calls)? 
 The missing role in the trust triangle: The Examiner. 
 Can Examiners become Digital Notaries? 
 Rethinking Authentication and Authorization – using attestations from multiple issuers helps to create more trust. 
 How issuance can become a business model for many trusted service providers. 
 Some Challenges with the mDL (ISO/IEC 18013) Standard. 
 The benefits of using a Microcredential approach in Issuance. 
 Misconceptions about becoming credential issuers (e.g., assuming liability, data minimization).

<p>SEVENmile now issues digital graduation certificates that are fraud-proof and instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.</p><p>Zug, Switzerland – 8 September, 2022 – <a href="https://www.sevenmile.org.au/">SEVENmile</a>, an experiential learning program in Australia, that helps high-school students learn real-world skills, today announced a strategic collaboration with <a href="https://dock.io/">Dock Labs</a> to issue digital graduation certificates that are instantly and permanently verifiable using blockchain technology. SEVENmile now issues fraud-proof certificates, allowing students to prove their skills throughout their lives and ensure immediate trust with employers.</p><p>SEVENmile’s entrepreneurial training program pairs high school students with business owners to teach students problem-solving techniques and help them gain an understanding of real-life business issues. SEVENmile believes that in 2022, a graduation certificate in a paper format has no real-world value to a student. Printed certificates are difficult to verify and, because of that, do not help students prove their skills. Dock Labs’ verifiable credentials platform, Dock Certs, is now enabling SEVENmile to issue hundreds of fraud-proof digital certificates and credentials that students can store on a mobile phone. By scanning the QR Code on the certificate, a hiring company will have immediate certainty and trust that the certificate is authentic.</p><p>Degree and certificate fraud is a billion-dollar industry and a growing problem worldwide. Dock Labs uses innovative <a href="https://dock.io/verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> and blockchain technology to ensure that digital certificates and credentials cannot be forged and remain verifiable forever. SEVENmile’s graduates will now have a future-proof digital credential that will allow them to create a lifelong record of the skills they learnt and ensure they can always prove it. SEVENmile is collaborating with the New South Wales Education State Agency to expand the program to 1500 high schools by 2024.</p><p>“The evolution of Web1 to Web3 has occurred over a couple of decades. From viewing static HTML text content (Web1) to the democratization of personal data (Web3), it has been a wild ride at times. At SEVENmile Ltd, we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data is a vital platform that will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock Labs to secure the credentials of students we train.” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.</p><p>“Working with Greg and SEVENmile has not only opened our eyes to the incredible work they are doing, it’s also shown us the power of verifiable credentials in an educational setting, providing students with tamper proof digital certificates that are completely under their control, respect their privacy, and can be verified instantly” said Nick Lambert, Dock Labs’ CEO.<br></p><p>About SEVENmile</p><p>SEVENmile Ltd prepares students to become workforce-ready graduates or next-generation innovators. Student’s skillful, confident mindset exposes opportunities, ignites ambition, and fosters the attitudes and skills that are the pathway to success. The SEVENmile programs are designed for 15-18 year old high school students, and culminates in an event where students present their proposed solutions to the real-world problems of local business owners.<br>For more information, visit <a href="https://www.sevenmile.org.au/">https://www.sevenmile.org.au</a></p><p>About Dock Labs</p><p>Dock Labs’ Verifiable Credentials Platform, Dock Certs, provides a highly secure and scalable solution for businesses to issue and verify digital credentials and certificates that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.

<p>Next Thursday September 15th 2022 starting from 05:00 pm CET, InfoCert will be one of the speakers during the event organized by the DizmeID Foundation titled “Rebooting the Web of Trust”.</p>



<p>Digital Identity, decentralized identity, decentralized finance, decentralized organization, crypto space, that’s will be some of the main topics, thanks the contribution of several important representatives from different companies and institutes part of the DizmeID Foundation, will be addressed during the virtual round tables.</p>



<p>Further relevant is the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), the aim of SSI is to give a citizen control over their personal and financial identity, whilst preserving anonymity where possible.</p>



<p>Decentralization in the virtual space has thrown up many interlinking ecosystems of risk and regulation. The event objective is to understand the key challenges and existing responses to them, as well as explore new avenues for resolution and progress.</p>

<p>Global tech company IDENTOS focuses on the developer experience with core security upgrades, new features, user guides and more as part of its FPX Junction release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.identos.com/">IDENTOS Inc.</a>, a leader in digital identity and access management, today, launched the latest Federated Privacy Exchange (FPX) version of its identity and authorization software API offering. This release incorporates a number of core updates (including APIs to hold World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) compatible Verifiable Credentials), enabling greater scalability, usability, and security, as well as important user guides geared towards helping developers understand how to use the software.</p>
<p>FPX Junction is a cloud-based set of software products which provide fine-grained API authorization and user centric identity management capabilities. The <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/uma/overview">user-managed access (UMA) 2.0</a> authorization server works in tandem with the digital wallet service to enable single sign-on (SSO) federation with fine-grained resource and user consent management. FPX Junction includes an optional digital wallet UI SDK with native support for mobile and web.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are thrilled to announce this next major milestone in our FPX product suite.&nbsp; As an organization that is focused on user-centricity and interoperability, accessibility is of key importance to us. IDENTOS’ user centric APIs securely enable fine-grain consented data sharing at scale. Whether cloud, hybrid, or on-premise, with FPX Junction, our customers get value now and position themselves securely for the future.” – Anik Chawla, VP New Markets, IDENTOS</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of this launch, the company has branded its product releases by naming them after communities and neighborhoods that have been part of their history and growth – starting with the Junction neighborhood, a community that Alec Laws, CTO of the company calls home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Celebrating the communities that have made us who we are is a core part of our DNA as a company.&nbsp; We’ve always put culture and people ahead of everything we do. Branding our product releases this way is an opportunity to recognize the communities that have shaped our people, and by extension shaped IDENTOS.”-&nbsp; Azadeh Mahinpou, VP Marketing, IDENTOS.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>FPX Junction core updates</p>
<p>Enhanced Usability FPX Junction includes powerful administrative capabilities enabling customers to configure the system with speed and efficiency. Complementing the administrative APIs is updated user documentation including templated examples for administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standards Optimization FPX Junction is developed on open standards and supports the following:<br>
–Optimized UMA 2.0 compliance<br>
–Onboarding of network partners including identity providers and service providers via OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML, and LDAP</p>
<p>Resource Server Adapter (RSA) Enhancements – an optional software module, the Resource Server Adapter minimizes data source onboarding effort through pre-integration to other FPX components, and configurable extension points for data and API integrations, including non-FHIR consented data imports into a FHIR database. The RSA can capitalize on other features of FPX required to allow this import, including consent capture and identity brokering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FPX Junction feature updates</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Support – Evolving to support Verifiable Credentials, FPX Junction includes an updated digital wallet API which enables the holding, receiving and presentation of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> using W3C Decentralized Identifiers. FPX Junction meets requirements for <a href="https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html">Aries Interop Profile 2.0</a> and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a> based credential exchanges. This capability positions FPX Junction as a flexible and future ready authorization platform that can transact access and sharing requests across technology with governed control.</p>
<p>Shared Resource Management / Authorized Representative – This capability allows for multiple users to manage the same resources, as determined by the resource server. This feature has many uses, from simply allowing several people to control sharing of a document, to caregivers securely managing personal data records of dependents. For example, enabling parents, guardians or other designated individuals to manage a health record on behalf of a patient.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>IDENTOS’ FPX Junction updates are all available today to new and existing customers.</p>

 – ADR approval confirms the group’s leading position in the European digital identity market 



 – The company is the first to offer two ADR compliant identity verification solutions in Romania 



 – ARIADNEXT merged with IDnow in June 2021, integrating the IDcheck.io solution into the IDnow group portfolio 



<p></p>



<p>Bucharest, September 7th, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a European leader in identity proofing and digital identity, announced today that it has obtained the approval of the Authority for the Digitalization of Romania (ADR) for its second identity verification solution in a row. The group’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idcheck.io/">IDcheck.io</a>&nbsp;KYC (Know Your Customer) solution has been approved as compliant with Article&nbsp;4 of the ADR Remote Identification Standard that came into force on July 22, 2022. The decision comes just weeks after the ADR conformity for IDnow group’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent+QES</a>&nbsp;solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two compliant identity verification solutions for different customer needs&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IDnow group solution AutoIdent+QES, already eIDAS certified by TÜV Austria in Italy, was approved by the ADR in May 2022. The 100% automated solution IDCheck.io had already been certified under ETSI TS 119 461, the European Standard for remote identity proofing services. IDCheck.io has successfully finished the audit for the ADR and given its existing certification, has been declared compliant with Article 4 of ADR law, thus enabling IDnow group to position this identification method on the regulated market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These two ADR approved services, a first for any identity proofing provider in Europe, allow the company to address different customer needs – both for full customer journeys that include identification and digital signatures, and identification-only requirements. With these two solutions, financial institutions and banks in Romania can fulfill all their KYC requirements by offering their customers a fully secure digital onboarding experience that is AML-compliant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Broad portfolio via a single platform&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The acceleration of advanced digital business models across Romania and Europe has led to a shift in demand, from single-product identity verification towards more comprehensive identity proofing and document signing platforms. By offering one of the broadest portfolios in Europe via a single platform, IDnow group is at the forefront of these market trends and can offer reliable, secure and convenient KYC processes for its customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oliver Obitayo, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, says: “By combining IDnow, ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM, IDnow group has emerged as one of the strongest identity verification players in Europe as we offer customers a range of solutions for various use cases and jurisdictions – all from a single source. As a group, we believe in a strategy that moves far beyond offering a single identity verification method. The second ADR approval for our products within a few weeks is proof of this. We are proud to be able to address the entire range of customer needs in Romania when it comes to a fully digital and secure onboarding.”</p>

 With the ever-changing mobility industry, ID verification can help to create a faster, safer, and more equal way to travel. 



 



<p>Everyone knows the age-old saying “Sharing is caring”, and with the latest trend in public transport—so-called shared mobility—this saying could not be more true. Shared mobility offers millions of people the opportunity to get where they need to be without the hassle of owning a vehicle.</p>



<p>Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) forecasts that by 2030, more than <a href="https://www.pwc.at/de/publikationen/branchen-und-wirtschaftsstudien/eascy-five-trends-transforming-the-automotive-industry_2018.pdf">one in three</a> kilometers driven could already involve sharing concepts. But, in order for this to happen, one thing must be available: quick and easy, on-the-go identity verification. Identity verification solutions provide the much-needed safety and security that is paramount for companies and consumers, all while connecting and leveling the social world.</p>



 Moving society by leveling the playing field 



<p>We all want to get to our destination, but not everyone has their own personal vehicle, nor can they afford one. In enters shared mobility and its connections to ride sharing, car rentals, car financing and all transport services, including micro-mobility (lightweight transportation for individual use).</p>



<p>With all these choices available at the touch of a button, through various apps and online sites, shared mobility allows everyone to get to their destinations quickly, cheaper, and in a much greener way. Of course, there are plenty of people who still use personal vehicles, but the shared mobility market is anything but small. Accounting for nearly <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">$130-140 billion in global consumer spending in 2019</a>, the popularity of shared mobility continues to increase and impact society, despite the obstacles the pandemic posed.</p>



<p>The primary reason for an interest in services such as ride hailing include convenience, with safety, price, and reliability the topmost important features <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">according to McKinsey</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, McKinsey’s 2020 ACES Consumer Survey, found that more than 60% of people would share their ride with a stranger if doing so would add less than 15% to their travel time while reducing their cost.</p>



<p>With shared mobility, individuals come together from all walks of life, illustrating how social hierarchy in mobility is barrier-free and can drive mobility into the future. But in order to get to this utopia of social and shared mobility, affordable and accessible identity verification solutions must get the green light to drive these movements forward.</p>



 How ID verification assists social and shared mobility 



<p>As more people turn to services such as e-hailing (hailing a vehicle through electronic devices), there’s one major component that can be both an opportunity and a challenge for mobility services: identity verification.</p>



<p>With the e-hailing market accounting for more than <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">90% of consumer spending</a> in shared mobility globally, companies need to know who they are doing business with. Safety is paramount when it comes to transportation, especially when individuals drive or hail vehicles they don’t own. Companies need to know they can trust whoever is using their service, and consumers need to be able to trust the companies they use.</p>



<p>Identity verification solutions can provide that trust and level of assurance that both parties are looking for. All that is needed is a government ID and a selfie. Users simply need to download a mobility service app, upload a photo of their driver’s license and submit a selfie. Verification takes minutes and users can be on their way to their final destination.</p>



<p>By having such a process in place, mobility companies empower people at every stage of life to get where they need to be, while maintaining a level of security. Products such as IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> enable businesses to offer a smooth verification process for their costumers, while preventing ID fraud or underage driving. Both fraud and underage driving are dangerous to businesses and consumers alike because lives are literally on the line. A simple <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a> has the potential to save lives.</p>



<p>But despite the obstacles that fraud and underage drivers pose, shared mobility, with the use of identity verification, can help more people get to where they need to be, while reducing risk. Accessibility and inclusivity are attained by knocking down prejudices such as age, race, gender, socioeconomic status and physical ability, and in the end leveling out social mobility and providing transportation to everyone in a safe and secure way.</p>



 







 A line-up of choices 



<p>Solutions across the shared mobility ecosystem include car-sharing, car hailing, car rental, car financing as well as the beloved and growing micro-mobility option. According to a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/the-future-of-urban-mobility">survey from BCG</a>, the top reason for consumers to use micro-mobility over personal vehicles is flexibility.</p>



<p>For many, personal vehicles are losing their allure due to their inflexibility, parking, maintenance, and of course price. And with the rising cost of gas prices, we’re likely to see shared mobility increase even more—specifically e-hailing and micro-mobility options. Even Uber saw a spike in usage with <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-statistics/">118 million users in 2021, which was a 26% increase from 2020 and a 6% increase from 2019</a>.</p>



<p>But whatever a person’s preferred mode of transport, shared mobility service providers will be there to ensure they get on the road faster, while mobility providers can operate safe in the knowledge that their customers are who they say they are through the use of identity verification solutions.</p>



<p>Because when it comes to social and shared mobility, the beauty lies in the fact that there is no social hierarchy; we are all equal by having access to a service that everyone can use, from anywhere, and at any time. And all of this is achieved through identity verification.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap (29th August — 4th September) <p>Welcome to another edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! A lot of exciting news this week, from California’s new digital asset-focused law to the FBI’s warning over DeFi protocols. There’s also an update on several significant changes to Veriscope. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Crypto Firms may Soon Require a License to Operate in California <p>A newly passed law titled “Digital Financial Assets Law” seeks to make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), including crypto exchanges, to seek a license to operate in California.</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/messyroshko/status/1565699960326299655?s=21&amp;t=m5-nm3F6MCb8oEQuVTQXpw">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The ball is in California Governor Gavin Newsom’s court now. He has two options, either sign it or veto&nbsp;it.</p><p>In case Governor Newsom decides to green-light the proposed law, it will become operative in January&nbsp;2025.</p><p>Key Takeaway</p><blockquote>Once the bill is enacted, digital asset issuers will have to comply with many variables, including liquid reserves against tokens issued, risk exposure, leverage ratios, and&nbsp;more.</blockquote><blockquote>No California-licensed businesses will be allowed to offer stablecoins unless the stablecoin-issuing entity is a DFPI-licensed firm or the stablecoin has been issued by an authorized bank.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.business2community.com/crypto-news/california-may-soon-join-other-us-states-to-require-license-for-crypto-firms-02543946">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Bank of Korea to Codify ICOs in New Cryptocurrency Regulation <blockquote>According to South Korea’s Central Bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), the country will have to institutionalize initial coin offerings (ICO) while drafting its new cryptocurrency law, which is now known as the Digital Asset Basic Act&nbsp;(BOK).</blockquote><p>This is a significant move, considering the ban on ICOs in the country. However, the Central Bank noted that the ban didn’t prove effective.</p><p>After all, many South Korean projects, including Paycoin and Terra-LUNA, issued new coins abroad and listed them on domestic exchanges to get around the restrictions.</p><p>Thus, the BOK <a href="https://www.bok.or.kr/portal/bbs/P0000559/view.do?nttId=10072479&amp;menuNo=200690&amp;pageIndex=1">insists</a> that South Korea institutionalize ICOs like the EU, where tokens issued abroad are also required to establish a local presence and adhere to local regulations to be traded domestically.</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/30/south-korea-must-reverse-ineffective-ban-on-crypto-icos-central-bank-says/">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Georgia may Legalize Cryptocurrencies Soon <p>The Georgian government has established a legal framework to regulate crypto firms on similar lines to the European Union (EU) framework standards.</p><p>Levan Davitashvili, Georgia’s Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, stated that the bill is now with the Parliament and is likely to be adopted during the autumn session, according to the news report published by the local news portal Business&nbsp;Media.</p><p>How Will This Framework Affect&nbsp;VASPs?</p><blockquote>With the help of the new regulatory framework, it will be possible to clearly define the legal status, rights, and obligations of&nbsp;VASPs.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/08/30/south-korea-must-reverse-ineffective-ban-on-crypto-icos-central-bank-says/">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> FBI Warns Investors Against Cyber Attack Risks Targeting DeFi Platforms <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warned investors of security flaws in DeFi systems in a public statement on&nbsp;Monday.</p><p>The FBI urged people to contact them via the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or their local FBI office if they believe their investments in DeFi protocols have been affected.</p><p>Why is this Warning Significant?</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The FBI noted, “Between January and March 2022, cybercriminals stole $1.3 billion in cryptocurrencies, almost 97 percent of which was stolen from Defi platforms, according to the US blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis.”</p><blockquote>The FBI also noted that attackers exploit flaws in flash loans, signature validation, and cryptocurrency price pairs to attack DeFi protocols.</blockquote><p>The security agency also red-flagged code errors in crowdsourced and decentralized platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/991388/fbi-warns-investors-of-increasing-crypto-theft-on-defi-991388.html">Read more&nbsp;here.</a></p> Latest Veriscope Releases <p>In this week’s Regulatory Recap, we are also adding updates on latest Veriscope releases.</p>  Veriscope now Supports Sandbox Environment AKA Robot&nbsp;VASPs  <p>With the launch of Sandbox Environment, VASPs can now conduct end-to-end as Originator VASP or Beneficiary VASP without coordinating with another&nbsp;node.</p><p>Thanks to this latest update, <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/restful-api/introduction.html">Veriscope API</a> and <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/webhook/introduction.html">webhook events</a> backend server integration will become much faster, saving developers a significant amount of&nbsp;time.</p><p>Visit the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/main/implementation/testing/sandbox.html">Sandbox Environment section</a> of docs for more information.</p>  A Couple of UI Views &amp; Functions Have Been Removed From Veriscope  <p>The “Managers Users and Attestation Admin “section was removed from the Veriscope dashboard.

<p>DWeb Camp finished last Sunday, and it was a rich and productive experience. A number of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/preparing-for-dweb-camp/">folks from the Holochain community</a> gathered with others who are trying to build a <a href="https://getdweb.net/principles/">more human web</a>. I’ll probably write more about it later, but in summary I think it was good for the Holochain folks — we got to connect with other DWeb builders and dreamers, meet friends and colleagues that we’ve only seen online, and share Holochain with our peers.</p>This is what it looks like to fix bugs and deploy a new Holochain launcher en route to DWeb Camp.<p>Of course, while some of us were at camp, the rest of us were still busy building and deploying. (And, as you can see from the picture above, some of us were building and deploying on the way to DWeb Camp!) Here’s what’s happened recently.</p> Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.0.156: WASM metering disabled <p>Release date: 23 August 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.20<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.147</p><p>In the previous release, we fixed a bug in execution limiting, or WASM metering, which terminated all of a cell’s function calls after a certain number of operations, rendering the cell inoperable even though it was still active. However, during testing in preparation for DWeb Camp, we discovered that the limit we gave, 10 billion operations, was still causing even simple hApps to terminate functions too early. For now, we’ve disabled this feature and will revisit it later. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1535">#1535</a>)</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220823103320">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.157: No changes <p>This release was issued on the same day as 0.0.156, and was simply a test of some bug fixes in our release process.</p> Holochain 0.0.158: must_get_agent_activity <p>Release date: 31 August 2022<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.148<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.20<br>Network protocol compatibility: Holochain 0.0.158</p><p>This is a small release with a big feature that breaks compatibility with both the host API and the network protocol. <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.148/hdk/chain/fn.must_get_agent_activity.html">`must_get_agent_activity`</a> lets you use deterministic agent activity queries in your validation functions. There’ll be updated documentation in the next Holochain release, but here’s what you need to know.</p><p>When you’re validating an operation, you sometimes want access to an agent’s history to calculate running balances, previous game state, and so on. But you don’t normally have access to the source chain in a validation function. `query` only works for the local agent, not the agent whose operation is being validated. `get_agent_activity` is non-deterministic, because it can reveal evidence of a source chain fork that may be visible to some validators but not others. And because validation functions only test for validity of existing data, they can’t have anything non-deterministic in them.</p><p>The newly introduced `must_get_agent_activity` lets you query the source chain of a particular agent, but ignores source chain forks and only focuses on the data within one linear history. Like the other two querying functions, you start at a certain point in the chain and walk backwards in history until you’ve got enough info using a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.20/hdi/prelude/struct.ChainFilter.html">chain filter</a>. There’s a number of options in the chain filter besides the desired starting point; you can choose to retrieve the entire chain, stop at a certain hash or sequence ID (or whichever happens first), and retrieve the corresponding entries.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220831015922">changelog</a>.</p> Known issues <p>We’ve identified a performance problem in Holochain’s gossip implementation. Some operations, especially large ones 10 MB or more, take a long time to propagate through the network. This can make it look like the data doesn’t exist yet. We’re tracking down the causes of this issue.</p> Holochain Launcher release notes  Launcher 0.5.0: Holochain and DevHub version bumps <p>Release date: 24 August 2022</p><p>This release adds support for Holochain 0.0.156 (HDK 0.0.147) and upgrades to the newest DevHub version, which supports publishing of hApps that were written after the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordination split</a> (Holochain 0.0.144 / HDI 0.0.9 / HDK 0.0.137 and newer).</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.5.0">Download the Launcher</a>.</p> Launcher 0.5.1: Backward compatibility fix <p>Release date: 24 August 2022</p><p>This release, published on the same day as 0.5.0, fixes an issue with hApps that run on Holochain 0.0.150 and earlier. After this version, `uid` was changed to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00151-network-seed-deterministic-dna-bundling-validation-ergonomics">`network_seed`</a>, breaking admin API compatibility. Now the correct field name is used for the corresponding Holochain version.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.5.1">Download the Launcher</a>.</p> JavaScript client 0.8.0: Admin API update <p>Release date: 24 August 2022<br>Holochain versions: 0.0.151 and up</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript Client library</a> now supports the admin API of newer Holochain versions which rename `uid` to `network_seed`.</p><p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">Get the JavaScript client from NPM</a>.</p> Acorn 1.1.0-alpha release <p>Acorn is a beautiful project management app based on the idea of desired outcomes rather than tasks and goals. If you haven’t heard about it, you can read about it in a hApp spotlight that I’ll publish next week.</p><p>As of 1.0.2-alpha, Acorn has reached a public alpha and is ready for people to download and use — not just testers. If it’s been a while since you’ve tried Acorn, it’s gained a lot more polish and features which make it ready for serious use. The 1.1.0-alpha release improves further on an already very functional and user-friendly app.</p><p>Acorn also has a new website, as beautiful as the app itself. Go to <a href="https://acorn.software">https://acorn.software</a> to find out how its approach to project management is different.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn/releases/tag/v1.1.0-alpha">Read the release notes and download Acorn</a>.</p> Until next time… <p>I want to leave you with this piece of music from <a href="https://www.delsolquartet.com/">Del Sol Quartet</a>, who performed at DWeb Camp. There’s something fascinating about watching a string quartet play; the subtle glances among musicians, the real-time giving and taking and calibrating, all result in a beautiful shared creation that’s more than one person (or four) could create by themselves. (Pardon the jerky filming; I’m still trying to figure out my equipment.)</p>

 Regulation Bill, Citing Energy-intensive Nature of Crypto&nbsp;Mining <p>Key takeaways</p><blockquote>The Paraguayan president vetoed the crypto bill, which was already opposed by the National Electricity Administration (ANDE), the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), and the Paraguayan central&nbsp;bank.</blockquote><blockquote>The President’s decree cites the high electricity consumption of the crypto mining industry as a significant factor behind his decision to veto the bill, as that would impede the sustainable growth of the national industry.</blockquote><blockquote>Despite the president’s veto, the bill can still be enacted if both chambers give it the green light after it goes back to the National Congress.</blockquote><p>Mario Abdo Benítez, the president of Paraguay, has vetoed a bill that sought to legalize crypto trading and recognize crypto mining as an industrial activity.</p><p>This move comes after recommendations were made against the bill by the National Electricity Administration (ANDE), Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIC), and the Paraguayan central&nbsp;bank.</p> What now? <p>All is not over yet as the bill will be sent back to the National Congress now, where if both chambers approve it with the majority, it can still be&nbsp;enacted.</p> The Proposal <p>The bill was approved in the Senate a few months back, establishing that miners would have to apply for a license and request authorization for industrial energy consumption.</p><p>This is not an outlier requirement. In fact, it is a pretty standard practice among major crypto mining centres. For instance, Texas has made it <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/energy/2022/03/30/texas-now-requiring-crypto-miners-to-seek-approval-to-energize-before-plugging-into-grid/">mandatory for crypto miners</a> to get permits before plugging into the electric&nbsp;grid.</p><blockquote>The proposed law also called for establishing the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as the primary law enforcement authority and the Secretariat for the Prevention of Money or Asset Laundering to supervise mining investments carried out by companies. Meanwhile, the National Securities Commission would oversee how companies would manage the digital assets produced by&nbsp;mining.</blockquote> The Senate vs The President <p>While the Senate-approved bill cites low-energy costs boosting mining activities in the South American country, the President reasoned this week that crypto mining’s high electricity consumption could hinder the expansion of a sustainable national industry.</p> Considering how <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/bitcoin-mining-how-much-electricity-it-takes-and-why-people-are-worried/">1449 KWh</a> energy is required to mine one Bitcoin, the President’s nod of disapproval seems on point, especially for a country that plans to prioritize sustainable development of the national industrial activity. <p>We also came across an interesting chart that puts Bitcoin’s annual global energy consumption into perspective by pitting it against the annual energy consumption of a few countries and multinational corporations:</p><p>(Image Source)</p><p>Besides, cryptocurrency mining utilizes intensive capital with low manpower usage. As such, it would not generate added value on par with other industrial activities. Prioritizing any industrial activity that doesn’t lead to considerable employment opportunities for citizens isn’t something that will amuse the President, especially when Paraguay is among the countries with <a href="https://www.riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/rio-business/paraguay-among-countries-with-highest-unemployment-rate/">the highest unemployment rate</a>.</p> Putting National Industry&nbsp;First <p>When the Senate approved the bill in July after the Chamber of Deputies did the same a couple of months before, the Paraguayan Senate also established a 15% tax on economic activities related to crypto&nbsp;mining.‍</p><p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/Blockworks_/status/1548236740401385472">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The decree, however, saw it as an “indirect industrial incentive” to crypto because the rate applicable to crypto miners is just a small percentage above the current industrial rate.</p><p>This is a deal-breaker in the President’s eyes, especially when the industrial investment in the country went up by 220% to $319&nbsp;million.</p> Besides, the President believes incentivizing the crypto mining industry on a large scale would wreak havoc on the country’s growing industrial activity by turning the country into a net electricity importer within the next four&nbsp;years. <p>All in all, the Paraguayan President vetoed the proposed bill over concerns that legalizing crypto mining will hamper the country’s industrial activity through excessive electricity consumption. But all is not over yet, as the ball is now in the National Congress’s court. If both chambers approve the proposed bill, it can still become law. So, keep an eye on our social media channels to get regular updates on how the chapter on crypto regulations unfolds in Paraguay.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

First round: September 12–19&nbsp;2022  Second round: September 19–26&nbsp;2022  Third round: September 26 — October 3&nbsp;2022  Fourth round: October 3–10&nbsp;2022  <p>6. The airdrop will be given only to participants who successfully hold META assets for 1&nbsp;round.</p><p>7. Participants can increase the number of META assets that are held during the airdrop event, but the additional META assets will be calculated in the next round (every Monday at 00.00&nbsp;WIB).</p><p>8. The maximum number of META assets that can be calculated to be able to get an airdrop is 2,000&nbsp;META.</p><p>9. If the participant withdraws META assets before the end of a round, the amount of META assets that is calculated to get the airdrop is the lowest balance after the withdrawal based on the balance snapshot taken every&nbsp;day.</p><p>10. If the participant withdraws the TAD assets before the round is complete, then the participant is not entitled to the airdrop event prize in that&nbsp;round.</p><p>11. The committee’s decision cannot be contested.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/indodax-metadium-airdrop-event-2ddaf60a0d30">INDODAX: Metadium Airdrop Event</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Operational Technology (OT) systems encompass Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). OT environments face threats similar to those that traditional enterprise IT systems do, as well as threats unique to each type and implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ICS environments are those found in manufacturing facilities and warehouses, and may involve dedicated Human-to-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors, valves, actuators, etc. Critical Infrastructure includes regional and municipal power plants and distribution grids, water treatment plants, traffic and navigation systems, etc. IIoT devices include various sensor types, cameras, and other IP-enabled devices. Though the settings in which these systems operate and the equipment types comprising OT environments are diverse, the consequences of cyber-attacks can often be more severe than attacks against isolated corporate targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Real-life examples&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/transform/hackers-hit-norsk-hydro-ransomware-company-responded-transparency/">Ransomware attacks against manufacturing plants</a> have set back production not only in their facilities but throughout other members of their supply chains. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/notpetya-cyberattack-ukraine-russia-code-crashed-the-world/">Ransomware incidents have halted overland and overseas shipments</a> for weeks while IT teams scramble to eliminate the malware and restore from backups so that businesses can get back up and running. <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/analysis/the-five-worst-cyberattacks-against-the-power-industry-since2014/">Cyber-attacks against power generation facilities</a> have turned out the lights temporarily in some cases. <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/hospital-ransomware-health-care-data/">Ransomware attacks on hospitals</a> and other medical facilities threaten not only patient data but lives. Even <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ceser/colonial-pipeline-cyber-incident">compromises of enterprise IT systems at companies running OT</a> can have severe impacts for those companies and national economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Key components for securing industrial environments&nbsp; 
<p>It is clear that the risks of OT compromise extend far beyond the organizations that are initially impacted. KuppingerCole recently published a Market Compass on Industrial Controls Security. We identify several key components for securing these environments:&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Asset discovery – you can’t protect it if you don’t know it’s there. Asset discovery can involve active and passive methods. ICS security solutions need knowledge of a wide range of device types, identifiers, addressing schemes, and communications protocols.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>IAM – Some ICS systems leverage LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory for user, group, permissions, and administrative management. Others have rudimentary or proprietary IAM and need integration work to properly lock down access.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Event monitoring – SIEM systems have been the foundation for enterprise IT event logging and correlation. The same principle and often same solutions work in the OT world as well. Ensuring that security analysts have maximum visibility of security information in OT and ICS is crucial.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Facilities management – Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) aligned with enterprise IAM can make it easier to control access by employees and contractors to sensitive equipment and remote facilities.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Threat detection – Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) tools can identify malicious activities at the network layer that may be otherwise go undetected in ICS and OT environments. Not all assets in OT can run endpoint security agents, thus NDR may be the only solution set for uncovering malicious activities. Distributed Deception Platform tools can emulate specific types of ICS gear with an intent to lure would-be attackers away from real assets and to study their TTPs. Both NDR and DDP tools require device and protocol level understanding of ICS equipment to be effective. NDR and DDP are increasingly being packaged in eXtended Detection &amp; Response (XDR) solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Disaster recovery – comprehensive backup and restore functions and processes must be in place to more quickly get back up and running after cyberattacks. Backups need to be performed regularly, and though testing restoring from backup isn’t fun, it’s something that needs to be done as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>At the KuppingerCole Cybersecurity Leadership Summit, we’ll address topics pertinent to OT security. We’ll have a track on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/904">Building Resilience</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/1">a session on Zero Trust for OT</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5213/2">security in the energy sector</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5212/1">endpoint security for ransomware prevention and mitigation</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5212/2">securing data in IoT realms</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5216/2">strategic approaches to securing ICS environments</a>.</p>

				  We take a look at a few of the best articles on why strong digital identity will be critical as we continue to build on the internet.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2022/08/09/solution-looking-for-a-problem-digital-id-solves-a-million-of-them/?sh=4d1d6bb4fd7f&nbsp;">A Solution Looking for a Problem? Digital ID Solves a Million of&nbsp; Them</a></p>
<p>I particularly liked this article because it talks about how many products look for edge use cases to try to stay relevant or increase market share, then pivots to show how this is completely unnecessary for digital identity. David G.W. Birch, a contributor to Forbes, focuses in this article on the importance of verifying specific aspects or traits that people can claim to have, saying that for most people it’s “not about proving who you are but about proving what you are,” offering, by way of an example, a pilot who <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/british-airways-pilot-jailed-for-lying-about-his-flying-experience-on-cv-to-get-job-12578731">lied on their resume</a> and wasn’t caught until they had been flying for two years. Birch points out that while we are trying to implement effective digital identification, criminal gangs are now <a href="https://screenshot-media.com/the-future/trends/miami-gangs-identity-theft/">competing to control identity theft</a>. The answer, he says, is verifiable credentials. To make confirming identity useful to the average person, we need to build a system using verifiable credentials to show that you are a board certified doctor, or a pilot, or a police officer.Until this system is in place,most other forms of online identity are susceptible to fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202208/goodbye-physical-identities-how-organizations-can-prepare-for-digital-identity-challenges&nbsp;">Goodbye, physical identities: How organizations can prepare for digital identity challenges</a></p>
<p>Philipp Pointner, Chief of Digital Identity at Jumio, looks at the growing&nbsp; importance of digital identity and the implications for data privacy. He raises some interesting points about the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-21-govt-tech-trends-2022-press-release">increasing number of digital identity wallets</a> being offered by states and national governments, and how, with the rise in digitalization, there are more opportunities for bad actors to acquire and misuse your information. He leaves us with a few key attributes to look for in a secure digital identity system. These align with what Indicio has been advising our clients:&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decentralized system is crucial: Centralized storage systems have a history of being breached in one way or another, while decentralization removes these honeypots and allows the data to reside on a secure device the end user is in control of.</p>
<p>Make sure the end user has full control over their data: The person the information is about should have the option to share as much or as little as they choose depending on the situation.</p>
<p>The system should have robust verification tools: There must be a system in place to check and know with as much certainty as possible that the end user actually is who they are claiming to be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2022/08/30/digital-identities-will-change-the-nature-of-online-reputation/?sh=bd1f30b584a3">Digital Identities Will Change The Nature Of Online Reputation</a></p>
<p>Alastair Johnson, a contributor to&nbsp; Fobes, does a great job of explaining the difference between Web2 and Web3, as well as how identification is currently handled online and how it will need to adapt as we move forward. The biggest changes he calls out are the reduction in the reliance of third parties. Currently much of your data is stored by third parties because the internet was built without an identity layer. This article highlights how these centralized repositories&nbsp; will become redundant as verifiable credentials put control of data into the hands of the person or entity it belongs to.. Examples cited include medical information or your credit score, both of which are difficult to access, and require validation from&nbsp; a third party. Johnson concludes with a section on why giving the power back to the individual is so important: It will reduce the impact of data leaks and protect people from scammers and the malicious activity that plagues Web2 users.</p>

<p>Brute force attacks are systematic attacks that continue to attack your logins until they find the correct login information. How can you protect against this?</p>
<p>What is a brute force attack? A brute force attack is when a bot attempts to hack into your account by using trial and error in an attempt to crack your password and encryption key.</p>
 What Is a Brute Force Attack? 
<p>As the name suggests, a brute-force attack involves using computers to attempt to breach authentication systems with rapid and overwhelming trial-and-error login attempts. This approach takes advantage of relatively simple attack vectors and the general understanding that many users don’t practice good cyber hygiene. It also involves a bit of luck–attempting to attack multiple accounts can pay off if the numbers are on the side of the hacker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account takeovers via brute force methods can not only threaten that account or user but an expanded horizon of interconnected systems. Some of the expected results of a brute-force attack include:</p>
 
 Site or App Takeover: At a minimum, the breach of user credentials can result in the loss of an administrator account or some account that can provide the hacker with the ability to take over a web application or website for purposes of harvesting data or defacing the site for political or personal reasons. 
 Data Theft: If the hacker attempts to break authentication on a local file (usually encrypted), they essentially walk away with that data.&nbsp; 
 Lateral System Movement: One of the more troubling results of an account breach is that the hacker can use the credentials and access privileges of the account to attack other systems. For example, the hacker can use a compromised account to launch a malware attack on a connected cloud system. 
 Phishing: Depending on the account, the hacker can launch more compelling and dangerous phishing attacks through email, video chat, or SMS. Since the account is a legitimate account for the organization, no one would be the wiser until it was too late.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The truth is that brute force attacks aren’t widespread, if for no other reason than security experts have mitigated their attack surfaces relatively well. However, they serve as a low-level kind of hack that can catch even the most sophisticated enterprise off guard if they aren’t paying attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that a brute force attack can unveil different types of data–login names, passwords, or data hidden in password-protected files using encryption.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Brute Force Attacks? 
<p>While the tactics of a brute force attack are relatively straightforward, there are always different approaches that hackers may take to make them more effective. These different approaches can improve the win rate of their attacks in general or against specific targets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some examples of brute force attacks include:</p>
 
 Simple Attacks: In the vanilla version of a brute force attack, the hacker throws an algorithm attempting password combinations as quickly as possible. These are typically ineffective if even basic security measures and practices are in place. They can fail on any login interface where slowdown occurs (i.e., web pages that reload after every attempt). These could have more effect on local encrypted files.&nbsp; 
 Dictionary Attacks: Similar to a vanilla attack, with refinement: rather than attempting to throw combinations at the login interface, this uses a dictionary of common words, phrases, and default or used passwords. So, this attack might lead to a narrower set of words that include common dictionary words or passwords like “password” or “123456”. 
 Hybrid Attacks: The hacker uses a base dictionary to begin their attack and then builds on permutations of phrases in that dictionary with expanded brute force methods.&nbsp; 
 Reverse Brute Force Attacks: Also known in some applications as password spraying, the attack attempts to use a standard set of password permutations (either on a web login or local file authentication) across multiple files or systems. 
 Credential Stuffing: This method takes advantage of the fact that many people reuse credentials on multiple sites and files. The hacker, one having hacked one account or file, will then attempt to “stuff” those credentials across multiple eCommerce, banking, and social networking sites to gain access to other accounts.&nbsp; 
 
<p>This form of attack is older than more modern attacks, but it still has purchase in the field of hacking and security because there are always people that do not follow good cybersecurity practices.&nbsp;</p>
 Can Brute Force Attacks Break Encryption? 
<p>The short answer is that no system currently exists that can reliably break advanced encryption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the top encryption standards is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) published and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The two reliable encryption methods under AES are AES-128 and AES-256, which use a 128-bit encryption key and 256-bit encryption key, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that, in either case, it would take the most powerful computers we have longer than the universe’s age to brute force through AES-encrypted data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it’s very possible that a hacker can brute force attack an authentication method attached to an encrypted file with dictionary attacks, depending on the practices of the user who created the password for that file.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Best Practices to Prevent Brute Force Attacks? 
<p>The reason brute force attacks still have some longevity is that people still use good cyber hygiene for simplicity and ease. With some attention paid to best practices, many of the pitfalls of these hacks can be avoided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some best practices include:</p>
 
 Use Multi-Factor Authentication: Deploying <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">MFA</a> to include biometrics or SMS/email tokens and one-time passwords can effectively eliminate the threat of a brute force attack. Even if the hacker guesses the password, they cannot access the system itself.&nbsp; 
 Force Increased Password Length and Complexity: An organization can require users to employ long, complex passwords to avoid dictionary attacks. This means longer than 8-10 characters, using some minimum of letters, numbers, and special characters, and disallowing the use of common words and phrases.&nbsp; 
 Limit Login Attempts: Brute force attacks rely on systems that allow unlimited access attempts. By limiting attempts to a small number and either locking the system or requiring a cool-down period, your organization can avoid some significant issues of brute force attacks.&nbsp; 
 Require Regular Password Updates: Users should change their passwords at least once or twice a year. Furthermore, they would be disallowed from reusing the same password when updating their credentials. This can help mitigate credential stuffing and, if a hacker has gained access to an account, stop them from using it.&nbsp; 
 Use Captcha: Requiring Captcha verification using image matching or user interaction can effectively end brute force attacks against vanilla passwords.&nbsp; 
 
 Leverage Tomorrow’s Authentication Today and Avoid Brute Force Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>With modern systems, brute force threats aren’t as dangerous as they used to be. However, many companies still, to this day, don’t restrict password behaviors, don’t implement MFA, and don’t modernize their authentication infrastructure for new mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meta, formerly Facebook, has just&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/meta-posts-its-first-ever-quarterly-revenue-decline/">posted</a>&nbsp;a year over year decline in quarterly revenue for the first time since the company went public in 2007, plus an unexpected&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">36% drop in profits</a>.</p>



<p>Its second quarter financial results show a 1% decline over its results for the same time in 2021, down from&nbsp;US $29.07 billion&nbsp;to $28.82 billion.</p>



<p>This result comes hot on the heels of Facebook’s loss of daily active users in the&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/default.aspx">last quarter of 2021</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;another first for the social media giant. While those numbers are going back up, it does raise eyebrows.</p>



<p>Outgoing COO Sheryl Sandberg&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">blamed</a>&nbsp;the profit decline on the decreasing value of the Euro and the&nbsp;“weaker demand for digital advertising and the broader economic uncertainty.” Google, Twitter and Snapchat have all reported less demand for advertising because of the slowing global economy, the effects of the war in Ukraine, and the strength of the US dollar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fair enough, but we wonder&nbsp;whether Meta’s lackluster showing proves the wind has changed direction on businesses that profit from personal data?</p>



<p>We’ve been saying for a long time that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers</a>&nbsp;are sick of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">trading their privacy</a>&nbsp;for access to online services, and certainly Big Tech is facing a tougher regulatory environment. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/technology/meta-earnings-revenue-decline.html#:~:text=Meta's%20declining%20revenue%20was%20especially,and%20the%20broader%20economic%20uncertainty.">New York Times</a>&nbsp;suggests that Meta’s recent results are due to “increased regulatory scrutiny and a turbulent economy while trying to build a new frontier of digital communication.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a raft of new rules and laws to rein in — even break up — Big Tech and give consumers more control over their data. In the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/13/us-bill-to-rein-in-big-tech-backed-by-dozens-of-companies.html">United States</a>, two major bills could significantly alter how Big Tech does business and both have bipartisan support. The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/new-bipartisan-federal-data-privacy-bill-in-the-us-but-will-it-pass/">bill</a>&nbsp;we reported on in June — the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/american-data-privacy-and-protection-act-heads-for-us-house-floor/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>— has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass. The second major bill — the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-tech-antitrust-bill/">American Innovation and Choice Online Act</a>&nbsp;or “Anti-Trust Bill” — could prevent Big Tech from favoring its own businesses and give smaller companies greater market participation. This bill is reportedly making Big Tech nervous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61342576">United Kingdom</a>&nbsp;is also tackling anti-trust and greater consumer control with new rules that would see large tech companies like Facebook and Google copping huge fines of up to 10% of their global turnover if they engage in “predatory practices”. The new Digital Markets Unit (DMU) will have new compliance powers.</p>



<p>On top of this, consumer sentiment has been changing for Big Tech for some time. Facebook advertising revenue suffered from Apple’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/we-told-you-so-apples-new-privacy-changes-validate-what-weve-done-for-years/">privacy changes</a>&nbsp;designed to give users “deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late 2020, respondents in the annual Business Insider&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/resources/digital-trust-benchmark-report-preview-2021/">US Digital Trust Survey</a>&nbsp;ranked Facebook last for digital trust in protecting users’ personal information and providing a safe online environment.&nbsp;The survey evaluates how US social media users feel about the big social media platforms — Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, and YouTube — and assesses the extent to which trust affects usage and attitudes towards advertising. After Facebook, Tik Tok and Twitter ranked second and third lowest for trust. LinkedIn ranked highest.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-is-consumers-least-trusted-social-media-platform-2020-9">Business Insider</a>&nbsp;said about the results: “Digital trust is important for brands and advertisers to consider because US social users say it impacts whether they will interact with the ads they see on social platforms. Even if security scandals don’t drive users to stop using social platforms, our data indicates that the trust users have—or don’t have—in social platforms could impact their interactions with ads or sponsored content. In fact, 79% of respondents said whether a platform protects their privacy and data was either extremely or very impactful when it comes to their decision to engage with ads.”</p>



<p>We’d say that sounds like the winds have definitely changed.</p>

				 <p>You’ll be hearing much about <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> from us over the next few months. In particular, two things are driving this activity – the kickoff of work that<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrellodonnell/"> Darrell O’Donnell</a> is leading at the<a href="https://trustoverip.org/"> Trust Over IP Foundation</a> (ToIP) and the growing understanding that Trust Registries play a massive role in our future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations worldwide are waking up to the need for Trust Registries throughout their operations. Whether the need is industry-specific (e.g. healthcare, education, and finance) or internal, a new urgency is forming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;As we prepare for this push, we will share a few things to help ground your team with some solid basics.</p>
 This week we’re highlighting the ToIP <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Registry+Task+Force">Trust Registry Task Force</a>. 
<p>The Task Force is made up of several international experts who are developing a set of standards that organizations can use to integrate Trust Registries into their decentralized ecosystems.&nbsp; These standards will cover multiple issues, including how to add and remove entities, verify the Registry’s information, and keep the Registry up to date. Trust Registries will amplify trust and collaboration in the digital world by enabling individuals and organizations to verify digital assets and transactions securely.</p>
<p>The ToIP Foundation is an independent non-profit organization dedicated to improving the security and trustworthiness of the Internet. The Foundation comprises representatives from various organizations, including MasterCard, IBM, Accenture, and dozens of other digital trust experts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We welcome individuals with various backgrounds to join us and share their knowledge and expertise. If this interests you or your organization, we hope you consider joining the working group!</p>
<p>Ecosystems are evolving – quickly, and it’s time to start thinking about how we will manage trust and reputation and how Trust Registries help to anchor the trust we need in our systems.&nbsp;</p>

Huobi Research released the latest survey report “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”. It mentioned how Web3 middleware, including decentralized identity (DID), reputation systems, node services, databases, and Oracles, will solve the problems related to the inability of blockchains to be implemented, and become the “protagonists” of the next round of ecological explosion. It introduced ONT ID, ONTO Wallet, OScore, and believed that these products can promote the prosperity and development of the Web3 ecosystem.  VentureBeat, a well-known technology media, published “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/datadecisionmakers/decentralized-identity-may-be-critical-for-the-success-of-web3/">Decentralized identity may be critical for the success of Web3</a>” written by Li Jun, analyzing the reasons why DID has become the key to Web3’s&nbsp;success.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6EEMswsxwg">Benzinga Crypto</a>, a well-known YouTube channel, talking about self-sovereign identity, its opportunities and potential pitfalls, and sharing the suite of decentralized identity products that Ontology has developed.  Ontology Harbinger Geoff Richards was invited to participate in a market discussion by Huobi Research, discussing “Web3 infrastructure” and “decentralized identity components” with experts and researchers on “Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3”.  W3C published “<a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560223446620991488?s=20&amp;t=VU7LwqSAdgPTeytaf8ZXlg">With FIDO2, is a passwordless future on the horizon?</a>” related news, pointing out that the era of Web3 passwordless login has begun. The ONT Login component in Ontology ONT ID has already been built, and continues to provide a mature passwordless login mode for platforms and applications.  The Verifiable Credentials WG of W3C has published a First Public Working Draft for “<a href="https://twitter.com/w3c/status/1561704492789370880?s=20&amp;t=siQTY7W35vMLJEf4wYaa6w">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0.</a>”, The verifiable credentials used in Ontology ONT ID are also constructed based on the v1.0 version, and are currently open sourced to Web3 developers in Java and GO around the&nbsp;world.

<p>Up to $50,000 in $OCEAN are earmarked for interoperable data storage integrations with Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a>, the $2M grants program to fund entrepreneurs building open-source Web3 solutions on Ocean, launches the Data Storage Initiative. The program will support teams interested in working on decentralized data storage integrations for Ocean Protocol. With data storage features highly requested by the Ocean user community, the goal of this project is to have up to 3 new data storage technologies integrated with Ocean in production by the end of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Sheridan Johns, Ecosystem and Partnerships at Ocean Protocol&nbsp;said:</p><p>“Multiple interoperable decentralized data storage solutions will greatly enhance the overall user experience and allow for exciting new options for orchestrating and managing complex compute jobs using&nbsp;Ocean.”</p><p>Data storage grants will be issued using a request for work/feature approach where project requirements will be defined by the Ocean engineering team. A total of four individual grants with varying amounts will be awarded including a grant for building a decentralised data storage backend for Ocean as well as grants for the integration of specific data storage microservices including Filecoin, Arweave and&nbsp;StorJ.</p><p>Successful grant recipients will receive tech support and guidance from the Ocean engineering team. The grant payments will be awarded upon the successful completion and delivery of each project grant milestone. Following the successful completion of all data storage grants, feedback will be collected from project members as well as the Ocean community at large to define a versatile plugin architecture for new backend components.</p><p>Interested projects can submit their proposals for single or multiple integration(s) by completing a dedicated Shipyard application <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/decentralized_storage_backend/issues/1">form</a> and they can apply for one or multiple grants by September 17, 2022 at 4 AM UTC. Submissions will be reviewed by the Ocean engineering team and successful grant recipients will be announced by September 22nd. Work is expected to begin no later than October 1st and must be completed by December 15,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Access the Ocean GitHub issue for more information <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/decentralized_storage_backend/issues/1">here</a>.

<blockquote>The Monetary Authority of Singapore upped the ante against crypto businesses with a pretty in-depth questionnaire about their business practices and operations.</blockquote><blockquote>At the time of writing, only ten crypto companies hold digital payment licenses in Singapore.</blockquote><blockquote>Although Singapore’s crypto regulations have a strong AML &amp; CFT focus, the central bank believes more amendments are required to address the elephant in the&nbsp;room.</blockquote><p>The central bank of Singapore is asking certain digital asset firms to submit data about their business activity, reported Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the&nbsp;matter.</p><p>The questioning isn’t the first step that the MAS has taken towards reigning in the crypto industry &amp; put an end to the wild west days of the industry in the country this&nbsp;year.</p><p>According to the report, MAS asked some cryptocurrency companies for their business-related data, including the amount loaned, top lending and borrowing counterparties, top tokens owned, and top tokens staked via decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols last&nbsp;month.</p><p>It all began with the collapse of Singapore-based crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and Singapore-registered Vauld and Terraforms Labs. These instances compelled the Monetary Authority of Singapore to initiate several safeguards to protect retail customers.</p> How can This Move Affect the Broader Crypto Ecosystem? <p>These steps are significant, considering Singapore’s position in the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>The number speaks the story in&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Crunchbase, for instance, shows the presence of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/singapore-blockchain-companies">500</a> blockchain companies in Singapore, which is <a href="https://golden.com/query/cryptocurrency-companies-in-singapore-EP88">roughly similar</a> to Golden’s numbers. Now, let’s move our focus to the investment that Singapore-based blockchain companies attracted.</p><blockquote>According to KPMG, investment in Singapore’s digital asset companies surged to $1.48 billion in 2021, which is ten times the previous year and almost half the Asia pacific total for the year. These figures show Singapore’s position in the Asia Pacific and global crypto assets&nbsp;market.</blockquote><p>These figures show why more regulators may follow the Singaporean financial authority’s footsteps sooner or later, as the country is a trendsetter as far as the financial industry is concerned.</p><p>Thus, VASPs may soon have to answer a pretty detailed questionnaire about their business operations and financial resilience before granting any licenses in more countries sooner or later. Thus, VASPs must stay prepared.</p> The Questionnaire <p>Recently, MAS sent a detailed questionnaire to some applicants and holders of its Digital Payment Token Licenses. The questionnaire asks for “highly granular information” about their business activity and holdings.</p><p>The questions focus on gauging the firms’ financial soundness and their interconnectedness. MAS has further asked the firms to respond to the questionnaire promptly.</p> Working on New Regulations <p>Much like the rest of the world, Singapore is intensifying its scrutiny of crypto-related firms in the city-state ahead of planned regulatory changes.</p><p>As previously mentioned by the managing director of MAS, the financial watchdog has been working on a regulatory framework, which is expected to help address consumer protection, market conduct, and reserve backing for stablecoins.</p><p>Speaking of the country’s current crypto regulations, they are among the strongest when it comes to AML &amp; CFT, but the central bank feels that certain areas within the existing crypto regulations in Singapore require specific amendments.</p> Is Singapore Indeed as Crypto-friendly as it is Made out to&nbsp;be? <p>Well, the answer to this question can be summed up by the <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2022/yes-to-digital-asset-innovation-no-to-cryptocurrency-speculation">recent statement</a> of Mr. Ravi Menon, Managing Director, Monetary Authority of Singapore:</p><blockquote>“Yes to Digital Asset Innovation,</blockquote><blockquote>No to Cryptocurrency Speculation”</blockquote><p>This also reflects on digital payment licensing, as only a handful of approvals have been granted so far. On top of that, several crypto businesses have already either shut down or moved out after the country’s licensing regime got implemented, such as&nbsp;Binance.</p><p>______________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 In the first of a brand-new series of interviews with fintech industry insiders and thought leaders, IDnow sits down with David Gyori, CEO of Banking Reports. We discuss upcoming trends in fintech, the importance of&nbsp;multi-jurisdictional solutions, and why the current state of crypto reminds him of the 17th century tulip mania crisis. 



 As a fintech consultant and thought leader, what first attracted you to the industry, and how have you seen the world of fintech change since you first became involved?&nbsp; 



<p>So, the most beautiful thing about financial technology is that bankers and experts around the world underestimate the complexity of it. Fintech is about payments technology; new channels like augmented reality, virtual reality; all the regulatory issues, including eKYC, AML, onboarding; wealth tech, wealth management, including open banking, access to account, asset tokenization, decentralized currencies, roboadvisors, personal financial dashboards, data tech, big data, AI, machine learning, neo banks, core banking technology, and even quantum finance, which is an upcoming new arena within financial technology. So, from POS innovation to central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from video banking to virtual reality, and metaverse, it’s more diverse, more complex [than people think].&nbsp;</p>



<p>And this complexity attracted me.</p>



 You are the CEO of Banking Reports London, which provides fintech training for retail and investment banks; what types of subjects and themes are covered in the course?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>My training programs deal with strategy and tactics of digital transformation, financial technology, and emerging innovation in banking all around the world. I provide training programs to bankers in well over 50 countries face to face and online. I am always learning things myself.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What are some of the major UK and European fintech trends that we can expect in the coming few years?&nbsp; 



<p>So, the major trends will revolve around two things: one, Profitability, two, Regulatory environment. These two components will determine the next five years of financial technology. Following the 2008 crisis, there was abundant funding, there was a lot of liquidity, interest rates were low, and investors were in a growth mindset as opposed to a value-investing mindset and investors wanted companies with great growth potential. Now, with a higher interest rate and more inflationary environment, investors want prompt profit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, profit is king. Looking at the 50,000 small, nimble, flexible creative, intellectually inspiring fintech startups, we will have to be selective to find the ones that can become profitable or at least offer a potential roadmap to profitability in the short run or maximum midterm. Probably, of the 50,000 candidates, there will be around 5,000 – 15,000, the rest will go down or be acquired, or merge into potentially profitable ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the second trend, Regulation will be equally as important. Regulators are waking up, incumbent credit institutions (ie banks) are waking up and learning the name of the game. As they want to go ahead in a fully compliant, well organized, regulated, supervised way, regulators will have to up their game and create a safe and crystal-clear environment for emerging digital innovations, and this is very exciting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Good regulators now have a chance to create a global best practice environment. Some of the emerging countries now have the chance to jump ahead; to leapfrog, and to produce an environment that attracts the best companies. Others will fall behind or fall further behind. So, this is a regulatory point of division, and more than ever in the past 30 years, we need smart and visionary regulators.</p>



 How about challenges? With increasing importance placed on fintech [partly due to pandemic-induced acceleration], what are some of the dangers and challenges associated with banks and financial institutions rapidly implementing fintech and regtech solutions?&nbsp; 



<p>Regulators should focus on the areas that are valuable, that have real potential, such as CBDC, Fiat currency, as well as blockchain. Blockchain as a technology, as a distributed ledger technology is making banking safer, if applied well. So, blockchain technology has great potential for trade finance, through securities clearing, to interbank clearing, from smart contracts to registering derivatives, and even KYC-related activities. Blockchain has great potential if it is compliant and applied well, and can make banking better, more transparent, more professional, more trustworthy, safer, and more compliant, and that’s good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning from some of the key innovations in the crypto world is also a great opportunity. But, cryptocurrencies, as decentralized, haphazard, no intrinsic value, no Fiat, no sovereign-appointed value in the background are dangerous, and probably the greatest bubble ever in history. I like to compare it to the tulip seed crisis in 17th century Amsterdam, when the price of tulip seeds went up to the price of residential real estate, and then it all crashed. A reason why cryptocurrencies in their current format are non-viable is a lack of material compliance; a lack of nominal price stability by design, which is a core characteristic of money as per money in terms of payments; a lack of sovereign control over monetary supply, which is very important in certain points in history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now we are battling inflation, but there is only one thing worse than inflation – deflation. Look at the energy crisis and look at how Bitcoin is eating up countries’ energy. Look at environmental considerations and try to put it together with servers running to the fullest across the world. Material costs, real cost of transactions, not illusory, imaginary costs, but real-life costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at all the fraud cases intended, unintended, deeply criminal, somewhat criminal, gray area, black area, full of fraud, and there is something very important, which is hidden and very important – a lack of interest rate content and lack of intrinsic value. An asset lacking interest rate content can be valuable, for example, gold is an asset lacking intrinsic value that can be valuable. Think about modern currency, it has very fractional reserves in the background, basically it lacks classic intrinsic value, but throughout history, throughout monetary history, assets without any of these two – interest rate content as well as intrinsic value – have been doomed to fail. </p>



<blockquote><p>Current decentralized cryptocurrencies can be characterized by a dual lack of characteristics: interest rate content and intrinsic value. Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger are perfectly right about cryptocurrencies.</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>However, regulators still have a great chance to focus on the good areas from blockchain to CBDC, from meaningful asset tokenization to certain synthetic units of corporate settlement. So, there are still great opportunities, but in this arena, regulators themselves must be selective, and selective in a conscious, premeditated yet strategic, tactical, and programmatic way.&nbsp;</p>



 Are there any countries that could be considered more advanced in the regulation of cryptocurrency?&nbsp; 



<p>This is a difficult question because we are in the process, and regulators are now trying to work out their positions. What we do see is that in terms of certain sub areas like CBDCs, certain countries are one or two steps ahead. For example, China has done some amazing research on CBDCs, the Bank of England is doing amazing research, also the Federal Reserve, some of the South Asian countries, such as Singapore. So, in terms of CBDCs, we are already seeing some interesting and meaningful attempts, but these are baby steps. We are in the nascent stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In terms of judging regulators, we must be very careful. In fact, one of the regulatory environments I’m expecting a bright future from is the UK regulatory environment, but I am also expecting some good things to come from Brussels, from the European union. PSD 3 (Payments Services Directive) is already in the making, and the UK is going ahead on its own path. I see some very good and smart signs that they’re supporting a vivid and valuable market structure in the future.</p>



 Customer onboarding processes remain a much fought-over area of a service provider’s customer experience. How can banks balance their customers’ desire to be onboarded in the automated and digital-only manner that they have become accustomed to, with local regulatory and KYC + AML requirements?&nbsp; 



<p>So, digital onboarding is paramount. Young people want simple, straightforward, easy to understand fun, one click, instant, digital, global best practice-level onboarding experience, and when they get it, they extend this experience to the product or service. So, they will think your product and service is amazing if your onboarding process is amazing. However, when your onboarding process has friction, when your onboarding process is slow, when your onboarding process is not digital, when your onboarding process is complex, when your onboarding process is nerve-breaking, when your onboarding process is not intuitive, you know what happens? According to research, millennials extend this to your product or service, in terms of perceived quality and content. </p>



<blockquote><p>We call it the digital halo effect: extending one characteristic of a person or a group or a company or an entity or a product or service to the entire entity.&nbsp;</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>If the onboarding experience is positive your clients will become active users of your products and services and produce a positive lifetime value – they will be your profit drivers. If your onboarding experience is negative, clients, especially the young ones under the age of 35, will turn away from your products and services no matter what the quality is. Their lifetime value will be negative, and they will drive losses. So, [digital customer onboarding] is a tactical element of excellence with a strategic importance.&nbsp;</p>



 How important is it for banks to invest in multi-jurisdictional fintech and regtech solutions?&nbsp; 



<p>So, this is a unique time in terms of the relationship between regulators and regulated entities in the arena of financial services. Why? Because things are changing in such a complex, such a dynamic way. Can you remember what I said about the complexity of fintech? It’s so complex and so dynamic that regulators are actually open to discussion with mature, trustworthy, wise market players.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>You can engage with the regulators now, and hand-in-hand, the market and regulators can forge safely ahead. For this reason, we are always searching for solutions that have been proven to be safe, trustworthy, compliant, and customer and regulator-friendly in other jurisdictions, [in order] to implement them in our jurisdictions.</p> David Gyori, CEO at Banking Reports </blockquote>



<p>Multi-jurisdictional solutions are more important than ever. Regulators are learning from each other. Market players are learning from each other. We need solutions that can be used in different countries at the same time. So, there are vertical and there are horizontal arguments for multi-jurisdictional, trustworthy, stable, safe, and customer friendly, intuitive, seamless, and well-designed solutions.&nbsp;</p>



 What are some of the major issues with current KYC processes?&nbsp; 



<p>This question is very important and it’s a very smart question, because there is a shift in the paradigm of KYC processes. There is the old school, and there is the new school. The old school was face to face physical processes are safe, and digital processes are dangerous. Be very careful with digital onboarding, put additional guards there. Regulators would try to slow it down, try to tame it, try to moderate it, but there is a change in guard. There is a change in paradigm, and there is the new paradigm: eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) digital-only onboarding. The more people you include in an end-to-end digital financial services onboarding, the more transparent and safer your entire financial ecosystem will become.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, onboard, onboard, onboard, onboard, of course do it as well, and as professionally as you can. Document everything, keep GDPR, be privacy compliant, but store everything that is legal and ethical to store, make it as safe as possible, and do it 24/7/365.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do it as much as you can because the more people, the more young people, the more unbanked people, the more underbanked merchants involved in the end-to-end digital financial services, the more transparent, safer, more compliant, more professional your entire financial ecosystem will become.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This 180-degree shift in the paradigm of KYC, particularly eKYC, is very important.</p>



 What have you heard of IDnow?&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow is put together in a very smart way, and designed in a very safe, business-friendly, yet compliant and secure way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must recognize that a well-designed eKYC digital onboarding solution provides a safer identity environment than traditional channels; this is a 180-degree paradigm shift from digital being dangerous, to digital being best practice when done well. But, to do it well, you need a world class partner, and in my opinion, IDnow is one of those world class players and partners.</p>

<p>CEO fraud attacks can destroy a company’s financial and reputational future but are there any ways to protect against these attacks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is CEO fraud? CEO fraud, also called executive or whale phishing, is a type of phishing attack where a cybercriminal pretends to be a high-level executive and emails an employee requesting sensitive information, a wire transfer or login credentials.</p>
 What Is Social Engineering and Phishing? 
<p>Social engineering is using social interaction (phone calls, emails, conversations, messages) to fool individuals into parting with confidential information, including account access credentials, financial account information, and even money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earliest attacks known to cybersecurity were considered social engineering, and currently, social engineering attacks like phishing are some of the most common forms of cyber threats in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phishing is the act of using some messaging service to pretend to be another person or organization with the notion of triggering an individual to provide information. More specifically, phishing often refers to a limited set of approaches to social engineering that include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/email-phishing/">Email Phishing</a>: The most common form of attack involves attackers simply sending malicious emails to individuals. These attackers will pretend to be a prominent business, a bank’s support or fraud division, or even someone interested in working with the recipient for financial or employment purposes.<br>
<br>
These emails will most often include a call to action that involves clicking a malicious link or calling the number of a fraudulent call center.&nbsp; 
 Video and Productivity Software Phishing: As more workers rely on collaboration software and video conferencing solutions, hackers are turning to these platforms to fool their targets. Some examples of fraud have been launched using messaging capabilities on software like Microsoft Teams, Skype, or Zoom. 
 
<p>An additional aspect of this attack is the use of Voice phishing through voice or video calls… However, these are much harder to pull off and are not typical.</p>
 
 SMS Phishing: While email is almost completely ubiquitous in modern computing, another prevalent technology is SMS text messaging. Many scam outfits are turning to SMS scams to send links or phone numbers directly to users’ phones, making these messages look authentically like they come from businesses or financial institutions.&nbsp; 
 
 What Are the Prime Forms of CEO Fraud? 
<p>Many enterprise businesses make the mistake that phishing, or social engineering in general, is only successful against under-prepared employees. The understanding that executives have some purchase on avoiding social engineering attacks is demonstrably false, as we have seen with the rise of CEO fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO fraud, simply put, is a fraudulent social engineering attack against a CEO (or other C-level executives) to get them to provide access to company resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today’s digital world, there are a few forms of attack that serve as the foundation of CEO fraud:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Spear phishing is a form by which the attacker, rather than spray low-effort messages across an organization, researches higher-grade targets in management or with security access. These attacks are more likely to succeed because they will come with the convincing language, convincing the target of the legitimacy of the attack.&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/bec-attack/">Business Email Compromise (BEC)</a>: Another way to easily navigate a company’s messaging system is to compromise a user’s account and masquerade as a company member. This allows the hacker to bypass email screening systems and present more convincing phishing messages to employees and executives who, upon seeing an email from the company domain, will immediately trust it.<br>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/executive-phishing/">Executive Whaling</a>: The evolved form of spear phishing,<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/"> executive whaling</a> is the process of researching the top-level executives of an organization to gather information on their habits, corporate structure, employee structure, interests, and daily routines.<br>
<br>
The hackers can use this knowledge to launch messaging attacks posing as, for example, internal financial managers who request wire transfers for thousands of dollars.  
 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">Executive whaling</a> isn’t limited to email and often comes through advanced platforms where an executive may not expect an attack (such as video conferencing or productivity software).&nbsp;</p>
 How Can I Prevent CEO Fraud? 
<p>While no organization has airtight security, it’s still possible to slow down or eliminate CEO fraud by addressing the issues that lead to organization access. Some ways to address fraud include:</p>
 
 Use Strict Authentication Controls: You must have strong authentication to prevent attacks. Biometrics, liveness testing, and identity proofing can all go a very long way towards cutting out low-level breaches that often lead to larger instances of CEO fraud. 
 Educate Executives About Fraud: We’ve already stressed that executives aren’t above falling for phishing attacks. Therefore, your security and compliance teams must put forward training and awareness materials for the C-suite to better understand how vulnerable they are if they ignore potential instances of fraud.&nbsp; 
 Run Phishing Simulations: Security experts regularly run penetration tests and vulnerability scans to ascertain the strength of a system’s defense measures. A good test to run is to throw out phishing simulations, organized and operated by your internal IT team, to help expose weaknesses in the organization and raise awareness about solid cyber hygiene. 
 Use Inbound Email Security: Simple and easy, IT managers can deploy software that filters out a blocklist of external domains or only allows a safelist of emails to enter employees’ inboxes. Furthermore, email systems can be set up to raise visual alerts on emails coming from external sources–-while this doesn’t eliminate the problem but can raise warning bells for employees.&nbsp;

<p>a new plural economic&nbsp;system</p><p>Economy is a form of human interaction; a process where debts are moved between two or more people that emerged from a simple gift and barter system around the Bronze Age (4000–2500 BCE). Societies developed notation systems using markings on clay tablets, papyrus, and other materials to account for crops, livestock, and land in order to keep administrative track of objects ready for&nbsp;use.</p><p>In 1758 the French economist François Quesnay wrote “Tableau économique” (Economic Table), regarded as one of the first works attempting to describe the economy in an analytical way. Quesnay was a great inspiration for Adam Smith, often known as “The Father of Economics”, whose ideas of free markets and ‘the invisible hand’ created the foundation for the modern economy. The system was based on a few key principles; trust among actors individually and across the system as a whole, fairness and common measurements of cost, risk and&nbsp;value.</p><p>Over time, further distinctions within the field of economics have been established: positive economics (what is), normative economics (what ought to be), economic theory, applied economics, rational economics, behavioural economics, mainstream economics, heterodox economics. Today we have a market economy, an accumulation of specific assumptions generated through history, often based on patriarchy and&nbsp;power.</p><p>But somewhere in the creation of the economic infrastructure, something went wrong. We reduced a complex system to one simple measurement — price. Our environment, ancestry, memories and relationships are all deeply valuable, live at the heart of our existence, and shape our daily decisions — yet our mechanisms of understanding and operationalising such value are extremely reductive. We need to recognise entanglement and diverse values beyond the abstraction of&nbsp;price.</p><p>It’s hard to identify trust, care, generosity, fairness or collaboration within today’s global economy. Humans evolved as fundamentally social creatures, unable to survive, nevermind thrive, without the collective support of our fellow humans. Imagining any alternative economy needs to consider interdependencies as a starting point, not as an afterthought.</p><p>We need to reinvigorate stagnated ways of looking, thinking and talking about the economy. The economy is based on growth, and is often explored through the lens of monetary structures, or through a lens of individuality, based on possessions and egocentricity, but there’s a much larger system, way beyond our notion of ownership, and we want to start radically new dialogues about this shared&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Could we establish an alternative market economy, one that is structured around a distinct set of principles centred on care, trust, generosity, the importance of collective intelligence and deep sets of relationships; what would fall away and what would remain in&nbsp;place?</p><p>Would growth matter? And if so, what kinds of growth could we differentiate from simple linear, “more is better”&nbsp;growth?</p><p>Would money be essential? If not, what alternative forms of value could we imagine might make more sense to build&nbsp;around?</p><p>How can we more clearly see our entanglement of all natural life and find our purpose within&nbsp;it?</p><p>Current features</p><p>We see failures manifest in the world because of the way capital is distributed, structured, governed and deployed. While delving into current economic structures and existing markets, we can identify a few key problematic features;</p><p>Central control — Capital is structured to be centrally controlled; all decisions around capital are thus disconnected from the needs of communities and the world. For example, in Switzerland, <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/ch/pdf/clarity-on-performance-of-swiss-private-banks-2021.pdf">95% of new money</a> is generated through private banks, individuals and organisations with close proximity to this capital creation are hugely privileged, both in terms of decision-making power and in reaping its extractive rewards. More widely, actors across countries in the global north exert their proximity to power when assigning value to supply chains to generate financial profits and growth, often causing ecological and societal&nbsp;damage.</p><p>Exclusion — Various intersectional communities are being systematically excluded from all forms of capital, from VC to impact to debt to equity. How could all individuals participate in alternative forms of capital? Do the terms of access need to change or does the structure of capital itself have to undergo a transformation in order to meet the core requirements of these communities?</p><p>Mistrust — Markets are based on the concept of mistrust: thus embedded silos between market actors, extensive legal agreements and the presence of intermediaries that control the flow of information. Banks are an example of this market failure: starting as a place of safekeeping of money, they have quickly evolved their business models to take advantage of siloed information that allows them to profit from the difference between established risk (based on the information they are privy to) and value (based on the information they are provided by their clients). However, there is a larger discussion to have about trust, genuine trust versus a forced trust. A genuine trust is created with deep personal connections while the forced trust we tend to see today is one where citizens via technology and institutions are forced to trust due to a lack of alternatives.</p><p>Prices &amp; values — Markets are structured around one single variable — price, and measured around one output — economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>The consequences for human dynamics and relationships due to these features are seriously harming life. We see an acute, global and growing inequality. We see climate breakdown all over a planet whose biosphere is suffering. We see wars and political traumas. We see health and mental health issues and a younger generation with severe climate&nbsp;anxiety.</p><p>Instead of trusting, we have developed a need to control. All interactions are based on a power dynamic instead of deep care and a desire to be generous. We have further developed a need to feel superior as a way of feeling worthy. This basic and natural need for recognition from others is deeply embedded in the economic system and our place within it. Finally, we have developed a need for efficiency to reach fullness. In most economic models monetary growth is inserted as the goal, often on a compressed time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>What would happen if money was spread more equitably in&nbsp;society?</p><p>Why are we so focused on perpetual monetary expansion?</p><p>What if growth was not the ultimate&nbsp;outcome?</p><p>What if capital would be structured and governed from a place of vulnerability and&nbsp;care?</p><p>What would terms of trust look like in an updated&nbsp;economy?</p><p>What are the notions a gift economy can bring to an updated&nbsp;system?</p><p>Who decides the exchange values between resources and how are they operating?</p><p>Coralus — A story of radical generosity</p><p>In 2015, hundreds of women in Canada helped co-design SheEO (now called <a href="https://coralus.sheeo.world/">Coralus</a>) — an organisation designed to radically disrupt a capital system for women-led innovative impact companies to thrive. At the time only 3% of venture capital and 4% of bank loans went to women and non-binary individuals. Over the past 7 years their collective purpose has also grown — from funding women entrepreneurs to shifting mindsets, decolonizing communities, rooting in Indigenous wisdom and racial justice, and using their power to build equitable systems. How have some of the questions we raised above been answered and explored in Coralus’s cosmos?</p><p>In summer 2021 a team from <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> started to explore new types of economic systems with a core group from Coralus. The main purpose was to more deeply understand an organisation that was testing and implementing new economic ideas. Together, we dived into what it means to be part of a new economic system, interviewing with community members who were gifting their capital as well as loan recipients. From there, we synthesised the learnings by mapping and creating illustrations, as well as <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z4jPY9-QbpJNCyEZ3hyNrK6fJZNQ72QtulBWgh9q23M/edit">writing and analysing</a> all learnings and experiences. The focus was to understand Coralus core values (radical generosity, abundance, co-creation and transformation) in relation to global societal economic systems and to imagine the outlines of what a much needed change could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Coralus is founded on a few key principles;</p><p>Paradigm — through radical generosity where power and resources are more equitably shared, and the interests of stakeholders are aligned, not in competition. This is explored through practices embodied across all the organisational operations through learning circles on mindset, systems, finance and ventures, workshops, mindset blogs and the cornerstone practice of Ask/Give. The structure and feeling of a caring and strong community has been what many within the organisation values the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Purpose of capital — Venture funding is directed to businesses that serve the world’s greatest needs and addressing the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals by creating a life sustaining planet. All activators contribute with capital as a gift and expect no capital return. This gift is placed in a perpetual flow, a fund, that organically exists as a parallel system to the social&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Capital distribution — Equitable allocation changes both where capital goes and the funding terms of how it is deployed: women-identifying entrepreneurs are funded through non-extractive capital, globally. The funded ventures are selected through a democratised voting process and the capital is lent through a non-extractive 0% interest loan. All ventures meet together to create a strong shared feeling of purpose and goal as a group. Activators participate in alternative economies through two pathways: they mentor an enterprise and/or they fund&nbsp;it.</p><p>Access to network — Each woman activates the change agent inside themselves through a diverse community. These networks are built on trust and are committed to sharing power, not accumulating it. Via regular community calls and gatherings anyone can practice asking and get help if needed. The online community and the Ask-Give platform is a crucial node where challenges and opportunities are solved collaboratively. There is a focus made on deep relationship building with communities normally put at the margins. Through learning programs, indigenous wisdom and racial justice are given a place at the centre stage. The vital reciprocity between activators and ventures is showing a way to a new economy fully based on caring relationships.</p><p>Coralus seems to truly shift ideas on funding capital through their approach to gifts. They have mutually understood the importance of unlearning the power notions attached to money investment and keep their full focus on the outcomes and measurements of the impacts created. By participating in a community like Coralus both activators and ventures seem to be immensely aligned; the enormous value of the caring network is what makes Coralus stand out. Many mention the inner transformation they have undertaken since joining the community as a powerful learning, a transformation that hasn’t only changed themselves but that has laid the foundation for important relationships being created. They have also had a large concrete impact on the environment; according to their 2021 report, ventures have reported impacting 16 of the 17 UN <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a>. A venture like <a href="https://www.loliware.com/technology">Loliware</a> has for example created a solution and a new technology to create plastic-like materials from seaweed for straws, cups, plates, etc. In addition ventures averaged 432% revenue growth since starting with Coralus for a combined reported approximately $52M in&nbsp;revenue.</p>The Shell image of Coralus (formerly SheEO) — its organisation, flow and community cosmos made by Dark Matter&nbsp;Labs.<p>Inspiring pathways</p><p>If we discuss and look into an alternative economy, there are a few approaches that could unlock the current system and there are organisations who have looked into the key problematic features in our current economic system mentioned above.</p>  We see intermediaries that are decentralised; capital is structured at community level through collective intelligence, skills and knowledge. As an alternative, local currencies decentralise power and encourage financial circulation within a localised environment. For example, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf875d9a-5be6-11e5-a28b-50226830d644">Sardex</a>, Sardinia’s first local money in a form of credit which is not subject to speculative bubbles and is sustainable as it doesn’t allow the members of the credit circuit to go too much into debt, to buy products, and generate an auction effect. This makes the local economy more resilient against shocks of future financial crises. They can also foster broader, more democratic, contextualised understandings of&nbsp;value.  Value of capital and economy has moved away from being fully monetary focused, to being based on the value of humans and communities with equal gifting for everyone at its epicentre. Coralus’s venture <a href="https://thealinker.ca/products/the-alinker-rent-to-own">ALinker</a> is a Canadian example where an LGBTQ founder and a fierce advocate for transforming the sick care system creatively constructs democratic ‘rent to own’&nbsp;methods.  All information is open source; there are no artificial or private barriers keeping citizens away from trust and empathy. For example, the start-up <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf">Everledger</a>, based on blockchain technology, which establishes a digital ‘passport’ for each diamond to combat criminal activities within the industry. It provides transparency that builds trust between sellers and buyers as well as clamping down on the trade in illegal diamonds through a record of provenance, travel, and transactions of each diamond with a unique cryptographic ‘fingerprint’.  The economic realm of markets, industry and technology is ultimately inseparable from ethics with the deliberation and application of our ideals of what is right, good, desirable and beautiful. In short, the economic and the ethical meet in an intricate question of value. <a href="https://www.stockholm50.report/">Replacing GDP as the single metric</a> to measure progress and instead focus on indicators that take “inclusive wealth” and the caring economy into account. For example, <a href="https://www.regen.network/">Regen Network</a> (a global community and platform focused on ecological monitoring and regeneration) aims to catalyse the regeneration of ecosystems through pricing ecosystem services and spillover values (such as clean water, Co2 sequestration, and biodiversity) produced by regenerative farmers. The price of potatoes should never be their “use price” but the broader social and environmental values they bring through regenerative practices. Even though pricing ecosystem services could potentially respond to environmental degradation, there is also a need to move beyond&nbsp;pricing.  Coralus’s structure.<p>Next steps</p><p>If we aim at discussing the economy more broadly, we need to incorporate the “invisible” or “non-monetary” economy; the system of economies embedded within a monetary economy that undertakes tasks that benefit society by means that the monetary economy does not value including household labour, caregiving, civic activity or even friends helping for each&nbsp;other.</p><p>We need to establish the true cost of items, not the fabricated prices we meet as consumers. Our current prices rarely include negative externalities (costs that are suffered by a third party as a consequence of an economic transaction, like pollution, stress, climate change). And even if we do charge negative externalities, pricing an externality doesn’t mean that it goes away. It is only beneficial from a utility standpoint.</p><p>For a long term sustainable society we need to rethink costs in relation to human suffering. But just like discussing post-growth economic systems, degrowth or decoupling, we enter a vulnerable, emotional space where economists, politicians, researchers and designers often get&nbsp;stuck.</p><p>Emotions are in symbiosis with the economy. Emotions seem to decide what we buy, how we spend our money and where we see capital to be needed. But equally, economies can rule our emotions through constructed identifications, by calming existential questions and creating frameworks for everyday lives. We are left questioning the ways our economies are linked to stress, fear of being lonely or muting internal lack of satisfaction.</p><p>Can organisations like Coralus be concrete and powerful inspirations that impact an outside world? How can they keep the influential, small and caring community feeling they’ve established when growing? How do they sit in a larger societal system that still is heavily based on continuous monetary growth? These questions are not raised here to be fully answered, but rather to be discussed and to create economic hope for future generations. There is a clear formula of regenerative capital and collective intelligence within the Coralus organisation that needs to be further studied, tested and explored. The radical generosity that is spread among the activators and ventures could be seen in relation to our shared social dialogues about deep care and a different future. We need to unveil a new plural economic system where a beautiful growth within humans, around humans and for all living things, is the&nbsp;core.</p><p>Research and blog by Jenny Grettve — jenny@darkmatterlabs.org, Fang-Jui Chang — fang@darkmatterlabs.org, Anastasia Mourogova — anastasia@darkmatterlabs.org, Danielle Cadhit — danielle@coralus.world among&nbsp;others.</p><p>Link to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yckfxum2">cases of alternative economies</a> made by DML for the deeper research mentioned in the&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/radical-generosity-8063d9edc3aa">Radical generosity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thank you for joining us. Today, we are going to hear from an expert in identity about – how from the perspective of, let’s say regular people, most of the people, who are not involved in the identity industry, how much they understand the identity, the methods, the technology and everything that we in this industry are building. So, we’re going to talk about how we can make identity easy for everyone.</p>
<p>For that, our guest is Heather Flanagan. She is Principal at Spherical Cow Consulting, and Choreographer for Identity Flash Mob. She comes from a position that the Internet is led by people powered by words and inspired by technology. She has been involved in leadership roles with some of the most technical, volunteer-driven organisations on the internet, including <a href="https://idpro.org/">IDPro</a> as Principal Editor, the IETF, the IAB as RFC Series Editor, ICANN as Technical Writer just to name a few. Hello, Heather.</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Nice having you.</p>
<p>Heather: Thank you. It’s great to be here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. This is going to be super fun talking about how to make identity easy for everyone. Let’s see how our conversation goes. So yeah, let’s get started, let’s talk about digital identity. First, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, please tell us your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, you know, very few people actually decide that “You know, digital identity, that’s going to be my career.” In my case, I have a liberal arts degree as a history major, and a library science degree for my master’s degree. I mean, I was supposed to be a librarian when I grew up. But as is often the case, once the person falls into tech, everything ends up touching on digital identity.</p>
<p>So immediately after university, I ended up working for the public research division of a newspaper that was just starting up an ISP. So, this was the mid ’90s, there weren’t a lot of experienced tech people to hire. And that ISP started hiring people who, you know, are you smart? Are you logical? Can you learn from a book? And there, as a sysadmin, I had to worry about creating user accounts and making sure that those users were able to access what they were allowed to on a system and only what they were allowed to on a system.</p>
<p>When I left the ISP, I went to work for a large software company where again, the fundamental reason for even having an infrastructure IT team was to make sure that people could access what they needed to across all the different computers. And this kind of pattern of you come in, you’re working on the infrastructure for an organisation, and it all boils down to do people have access to what they need? Is their identity set up properly so that it can do what it has to do online? That pattern just kept repeating for as long as I had any job that included operational responsibilities.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you were supposed to be a librarian, you said. And then you are– in the mid ’90s, the beginning of the commercial internet, helping these ISPs, right? Internet Service Providers, so actually it’s a term that not many people use these days, you know, it’s like ISP is taken for granted, right? It used to be a big thing at that time.</p>
<p>Heather: It was. It was. The ’90s was a heck of a time. There were so few people who actually had computer science degrees. I think in the team I worked with, there was me as the librarian. I had Political Science majors, French majors, English majors, Math majors, I think we might have had one Computer Science person and he left early on because he could. And yet the diversity of that team was outstanding.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow! Sounds very nice. And it looked like you just continued that path, making more step and you never came back. Yeah, fantastic, fantastic, the projects you’re working nowadays, and I know that at least in Identity Flash Mob we work a lot. Yeah, trying to make identity and other tech concepts understandable, easy to understand for everyone. So, I’d like to jump in and ask you how do you explain what digital identity is for a young person, someone who just entered, a college let’s say.</p>
<p>Heather: So, actually wrote a blog post on that topic on the Identity Flash Mob website called <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/2021/09/27/wait-you-mean-digital-identity-is-an-entire-industry/">What is digital identity (and why should you care)?</a> It’s interesting if you think about explaining this to a freshman in college, versus say how you would explain it to your mom. Because one of them is born digital, right? They’ve never lived in a world that didn’t have an aspect of them online.</p>
<p>And yet, I don’t think I would explain it too differently to either them if they actually asked. I mean, on the one hand, digital identity is the representation of you online. It’s your online access to your banks and your credit cards. It’s your account to your email provider. It’s your presence on social media. It’s your electronic information with your government. It’s your browsing history. It’s the details of your smartphone. It’s where your computing devices are in physical relation to others.</p>
<p>Just like different things make up your personal human identity, brown hair, blue eyes, a lot of different things make up your digital identity. And not everyone has the same characteristics. You may not have a smartphone, or you may not have a social media account, but you almost certainly have some other things that come together to make up what a digital identity is. So, it’s, I think, that kind of explanation, hopefully, bridges all different kinds of demographics, in terms of how techy someone is or isn’t, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what have been the faces after you give that answer?</p>
<p>Heather: Usually, minds start to explode a little bit because it’s a lot. There’s a field of psychology to try and understand the human mind and that field has been around for a while and it’s really complicated, and people get doctorates in it. Digital identity is actually also really complicated. As soon as you start pulling it apart to try and understand it, you realise that there’s a lot there to unpack.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’re still in early days, and unlike the field of psychology, we don’t have quite the massive of knowledge and understanding and research that has gone into it yet to make it something that you can study. There’s very few schools out there that actually have courses on understanding digital identity or managing digital identity or being careful with digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And yeah, you know what, it doesn’t happen often to me, at least, that someone, someone who is not in the industry asked me, “OK, what is digital identity?” It’s not that common. But the ones who, for instance, when I give an answer, you have given this answer, it was a really good answer, simple answer, that’s pretty good. So, some people get an idea of that. But beyond that, it’s good to understand what are the consequences, right, of having this reasonable understanding about digital identity for an– yeah, regular person. So, what could be the worst consequences of not really understanding enough the identity for regular people?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, that’s a good question. And then I’m glad you qualified it with understanding enough because no one’s going to understand everything, you just have to understand enough. Because computers are absolutely everywhere in governments, in banks, in schools, in businesses, everybody has a digital identity. And if you don’t understand that, you don’t even know that you have to protect it. And if you don’t protect it, then people can impersonate you, to do all sorts of things. That’s something that we call identity theft.</p>
<p>There’s a big insurance company in the US called Allstate Insurance. They did a study a few years back and found it took over six months to recover from identity theft. Experian, which is a great big credit agency said that it can even take years, you know, six months might be optimistic. So, if you don’t understand that you have a digital identity, that just because you may not have a smartphone or you don’t have a Facebook account, you still do have a presence that you need to take into account and need to think about how to protect.</p>
<p>For me, that’s like the biggest single consequence. It’s the lack of awareness that it’s something that you need to protect just like you need to protect your birth certificate or your passport, or the keys to your house.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, exactly. Yeah. As you put it in concrete and visual examples, yeah, people the key, or the key for your passport, something that you would have it on your pocket very close to you. And if you would lose that, you definitely would feel like “Oh, I’m in big trouble, or I will be in big trouble if that happens.” So, the same way everybody should feel if there is a chance of losing the identity, well, not losing but someone takes over, there is identity theft.</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah, it’s hard to get back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly six months in some cases, or you say that’s, that’s a lot. What can you do in six months without a digital identity, at least for the most relevant identities that you have, such as the government identity, for instance. Also going into the worst scenario, the worst consequences of not understanding well digital identity, but now the perspective of people who are directly and indirectly building digital services and this can be people, for instance, working in start-ups, in the government, in the health care. They are not necessarily the developers, the technical people but they are working, they are part of the extended team that are building these services. So, what can be the worst consequences of, again, these extended on to people who are working if they don’t understand well?</p>
<p>Heather: So, we just said that people suffer when their digital identity is stolen. But you know, businesses do, too. I was moderating a webinar just yesterday, where the speaker, Tim Cappalli from Microsoft said, “Attackers don’t break in, they log in.” That means, like the majority attacks against businesses come through attackers just logging in, using stolen account information.</p>
<p>If a business doesn’t have a handle on their identity and access management services, and the best practices for the security in that space, they’re going to lose so much money to fraud, just even more money to cyber-attacks. I mean, businesses often think of their IT infrastructure as being this cost centre, because it’s not what’s directly making the money. But wow, messing up that infrastructure can put a company right out of business, or at least put a serious dent into their net worth.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely, as you said, data breaches or just fix something, it can have a huge impact not only financial, but also in, well, reputation, et cetera, et cetera. And how do you see if, again, I ask you the extended people who work building these services, how much do you feel that an average project manager, an average designer is aware about digital identity?</p>
<p>Heather: Usually not very. I mean, this comes back to it’s not like digital identity is as taught as a separate thing, right? In a way, it’s almost when you’re working with computers, it’s almost like air, because it’s just there. Of course, you have to log in, of course, you have to have an account. You hear about having to have strong passwords and all these other things. And so actually understanding that it is more complicated than that, and that there are good reasons for it to be, it’s not as common as it should be. Certainly, otherwise, we wouldn’t be losing all this money to fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, indeed. So, there’s a lot of work for us, the ones who are working in the industry to keep educating, right? Making it easy also to understand that’s super important, and I know you work very hard into that.</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, the identity industry isn’t making it easy, necessarily. So, there is always that to consider too.</p>
<p>Oscar: If– so where the– if you see the identity industry where the identity industries is failing to make itself understood?</p>
<p>Heather: Oh, I have a list. So, let’s start with like one of the questions you asked earlier about, OK, how would you define digital identity? I gave you, my definition. But if you get 10 identity professionals in a room and ask them, you’re probably going to get at least 15 different answers. I mean, that’s among professionals already in this space. So now, imagine how hard it is for people, not in the space to get a handle on what their digital identity is and how to manage it. The terminology used in the industry is imprecise. The standards that we’re developing are incomplete. They’re inconsistently used. And it’s just how we communicate with the rest of the world’s big problem.</p>
<p>I’ll give you another example. Passwords. Let’s just talk about passwords. If you talk to any identity professional, they will agree that passwords are one of the biggest, possibly the biggest challenge facing the industry. So how are we solving it? There’s password complexity rules, password reuse rules, passphrase suggestions, password manager guidance, passwordless guidance, multifactor authentication using authenticator apps, multifactor authentication using biometric data, multifactor authentication using SMS codes, all of these options, all these different guidance, how’s the user suppose to understand all that? When they’re going from one site to the next to the next and they’re just being mentally pummelled with all these different options? How are they supposed to know what the best practice is? What are they supposed to be doing to protect their identity if they’re getting such an inconsistent story, just on the most basic aspect of logging in?</p>
<p>Every site is implementing things differently. A regular user doesn’t know if that’s the current best practice or not. And to be fair, practitioners can barely keep up with it themselves because the identity industry at this point, it’s not just sending mixed messages. We’re just sending white noise and static to our users, because it’s just all over the place. That’s a huge failing on our part.</p>
<p>Oscar: Ah, yeah, yeah. That’s cool in many people’s ear, I believe. Yes, it’s true. So, the way you say it, so if 15 different identity professionals answer the same questions, all of them understand very well the concept, the problems, but yeah, the answer will be different. So that already tells a lot.</p>
<p>Yeah, I would like to hear if there are, there must be, there must be good examples of projects or initiatives that have – well, intentionally or unintentionally have been making identity much more understandable for everyone. So, if you can share some success stories about how projects initially have educated about digital identity.</p>
<p>Heather: So yeah, I definitely have some favourites here. Though I want to preface that educating people about digital identity is hard, because often people don’t want it to be hard, so they don’t want to know about how complicated it is. And that, that makes it a bit challenging to offer education. But that said, I love what I see coming out of the <a href="https://internetsafetylabs.org/about-us/">Internet Safety Labs</a>, that was previously known as the Me2B Alliance, they’ve turned into an independent software product testing organisation. And that focuses on online safety standards that company can actually quantitatively measure their software against to see if they’re really offering a safe online experience.</p>
<p>I’m also a huge fan of the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a>. And the work they’re doing to finally move the world away from passwords in a way that’s very easy for the end user to understand and respond to. But that said, I see those as success stories that influence the business side of things, on behalf of users, but still, it’s very business oriented, which is great.</p>
<p>But I also want to highlight those groups that are actually– they’re actually getting out there on Instagram, and TikTok to get useful information about digital identity in front of regular people where they hang out every day. So, I mean, that’s something I’m trying to do through Identity Flash Mob, which is a passion project for me. But another one that I’d point to is the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thecybersecurityhub/">Cyber Security Hub</a>. I find their posts on Instagram hilarious and absolutely spot on. And they’re reaching over 343,000 people on Instagram with those posts.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, so definitely have to check it out. Was it Cyber Security Hub?</p>
<p>Heather: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: And of course, your project Identity Flash Mob. So, you’re already on TikTok?</p>
<p>Heather: I tried to do TikTok, I’m not very good at it. I’m much better at Instagram.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right. Each one of course has their own strengths. Yeah, yeah. I’m not in TikTok either. I have to definitely keep following the work you are doing. But tell me a bit more what you’re doing in Identity Flash Mob now that we are in this point?</p>
<p>Heather: So what I’m trying to do there is, as you say, make the information about identity and security and standards, basically how technology works a bit more consumable to people like my mother, or my friend, Laura, Laura Paglione, who’s partnering with me on this, you know, make it something that her daughter would find interesting enough to actually stop and read. And that means getting the information into accurate and consumable, almost sound bites, you know, very, very short pieces and in front of them where it goes.</p>
<p>We do write blog posts, because blog posts helped me organise my thoughts as to how I want to present an idea to the users. And a lot of the posts offer what can you do in five minutes, in 15 minutes, in 30 minutes to learn more about the space? And also, the regular posting on Instagram just to get ideas and thoughts out there to people?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I checked your website and definitely it’s super interesting. I read a few of your articles, and excellent job that you are doing there. And yeah, I’ll keep following. Yeah, that’s super interesting for me I was– every time I have the well, the responsibility to give a talk or some, yeah, writing blog, for instance, writing blog posts, I also like, to the best possible effort to make it very easy to understand and to connect with something that people are familiar. So, it is super important, as we are seeing after how this conversation is going really, it’s – that’s a lot to do, yeah, on that aspect.</p>
<p>And now, I’d like to hear more about your work in those standard organisations. And you have been working as a technical writer, editor, et cetera, also leading projects there. Yeah. Tell me about this, this work you’ve been doing writing the standards.</p>
<p>Heather: So, standards development is one of my favourite things. So, a bit about standards, right, is that standards exist to make it so things can actually interoperate. The fact that you can send an email from your mail app, and have it received across the world to someone in India, with a completely different mail app is actually a miracle of standards, you know, that that functions all the way through. I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to get people involved in those kinds of efforts. And it needs all different kinds of people.</p>
<p>I don’t write standards. I’m not that kind of technical. But I’m really good at reading them and offering feedback or helping with the process or helping facilitate the calls. Whatever is needed to help the engineers write what they need to write is how I participate. So, there’s rooms for lots of different kinds of smart, a lot of different kinds of technical, it’s not just system engineers and what they can do.</p>
<p>So, I was the Publisher the Executive Oversight for Publishing Internet Standards for eight years through the Internet Engineering Task Force, and I got to watch a lot of that work being done and help the groups actually get their words out and published to the world. It was very exciting. And it’s also very hard, because one of the biggest challenges that the whole standards development process has, is that to actually achieve interoperable standards, you have to get people from different backgrounds to help write review, test the proposed standards to see if they meet the needs that they are written to address.</p>
<p>I mean, as it stands today, even though there’s companies that sort of donate their people’s time, nobody actually has a full-time job saying, I am a standard writer, right? They work for a company, they have other things they have to do, their “day job”. So, it’s always the best effort really, in terms of are the right people in the room? Or is there enough diversity in the room? And so far, they’re just huge diversity gaps there.</p>
<p>I think most standards or organisations have some kind of diversity effort on the books. But it’s hard to attract new people, when you already have a strong culture in place that itself isn’t attractive to diverse participants. It can be done, but it’s pretty slow going. I think I’ve had it easier, in a way because I embrace the fact that I’m really good at organising people and organising processes. And that was a space that the specification writers themselves didn’t want to do. And so, it was easy to just slot in and say I can help you with this stuff that you don’t want to do. And it made for very good give and take to get things out the door.</p>
<p>But I think other folks may find it a little bit more challenging, because the thing I hear constantly is I’m not technical enough to do that. You use a computer, you can turn it on, you can offer what’s your experience? What did you find easy? What did you find hard? That right there is useful information for spec writers to know.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I understand the challenge of as you said, most of the people who are writing these standards, well are squeezing their time, right, to work on those projects. Yeah, it’s one, among other tasks of their day job for most of these people. That is correct. And it’s already challenging. So, you have mentioned the challenging in finding diversity, if you can explain a bit more in what about geographically, what about which aspect of diversity are not so well right now, let’s say.</p>
<p>Heather: All of them. There’s the geographic diversity. I mean, if you look at the demographics of who’s attending something like an <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> meeting, it’s mostly US and Europe, and then China and India, but it quickly drops off, right? They try and address this by moving the meeting around. So, you’ll have North America, then you’ll have Europe, then you’ll have Asia, right, to try and get it at least proximate to the geography of who will actually attend. But that’s just one thing.</p>
<p>There’s also gender, tech is notoriously driven by a male dominated field. There’s also age, one of the bigger concerns is the fact that people who write standards are usually more at the tail end of their career, as opposed to the beginning of their career. And so, it’s a group that’s aging out. And not a lot of young folks come into it at all. Often, their company says, “Well, you’re too junior to participate in that.” which is unfortunate. So really, pretty much every dimension has a lack when it comes to diversity.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, you would encourage as you just said now, for instance, one person who is relatively young, and so the boss or someone the company says, “You don’t have enough experience to do that.” So, we need to challenge that, right?</p>
<p>Heather Flanagan: We do. I think of it this way. I mean, the argument I would make is, by the time someone is at the end of their career and coming in and everything that you know, they have very strong opinions, and that’s great, but we’re leaving the junior staff to relearn all our mistakes. Because they’re going to go through this learning process, and they won’t understand the history of why did something develop the way it did. And because they don’t understand it, they’re going to reinvent the same problems. And maybe they’ll solve them slightly differently.</p>
<p>But wouldn’t it be better if we could jumpstart them and say, “OK, this is what we did. This is why we did it. This is you know, how we did it.” But condense that so that earlier on in their career they can say, “OK, I understand what was tried before and why it didn’t work. Now let’s really think new things.” That would be a wonderful thing to see happen.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed. Yeah, I hope people who are listening to this episode are – have some curiosity to… so what happened in someone who is right now listening to this podcast say, “OK, maybe I can try it.” So, whom they should contact to, in order to try participating one of these organisations, what are the best way to – whom to contact or how to get started?</p>
<p>Heather: So, the first thing to do, I guess, is to narrow down into at least a little bit into well, what kind of thing, what are you most interested in? Right? And you could actually just post on Twitter or post on LinkedIn or something like that and just do an outreach saying, “I want to help with the standards process, how do I do it?” And see what kind of answer you get, see what’s open.</p>
<p>For organisations like the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, they have… oh, goodness, I don’t know how many working groups, we’ll easily say at least 100, possibly more. And you can just look through them and say, “OK, this sounds interesting.” And its public knowledge, well, who’s… you know, what kind of documents is that group working on? Read them, and you’ll know who their authors are. You’ll have their contact information. You’ll have the contact information of the working group Chairs, and you can reach out to them and say, “I’m interested in helping, what can I do?” And sure, that they will be so happy. So happy to hear that there’s interest in that space.</p>
<p>Oscar: That’s great, definitely. I have only once for a couple of years, I participated in Kantara Initiative, definitely, a colleague suggested me to join for a while and it was super nice, definitely. So yeah, actually, anyone who has not participated in any of these standard organisations, yeah, please follow Heather’s advice. Just find something that’s interesting for you and contact them. Because it’s very important, it’s very important for all of us not only to ship the standards, but that process of making everything more and more understandable.</p>
<p>So super interesting conversation with you, Heather. Now, a final question is for all business leaders who are listening now in this conversation, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Heather: OK. So, I knew you’re going to ask this, and I gave it some thought. And what I would love to see happen, and I think would actually be fun. You need to strengthen your identity and access management, you need to strengthen that function in your organisation to the point that your marketing team, your finance team, your management team, your dev teams, all understand what digital identity means in your company, and why it’s so important to protect.</p>
<p>And I’m talking about getting creative about it. Not like having an online training course that says, “Make sure that your passwords are 16 characters long, it contains the following.” No, no, that’s not what I mean. I want you to encourage study groups. I want you to create a game day, where you have teams that include representatives from every department acting out a response to an incident involving an identity related security issue.</p>
<p>So, the marketing person would– they would be tagged to figure out what is the communication message that you have to send. The finance person would have to figure out what would the cost of this be? The development person would have to figure out how to research and close whatever vulnerability was used in the system. And that’s not just going to help your company. It’ll actually help your people protect themselves everyday online. So, and I think it could kind of be fun to do.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like it. It sounds definitely fun. So yeah, digital identity can be fun. So, it’s a great idea that you are suggesting to organise a game. So, well, thanks a lot for that. It was super interesting. And again, I commend you for all the work you are doing in <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/">Identity Flash Mob</a> and all the standard organisations. So, for people who would like to continue this conversation with you, Heather, or find more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you?</p>
<p>Heather: So, you can always find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hlflanagan/">LinkedIn</a>, I’m fairly active there. You can do me a huge favour and follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/identityflashmob/">Identity Flash Mob on Instagram</a>, which is always great. Or, you can go to the <a href="https://www.identityflashmob.com/">identityflashmob.com</a> website and just read about what we’re doing and it will give you a few ways to contact us there too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot, Heather. And all the best.</p>
<p>Heather: Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Historically, there has been a disconnect between what security engineers see as risks or threats and how these risks are perceived by business leaders. FAIR STRIDE is a novel approach to driving strategic initiatives with business-relevant application threat models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikko Hyppönen pointed this out concisely during his keynote at RMISC 2019 by stating: “In security, when we do our jobs right, nothing happens.” In reality, this is not the case, but we have to observe the situation through a lens that can bring a security program’s value to light. In the scope of application security, the disconnect happens when security engineers express the impact of vulnerabilities on systems and applications, rather than their impact on the business itself.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>On the one hand, an application security team enables the business to sell trustworthy products, usually by fulfilling compliance frameworks like SOC2 or ISO 27001. On the other hand, when security teams do their jobs right they prevent monetary losses from being inflicted on the company without slowing down the business.</p>

				  A must-attend interoperability event for anyone developing decentralized identity solutions using Hyperledger Aries.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>Join us on August 31, 2022, when Hyperledger Aries will host its first virtual, interactive interoperability event. The Hyperledger Aries Interopathon will give teams across the verifiable credentials community the opportunity to test how well their products and solutions interoperate. As previous <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-cardea-interop-a-thon-returns-and-heres-why-you-should-participate/">interopathons</a> have shown, this is an invaluable opportunity to find out if you need to fix anything.</p>
<p>The maintainers of Hyperledger Aries will provide a test environment that&nbsp; includes Issuer, Mobile, Mediator, and Verifier Agents for participants to test against.</p>
<p>Participants will also be able to use the Test Harness — an automated way to connect two agents — and learn more about it, as well as offer feedback to improve the system.</p>
<p>If you would like to bring your own Hyperledger Indy network you are also welcome to do so.</p>
<p>The goal is to discover what needs to be done to ensure that all Aries projects are interoperable. Anyone interested in simply observing is also encouraged to attend!</p>
<p>Why is it important?</p>
<p>Interoperability drives adoption. The more verifiable credentials can be used across multiple projects and ecosystems, the more they will be valued and the more they will be used. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>This event will help developers&nbsp; remove obstacles to interoperability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Who is this event for?</p>
<p>This event is aimed at developers, but anyone interested in decentralized identity is welcome to join.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in actively participating will need to be able to make a connection between agents using DIDComm connection V1 or Out of Band.</p>
<p>What will I take away from it?</p>
<p>Participants will leave with an understanding of where the gaps are in their interoperability, and hopefully an idea of where to begin fixing these gaps.</p>
<p>For anyone in attendance this will be an excellent opportunity to make connections, learn more about what it takes to achieve interoperability, and see some of the interesting projects that are in the works!</p>
<p>Where can I register?</p>

You can even log in with your Google and Apple accounts as&nbsp;well.</p><p>This concept is called Bring Your Own Identity (BYOI or BYO Identity):</p>  A form of digital authentication in which an end user’s username and password is managed by a third&nbsp;party.  The approach leverages Single-Sign On (SSO) technology to make authentication more simple and convenient for&nbsp;users.  <p>It’s also beneficial for companies since it allows visitors to quickly register using their existing credentials. An improved sign-on experience can result in as much as a <a href="https://medium.com/@XTOPOLY/user-experience-ux-is-more-than-just-a-trending-topic-for-all-brands-b3ef1b2f591b">45% increase in customer registrations.</a></p><p>The simplicity of BYO Identity means businesses convert more of their website visitors into customers instead of losing them when they’re asked to create a new&nbsp;account.</p><p>But there are drawbacks as&nbsp;well:</p>  Many users worry they’re trading convenience for privacy. Every time you log in to a third-party website using Facebook or Google, they gain access to your data and leverage it to sell&nbsp;ads.  It’s not the most secure authentication method. Anybody can create a social media account, but these companies don’t verify your attributes. So, using social identities to log in to third-parties means companies can’t be 100% certain about the identity of their customers.  <p>Even with these concerns, BYO Identity is a step in the right direction towards a future where interoperable and portable identities are commonplace.</p><p>There is a real opportunity to combine technology that is being developed with the concept of BYO Identity that will create a new identity framework where you own and control your&nbsp;data.</p>  By creating an account with an identity service provider who leverages verifiable credentials technology, you will confirm your attributes are real, and companies will rest easy knowing you’re identifying yourself truthfully.  Your identity will be decentralized, not federated. Identity service providers like GlobaliD don’t have access to your data, so they can’t store it. You’ll be able to browse, log in and transact without your data being leveraged by Big&nbsp;Tech.  This makes the process of identity convenient, and portable. In the future, many identity companies will be built on this decentralized approach using verifiable credentials. Rather than being stuck with a certain provider or platform, you’ll be able to easily transfer your identity from one service provider to&nbsp;another.  <p>If you’d like to learn more about our current BYO identity tools for individuals and businesses, like our Digital ID Wallet or Global Onboarding, visit our website or contact our sales&nbsp;team.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.

<p>Today, when one of your products or services catches a customer’s attention, their first thought is, “Where can I buy this online?” Your digital channels have become the primary touchpoint for establishing new customer relationships, and it’s crucial to make a good first impression if you want those relationships to flourish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, it’s all too easy to stumble at that first hurdle. If you force customers to go through a multi-step process to register and log in before they complete their purchase, then every step will sap their energy and give them an opportunity to reconsider their purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you don’t do enough due diligence to confirm your customer’s identity, you’re making it easy for fraudsters to take advantage of your business—and potentially putting genuine customers at risk of account takeover and identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like a catch-22 for customer experience—a lose-lose choice between friction and fraud. However, there is another way. The right customer identity and access management (CIAM) strategy can help you steer a safe course to secure, stress-free customer experiences.</p>

  <p>For years the Okta OIDC SDK was the primary tool mobile developers used to integrate their apps with Okta, but as with all things in life, entropy takes its toll. Over time, as platforms and languages change, or new features become available, a refactor is required. Today we’re proud to announce that the Okta Mobile SDKs for Swift and Kotlin are now available!</p>

<p>Recent advances at Okta, such as support for Device Single Sign On (SSO), the Device Authorization Grant (used in most streaming smart TV apps, or devices without a browser), and most especially the Okta Identity Engine (OIE), have proved difficult to integrate into the aging OIDC SDK. We realized it was time for something new. As a result, for the past few months, we’ve been hard at work developing our next-generation SDK targeting native and mobile environments across Apple and Android platforms.</p>

<p>These SDKs take a whole new approach to authentication that goes beyond simple browser-based sign in (also known as the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow). We took a modular approach to assembling the SDK; you choose to include only the components needed to build your applications. This architecture enables leaner builds and puts more power and flexibility into your hands. It also opens the doors to integration with other SDKs, such as the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) using the Okta Identity Experience (IDX) SDK.</p>

 Why replace our current SDKs? 

<p>First, I’d like to explain why we chose to replace our current mobile SDKs. We didn’t make this decision lightly, but several reasons made it the best choice:</p>

 
   Okta OIDC for iOS and Android is built upon an aging code base, which was difficult to maintain, and didn’t follow modern mobile best practices. 
   The OIDC libraries are focused on web-based authentication, which introduces overhead when native sign-in is used. 
   Targeting mobile and desktop applications limits the possibility of extending to other platforms, such as smart watches, TVs, or app extensions. 
   The OIDC libraries assume that only one set of tokens will be used at a time. This assumption prevents developers from supporting multiple users within an app, or multiple tokens for different app extensions or security scopes. 
 

<p>These are some of the key reasons why we chose to make a fresh start, focusing on convenience and ease of use. Our goal is to unblock advanced use cases that were previously impossible.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve seen our rationale for refactoring, let’s take a look at the architecture and philosophy behind the new Okta Mobile SDK.</p>

 Welcome to the new Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>We had several goals when designing the new SDK:</p>

 
   Improve the developer experience and streamline the developer onboarding process 
   Eliminate technical debt 
   Move from a monolithic architecture to a modular one 
   Unlock advanced features and scenarios with flexible extension points 
   Support new Okta platform features 
 

<p>These goals helped shape the architecture for our SDKs, from the high-level capabilities down to the naming of individual functions.</p>

<p>Note: Since I’m predominately a Swift engineer I’ll be using examples from the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift">Okta Mobile SDK for Swift</a>, though everything discussed here also works within our <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-kotlin">Okta Mobile SDK for Kotlin</a>.</p>

 A walk through the new developer experience 

<blockquote>
  <p>“Make the easy things easy, and the hard things possible” – Larry Wall</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main feature of this SDK is a streamlined developer experience, above and beyond all else. We focused on the ergonomics of the APIs a developer would use, making sure they make sense, and are consistent with other similar types.</p>

<p>We set ourselves a “1-line-to-integrate” goal for all of our primary scenarios. This means that you should be able to sign in or out with a single line of code. Additionally, the code you write shouldn’t be throw-away. Simple solutions should be able to grow into more complex ones, without requiring a completely different approach.</p>

<p>This is further improved by modularizing the SDK into smaller libraries that complement one another. Simple high-level APIs make certain features easy to use, yet still expose lower-level details that let you customize or control the SDK’s behavior.</p>

 Modularized architecture 

<p>Many of the original problems we faced with maintaining the OIDC SDKs stemmed from their monolithic architecture. This also prevented us from properly being able to integrate Okta IDX into applications, since there was no convenient way to store tokens created from IDX within the OIDC SDK.</p>

<p>As a result, we broke the new SDK into three libraries, each building upon one another: AuthFoundation, OktaOAuth2, and WebAuthenticationUI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This structure gives us several advantages:</p>

 
   By having clear lines of separation, it forces us to establish clean API contracts between dependent classes. 
   Applications only need to import the libraries necessary to get their job done, keeping runtime app sizes leaner. 
   Additional SDKs (such as Okta IDX) now have a foundation to build upon, and can enable different tools to work together. 
 

<p>Each library has its own areas of responsibility:</p>

 AuthFoundation 

<p>This library is the lowest-level and provides common features required for all authentication-related operations.</p>

 
   Generic OAuth 2 API client interface 
   Token storage &amp; validation 
   JWT parsing &amp; validation 
   Keychain/Keystore support 
   Conveniences and utilities needed by other SDKs 
 

 OktaOAuth2 

<p>This library implements all the primary OAuth 2 flows supported by Okta, including:</p>

 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/#request-for-tokens">Authorization Code Flow</a> (used by web-based OIDC) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/ropassword/main/#about-the-resource-owner-password-grant">Resource Owner Password Flow</a> (simple username/password) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Token Exchange Flow</a> (used to implement Device SSO) 
   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/device-authorization-grant/main/">Device Authorization Flow</a> (used for devices without a browser and/or keyboard) 
   Session Token Flow (used to integrate with Okta’s classic Native Authentication SDK) 
 

<p>In addition to these flows, the OktaOAuth2 library includes all the utilities and delegate protocols/interfaces necessary to customize each flow’s behavior.</p>

 WebAuthenticationUI 

<p>When your app uses web-based OIDC authentication, this library coordinates with the system’s browser to ensure a safe and secure embedded authentication experience. Since it is built upon the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/authorizationcodeflow">AuthorizationCodeFlow</a> class from OktaOAuth2, those lower-level classes are exposed to you, allowing extensive customization of the process if your application has specific requirements.</p>

<p>By separating this logic into its own library, your app can choose not to include this library if you use a non-web authentication process, removing unnecessary overhead.</p>

 OktaIdx 

<p>When your app uses the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) to natively authenticate your users, the IDX SDK (included separately in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-swift">okta-idx-swift</a> and <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-idx-android">okta-idx-android</a> repositories) now properly integrates within this SDK using AuthFoundation. The Okta IDX SDK also follows similar patterns as OktaOAuth2, by providing the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-idx-swift/development/oktaidx/documentation/oktaidx/interactioncodeflow">InteractionCodeFlow</a> class.</p>

 Flexible extension points 

<p>The customizations and low-level capabilities described above are examples of the extension points we proactively built into the SDK. For many key decisions within the SDK, these steps are customizable either through the use of delegation, or via wholesale replacement of the SDK defaults.</p>

<p>You can override everything, from the way ID token validation occurs to how tokens are securely stored, or your app can accept the out-of-the-box defaults.</p>

 Support for new Okta features 

<p>As Okta continues to innovate, introducing new features and capabilities, our mobile SDKs need to update to take advantage of them. By refactoring these SDKs, we aim to make it as easy as possible for you to adopt new features, which has been our primary motivation. Let’s take a look at a few of the more exciting features we now support.</p>

<p>Many platform features center around support for new authentication flows. Classic web-based sign-in, through OIDC, is implemented using the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow. Instead of locking this functionality away, we’ve exposed it, along with our new flows. We tried our best to follow similar patterns for all <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/introductiontoauthenticationflows">authentication flows</a>, to reduce a lot of the guesswork necessary to get a feature to work.</p>

 Benefits of the new Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>As mentioned above, our aim has been to do more than build parity functionality with the legacy OIDC SDKs. We wanted to unlock amazing new capabilities while simultaneously simplifying your developer experience. So let’s take a look at a few of the improvements we’ve made.</p>

 Simplified web-based authentication 

<p>Signing in with a web browser using OIDC should be a straightforward process, and it is the easiest way to get started using Okta in a mobile application. And yet, we felt we could make it even easier.</p>

<p>Just like within Okta OIDC, the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui">WebAuthenticationUI</a> library is capable of using a configuration file named <code>Okta.plist</code> to define your client settings. From there, you can sign into your application using a single line of code.</p>

   <code>// Sign in using the default configuration
let token = try await WebAuthentication.shared?.signIn(from: view.window)

// Save the user's token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>The <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/webauthentication/shared">shared property</a> simplifies how to create a <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/webauthentication">WebAuthentication</a> instance, but if you want direct control of the configuration, you can simply create one in code.</p>

   <code>let auth = WebAuthentication(
    issuer: URL(string: "https://dev-133337.okta.com"),
    clientId: "0oa1234567890abcdefg",
    scopes: "openid profile email offline_access",
    redirectUri: URL(string: "myapp://login"),
    logoutRedirectUri: URL(string: "myapp://logout"),
    additionalParameters: ["idp": idpName])

// Sign in using the above configuration
let token = try await auth.signIn(from: view.window)

// Save the user's tokens
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>Depending on your application’s needs, there are many ways to configure your client. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/webauthenticationui/documentation/webauthenticationui/configuringyourclient">documentation on Configuring Your Client</a> for more information.</p>

 Device Authorization Grant 

<p>This is an OAuth 2.0 flow meant for use with headless devices, kiosks, or for clients that have limited text input. The prime example for this is a tvOS application running on the Apple TV. In this flow, a user is presented with a code they enter on a different device (a mobile phone, laptop computer, etc.) and finish logging in on the second device.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The above screenshot comes directly from the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift/tree/master/Samples/DeviceAuthSignIn">DeviceAuthSignIn sample</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift">okta-mobile-swift GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>To implement this in your own application, simply use the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/deviceauthorizationflow">DeviceAuthorizationFlow</a> from the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/">OktaOAuth2 library</a>, and try the following code:</p>

   <code>// Uses the client configuration in an Okta.plist
// configuration file
let flow = DeviceAuthorizationFlow()

// Get the code to display to the user
let context = try await flow.start()
showCodeToUser(context)

// Poll the server, waiting for a successful login
let token = try await flow.resume(with: context)

// Save the user's tokens
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>All the details for how authentication occurs, including the polling process, error handling, and other considerations, are handled for you.</p>

 Device SSO (aka Token Exchange Flow) 

<p>We’re excited about the ability to perform single sign-on across a suite of apps on the same device, or across separate app extensions within the same app. We’ve <a>discussed this feature before on the Okta developer blog</a>, but the amount of code necessary to implement device SSO had been prohibitive to developers who wanted to try this feature.</p>

<p>So with the new <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/oktaoauth2/documentation/oktaoauth2/tokenexchangeflow">TokenExchangeFlow</a> we’ve drastically simplified the process, reducing it to just a single line of code.</p>

   <code>// Create the flow, using the Okta.plist configuration
let flow = TokenExchangeFlow()

// Exchange the ID and Device tokens for access tokens.
let token = try await flow.start(with: [
    .actor(type: .deviceSecret, value: deviceToken),
    .subject(type: .idToken, value: idToken)
])

// Save the user's token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)
</code>   

<p>Once you’ve authenticated a user with the <code>device_sso</code> scope, Okta will return both an ID Token and Device Secret in the token response. If you save this in a secure location accessible to all your apps (for example, in a Keychain within a shared App Group), you can supply those strings to the TokenExchangeFlow class.</p>

 Improved token storage and biometric support 

<p>Like the Okta OIDC SDK, the new Swift SDK uses the Apple Keychain to securely store tokens. With the new <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/store(_:tags:security:)">Credential.store</a> function however, more options are available to you at the time you store a token. Security settings or developer-assigned tags can optionally be supplied to customize how those tokens will be stored.</p>

   <code>// Accept defaults
try Credential.store(token)

// Assign tags to later retrieve specific tokens
try Credential.store(token, tags: ["tag": "value"])

// Share the token between an app's extensions
try Credential.store(token, security: [
    .accessGroup("com.myapp.access-group")
])

// Secure the token with biometrics, and require
// the device to be unlocked
try Credential.store(token, security: [
    .accessibility(.unlocked),
    .accessControl(.biometryAny)
])
</code>   

<p>The tags option can be used to help manage the tokens stored in the keychain, which helps when your app works with multiple tokens or accounts. This is a feature I’m very excited about, due to the advanced use cases it unlocks. Let’s dig into that in the next section.</p>

 Supporting multiple tokens / users 

<p>We now support storing multiple tokens or user accounts in a single application. This is a big improvement over the legacy Okta OIDC SDK, which made the assumption that an app would only ever have a single user at a time. Storing multiple tokens helps you create more sophisticated apps, such as:</p>

 
   Multi-user applications that allow users to quickly switch between profiles 
   Applications that utilize app extensions, or widgets that wish to use separate tokens for each extension, for security reasons 
   Apps that use separate tokens with different scopes for escalated access 
 

<p>For a host of reasons, the AuthFoundation library now supports the storage and use of multiple tokens simultaneously, while still supporting traditional single-user applications via the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/default"><code>Credential.default</code></a> property.</p>

   <code>// Retrieve the credential created when storing a token
let credential = try Credential.store(token)

// Load the default credential
let credential = Credential.default

// Load a credential with a unique ID
let credential = try Credential.with(id: savedTokenId)

// Find all credentials matching a given tag
let credentials = try Credential.find(where: { metadata in
    metadata.tags["purpose"] == "background"
})

// Find all credentials containing ID token claims
let credentials = try Credential.find(where: { metadata in
    metadata.subject == userId
})
</code>   

 Simplified Keychain handling 

<p>Since secure token storage makes extensive use of the Apple Keychain, the AuthFoundation library provides a convenient <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/keychain">Keychain helper</a> to simplify keychain operations. We made it public to simplify the way shared secrets can be stored and still remain accessible to your other apps or extensions. For example, when saving the device secret necessary to implement TokenExchangeFlow, you can use the Keychain utility to save these secrets in a way that’s accessible to your other applications.</p>

   <code>if let deviceSecret = credential.token.deviceSecret,
   let idToken = credential.token.idToken
{
    try Keychain.Item(account: "ssoSecret",
                      accessGroup: "com.myapp.shared",
                      value: deviceSecret).save()
    try Keychain.Item(account: "ssoToken",
                      accessGroup: "com.myapp.shared",
                      value: idToken).save()
}
</code>   

<p>Later, retrieving these values can be an equally straightforward operation.</p>

   <code>if let secretData = try? Keychain.Search(account: "ssoSecret").get(),
   let secretToken = try? Keychain.Search(account: "ssoToken").get(),
   let ssoSecret = String(data: secretData, encoding: .utf8),
   let ssoToken = String(data: secretData, encoding: .utf8)
{
    // Exchange the tokens using TokenExchangeFlow
}
</code>   

 Outgoing request authorization 

<p>Ultimately, developers use the Okta Mobile SDK in order to securely access resources on a server somewhere. Your users authenticate using their credentials, and your application can use the resulting tokens to perform network requests on their behalf.</p>

<p>Since this is such a common operation, we decided to improve the developer experience by streamlining the process.</p>

   <code>let url = URL(string: "https://api.example.com/notes")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.httpBody = jsonBody

// Add appropriate HTTP authorization headers,
// automatically refreshing the token if needed.
await credential.authorize(&amp;request)

let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared
    .data(for: request)
</code>   

<p>When using the Swift Concurrency <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/authorize(_:)"><code>Credential.authorize()</code></a> async function, this will automatically refresh the credential’s access token if it’s expired, and add the appropriate HTTP authorization header to the request object. If you’re not using Swift Concurrency, the same thing can be accomplished with the <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/refreshifneeded(graceinterval:completion:)"><code>refreshIfNeeded(graceInterval:completion:)</code></a> and <a href="https://okta.github.io/okta-mobile-swift/development/authfoundation/documentation/authfoundation/credential/authorize(request:)"><code>authorize(request:)</code></a> functions.</p>

 Get started using the Okta Mobile SDK 

<p>The goal of these updates is to make it easier to build safer apps, while using native platform features to their fullest. To help you get started, here are a few suggestions of how you can take advantage of the new features in this SDK.</p>

 
   Support multiple users in your application, with fast switching between accounts. 
   Add app extensions to your app, using Device SSO to create unique tokens for each extension. 
   Use Device SSO to sign your user in across a suite of apps. 
   Create different tokens for your user with different scopes, one of which is stored behind biometrics, to support escalated permissions within your app (e.g. requiring Face ID to perform a bank transaction). 
   Build Apple TV or command-line applications that can use the Device Authorization grant to support convenient MFA sign-in securely. 
   Streamline your workflow to simplify authorizing network requests to your own server APIs, while keeping your tokens refreshed. 
 

<p>Check out the repositories on GitHub to get started. These repos have several <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift/tree/master/Samples">sample applications</a> that demonstrate the features outlined in this article. The README and API documentation referenced from the repositories is a great way to learn more about these new features.</p>

             Scheltema, Marktsteeg 1 Leiden, THE NETHERLANDS 
      
             <p>Despite legislation such as GDPR, people have lost the right to use and control their data, which is leading to growing resistance to data being collected and stored in central silos. At the same time, there is a paradigm shift from the centralised handling of data to a decentralised approach.</p>

<p>Together with the highly popular De Nieuwe Wereld YouTube channel, we will be recording a talk show called 'High time for a new data economy: from centralised to decentralised' on 5 October. Philosopher Ad Verbrugge will be discussing this topic with experts including Ruben Verborgh (professor of decentralised web technology), Mladen Sancanin (director of innovation, data services and research at PGGM), and Robert Reinder Nederhoed (blockchain entrepreneur).</p>

<p>The talk show will be recorded at Scheltema, Marktsteeg 1 in Leiden, the Netherlands.</p>

<p>This is your chance to be in the audience for the live recording session. Places are limited, however, so if you are interested in attending please let us know by email by latest 28 September:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.innopay.com/aanmelden">www.innopay.com/aanmelden.</a></p>

<p>Please note: The talk show will be held in Dutch.</p>

   Schrems II und seine Bedeutung für den Schutz von Kundendaten und den internationalen Datentransfer 

<p>Kundinnen und Kunden interessieren sich vermehrt dafür, wie genau ihre Daten verwaltet, geschützt und verwendet werden. Beim Thema Sicherheit und Datenschutz geht es nicht mehr nur darum, gesetzliche Vorgaben einzuhalten, sondern darum, das Vertrauen der Kund*innen zu gewinnen und sie so langfristig zu binden. Dieses steigende Bewusstsein war auch einer der Gründe für die Datenschutz-Bewegung unter der Führung von Maximilian Schrems, der 2015 und 2020 die Rechtmäßigkeit der Weitergabe seiner in Irland von Facebook gespeicherten persönlichen Daten an die Firmenzentrale in den USA infrage stellte.</p>
	
<p>Schrems argumentierte, dass bei Datenübermittlungen zwischen den beiden Ländern seine persönlichen Daten nicht adäquat geschützt seien und demnach das Risiko bestünde, dass seine Daten abgefangen und die Bestimmungen der Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) sowie des Privacy Shield Frameworks verletzt würden. Das aus seiner Klage entstandene Urteil Schrems II schreibt nun vor, dass Unternehmen und Serviceanbieter mithilfe angemessener Kontrollen die Sicherheit und den Schutz von Kundendaten gewährleisten müssen.</p>
	
 Internationaler Datentransfer als wichtiger Faktor für das Unternehmenswachstum 
	
<p>In einer Zeit, in der über 65&nbsp;% der Unternehmen Daten außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR) übermitteln, wird diese Thematik sehr schnell zu einem weltweiten Problem, das Unternehmen in verschiedensten Regionen betrifft. Wenn Unternehmen Daten lokalisieren müssen, werden sie in ihrem Unternehmenswachstum ausgebremst. Außerdem haben sie Probleme beim Einsatz von globalen Drittanbieter-Technologien, die ihnen einen Wettbewerbsvorteil verschaffen sollen. Doch es gibt auch gute Nachrichten: Die USA und die EU haben kürzlich bekanntgegeben, dass sie an einer Vereinbarung für ein Transatlantic Data Privacy Framework arbeiten. Was aber können Unternehmen schon heute tun, um die Daten ihrer Kund*innen besser zu schützen und auch für künftige Datenschutzvorschriften gewappnet zu sein&nbsp;– natürlich ohne negative Auswirkungen auf ihr Geschäft?</p>
	
 Für die Zukunft gerüstet: Höhere Kundensicherheit dank moderner CIAM-Funktionen 
	
<p>Die Identität Ihres Unternehmens ist seine Visitenkarte: Sie formt den ersten Eindruck, den Kund*innen von Ihrem Unternehmen gewinnen. Wie schützen wir unsere Daten und wo speichern wir sie? Hier die richtigen Entscheidungen zu treffen, ist heute wichtiger denn je. Gerade in Anbetracht eines Ökosystems, das sich immer mehr in Richtung Cloud und hybride IT entwickelt, stellt sich unweigerlich die Frage, wo Identitätsdaten gespeichert werden sollen.</p>
	
<p>Um persönliche Daten ausreichend zu schützen, müssen Unternehmen einen mehrschichtigen Sicherheitsansatz verfolgen. Dieser beginnt mit einer robusten Customer Identity and Access Management-Plattform (CIAM), die es ihnen ermöglicht Daten in der Region ihrer Wahl zu verwalten, zu speichern und zu schützen. Der Markt bietet aktuell verschiedene CIAM-Lösungen, doch die meisten bringen nicht das erforderliche Design und die nötige Architektur mit, um auch auf künftige Datenschutzvorschriften reagieren zu können.</p>
	
<p>Wie also kann eine moderne CIAM-Architektur Sie bei der Einhaltung von Datenschutzvorschriften unterstützen?</p>
	
  Sicherheit und Datenschutz von Grund auf mitgedacht: Moderne CIAM-Lösungen, die als SaaS bereitgestellt werden, werden von Anfang an für Sicherheit, Datenschutz und Datensouveränität konzipiert. Die sorgen dafür, dass in der Cloud gespeicherte Daten geschützt werden, jederzeit verfügbar sind und von andern Kundendaten (oder Tenants) getrennt sind. So minimieren Sie das Risiko einer Datenschutzverletzung und bieten Schutz vor unberechtigtem Zugriff. Außerdem können Sie mithilfe moderner CIAM-Lösungen Zugriffskonfigurationen und Berechtigungen bereitstellen, die minimale Zugriffsrechte für Ihre Identitätsdaten durchsetzen. 
   Regionale Datenisolierung: Moderne CIAM-Lösungen bieten Ihnen eine Auswahl weltweit verteilter Rechenzentren und überzeugen mit der für Ihr Unternehmenswachstum so wichtigen Zuverlässigkeit, Performance und Skalierbarkeit. Sie ermöglichen außerdem die Isolation der Datenresidenz innerhalb der von Ihnen gewünschten Region(en), damit Sie die vor Ort geltenden Datenschutz- und Datenresidenzbestimmungen einhalten und zugleich Ihr Unternehmenswachstum voranbringen können. 
   Datenschutz während der Speicherung und des Transfers: Die Verschlüsselung Ihrer Kundendaten innerhalb Ihrer On-Premise-Infrastruktur ist heute Standard. Doch sobald Sie in die Cloud wechseln, müssen Sie sicherstellen, dass die Daten sowohl während der Speicherung als auch während der Übermittlung mit kryptografischen Standard-Technologien verschlüsselt sind. Moderne CIAM-Lösungen, die Identitätsdaten in der Cloud isolieren, minimieren den sogenannten „Nosy-Neighbor-Effekt” und das Risiko, dass andere Kund*innen und Dritte sich böswillig Zugriff auf Ihre Identitätsdaten verschaffen. Damit werden auch Kontoübernahme-Angriffe unwahrscheinlicher. 
 <p>Die ForgeRock Identity Cloud bietet von Grund auf Sicherheit und Datenschutz dank vollständiger Tenant-Isolation, Datensouveränität mit regionaler Isolation und einer zuverlässigen Datenverschlüsselung, die sicherstellt, dass Ihre Daten sowohl während der Speicherung als auch während des internationalen Datentransfers gemäß den Vorgaben des Schrems-II-Urteils geschützt sind. So können Sie regulatorische Risiken sowie Kosten für die Nichteinhaltung von Vorschriften minimieren, die Daten Ihrer Kund*innen optimal schützen und so ihr Vertrauen gewinnen. Ihre Kund*innen verdienen höchste Sicherheit. Erfahren Sie noch heute, wie ForgeRock Sie dabei unterstützen kann.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Zero Trust is undoubtedly one of the hottest buzzwords in the IT industry. The idea that just by following a set of simple principles an organization can dramatically reduce the complexity of its IT infrastructure and significantly improve its security posture and resilience to cyberattacks is, of course, extremely appealing to everyone. Unfortunately, even the companies highly motivated to adopt Zero Trust as their new strategy are often struggling even with the initial steps.</p>
<p>If KuppingerCole analysts got a dollar every time we had to tell someone: “sorry, but you cannot buy Zero Trust”, we could probably all have retired early, but alas, most customers are not content with that response and would rather look for more practical recommendations. This is especially true in times when Zero Trust is sometimes presented as the only way to solve massive business-relevant problems, like quickly enabling your entire workforce to work from home because of a lockdown or protecting your business from destructive ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>The beauty of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/zero-trust" title="Zero Trust Principles">Zero Trust principles</a> is in their simplicity and universality: after all, it’s just a set of several basic rules that an organization has to follow, which don’t go into technical details and are thus understandable even for non-technical stakeholders. “Never trust, always verify”, “only allow as much access as necessary”, and “monitor all activities” – that’s basically the whole of Zero Trust in a nutshell. But how do you translate them into specific technical solutions?</p>
 Prerequisites for Zero Trust 
<p>Well, first of all, there is no single solution that can implement it across your entire IT environment, from devices and data stores to network infrastructure and cloud platforms to applications and SaaS services. Vendors can help you with the right building blocks and general guidance, but all the critical strategic decisions have to be made by you because nobody else knows your risks, challenges, and priorities. There are however certain prerequisites that you must have in place before even starting to invest into Zero Trust products.</p>
<p>Start by applying Zero Trust to Zero Trust itself! Do not trust product labels and vendor claims – make sure that you always verify that their solutions actually deliver the promised capabilities and don’t have hidden limitations. You should also have an inventory of the security and other tools you already have to ensure that you do not invest into unnecessary duplication of existing functionality. And, of course, you should define your long-term strategy but make sure you can deliver regular quick wins, or your management will inevitably turn Zero Trust into Zero Budget…</p>
<p>At an even more basic level, the magic formula for every Zero Trust architecture is</p>
<p>Zero Trust = Strong Identity + Full Visibility + Policy Enforcement</p>
<p>The latter component is the trickiest one to implement consistently and with full coverage, but the former two you should already have in place. A robust, modern and extensible IAM system is a basic foundation not just for Zero Trust, but for any digital enterprise, and trying to implement Zero Trust without reliable identities for all users, devices and services will inevitably fail. However, for quite a few of short-term use cases, a cloud-based Identity-as-a-Service platform will work just fine, and many Zero Trust platforms actually support those (Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, etc.) out of the box.</p>
<p>Full visibility is also one of the basic cybersecurity hygiene principles: you can only protect what you know exists, and to protect it efficiently, you have to know what’s happening in your IT environments at any moment. At the very least, you need to collect security telemetry from endpoint devices and feed it into Zero Trust policy engines to ensure that every access decision is based on their up-to-date security posture. And again, most organizations already have tools that do exactly this – endpoint detection and response (EDR), security information and event management (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR). All you need is to make sure they can exchange information with your future Zero Trust solutions.</p>
 Quick Wins of the Way 
<p>As soon as you face the challenge of actually implementing policy-based access management to any kind of sensitive resource, you’ll quickly realize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Securing access to web applications and, say, relational databases relies on entirely different technologies, standards, and protocols. It is up to you to decide which one you need to implement first and to find the right balance between long-term strategic projects and quick wins to please your users and management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of those quick wins are literally quick and painless. The best example is undoubtedly <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80474/zero-trust-network-access">Zero Trust Network Access</a> (ZTNA). Two years of working from home have led to an explosive growth of this market, and nowadays you can find a solution for an organization of any size and industry. Some cloud-native fully managed ZTNA platforms can be deployed in minutes, and the only prerequisite is a connector to an existing identity provider. These solutions then can be seamlessly extended with cloud-delivered security capabilities to form another popular buzzword – Secure Access Service Edge (SASE).</p>
<p>Expanding Zero Trust to other aspects of your IT, such as cloud infrastructure and workloads, sensitive data, APIs and so on might not be as trivial, but again, the actual implementation details depend largely on your existing applications and services. Some might already ship with ZT-enabled access controls that only need to be integrated with your existing policy engine. Others might require installing third-party plugins or connectors.</p>
 Would You Like to Know More? 
<p>If you are looking for more specific and comprehensive guidance or want to meet the real experts in the fields of identity and cybersecurity, you should definitely not miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/csls2022">Cybersecurity Leadership Summit</a> that will take place in Berlin this November. Zero Trust is one of the key topics of the summit, and we are already looking forward to interesting sessions covering anything from strategic approaches at large enterprises like <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/1">Siemens</a> or <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5213/1">Mercedes-Benz</a> to real-life stories of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5183/2">Zero Trust journeys</a>.

   There are a myriad of state management options available for React. React provides the option of using the built-in Context for when you have a nested tree of components that share a state. There is also a built-in useState hook that will allow you to set local state for a component. 

 For more complex scenarios where you need a single source of truth that changes frequently and is shared across

  <p>There are a myriad of state management options available for React. React provides the option of using the built-in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">Context</a> for when you have a nested tree of components that share a state. There is also a built-in <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate">useState hook</a> that will allow you to set local state for a component.</p>

<p>For more complex scenarios where you need a single source of truth that changes frequently and is shared across large sections of your application, consider using a more robust state management library.</p>

<p>This walkthrough will get you started with a basic setup using Okta’s redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. It provides examples on when to use <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> versus local state using React’s <code>useState</code> hook versus React Context.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

<p>As of the time of this publication, Create React App requires Node &gt;= 14.0.0 and npm &gt;= 5.6. You can check for the latest required versions at <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html">https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html</a>.</p>

<p>NOTE: Redux also recommends you install the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en">React Developer Tools Chrome extension</a>.</p>

 Create the React app using TypeScript 

<p>We’ll get started with the built-in React template for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a> that uses Redux and TypeScript. This includes the recommended Redux Toolkit and Redux’s integration with React components. You can also <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-typescript-redux-example">clone the GitHub repo</a> and follow the instructions there to configure it instead of building the project.</p>

 
   First, run:
       <code>npx create-react-app okta-react-redux --template redux-typescript
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Our demo repository uses React <code>^18.2.0</code> and React Scripts <code>5.0.1</code>.</p>

 
   Then we’ll add the Redux core by running:
       <code>npm add redux@4.2
</code>       
   
   Redux provides its own types, but we’ll want to add our <code>react-redux</code> types since we’re using TypeScript:
       <code>npm add -D @types/react-redux@7.1
</code>       
   
   We’ll also need routing (and routing types) for our app:
       <code>npm install react-router-dom@5
npm add -D @types/react-router-dom@5.3
</code>       
   
   To start your app, run:
       <code>npm start
</code>       
   
 

 How Redux works 

<p>To update state using Redux, an action is dispatched. Then the store uses the root reducer to calculate a new state as compared to the old state, which notifies the proper subscribers of the update, so that the UI can be updated properly.</p>

<p>A typical Redux workflow goes like this. First, the UI for your application is rendered using an initial global Redux store, created with the root reducer:</p>

 
   An event occurs in the UI of your app, such as a user button interaction, which triggers an action. 
   The action is then dispatched to the store and an event handler that handles the needed logic makes the changes to your global state. 
   The store notifies subscribed parts in the UI that there has been an update. 
   Those subscribed parts then check to see if a re-render is necessary to update the UI as needed. 
 

<p>NOTE: The built-in Redux template we used includes a great counter example of how Redux works. You can take a closer look at <a href="https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples/">Redux’s explanation of the counter example</a>.</p>

 Useful terms for working with Redux 

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers">Action</a></p>

<p>An action is a JS object with a type and a payload. It describes an actionable interaction within your app, and typically is named something like <code>createUser</code> or <code>addToDo</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#action-creators">Action Creators</a></p>

<p>Action creators can be used to dynamically create actions. Our demo does not use action creators, but you can read more about it at the link above.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#reducers">Reducers</a></p>

<p>When passed a new state, a reducer returns the proper current state by comparing it with the previous state, and making the applicable changes. Reducers work similarly to the <code>Array.reduce</code> method.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-4-store#redux-store">Redux store</a></p>

<p>The current live state for your app lives in the Redux store.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#selectors">Selectors</a></p>

<p>A selector returns a piece of the live Redux state as stored in the live Redux store.</p>

<p><a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#dispatch">Dispatch</a></p>

<p>Dispatch is a method that triggers an action, which in turn updates the Redux store.</p>

 Add authentication using OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>For this demo app, we’ll be using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/">Okta’s SPA redirect model</a> to authenticate and fetch user info.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



 
   Add the Okta SDKs to your project by running:
       <code>npm install @okta/okta-react@6.4 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.0
</code>       
   
 

 TypeScript React application setup with Redux state management 

 
   Create a <code>.env</code> file to your root directory and add the following:
       <code>REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Remember to not include your <code>.env</code> file in any version control for security reasons.</p>

 Add authentication and create routes 

<p>Modify the existing <code>App.tsx</code> file:</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import { LoginCallback, Security } from "@okta/okta-react";
import Home from "./components/home";
import { useCallback } from "react";

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
  clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID,
  redirectUri: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI + "/login/callback",
});

function App() {
  const restoreOriginalUri = useCallback(
    async (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    },
    []
  );

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/" exact={true} component={Home} /&gt;
        &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
      &lt;/Security&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code>   

 Add initial state, create Redux slice, and create selector 

 
   Create a <code>src/redux-state</code> directory:
       <code>mkdir src/redux-state
</code>       
   
   Add a <code>userProfileSlice.tsx</code> file in the created <code>redux-state</code> directory with the following: 
 

   <code>import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import { RootState } from "../app/store";

export interface IUserProfile {
  email: string;
  given_name: string;
  family_name: string;
}

const initialState: IUserProfile = {
  email: "",
  given_name: "",
  family_name: "",
};

export const userProfileSlice = createSlice({
  name: "userProfile",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUserProfile: (state, action) =&gt; {
      return {
        email: action.payload.payload.email,
        given_name: action.payload.payload.given_name,
        family_name: action.payload.payload.family_name,
      };
    },
  },
});

export const selectUserProfile = (state: RootState): IUserProfile =&gt;
  state.userProfile;

export const { setUserProfile } = userProfileSlice.actions;
export default userProfileSlice.reducer;
</code>   

 
   In the <code>src/app/store.ts</code> file, add the created Redux slice to the Redux store: 
 

   <code>import { configureStore, ThunkAction, Action } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";
import userProfileReducer from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
    userProfile: userProfileReducer,
  },
});

export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export type RootState = ReturnType&lt;typeof store.getState&gt;;
export type AppThunk&lt;ReturnType = void&gt; = ThunkAction&lt;
  ReturnType,
  RootState,
  unknown,
  Action&lt;string&gt;
&gt;;
</code>   

 Show user profile information with state management 

 
   Create a <code>src/components</code> directory:
       <code>mkdir src/components
</code>       
   
   In the <code>src/components</code> directory, add the following files:
     home.tsx 
   
 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { createContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { setUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import Dashboard from "./dashboard";
import { UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

type UserProfileExtra = Pick&lt;UserClaims, "locale" | "preferred_username"&gt;;

const emptyUserContext = {
  preferred_username: "",
  locale: "",
} as UserProfileExtra;

export const UserContext = createContext(emptyUserContext);

export default function Home() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [userProfileExtra, setUserProfileExtra] = useState&lt;UserProfileExtra&gt;();

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      oktaAuth
        .getUser()
        .then((userInfo: UserProfileExtra) =&gt; {

          dispatch(
            setUserProfile({
              type: "userProfile/userProfileSet",
              payload: userInfo,
            })
          );

          setUserProfileExtra({
            locale: userInfo.locale,
            preferred_username: userInfo.preferred_username,
          });
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          console.error(err);
        });
    }
  }, [authState?.isAuthenticated, dispatch, oktaAuth]);

  return (authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp; userProfileExtra) ? (
    &lt;UserContext.Provider value={userProfileExtra}&gt;
      &lt;Dashboard /&gt;
    &lt;/UserContext.Provider&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;div className="section-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div className="title"&gt;Use Redux to Manage Authenticated State in a React App&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;button className="button" onClick={login}&gt;
        Login
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here we use React’s <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html"><code>useEffect</code> hook</a> to set the global user state we set up earlier with <code>setUserProfile</code> and the local user state we set up in this file with <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html"><code>useState</code></a>.</p>

<p>Once the user is authenticated, we rely on the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#getuser"><code>getUser</code> method</a> that is built into <code>oktaAuth</code> to fetch the user profile information. If the user is not yet authenticated, we render the login page instead.</p>

 dashboard.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";
import { useState } from "react";
import UserProfile from "./userProfile";
import UserProfileExtra from "./userProfileExtra";

export default function Dashboard() {
  const { oktaAuth } = useOktaAuth();
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut();

  return (
    &lt;div className="section-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div className="title"&gt;Dashboard&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="profile-greeting"&gt;{`Hi ${userProfile.given_name}!`}&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="profile-more-wrapper"&gt;
        {isExpanded &amp;&amp; (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;UserProfile /&gt;
            &lt;UserProfileExtra /&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {
        &lt;div
          className="profile-toggle"
          onClick={() =&gt; setIsExpanded(!isExpanded)}
        &gt;
          {isExpanded ? "Show less" : "Show more"}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      }
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;button className="button" onClick={logout}&gt;
          Logout
        &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>In this file, we use a Redux selector to get the current state for <code>userProfile</code> to then render those values in our component.</p>

<p>We also set an <code>isExpandable</code> property that toggles whether or not additional user profile information is hidden or shown. This is another example of how to use local state with the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>

 userProfile.tsx 

   <code>import { useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { selectUserProfile } from "../redux-state/userProfileSlice";
import "../App.css";

export default function UserProfile() {
  const userProfile = useSelector(selectUserProfile);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Email: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfile.email}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Last name: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfile.family_name}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>In this file, we use the Redux selector created earlier to get the current state for the state slice. This includes the user profile information we set earlier.</p>

 userProfileExtra.tsx 

   <code>import "../App.css";
import { useContext } from "react";
import { UserContext } from "./home";

export default function UserProfileExtra() {
  const userProfileExtra = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Username: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfileExtra.preferred_username}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;Locale: &lt;/span&gt;
        {userProfileExtra.locale}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Here, we demonstrate another way to manage state. This time, React’s built-in <code>useContext</code> hook is used to get what we set earlier in the <code>UserContext</code> we created with React’s <code>createContext</code> method.</p>

<p>NOTE: The following custom styling has also been added to <code>src/App.css</code> in the demo repository.</p>

   <code>.section-wrapper &gt; div {
  padding: 24px;
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
}

.section-wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: calc(100vh - 100vh * 0.33);
  margin-top: 56px;
}

.button {

}

.profile-more-wrapper &gt; div {
  padding: 16px;
}

.profile-more-wrapper span {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
</code>   

<p>Our app is now complete! Next we’ll run it to log a user in and render our applicable states.</p>

 Running the app 

<p>To start the app, run <code>npm start</code>.</p>

<p>After your app starts and you’ve clicked <code>login</code> on the home screen, you’ll be redirected to the Okta-hosted sign-in page. Here, enter your user credentials. Once your user is authenticated, the dashboard component we created will render.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you recall, the value for the user’s <code>given_name</code> is part of the Redux slice from our created selector <code>selectUserProfile</code>. Clicking <code>Show more</code> or <code>Show less</code> toggles our local state for <code>isExpanded</code> in the dashboard component. This allows us to show or hide additional user profile info, which is a mix of values from the <code>userProfileSlice</code> and additional values from the <code>UserContext</code> we created.</p>

 Learn more about authentication, React, and Redux 

<p>In this post, we used Okta’s redirect model to manage authenticated state and user profile information within a React app. We also looked at examples for when to use Redux, local state using React’s <code>useState</code> hook, or React context. As you scale your apps, you might find that a mix of all three solutions is the right choice.</p>

<blockquote>The ‘Token Mapping’ exercise will enable the Australian government to look into the readiness of the country’s current crypto regulatory framework and whether it is keeping up with the fast pace of the digital assets&nbsp;space.</blockquote><blockquote>With the ‘Token Mapping’ exercise, the Australian government plans to study the categories of digital, their underlying code types, and other significant technological distinctions between&nbsp;them.</blockquote><blockquote>This is the first-ever instance where a country will conduct a ‘Token Mapping’ exercise.</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>On Monday, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers <a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/stephen-jones-2022/media-releases/work-underway-crypto-asset-reforms">released a statement</a> announcing that Australia is all set to begin a review of how the country’s regulatory framework manages cryptocurrencies to keep up with the fast-moving world of digital assets and protect consumers at&nbsp;large.</p><p>“Australians are experiencing a digital revolution across all sectors of the economy, but regulation is struggling to keep pace and adapt with the crypto asset sector,” he&nbsp;said.</p><p>Treasurer Chalmers said this was the first time a country had sought to map out the crypto landscape. This initiative, according to him, would give a clear insight to help in deciding possible areas of regulation.</p><p>This is a significant move considering Australia is among the top-most cryptocurrency markets globally. Speaking of numbers, according to the tax office estimates, since 2018, over one million people have “interacted” with cryptocurrencies in Australia.</p><p>If we go by external surveys, the numbers are even higher. For instance, according to Finder’s recent survey, <a href="https://www.finder.com.au/finder-cryptocurrency-adoption-index">2.6 million Australians</a> own cryptocurrencies, which puts the country in the 4th spot in crypto adoption.</p><p>Australia’s move towards crypto regulation comes as the Reserve Bank of Australia prepares to trial a digital currency in a “ring-fenced” pilot program as part of a collaborative research project to look into how consumers and businesses can use&nbsp;it.</p> Mapping the Crypto Landscape <p>The first step in this <a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/stephen-jones-2022/media-releases/work-underway-crypto-asset-reforms">reform</a> agenda is “token mapping.” The Treasury will prioritize this in 2022 to help identify how digital assets and related services should be regulated.</p><blockquote>“This hasn’t been done anywhere else in the world, so it will make Australia leaders in this work,” added Chalmers.</blockquote><p>The government promises to release a public consultation paper on ‘token mapping’&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Simply put, through token mapping, the new government of Australia, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, aims to uncover the characteristics of all digital asset tokens in the country, including the type of crypto asset and its underlying code, as well as any other defining technological feature.</p><blockquote>The token mapping exercise will help determine which digital assets are already subject to financial services law. Besides this, it will also enable the government to identify non-financial products that may require their own special legislation.</blockquote><p>But before this “token mapping” is completed, the government will release a paper about a regulatory framework after consultation with stakeholders.</p> A Political Issue <p>According to Chalmers, there has been an “increasingly widespread proliferation of crypto assets,” but regulation is struggling to keep pace and adapt with the crypto asset sector. He added that regulators must ensure that consumers are adequately informed and protected.</p><blockquote>“As it stands, the crypto sector is largely unregulated, and we need to do some work to get the balance right so we can embrace new and innovative technologies while safeguarding consumers,” Chalmers&nbsp;said.</blockquote><p>The move seems to be more than just to advance technology in the country; however, as Chalmers pointed out, the previous government “prematurely” jumped to crypto asset regulation without first understanding the asset&nbsp;class.</p><p>The current government of Albanese, which defeated the previous Labor administration under Scott Morrison in May, is taking a more stern approach to working out the ecosystem and the risks involved, Chalmers added. The idea is to keep up with the developments and provide greater consumer protections, as per the statement.</p><p>The reform aims to identify notable gaps in the regulatory and licensing framework, Chalmers said in the statement. He further said they would review innovative organizational structures, look at custody obligations for third-party custodians of digital assets, and provide additional consumer safeguards.</p><p>________________________‍</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

  TreeLDR is an open-source developer tool with a DSL that makes managing data schemas as easy as defining data structures in your favorite (sane) statically-typed language.

<p>As we discover new ways to let users control their data across the web, we face plenty of hard problems to solve on the way there. We keep encountering the challenge of managing data schemas, especially when you add digital signing to them as in the case of W3C Verifiable Credentials.</p>  How can you have a handle on your data when you don’t know how to describe them?   How do you go from machine-readable JSON to human-friendly understanding?   Which fields are required, and what do they mean? Is that <code>bankId</code> referring to a financial institution or a river bank?  <p>Fortunately, a crop of solutions have emerged for the problem of JSON data schema management over the years, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb">Semantic Web</a> technologies (<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> and <a href="https://www.ontotext.com/knowledgehub/fundamentals/what-is-sparql">SPARQL</a>), <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, <a href="https://docs.couchdb.org/en/3.2.0/ddocs/views/index.html">CouchDB views</a>, and <a href="https://ipld.io/">IPLD</a>. The downside is that there are many categories of ways to manage data, primarily semantic meaning and validation, and combining them into a complete data schema management system is full of pitfalls and unpaved paths. For example,</p>  JSON-LD will add semantic meaning to what a “LeaseAgreement” is in a specific context, but has no straightforward way to enforce that the “startDate” is an ISO 8601 datetime like “2022-08-16”.  JSON Schema can be used to require that “age” is greater than or equal to 21, but cannot explain who or what is being described by the age field in a way understandable by both humans and machines.  There is no agreed-upon way to perform wholesale migrations from one schema to the next one, or to rollback changes. There are some low-level protocols such as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6902">JSON patches</a> that can serve as building blocks, but how would one automatically transform an OpenBadges V2 credential into an OpenBadges V3 one by configuring a managed migration instead of writing custom software that needs its own deployment pipeline?  How would you describe a JSON credential schema that must have been issued (digitally signed) by specific Ethereum or Solana accounts? What if this list of issuers needs to change, or networks need to be added based on different cryptography?  <p>We like emergence, and therefore oppose solutions that assume a single entity can efficiently propose, define, and evolve data schemas for all conceivable use cases across disparate verticals. We believe this to be technically infeasible, politically difficult, and also against the tenets of decentralization. </p><p>Instead, we much prefer approaches where developers are empowered to self-serve, leveraging their specific domain knowledge to create data schemas that suit their use cases well–and when they need to, easily collaborate with other developers to reach a rough consensus on what would work for even more implementers.</p> Introducing TreeLDR (Tree Linked Data Representation)  <p>That’s why we’re happy to introduce <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr">TreeLDR</a>, which is an open-source developer tool with a DSL that makes managing data schemas as easy as defining data structures in your favorite (sane) statically-typed language.</p><p>TreeLDR provides a single language to define common concepts (types) and shared data representations (layouts) that can then be compiled into a concert of data schema artifacts. It can be used to produce JSON Schemas, JSON-LD contexts, migration strategies, and eventually entire SDKs (with credential issuance and verification) in various target programming languages. </p><p>In TreeLDR, not only can you import other TreeLDR definitions but also existing schemas such as JSON-LD contexts or XML XSDs. This way, developers can define data layouts in a familiar way and focus purely on the application they wish to build. Today, it just supports printing out JSON Schema and JSON-LD contexts, but it’s already usable, and more features are on the way. We felt it most important to release and quickly iterate against feedback from implementers as soon as possible, so here it is. We already use it to <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/blob/main/examples/rebase/schema/basic_post.tldr">represent credential schemas using W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> for the <a href="https://github.com/rebase-xyz/rebase">Rebase</a> project. </p><p>Here's an example of a TreeLDR file being compiled into both JSON-LD Context and JSON Schema: </p> <code>// Sets the base IRI of the document.
base &lt;https://example.com/&gt;;

// Defines an `xs` prefix for the XML schema datatypes.
use &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#&gt; as xs;

// A person.
type Person {
	/// Full name.
        name: required xs:string,
        
        /// Parents.
        parent: multiple Person,
        
        /// Age.
        age: xs:nonNegativeInteger
}</code> <p>After defining the TreeLDR file, we can run the following to define JSON-LD Context:</p> <code>tldrc -i example/xsd.tldr -i example/person.tldr json-ld context https://example.com/Person</code> <p>and the following is the output result: </p> <code>{
	"name": "https://example.com/Person/name",
        "parent": "https://schema.org/Person/parent",
        "age": "https://schema.org/Person/age"
}</code> <p>We can also run the following to generate JSON Schema:</p> <code>tldrc -i example/xsd.tldr -i example/person.tldr json-schema https://example.com/Person</code> <p>and the following is the output result: </p> <code>{ 
	"$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
        "$id": "https://example.com/person.schema.json",
        "description": "Person",
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
        	"name": {
                	"description": "Full name",
                        "type": "string"
                }
                "parent": {
                	"description": "Parents",
                        "type": "array",
                        "item": {
                        "$ref": "https://example.com/person.schema.json"
                        }
               }
               "age": {
               	        "description": "Age",
                        "type": "integer",
                        "minimum": 0
              }
      },
      "required": [
      	     "name"
      ]
}</code>  What's Next   Enable merged representation of JSON-LD contexts and JSON Schema into a single file.  Define platform-agnostic and language-agnostic migration formats to upgrade/downgrade data schema versions automatically.  Begin integration with <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/cryptoscript">cryptoscript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/didkit">DIDKit</a> to produce developer SDKs that speak W3C Verifiable Credentials, including signing, verifying, and enforcing simple trust frameworks.  Investigate support for the IPLD ecosystem, including IPLD Data Schemas and Advanced Data Layouts (ADLs).  <p>TreeLDR is one of many open source tools released by Spruce to help developers tame the complexity of decentralized identity.

 With every major sports event comes a spike in online betting, and increased chances of fraud and underage gambling. Sports betting operators must be well-prepared to handle the influx of new customers looking to bet on this most unusual of World Cups.  



<p>The World Cup is perhaps the most popular sporting event in the world, watched by billions of people. The 2022 tournament brings some new and unprecedented challenges for betting operators, such as the unique scheduling during the winter holiday season, and increased competition for cash-strapped customers’ funds.   </p>



<p>World Cups are held every four years, in the downtime football period between domestic football seasons ending in May and beginning in August. This is good for football fans as the World Cup tends to bridge the gap before their national football league restarts, and good for betting operators as consumers typically have more time and funds to spend on their favorite games.</p>



<p>This year, however, due to the extreme summer heat in the host nation Qatar, the World Cup will begin on November 21, with the final scheduled for December 18. </p>



 The impact of major sports events on online gambling  



<p>Despite the timing of the World Cup 2022, the huge sporting event is still likely to attract enormous audiences and interest from sport bettors. Football makes up a huge proportion of the international online sports betting market, especially in European nations like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK. In fact, up to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1264768/sports-betting-participation-by-sport-great-britain/">90% of all sports wagers in the UK</a> are placed on football. In Europe, even the most casual football fan will place a bet on the World Cup.</p>



<p>According to Sportradar, bets on the World Cup totaled approximately <a href="https://www.casino.org/news/2018-world-cup-generated-e136-billion-in-bets-worldwide-fifa-says/">€136 billion in 2018</a>. The UK alone experienced <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/world-cup-economic-boost/">a 50% upsurge in gambling activities</a> from the 2014 World Cup to the 2018 World Cup. In fact, each game in 2018 experienced an average betting turnover <a href="https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/2018russia/news/136bn-betting-turnover-and-no-suspicious-betting-behaviour-at-russia-2018">worth €2.1 billion</a>. This year, that number is likely to be absolutely smashed as this is the first opportunity for American football fans to bet online, following the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling</a> that legalized sports betting. Plus, with “soccer” now more popular than ever in the States, we could see an all-time record.</p>



 Adapt and optimize onboarding for Qatar 2022 



<p>With the global online gambling market <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/recent-trends-in-global-online-gambling--betting-market-size--share-to-exceed-us-114-4-bilion-at-10-9-cagr-rise-by-2028---industry-analysis-trends-forecast-report-by-zmr-301542610.html">estimated to be worth $61.5 billion</a>, gambling platforms need to ensure they offer the best customer experience possible, to differentiate themselves, and stay ahead of the competition in an increasingly congested marketplace.</p>



<p>Gambling operators must also bear in mind that although gambling is strictly illegal in Qatar, there is nothing prohibiting people from outside Qatar placing bets on events that take place inside the country. It is for this reason and more that operators need to choose an ID verification solution that offers solid, robust and intuitive KYC processes, ensuring they follow different <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">region’s regulations</a>, rules and requirements.</p>



 Dealing with the increased chances of fraud 



<p>With the popularity of online gambling continuing to rise, security remains a major concern for players and providers alike. In fact, fraud rates in gambling went up <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/uploads/docs/TransUnion-Q1-2022-Digital-Fraud-Trends-Analysis-Infographic.pdf">50.1% in the first quarter</a> of 2022, compared to the same period last year. To reduce the risk of fraud and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, online gambling platforms need to take every step possible to verify the identities of their players. Gambling platforms can help minimize fraud by having a digital identity verification partner like IDnow that has experience in dealing with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/are-you-prepared-for-the-uefa-euro-championship/">fraudulent activity spikes</a> during major sports events. But in order to prepare in advance, betting sites should incentivize prospective bettors to register early.  </p>



<p>Extensive marketing campaigns can increase consumer awareness during the ongoing Premier League and Champions League to get people registered and verified before the first World Cup match on November 21. In addition, special offers such as free bets and bonuses often capture the attention of bettors and drive sign-ups which allows operators to tailor different promotions in advance to spread out verification processes. </p>



<p>However, bonus abuse (process of signing up to a service multiple times to take advantage of marketing offers normally intended just for new users) is something that operators need to manage in order to keep their books positive. Regulations in Europe nowadays prevent huge bonuses, but if we look over to the States or Brazil, deposit bonuses are very hefty and the reason why operators need to be extra vigilant. </p>



<p>As a result, having a secure identity verification provider such as IDnow proofing customers’ identities can prevent such abuse from occurring.</p>



 







 



 What operators should be aware of  



<p>Since most sports bettors will look to stay indoors and watch the World Cup this winter, gambling sites can anticipate a significant inflow of online players. On the other hand, considering the event will take place so close to Christmas, online gambling operators may also see a drop in visitor numbers, as players’ disposable incomes face stiff competition from festive expectations of gifts, parties, and rising heating costs.</p>



<p>During a recent <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/features/2022/06/14/a-world-cup-with-adjusted-goalposts-bose-examines-qatar-2022-marketing/">BOSE conference</a>, Head of Sportsbook Proposition, Myke Foster said that marketing needs to grab customers before the busy holiday season begins, adding that the tournament starts a week before the year’s most “pressured payday”, especially in the face of inflation and the ongoing economic crisis.</p>



<p>As gambling platforms will be targeting new markets, and a potentially smaller pool of consumers than during regular World Cups, they need to ensure their service is top-notch. New players will not want to go through a long or complicated process to register, so online gambling operators need to make the process as simple, secure and intuitive as possible. A solid product experience and a fast and secure onboarding process are crucial to leave no potential customer behind.  </p>



 A variety of firsts at Qatar’s World Cup 



<p>Although the 2018 World Cup was a massive hit for the online gambling market, much has changed in technology and mobile gambling platforms since France last snatched the coveted title. For the Qatar World Cup, many online gamblers will likely be using their smartphones to register and place their bets and will expect a smooth, secure and easy process throughout. Customers are no longer prepared to fill out lengthy application forms. Operators need to take advantage of the latest biometric verification methods to supercharge the registration process, including selfie sign-ins, and photo verification.</p>



<p>With the winter World Cup, there will be more people than ever watching from the comfort and heat of their homes, meaning there is a unique opportunity to capitalize on those who may decide to try their luck with an online bet for the first time. This new client base must be welcomed and guided accordingly. </p>



<p>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s solutions have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages.</p>



<p>Preparation is key and leveraging IDV and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a> will allow gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience for bettors, new and old.</p>

 How we are building an interoperable ecosystem for private markets 
<p>The continued expansion of our ecosystem is transforming Tokeny into the middleware that powers the new financial infrastructure for private markets, and the network effect is starting to take off.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in August 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Our role at Tokeny is to provide a compliance infrastructure for digital assets that enables issuers to build and launch their tokenization projects with a low technology cost in a few weeks. We are currently concentrating on delivering&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3WCwuv6ZmVbY3hD9OEVkbGhCIblpCfONGyb3oOQAEVz_wsT3lT6TQF124pB0W5ZijG7E8">scalable tokenization solutions</a>&nbsp;that are ready to issue thousands of tokens in parallel&nbsp;with no downtime for multi-token issuers and our ecosystem partners.</p>
<p>Now, more and more&nbsp;reputational companies integrated and packaged our API-ready and white-label solutions to provide a ready-to-use tokenization platform&nbsp;for their institutional customers, facilitating the adoption of tokenization by the mainstream.</p>
<p>These partners include consulting companies, law firms (e.g. CMS), custody providers (e.g. Fireblocks), valuation-as-a-service providers (e.g. Inveniam), and liquidity providers including alternative trading systems (ATS), decentralized exchanges, regulated exchanges, and others.</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 The value chain of tokenized assets is gradually being completed. It paves the way to bring liquidity for tokenized assets&nbsp;in three steps: 

		 
	 
            Tokenize assets  <p>By integrating our solutions through APIs or providing the white-label platform, ecosystem players can offer a turnkey tokenization solution so that issuers can easily deploy and manage digital securities or stablecoins without requiring any blockchain knowledge.</p>
              Enrich token data  <p>Investors can access accurate, reliable and real-time token data, such as price references, provided by valuation service providers like Inveniam.</p>
              Connect to distribution networks  <p>After the tokenized assets are priced, investors can find a counterparty and compliantly trade tokenized assets via liquidity provider partners’ distribution networks, leading to increased liquidity.</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>As our solutions are based on the&nbsp;open source market standard ERC3643, which supports Ethereum and any EVM public blockchains such as Polygon, we&nbsp;ensure the interoperability and cross-chain capability of the tokens, thereby enabling improved liquidity, while enforcing compliance&nbsp;as the smart contract only allows transactions between eligible investors who have passed identity-based compliance validation.</p>
<p>The continued expansion of our ecosystem is transforming Tokeny into&nbsp;the middleware that powers the new financial infrastructure for private markets.&nbsp;And we’re excited to see the network effects begin to take off, bringing the industry as a whole closer to unlocking the full potential of tokenization by&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenization-is-the-first-step-for-real-world-assets-in-defi/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--3WCwuv6ZmVbY3hD9OEVkbGhCIblpCfONGyb3oOQAEVz_wsT3lT6TQF124pB0W5ZijG7E8">bringing tokenized assets to DeFi</a>.</p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 Join the ecosystem 
<p>We welcome more corporates and blockchain companies to integrate our tokenization solution to quickly join the interoperable ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the KILT&nbsp;Devs</p><p>As promised in last week’s announcement <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/kilt-moves-to-polkadot-b5d4b56f8040">KILT Moves to Polkadot</a>, here are additional technical details about the migration plan. We’ll publish full documentation after the move to Polkadot is complete in late September, which should be helpful to other projects considering this&nbsp;path.</p> Solo-to-parachain pallet <p>In order to provide the safest and most seamless move from Kusama to Polkadot, the “solo-to-parachain” pallet provided by Parity Technologies will be used. This also allows us to keep the full block history, and it will not be necessary to temporarily restore the Sudo key to the KILT&nbsp;network.</p><p>This process requires adding two more abilities to the KILT&nbsp;Council:</p>  Execute XCM call to swap parachain lease  Remove the requirement that the Relay Chain block should strictly increase between two parachain blocks (Polkadot has lower block numbers than&nbsp;Kusama).  <p>Also the “solo-to-parachain” pallet needs to be added to the KILT&nbsp;runtime.</p> Governance by KILT community <p>Of course this requires a governance decision by the KILT community. The proposal will be posted by mid-September and the referendum will start approximately 7 days later. The governance phases will be announced on KILT channels (<a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a> and <a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT.io</a>). We encourage the KILT community to vote on the referendum.</p><p>After the referendum has passed, the Council would execute the move to Polkadot. This should take a little more than three hours.&nbsp;Then:</p>  In the first two hours of this period, the KILT network will work normally.  In the third hour KILT will not produce any new&nbsp;blocks.  After this last hour, block production will pick up with Polkadot as the new Relay Chain. The KILT chain will remain unchanged and produce the next&nbsp;block.  <p>The KILT Council, now on Polkadot, would then remove its two new rights. At this point the move is done. We anticipate that KILT will be live on Polkadot by the end of September, a bit sooner than expected.</p> FAQs  Who in the KILT community can relax and have a beer/wine/seltzer?   KILT Coin&nbsp;holders  KILT credential holders, DID holders, web3name&nbsp;holders  Sporran users  Staking delegators  Anyone who developed software using KILT (SDK, Extrinsics, RPC)   Who in the KILT community needs to do something? <p>Any node operator:</p>  Collators  Full nodes (Exchanges, RPC- Providers)   What does a node operator need to&nbsp;do? <p>Please be sure to be synchronized with the Polkadot relay chain in advance, either&nbsp;by:</p>  Taking a snapshot from <a href="https://dot.polkashots.io/">Polkashots’ Database Snapshots</a>, or  Preparing a node with the –-chain=polkadot instead of the –-chain=kusama  <p>“When do I need to be&nbsp;ready?”</p>  We will let you know in advance! You will have at least 8 days of advance warning, after we open the proposal on the KILT&nbsp;network.  <p>“How do I know the migration from Kusama to Polkadot is happening?”</p>  We will let you know when the migration happens.  After the last KILT-on-Kusama block, you should restart and synchronize your node within one hour to avoid downtime.

  <p>Java has had good multi-threading and concurrency capabilities from early on in its evolution and can effectively utilize multi-threaded and multi-core CPUs. Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.1 had basic support for platform threads (or Operating System (OS) threads), and JDK 1.5 had more utilities and updates to improve concurrency and multi-threading. JDK 8 brought asynchronous programming support and more concurrency improvements. While things have continued to improve over multiple versions, there has been nothing groundbreaking in Java for the last three decades, apart from support for concurrency and multi-threading using OS threads.</p>

<p>Though the concurrency model in Java is powerful and flexible as a feature, it was not the easiest to use, and the developer experience hasn’t been great. This is primarily due to the shared state concurrency model used by default. One has to resort to synchronizing threads to avoid issues like data races and thread blocking. I wrote more about Java concurrency in my <a href="https://deepu.tech/concurrency-in-modern-languages-java/">Concurrency in modern programming languages: Java</a> post.</p>

 What is Project Loom? 

<blockquote>
  <p>Project Loom aims to drastically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications that make the best use of available hardware.</p>

  <p>— Ron Pressler (Tech lead, Project Loom)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OS threads are at the core of Java’s concurrency model and have a very mature ecosystem around them, but they also come with some drawbacks and are expensive computationally. Let’s look at the two most common use cases for concurrency and the drawbacks of the current Java concurrency model in these cases.</p>

<p>One of the most common concurrency use cases is serving requests over the wire using a server. For this, the preferred approach is the thread-per-request model, where a separate thread handles each request. Throughput of such systems can be explained using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">Little’s law</a>, which states that in a stable system, the average concurrency (number of requests concurrently processed by the server), L, is equal to the throughput (average rate of requests), λ, times the latency (average duration of processing each request), W. With this, you can derive that throughput equals average concurrency divided by latency (λ = L/W).</p>

<p>So in a thread-per-request model, the throughput will be limited by the number of OS threads available, which depends on the number of physical cores/threads available on the hardware. To work around this, you have to use shared thread pools or asynchronous concurrency, both of which have their drawbacks. Thread pools have many limitations, like thread leaking, deadlocks, resource thrashing, etc. Asynchronous concurrency means you must adapt to a more complex programming style and handle data races carefully. There are also chances for memory leaks, thread locking, etc.</p>

<p>Another common use case is parallel processing or multi-threading, where you might split a task into subtasks across multiple threads. Here you have to write solutions to avoid data corruption and data races. In some cases, you must also ensure thread synchronization when executing a parallel task distributed over multiple threads. The implementation becomes even more fragile and puts a lot more responsibility on the developer to ensure there are no issues like thread leaks and cancellation delays.</p>

<p>Project Loom aims to fix these issues in the current concurrency model by introducing two new features: virtual threads and structured concurrency.</p>

 Virtual threads 

<blockquote>
  <p>Java 19 is scheduled to be released in September 2022, and Virtual threads will be a preview feature. Yayyy!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/425">Virtual threads</a> are lightweight threads that are not tied to OS threads but are managed by the JVM. They are suitable for thread-per-request programming styles without having the limitations of OS threads. You can create millions of virtual threads without affecting throughput. This is quite similar to coroutines, like <a href="https://go.dev/tour/concurrency/1">goroutines</a>, made famous by the Go programming language (Golang).</p>

<p>The new virtual threads in Java 19 will be pretty easy to use. Compare the below with Golang’s goroutines or Kotlin’s coroutines.</p>

<p>Virtual thread</p>

   <code>Thread.startVirtualThread(() -&gt; {
    System.out.println("Hello, Project Loom!");
});
</code>   

<p>Goroutine</p>

   <code>go func() {
    println("Hello, Goroutines!")
}()
</code>   

<p>Kotlin coroutine</p>

   <code>runBlocking {
    launch {
        println("Hello, Kotlin coroutines!")
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Fun fact: before JDK 1.1, Java had support for green threads (aka virtual threads), but the feature was removed in JDK 1.1 as that implementation was not any better than platform threads.</p>

<p>The new implementation of virtual threads is done in the JVM, where it maps multiple virtual threads to one or more OS threads, and the developer can use virtual threads or platform threads as per their needs. A few other important aspects of this implementation of virtual threads:</p>

 
   It is a <code>Thread</code> in code, runtime, debugger, and profiler 
   It’s a Java entity and not a wrapper around a native thread 
   Creating and blocking them are cheap operations 
   They should not be pooled 
   Virtual threads use a work-stealing <code>ForkJoinPool</code> scheduler 
   Pluggable schedulers can be used for asynchronous programming 
   A virtual thread will have its own stack memory 
   The virtual threads API is very similar to platform threads and hence easier to adopt/migrate 
 

<p>Let’s look at some examples that show the power of virtual threads.</p>

 Total number of threads 

<p>First, let’s see how many platform threads vs. virtual threads we can create on a machine. My machine is Intel Core i9-11900H with 8 cores, 16 threads, and 64GB RAM running Fedora 36.</p>

<p>Platform threads</p>

   <code>var counter = new AtomicInteger();
while (true) {
    new Thread(() -&gt; {
        int count = counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Thread count = " + count);
        LockSupport.park();
    }).start();
}
</code>   

<p>On my machine, the code crashed after 32_539 platform threads.</p>

<p>Virtual threads</p>

   <code>var counter = new AtomicInteger();
while (true) {
    Thread.startVirtualThread(() -&gt; {
        int count = counter.incrementAndGet();
        System.out.println("Thread count = " + count);
        LockSupport.park();
    });
}
</code>   

<p>On my machine, the process hung after 14_625_956 virtual threads but didn’t crash, and as memory became available, it kept going slowly.</p>

 Task throughput 

<p>Let’s try to run 100,000 tasks using platform threads.</p>

   <code>try (var executor = Executors.newThreadPerTaskExecutor(Executors.defaultThreadFactory())) {
    IntStream.range(0, 100_000).forEach(i -&gt; executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
        System.out.println(i);
        return i;
    }));
}
</code>   

<p>This uses the <code>newThreadPerTaskExecutor</code> with the default thread factory and thus uses a thread group. When I ran this code and timed it, I got the numbers shown here. I get better performance when I use a thread pool with <code>Executors.newCachedThreadPool()</code>.</p>

   <code># 'newThreadPerTaskExecutor' with 'defaultThreadFactory'
0:18.77 real,   18.15 s user,   7.19 s sys,     135% 3891pu,    0 amem,         743584 mmem
# 'newCachedThreadPool' with 'defaultThreadFactory'
0:11.52 real,   13.21 s user,   4.91 s sys,     157% 6019pu,    0 amem,         2215972 mmem
</code>   

<p>Not so bad. Now, let’s do the same using virtual threads.</p>

   <code>try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    IntStream.range(0, 100_000).forEach(i -&gt; executor.submit(() -&gt; {
        Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
        System.out.println(i);
        return i;
    }));
}
</code>   

<p>If I run and time it, I get the following numbers.</p>

   <code>0:02.62 real,   6.83 s user,    1.46 s sys,     316% 14840pu,   0 amem,         350268 mmem
</code>   

<p>This is far more performant than using platform threads with thread pools. Of course, these are simple use cases; both thread pools and virtual thread implementations can be further optimized for better performance, but that’s not the point of this post.</p>

<p>Running Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) with the same code gives the following results, and you can see that virtual threads outperform platform threads by a huge margin.</p>

   <code># Throughput

 Structured concurrency 

<blockquote>
  <p>Structured concurrency will be an incubator feature in Java 19.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/428">Structured concurrency</a> aims to simplify multi-threaded and parallel programming. It treats multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work, streamlining error handling and cancellation while improving reliability and observability. This helps to avoid issues like thread leaking and cancellation delays. Being an incubator feature, this might go through further changes during stabilization.</p>

<p>Consider the following example using <code>java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService</code>.</p>

   <code>void handleOrder() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    try (var esvc = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(8)) {
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; inventory = esvc.submit(() -&gt; updateInventory());
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; order = esvc.submit(() -&gt; updateOrder());

        int theInventory = inventory.get();   // Join updateInventory
        int theOrder = order.get();           // Join updateOrder

        System.out.println("Inventory " + theInventory + " updated for order " + theOrder);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>We want <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> subtasks to be executed concurrently. Each of those can succeed or fail independently. Ideally, the <code>handleOrder()</code> method should fail if any subtask fails. However, if a failure occurs in one subtask, things get messy.</p>

 
   Imagine that <code>updateInventory()</code> fails and throws an exception. Then, the <code>handleOrder()</code> method throws an exception when calling <code>inventory.get()</code>. So far this is fine, but what about <code>updateOrder()</code>? Since it runs on its own thread, it can complete successfully. But now we have an issue with a mismatch in inventory and order. Suppose the <code>updateOrder()</code> is an expensive operation. In that case, we are just wasting the resources for nothing, and we will have to write some sort of guard logic to revert the updates done to order as our overall operation has failed. 
   Imagine that <code>updateInventory()</code> is an expensive long-running operation and <code>updateOrder()</code> throws an error. The <code>handleOrder()</code> task will be blocked on <code>inventory.get()</code> even though <code>updateOrder()</code> threw an error. Ideally, we would like the <code>handleOrder()</code> task to cancel <code>updateInventory()</code> when a failure occurs in <code>updateOrder()</code> so that we are not wasting time. 
   If the thread executing <code>handleOrder()</code> is interrupted, the interruption is not propagated to the subtasks. In this case <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> will leak and continue to run in the background. 
 

<p>For these situations, we would have to carefully write workarounds and failsafe, putting all the burden on the developer.</p>

<p>We can achieve the same functionality with structured concurrency using the code below.</p>

   <code>void handleOrder() throws ExecutionException, InterruptedException {
    try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; inventory = scope.fork(() -&gt; updateInventory());
        Future&lt;Integer&gt; order = scope.fork(() -&gt; updateOrder());

        scope.join();           // Join both forks
        scope.throwIfFailed();  // ... and propagate errors

        // Here, both forks have succeeded, so compose their results
        System.out.println("Inventory " + inventory.resultNow() + " updated for order " + order.resultNow());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Unlike the previous sample using <code>ExecutorService</code>, we can now use <code>StructuredTaskScope</code> to achieve the same result while confining the lifetimes of the subtasks to the lexical scope, in this case, the body of the try-with-resources statement. The code is much more readable, and the intent is also clear. <code>StructuredTaskScope</code> also ensures the following behavior automatically.</p>

 
   
    <p>Error handling with short-circuiting — If either the <code>updateInventory()</code> or <code>updateOrder()</code> fails, the other is canceled unless its already completed. This is managed by the cancellation policy implemented by <code>ShutdownOnFailure()</code>; other policies are possible.</p>
   
   
    <p>Cancellation propagation — If the thread running <code>handleOrder()</code> is interrupted before or during the call to <code>join()</code>, both forks are canceled automatically when the thread exits the scope.</p>
   
   
    <p>Observability — A thread dump would clearly display the task hierarchy, with the threads running <code>updateInventory()</code> and <code>updateOrder()</code> shown as children of the scope.</p>
   
 

 State of Project Loom 

<p>The Loom project started in 2017 and has undergone many changes and proposals. Virtual threads were initially called fibers, but later on they were renamed to avoid confusion. Today with Java 19 getting closer to release, the project has delivered the two features discussed above. One as a preview and another as an incubator. Hence the path to stabilization of the features should be more precise.</p>

 What does this mean to regular Java developers? 

<p>When these features are production ready, it should not affect regular Java developers much, as these developers may be using libraries for concurrency use cases. But it can be a big deal in those rare scenarios where you are doing a lot of multi-threading without using libraries. Virtual threads could be a no-brainer replacement for all use cases where you use thread pools today. This will increase performance and scalability in most cases based on the benchmarks out there. Structured concurrency can help simplify the multi-threading or parallel processing use cases and make them less fragile and more maintainable.</p>

 What does this mean to Java library developers? 

<p>When these features are production ready, it will be a big deal for libraries and frameworks that use threads or parallelism. Library authors will see huge performance and scalability improvements while simplifying the codebase and making it more maintainable. Most Java projects using thread pools and platform threads will benefit from switching to virtual threads. Candidates include Java server software like Tomcat, Undertow, and Netty; and web frameworks like Spring and Micronaut. I expect most Java web technologies to migrate to virtual threads from thread pools. Java web technologies and trendy reactive programming libraries like RxJava and Akka could also use structured concurrency effectively. This doesn’t mean that virtual threads will be the one solution for all; there will still be use cases and benefits for asynchronous and reactive programming.</p>

<p>Access control is a security measure that can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. But how can mandatory access control help with security?</p>
<p>What is mandatory access control? Mandatory access control (MAC) is a type of access control where the policy administrator, not the user, can grant or restrict access to certain files.</p>
 What Is Access Control? 
<p>As users navigate through physical and digital systems, they tend to brush up against resources and assets that they should or should not have access to. This is particularly true in digital systems where the lateral movement to different storage, application, or processing areas can lead to dangerous security threats that undermine the entire infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To maintain separation of assets and resources, security administrators use what are known as “access controls” that define who can access those resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, once a user is authenticated and authorized to enter a system via a user account or identity, an access control system sets conditions that determine who, when, where, and sometimes how that user can navigate the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this concept seems simple on its surface, there are several different access control schemas that help secure resources against unauthorized access:</p>
 Rule-Based Access Control&nbsp; 
<p>This approach grants permissions to users based on a structured set of rules and policies. These rules create a “context” from which resource access can be derived. These rules are laid out in an Access Control List (ACL) attached to an “object” (the resource, whether it’s processing permissions, data, account access, etc.).</p>
<p>Some common forms of rule-based access include limiting system access to given times of the day, or locations (for example, limiting access to devices at or near an office location).&nbsp;</p>
 Role-Based Access Control&nbsp; 
<p>Role-based access is an approach where user roles within an organization dictate access permissions. The organization will have a defined organizational hierarchy and a clearly set list of permissions based on roles within that hierarchy. Any user designated within a given role will gain the permissions of that role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Role-based access is quite common. The most typical places we find role-based permissions are multi-user systems. For example, a public-facing service provider (like an email or cloud service provider) may have several different types of accounts (users, VIP users, administrators, moderators, etc.), each with their own permissions and access controls. A role-based system would restrict who can access what within that system to allow for a shared space.&nbsp;</p>
 Attribute-Based Access Control 
<p>Attribute-based systems are somewhat more granular than both role- and rule-based systems. Attribute-based systems, rather than looking at a list of rules related to resources (like rule systems) or roles (like a role system) can pull dynamic information from user accounts to field more fluid and responsive access systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, suppose a company works with classified data. In that case, individual users could receive designations for access to SECRET data designations–this would be an attribute of the user, not a role or a resource.</p>
<p>These access control approaches aren’t necessarily exclusive. For example, it’s possible to use both attribute- and role-based systems to fine-tune the system and data security.</p>
 Mandatory Access Control 
<p>No matter what the specifics of the control system, at some point, implementation and maintenance fall onto some sort of authority. In Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems, that authority falls squarely on the shoulders of system administrators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process of access designation follows a similar path across MAC systems:</p>
 
 Administrators create, configure, and implement access policies. These policies are based on specific pieces of information–but at this point, the admins are creating the categories themselves (roles, user attributes, resource attributes, etc.).&nbsp; 
 These administrators implement these access categories where necessary, either as fields of user information, data object metadata, system information, and so on. 
 During authorization, the system will look at the security attributes of the “subject” of access (user, object, system, etc.) and determine whether permission exists.&nbsp; 
 
 Discretionary Access Control 
<p>Conversely, Discretionary Access Control (DAC) gives customers and business end-users more capabilities in terms of setting their own access controls. While a security administrator may implement roles and permissions throughout the system, the user may override those permissions to grant access to individual users who, based on their business credentials, should actually have access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach can provide some flexibility in terms of how a business gives access to users. However, it also creates potential vulnerabilities when local business administrators fail to update or configure their local permissions. This makes DAC a high-maintenance solution that, while flexible, needs regular attention.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are the Differences Between Mandatory and Discretionary Access Control? 
<p>MAC and DAC are rather polarized. While some access control schemes can work together in some capacity, it’s relatively difficult (if not impossible) to effectively field both DAC and MAC without stepping over one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that said, these incompatibilities are partly due to the differences between the two approaches. Mandatory and Discretionary differ in a few key ways:</p>
 
 Protection: Mandatory discretion offers more stable and predictable protection when implemented well. Discretionary access control can provide key flexibility for an organization but also introduce potential conflicts between individual and organization-wide permissions.<br>
 
 User Control: Additionally, mandatory controls aren’t incredibly flexible outside of their schema, and for a good reason–to address security issues related to access from an organizational level. However, there are legitimate instances where individuals in an organization should receive access to specific resources even if their role or user attributes don’t allow it.&nbsp; 
 Maintainability: Mandatory access controls are typically formulated from the top-down and centrally planned. That means that they can support robust authorization throughout a system, with security and regulatory demands implemented in one place.<br>
On the other hand, DAC can get messy if an end-user is implementing local access control haphazardly or without maintaining their permissions list in cases where employees leave the company or are terminated.&nbsp;

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock DIDs now support more than one key  Keys can be given different capabilities using Verification Relationships  We support 4 Verification Relationships: Authentication, Assertion, Key Agreement, and Capability Invocation.  DIDs can now be controlled by other DIDs  DIDs can now have service endpoints  Dock now supports off-chain DID Documents  <p>Until now, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on Dock could only have one key at any moment. Though they could be rotated over time, having only one valid key at any moment meant that the DID owner had to use the same key for all purposes. </p><p>As an example, consider the life of an issuer utilising a DID. The issuer could perform several functions like the issuance of credentials, authenticating with some other application, engaging in secure communication using a methodology like <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm</a>, or revoking its issued credential on the blockchain, which again requires authenticating itself to the chain. Following the principle of separation of concerns, the issuer would ideally like to have separate keys for each of these functions so that when one key is compromised or lost, its other functions are not impacted. Also, the issuer would like to have separate more sensitive keys that can be used to add new or remove existing keys of its DID.</p> Keys and Verification Relationships <p></p><p>With the latest release of our platform (blockchain node and SDK), we enable a DID owner to have a setup like the above. This new release will allow a DID to add multiple keys for its DID and give them different capabilities. These are called Verification relationships in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#verification-relationships">W3C DID spec</a>. A key can have one or more Verification relationships to the DID depending on the kind of functions it's supposed to perform on the DID's behalf. </p><p>We support 4 Verification Relationships:</p><p>1. Authentication - Keys with this relationship are only allowed to be used for authentication, i.e. convincing the other party that it's a key of the DID. Such a key can revoke a credential on the blockchain, add a schema, or act as a holder when sharing a presentation of credential(s).</p><p>2. Assertion - Keys with this relationship are used for signing credentials during issuance.</p><p>3. Key Agreement - These keys are used during secure communication to encrypt some data for the DID.</p><p>4. Capability Invocation - These keys are able to modify the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents">DID Document</a>, i.e. add new or remove existing keys, add/remove service endpoints, controllers (more on this below), etc. If a DID has one or more such keys, we say that the DID "controls" itself, meaning that it can modify its DID Document. We have intentionally decided to allow keys with this relationship to also add schemas, revoke credentials, etc., on the chain. </p><p>While adding a key, it can be specified what verification relationships the key would have with the DID. Each new key gets a unique id (in that DID's context), and using this id, the key can be removed as well.</p> DID Controllers <p></p><p>As mentioned above, only keys with "Capability Invocation" are able to modify the DID Document. A DID with such a key is said to be self-controlled, or it's a controller of itself. But a DID might have other controllers as well, or a DID might not control itself but is only controlled by other DIDs. This capability is essential for guardianship use cases where a DID (the controller) is the custodian of another DID (controlled). </p><p>As an example, consider an organization that wants to onboard its members to our chain and give each member a DID. At the time of onboarding, members might not be capable of managing keys, so the organization will create a DID for each of its members. That member DID won't have a key, and the organization DID will be the controller of the member DID. Now the organization is the guardian of the member. </p><p>When the member becomes capable of managing keys, the member will provide its public key to the organization, which will update the member DID with that public key, make the member the controller of its DID and remove itself from the controller role, thus ending the guardianship. </p><p>In another example, consider an IOT application where each sensor has its own DID. The sensors have keys that they use to sign (Authentication) messages before sending or decrypting (Key Agreement) received messages, but only the owner of the sensors can update their keys. Also, the owner could add new owner(s) to those sensors by adding more controllers to their DID or remove itself as the controller, thus transferring the ownership. </p><p>Similar to sensors, DIDs can be assigned to other objects like batteries where batteries have DIDs, but they don't have any keys, only controllers (the owner of the battery). This helps us in building <a href="https://www.circularise.com/blog/digital-product-passports-dpp-what-how-and-why">Digital Product Passports</a> which are digital twins of physical products to enable a sustainable and circular economy, etc. DIDs can also be assigned to an NFT where the NFT itself has no keys, but the owner of the NFT is the controller of its DID. When the ownership is transferred, the controller of the NFT DID also changes (this will be triggered through a smart contract).</p> Other Features of This Release  Service Endpoints <p>DIDs often need a way to communicate, like a subject DID needs to request a credential from the issuer DID. The issuer thus needs a way to publish its contact information like an HTTPS endpoint it should be reached on or its website. This is achieved by the issuer adding a "service" to its DID Document, which specifies this information. As alluded to before, only controllers of a DID can update the DID Document, thus adding the service endpoint. &nbsp;</p> Off-Chain DID Documents<br> <p>Another feature we have added is off-chain DID Documents. Until now, all things part of the DID document, like keys, controllers, and services, are stored on the chain. The logic to add/remove these is not clearly defined in the DID spec but is what looked like the most reasonable to us. But for users who would like a different set of rules for updating DIDs or adding more functionalities without waiting for us to build them can host their DID documents on another storage like IPFS or anything and only store the reference to the document like <a href="https://docs.filebase.com/storage-networks/ipfs/ipfs-cids">IPFS CID</a> or URL for the DID. &nbsp;</p> Improvements and Changes<br> <p>Lastly, the release contains several refactorings and improvements, which led us to introduce breaking changes, so please upgrade your applications at your earliest convenience.</p><p>For a more technical walkthrough of these features check out the <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/concepts_did.html">conceptual explanation</a> and the <a href="https://docknetwork.github.io/sdk/tutorials/tutorial_did.html">hands-on example</a>. Also, there are breaking changes for our SDK so please use SDK version <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/releases/tag/v2.3.0">2.3.0</a> or above.</p> Learn More   <a href="https://www.dock.io/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/decentralized-identity">Decentralized identity</a>  <p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

 Enjoy the latest OWN Insights, by our Head of Operations, Cedric&nbsp;Ding. <p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article written by Cedric Ding, Head of Operations at Ontology.</p> The end of Web2 and&nbsp;Web3 <p>Since the birth of the concept of Web3 (Web3 in this article generally refers to a network form that confirms and empowers everyone’s data and assets through decentralized technology), some people regard it as the terminator of Web2. It’s as if Web2 is the wicked dragon and Web3 is the knight to save them. In their eyes, Web3 will eventually replace Web2. But in my opinion, this cannot and will not happen. Kevin Kelly has put forward a point of view called “candle economy”, that is, as long as it exists, it will not disappear with a high probability. Just like today, when electric lights are so popular, the production of candles is the highest in human history. In my opinion, the final outcome of Web3 and Web2 is coexistence, and the proportion of both is not small. They will probably exist in a state where there is a bit of them in each other, and Web3 may account for 20%, 50% or 80% of them. The process must be a two-way journey between Web2 and Web3. Web3 will be a tool that some people use when dealing with some things and some relationships.</p><p>Why do I have such an opinion? In a big way, all countries are a kind of centralized existence. The country grants people various rights through laws. When people encounter problems, they still need to be solved by the administrative departments and means of the government. Even blockchain-related issues, such as the recent bankruptcy of Three Arrows Capital, end up in legal action. I believe countries will use blockchain technology for efficiency, but I can’t imagine pure Web3 anarchy. Secondly, how many people are willing to suffer the inconvenience brought by Web3? A simple example is, how many people have the ability to keep the private keys of their wallets for a long time? In the world of Web2, you can retrieve your account in various ways, but in Web3, it is all up to&nbsp;you.</p><p>After we have the finale, we will explore how to implement Web3. I will discuss the organizational form, product form, and technology development.</p> Evolution of&nbsp;DAOs <p>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are an emerging form of organization under Web3, but autonomous organizations are not. As social animals, human beings have established autonomous organizations from the very beginning, dividing labor for gathering, hunting, and distribution. In modern times, with the increase in human needs, such autonomous organizations have become richer and more subdivided. The establishment of autonomous organizations is bottom-up, and a group of people establishes organizations and divides labor for a common goal. The DAO adds the attributes of anonymity and transparency on the basis of the original autonomous organization and influences the decision-making and strategy of the project through voting on governance tokens. Finally, token holders can directly enjoy the benefits of the project. This sounds similar to a joint-stock company today, the only benefit is that the return of the token is guaranteed by the blockchain and contract, not bound by contract or corporate law.</p><p>One problem with DAOs is the efficiency of decision-making. The decision-making of DAO often requires full discussion and voting in the project community. This can be fatal for a start-up project. A core team may only need a 2-hour meeting to confirm something. In the DAO, it may take days or even weeks of discussions and votes to decide, during which the Team members are also required to expend effort into discussions and explanations. To make things even more troubling, many token holders are short-sighted, wanting to quickly benefit from the project and turn away. Another situation is that the project party itself is the largest holder of tokens, so the entire DAO will be a mere formality. In any case, such a DAO would do more harm than good for the project. In the practice of DAO, a good case may be MakerDAO. In the early stage of the project, the team decisively turned DAO into a centralized decision-making model to speed up the decision-making process to cope with the rapidly changing world. Once the project is more mature, the project will be divided into modules. It is gradually transformed into the form of DAO, and is managed by the community to meet the demands of most people. DAO should serve the project itself, and whether to adopt DAO should be judged by whether it can achieve the project goals more efficiently, and a more appropriate organizational form can be adopted at different stages of the&nbsp;project.</p> Product innovation and iteration <p>We all know that the issuance and circulation of project tokens is not equal to Web3, nor is blockchain technology equal to Web3. What can really realize Web3 is products and applications, and what can really make Web3 widely used is easy-to-use products. With the exception of fundamentalist Web3 geeks, the vast majority of user groups don’t use a product just because it’s labeled Web3. It must be a product that solves the user’s problem and has a better user experience than Web2 to attract a large number of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Coming to what problem Web3 can solve, unfortunately, most of the popular applications are currently only used to help users make money. It is true that products in financial scenarios are also the most widely used solutions at present. Whether it is payment transfer, exchange, loan or liquidity mining without any third-party approval, it greatly improves the efficiency of user assets. Although ironically, when you exchange fiat currency in OTC, you still hope that a third party will help you supervise your transaction partner to ensure the integrity of the transaction. Web3 can also solve the problems of trust, right confirmation, certification and reputation. Using the immutability and traceability of information on the chain, Web3’s products are an excellent solution to the above problems. One of the problems is how to ensure the authenticity of off-chain information when it is on-chain, otherwise credibility can only stay in the narrowest sense of on-chain information. More use of trusted data sources, optimized mechanisms and algorithms can solve this problem to a certain extent, and cooperation with Web2 data owners will also be involved in this process. My suggestion is that if there is an opportunity, cooperate first to form a product, and constantly solve user problems and iterate quickly in the process of cooperation. Increasing the degree of decentralization is only a way to better solve user problems, not an&nbsp;end.</p><p>We have a similar problem when it comes to making Web3 provide a better user experience than Web2, especially with games and social products. After being hot for a while, blockchain games and social products are thinking about what a real product should look like? Are Web3’s gaming and social products really meeting the needs of users before stimulating their use through token economics? The user experience is the same in the world of Web2 and Web3, because users are all human, and human nature is behind all interactions. Web2’s products have matured after 20 to 30 years of development, and Web3’s products should reduce the user’s learning cost as much as possible in the front-end experience and conform to the user’s operating habits. Of course, because of the combination of blockchain technology, Web3 products are extremely challenging in optimizing product experience. Another feasible path is for Web2-based products to move closer to Web3. For example, more and more Web2 products now support the use of wallet connections, and give more rights and interests according to the NFT held by the address. This is positive for Web3. For the Web3 project, this not only has an idea of ​​making products, but it also brings more competitors.</p> Technology and infrastructure support <p>In addition to the lack of “genius” inspiration, the lack of excellent products is also due to the fact that current technology cannot support such products. Blockchain technology is recognized as one of the important and necessary technologies to realize Web3. As the infrastructure and carrier of blockchain solutions, the public chain has always been one of the focuses of development, and the most widely used one is Ethereum. However, Ethereum has also faced a series of problems such as low throughput and high handling fees for a long time; the PoS upgrade has been repeatedly delayed, and the sharding is far away; the contract that has just passed the separation of ownership and usage rights has not yet been practically applied,&nbsp;etc…</p><p>Of course, in addition to the Ethereum chain, other public chains are constantly innovating and iterating, and new public chains are emerging one after another. Side chains, Layer 2, non-EVM, Meta systems, etc. have their own characteristics, so that projects need to choose a public chain. In choosing public chains, there are repeated tradeoffs. Among the many public chains, Ontology provides a complete set of infrastructure OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) to help projects realize the road to Web3 more quickly. The bottom layer of Ontology Chain is a public chain with high throughput (5000 transactions per second) and high compatibility (supporting 4 types of contracts). It is a platform suitable for various projects and developers. In addition, on the protocol layer, Ontology has a lot of protocols that are closely related to Web3, such as DID (ONT ID), data collaboration (POD), reputation (Orange), and trusted credentials, which have been implemented and can be directly used by developers. At the product layer, Ontology also provides a wealth of tools such as ONT Login, ONT TAG, Mercury, browsers, and various APIs/SDKs to help applications land. More importantly, Ontology has been committed to building a trust and collaboration infrastructure since its inception, and its accumulated rich experience can help Ontology go further on this road. It is believed that if developers and project parties use the entire OWN infrastructure to develop projects, they will achieve twice the result with half the effort on the road to realize&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>In addition to blockchain technology, the realization of Web3 also relies on technological breakthroughs in privacy computing, 5G networks, zero-knowledge proofs, artificial intelligence, and other fields. Only when these technologies meet the needs of Web3, the corresponding applications will really&nbsp;explode.</p><p>The realization of Web3 is a long road, and we hope we can work together to usher in this&nbsp;day.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/own-insights-the-realization-of-web3-5fb87980cee">OWN Insights 05: The Realization of Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Google the term ‘metaverse’ and you’ll see it’s a complex concept that people are still trying to pin down and define. It seems in the eight months since Facebook’s parent company rebranded as Meta and staked its claim on the future of social connection on the internet, we’re still a bit fuzzy on what the metaverse is, how we’ll get there, and what we’ll do when we arrive.</p>



<p>But the first thing you should know about the metaverse, even as it’s still emerging and being defined, is that the time to act is now. The metaverse is expected to contribute&nbsp;<a href="https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/insights/publishing/2022-the-potential-global-economic-impact-of-the-metaverse.pdf?fbclid=IwAR02cv2Qm2GDGEPGc-JGaU2TM_FCeOVxflqs-cfjvlHq5jM0XqsV1oKiNoQ">USD 3 trillion</a>&nbsp;to global GDP by 2013 and customers will expect immersive and interactive activities and apps from your brand. So, let’s see what’s possible.</p>



 What is the metaverse? 



<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/meaning-of-metaverse#:~:text=In%20its%20current%20meaning%2C%20metaverse,socialize%2C%20play%2C%20and%20work.">Officially</a>, the metaverse is&nbsp;“the concept of a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play, and work.”&nbsp;Meta means “transcending reality” so metaverse really means “transcending the universe as we know it.” Zuckerberg brought it back down to earth when he called the metaverse “the next chapter for the internet.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2022/07/18/the-ceo-guide-to-the-metaverse/?sh=33c81a4098ea">Forbes</a>&nbsp;defines the metaverse as “a virtual world where people can interact with each other and businesses entirely realistically. This revolutionary technology is made possible by a combination of virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>LeewayHertz CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/metaverse-use-cases-and-benefits/">Akash Takyar</a>&nbsp;goes further: “We must think of a three-dimensional web powered by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The metaverse is persistent, self-sustaining, infinite, interoperable, and in real-time, and these features are its key characteristics. Persistent means it exists regardless of the user’s physical presence. Infinite supports countless contemporary users and VR worlds. Self-sustaining means that users can earn within the metaverse and pay for their utility. Interoperability helps users move their virtual items, including avatars, from one metaverse project to another. Real-time allows users to relish live experiences.”</p>



<p>Entry to this shared virtual world is mostly via VR headsets right now, but smartphone access will be commonplace in future. In fact, some say it will be augmented reality (AR) and not VR that drives the metaverse forward and solves the physical separation and discomfort&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-metaverse-and-what-can-we-do-there-179200">issues</a>&nbsp;of VR headsets. AR&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/augmented-reality-AR">digitally enhances</a>&nbsp;the real world in real time, rather than takes us out of it, and this might appeal to more people.</p>



 The metaverse is a huge opportunity for business 



<p>The metaverse presents a vast profitable frontier for business. It’s where companies and customers can interact completely virtually and harness untold possibilities in immersive customer service, marketing, events and tourism, healthcare, research and training, and more. Geographical borders and physical environments are no barrier. Profits, customer loyalty and trust are massive benefits.</p>



<p>In many ways, the COVID-19 pandemic showed us what’s possible for remote interaction and the concept has boomed. The global market for the metaverse is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/08/2458533/0/en/Metaverse-Market-Size-to-Worth-Around-USD-1-607-12-Bn-by-2030.html#:~:text=According%20to%20Precedence%20Research%2C%20the,50.74%25%20from%202022%20to%202030.">projected</a>&nbsp;to be worth around USD 1,607.12 billion by 2030. In the past year, the number of companies working in the space went from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/benjaminlaker/2022/07/18/the-ceo-guide-to-the-metaverse/?sh=33c81a4098ea">200 to 500</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/metaverse-brands/">Visionary brands</a>&nbsp;such as Tommy Hilfiger, Dolce Gabbana, Gucci, Puma, Nike, Samsung, Hyundai, Coco-Cola, Adidas, Wendy’s, and Accenture are already using the technology for marketing, customer service, and training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re in business, now is the time to develop a metaverse strategy and embrace the new technology.</p>



 The metaverse will rely on decentralized identity and blockchain&nbsp; 



<p>Two new technologies will make widespread uptake of the metaverse possible:&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">blockchain</a>.&nbsp;The metaverse will run its own&nbsp;<a href="https://business-reporter.co.uk/technology/the-metaverse-the-new-digital-economy">digital economy</a>&nbsp;with cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and participants will depend on digital proof of identity for gaining access (<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">verifiable credentials</a>). The&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">digital wallet</a>&nbsp;will be essential for user control and seamless transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/07/dr-ashley-presents-on-opportunities-and-challenges-of-real-world-applications-of-blockchain-at-australian-event/">co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;recently told a blockchain event that decentralized identity is the most important use case for blockchain, and both are essential to the metaverse and Web3. LeewayHertz’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leewayhertz.com/metaverse-use-cases-and-benefits/">Askash Takyar</a>says:&nbsp;“With blockchain, enterprises can build decentralized and transparent solutions to provide digital proof of ownership, digital collectability, value transfer, and interoperability.”</p>

				  The Indicio Meetup Community comes together once a month to discuss some of the biggest news, trends, and developments in the decentralized identity space.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Why attend?</p>
<p>On August 30, Indicio will host a conversation between Daniel Hardman, CTO of Provenant, and Sam Curren, Deputy CTO of Indicio on DIDComm V2 and its recently approved spec status by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF). Daniel currently serves as the chair of the DIDComm user group, which is sponsored by DIF, and Sam serves as the co-chair. As both are immersed in DIDComm, they will be able to offer insight into why DIDComm V2 acceptance is a significant step forward for everyone using the internet.</p>
<p>What is DIDComm?</p>
<p>“DIDComm, short for Decentralized Identifier Communication, is a communications methodology that works with the decentralized design of DIDs to provide private, secure interaction…DIDComm provides the next step in decentralized identity: direct, secure communication between the owners of DIDs. Currently, APIs are the norm for communicating with online services; however, APIs favor those with the ability to provide highly-available online services; they are ill-suited to peer-to-peer cases where the endpoints are not highly available and the infrastructure costs must be low. In contrast, DIDComm enables peer-to-peer interaction with computers, phones, and even IoT devices.” – Decentralized Identity Foundation</p>
<p>What will you get out of it?</p>
<p>This conversation is an opportunity to question the experts! Come learn about DIDComm, how it is used and how it will be used, and, if you’re interested, how you can get involved in future projects. Register for the Meetup and find more details here: <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/287904731/">https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/287904731/</a></p>
<p>For those who would like a crash course in DIDComm itself, you can prepare by watching Daniel Hardman’s excellent explainer video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxWgNmsnvU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBxWgNmsnvU</a></p>

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560340756555915266?s=20&amp;t=VU7LwqSAdgPTeytaf8ZXlg">weekly Community Call</a>, discussing “Four key goals of DID”. We invited Shrey, a well-known Microsoft Web3 researcher, who talked about “DID is striving to achieve four key goals: privacy, censorship resistance, interoperability with smart contracts, and self-management.”  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. He discussed Metaverse and NFTs with community members. The development of NFTs is inseparable from its strong scalability and plasticity. It is foreseeable that the development of Web3 will provide it with a wider range of application scenarios.  Ontology organized an AMA and invited community Harbinger <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1560176905177137152?s=20&amp;t=VU7LwqSAdgPTeytaf8ZXlg">Dumont</a> to share his rich experience in Ontology staking and answer the questions encountered by community members.

They pointed out that the era of Web3 passwordless login has begun. The ONT Login component in Ontology ONT ID has already been built, and continues to provide a mature passwordless login mode for platforms and applications.  The Verifiable Credentials WG of W3C has published a First Public Working Draft for “<a href="https://twitter.com/w3c/status/1561704492789370880?s=20&amp;t=siQTY7W35vMLJEf4wYaa6w">Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0.</a>”.

<p>The retail industry has shifted from competing purely on products to relying on experiences to entice shoppers to choose their brand. Retailers that can identify their customers the moment they touch a digital property have the advantage of distinguishing themselves over others that can’t. These brands have the power to make every digital touchpoint personalized, secure, and frictionless and make it impossible for a shopper to stop engaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is where customer identity can make a difference. When retailers use customer identity as the foundation for interacting with shoppers online, they are able to outpace their competition, grow their customer base, and boost revenues with tailored end-to-end shopping experiences that are simultaneously seamless and secure.</p>

<p>Digital financial experiences are becoming central to our lives. In a recent Mastercard poll, eight in 10 U.S. consumers reported using technology for financial tasks like paying bills, sending money to friends, checking or improving credit scores or applying for loans.</p>
<p>These are not mere conveniences, but tools that meaningfully impact people’s lives, providing them with more choice in financial services and more opportunities than ever before. Many of these innovations are made possible by open banking — technology that allows consumers and small businesses to permission their financial accounts’ data to the financial apps and services they want to use.</p>
<p>As digital payments continue to increase<a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-291-billion-payments-2021-led-major-gains-b2b-and-same-day-ach"> exponentially</a>, so will the flow of financial data between parties. The massive increase in digital financial experiences is underway, according to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwrs2XBhDjARIsAHVymmQlHVjYG1NKP9FeIOCBY3yRGMa8eWw-_S17833WX-3V2PvgHLGRJiQaAk3cEALw_wcB">Rise of Open Banking report</a>, 93% of US consumers currently using technology to manage their money. Security is more important than ever and, to ensure privacy, consumers want transparency and more control.</p>
<p>Mastercard improves security through open banking by driving new technology innovation while meeting governmental regulations and helping to establish industry standards.</p>
<p>Trusted financial data aggregation platforms, such as Mastercard’s open banking, facilitate secure access to consumers’ permissioned data via traditional connections and APIs. However, there are additional technological and regulatory measures at work that add more layers of protection to consumers and small businesses alike.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Here are some of the ways open banking keeps your customers’ financial data secure: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tokenized Access 
<p>The industry is rapidly moving toward “tokenized” access. Also known as “Open Authorization” or “oAuth” connections, “tokenized” access involves providing an open banking platform with a “token” that is used as an access key rather than account credentials to access consumer-permissioned financial data.</p>
 Regulatory Movement 
<p>Across the globe, government regulations of consumer technology have emerged to protect people’s data from leaks, fraud or loss. For example, in the U.K. and Europe payment service providers must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> to provide certain open banking services. Only registered providers can access consumer bank accounts, and they require explicit consent from consumers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new technological advances are accompanying Open Banking regulations to further protect consumers and provide clear boundaries for innovators. For instance, a crucial component of Europe’s<a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/everything-need-know-psd2/"> PSD2</a> regulation is Strong Customer Authentication (<a href="https://nordigen.com/en/blog/psd2-sca/">SCA</a>), a tool that guarantees user ID verification. As a stronger form of multi-factor authentication, SCA requires that customers share something they know (i.e. password or PIN), something they own (their mobile phone’s unique identity) and a biometric (facial profile or fingerprint). SCA will not authorize a payment without two of these three factors.</p>
<p>There are also regulations being worked on in other regions.</p>
 Industry-Driven Technology Standards 
<p>Establishing common industry standards around security will also help open banking to more clearly define access and sharing of financial data. In North America, a cross-section of banks, fintechs and financial services groups have come together to form<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/FDX/About/FDX/About/About-FDX.aspx?hkey=dffb9a93-fc7d-4f65-840c-f2cfbe7fe8a6"> Financial Data Exchange</a> (FDX), a nonprofit aligned around a single data-sharing standard entitled<a href="https://financialdataexchange.org/FDX/News/Press-Releases/Financial_Data_Exchange_Releases_FDX_API_5.0.aspx"> FDX API</a>. As an interoperable and royalty-free standard, the FDX API could accelerate the adoption of open banking API frameworks.</p>
<p>FDX adheres to<a href="https://www.finicity.com/the-finicity-perspective-whitepaper/"> five key principles</a> for data sharing – control, access, transparency, traceability and security. Taken together, these five principles prescribe how consumers can be empowered and protected via data sharing by giving them a better view into what is happening with their data, who is accessing their data and what consumers are getting from their data.</p>
 Data Access 
<p>To protect the security of customers’ data, Mastercard, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Finicity, takes additional steps. In the United States, Mastercard has direct bilateral agreements for data access with most of the largest financial institutions. Our open banking platform is guided by our<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2022/data-responsibility-and-inclusion/"> data responsibility principles</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When choosing an open banking platform for your fintech innovation needs, security is an important consideration.Our focus on building trust, stewarding data and driving choice have and will continue to drive how Mastercard looks to the future.</p>

				  Managing Trust and Reputation via Trust Registries  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>“Who can be trusted to establish, sustain, and approve registry members?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many potential answers to this question, and it’s essential to consider when determining who will be responsible for creating, maintaining, and validating the registry. Managing Trust and Reputation via <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/trust-registries-explained/">Trust Registries</a> will be necessary for the future evolution of online ecosystems.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <blockquote>
<p>To create trust between members of an ecosystem, one of the most critical functions is confirming that a particular entity is a member of the ecosystem and therefore bound by its <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/services/digital-governance/">governance framework</a>‘s terms and accountability requirements. Trust Registries (or Trust Hubs) fulfill this role. They can be implemented in many ways, from traditional centralized directory services to federated registries to fully decentralized ledgers. All of them can function as credential registries. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> – Alex Preukschat and Drummond Reed.</p>

				 <p>An Issuer creates every credential – so knowing how that Issuer’s authority is established is crucial. Otherwise, a crafty teenager will create a DMV that issues driver’s licences that “look real” (i.e. the Credentials validate cryptographically and have data that make sense). Further, they may even create a fake website that fools folks. But with the concept of a Trust Registry, their efforts would fail.</p>
<p>We’ll get to a more detailed description of a Trust Registry. Still, in this case, all a law enforcement officer’s Digital Wallet needs to know is the list of official DIDs from each province/state/federal authority it recognizes.&nbsp; In other words, a concise list that doesn’t change.</p>
<p>To get lists of the Issuers (e.g. the actual DMV), a Wallet will need to be aware of the concept of Trust Registries (aka Trust Hubs).</p>
 
 The concept behind a Trust Registry is that a Wallet needs to know which decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to “trust” as a source of truth. At many levels, this “trust” translates to “authority” – knowing that somebody, centralized or decentralized, is responsible for maintaining a list of trusted DIDs. 
 
<p>A Wallet will need to know which Registries are to be trusted. Therefore, over time the community will need to have Trust Registries anchored by various means:</p>
 
 Legislative Authority. Many Vital Statistics and other government Issuers. They are authoritative due to their legislative authority. Examples of these include issuers of driver’s licences, hunting permits, building permits, passports, etc. 
 Community Authority. Some Trust Hubs will be created by communities, associations, etc., that exist through either a formal (similar to legislative) or de facto authority. Examples include a registry of licenced doctors; a registry of banks and credit unions; industry associations, local business improvement areas/chambers of commerce; etc. 
 Informal Authority. A Trust Hub should be able to exist with no formal authority. For example, we can imagine consolidated reputations (E.g. Uber &amp; Lyft combined; Yelp and TripAdvisor) that allow someone to aggregate reputation across platforms. It likely derives its authority from the larger community that “lends” its reputation to them. 
 
 Web of Trust 
<p>A Wallet’s Owner(s) needs to know that their Wallet is using the correct list of Trusted Issuers. Therefore a Wallet needs to be able to “explain” how it created the levels of Trust – and what anchored these trust levels. We can imagine the following chain of actions when we, as a homeowner, receive a bid folder from a renovation contractor:</p>
 
 We check our contractor’s business licence, which is anchored back to the province/state corporate registry. 
 We check their insurance certificate against a list of Issuers on a nationally maintained list of insurance companies – a trust registry. That list is anchored back to various province/state/federal registries that are the “source of truth” for insurance company establishment – another trust registry. 
 We check the training status of all of the company’s workers as they arrive to know that they have all the required certificates and training for the jobs that they are doing. 
 We check with the city to ensure our contractor is licensed to operate. The municipality maintains a trust registry of businesses. We back-check the city licence bureau against their master list of Issuer DIDs. The city has a master DID that signed that registry, pointing back to its legislative source of authority and the master list of municipalities for that province/state. 
 



Sovrin Web of Trust Model
The decentralized, non-hierarchical trust model defined by the Sovrin Governance Framework that combines a cryptographic trust layer achieved using the Sovrin Ledger, Agents and Connections with a human trust layer achieved via Credential Exchange. The Sovrin Web of Trust Model does not rely on a single root of trust, but empowers any Sovrin Entity to serve as a root of trust and enables all Sovrin Entities to participate in any number of interwoven Trust Communities, either informally or as defined by Domain-Specific Governance Frameworks. See the Sovrin Web of Trust Model white paper.&nbsp;


Sovrin Glossary



<p>That sounds like a lot of work, doesn’t it? Here’s the thing – we don’t have to do any of this ourselves. Our Digital Wallet should do this for us.</p>



STORY: A Home Renovation…



<p>Let’s imagine a home renovation project with three main groups to think about:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Homeowner 
 Contractor&nbsp; 
 City Inspector 
 
<p>Trust Hubs and Trust Registries allow us to know that the various shared credentials (e.g. proof of insurance) are real. A Homeowner can ask their Digital Wallet to verify an insurance Credential that the Contractor is real. Their Digital Wallet needs to prove a few things:</p>
 
 That the Contractor was the entity to which the Insurer (the Issuer) gave the Credential. Done inside the Contractor’s Digital Wallet – it uses cryptography to prove that they still control the insurance Credential.&nbsp; 
 That the Insurer cryptographically signed the Credential. This allows the Homeowner to know that the information wasn’t tampered with. 
 That the Insurer is a bona fide insurance company. There will need to be a Trust Hub that lists insurers for a particular area for this to happen. 
 
<p>All of the above can be done in just a few seconds, and other checks can be made simultaneously. Each party involved has their own pieces of information that they need to verify.</p>
 
 Homeowner wants to know that they have the proper permits and licences for the job and that their contractor and employees are fully licensed, insured, and up to scratch. 
 Contractor wants to know that the Homeowner has the proper permits, licence, inspections and insurance. 
 City Inspector wants to know that the Homeowner and Contractor have the required permits, training, and other paperwork.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Paper-based approaches to verifying the above take long enough that few Homeowners ever do the checks they should. Our Digital Wallets can get all of them done in seconds – even while we are greeting each other.</p>

<p>Strong Customer Authentication works to protect European users when accessing sensitive financial information, but your company may also need it for compliance.</p>
<p>What is strong customer authentication? Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a European requirement under Payment Services Directive (PSD2) that requires users to authenticate their account before logging in in order to prevent fraud when accessing their banking or making online purchases.</p>
 What Is Strong Customer Authentication and Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)? 
<p>In 2007, the European Union (EU) implemented the Payment Services Directive to support better security practices around electronic payments in participating countries. This helped protect consumer information but wasn’t suitable for advances in payment technology, specifically the rise of third-party payment processors.</p>
<p>In 2016, the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">EU enacted the Second Payment Services Directive</a> to promote a more integrated system of payment processing that would make it easier to work across EU borders, to promote competition in the payment processing market, and to enhance protection for EU consumers increasingly using digital and mobile payment options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This law applied specifically to three different types of services:</p>
 
 Account Information Services (AIS): These services provide consumers and businesses with information on their finances, either in a single account or across multiple accounts. 
 Payment Initiation Services (PIS): These services support online payments for merchants and consumers, including processing payments, communicating with merchants regarding the completion of transactions for the release of services, and other parts of digital payments.&nbsp; 
 Card-Based Payment Instruments: Third-party providers that offer card readers (whether through POS terminals or those connected to tablets or phones) that read information and communicate with credit accounts to verify fund availability.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Essentially, if a technology or organization handles transaction information, including card numbers and related information, it falls under PSD2 jurisdiction.</p>
<p>To govern the security of these services, PSD2 defines a few core requirements:</p>
 
 Strong Customer Authentication: Increased customer identification (described in detail later).&nbsp; 
 Transaction and Device Monitoring: Processors should provide monitoring for systems and devices to track unusual customer behaviors to prevent fraud.&nbsp; 
 Reliable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Providers must provide secure APIs so that merchants, banks, card networks, and the processors themselves can share consumer data securely for authentication and transaction.&nbsp; 
 
 What Is Strong Customer Authentication? 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/strong-authentication/">Strong Customer Authentication</a>, or SCA, is the most integral part of PSD2 in protecting consumer information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of payment processing, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication </a>is a bit different from other kinds of authentication. The purpose, in this context, is to help merchants and payment processors verify that users are who they claim to be in order to reduce fraud during transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, SCA requires that consumers must be authenticated for transactions using strong multi-factor authentication methods (MFA). More specifically, these consumers must be authenticated through methods comprised of at least two of the following categories:</p>
 
 Knowledge: Authentication methods of knowledge are those based on a piece of information that the user knows (either memorized or recorded). These include username/password combinations or PINs. 
 Possession: Authentication methods of possession are those based on methods of confirming possession of an application, account, or device. These methods include One-Time Passwords (OTPs) generated by authentication apps or PINs sent through email or SMS texts.&nbsp; 
 Inherence: Authentication methods of inherence are based on the user’s physical or behavioral (and relatively stable) aspects. These methods include iris scans, fingerprint scans, facial scans, etc. 
 
<p>Each measure must be completely independent for any two or more methods used for SCA. That is, if one is breached, it does not compromise the other. This means that a hacker can’t, for example, steal a password and gain access to a mechanism changing where a PIN is texted to–in this case, SCA would require that the hacker have both the password and the device to authenticate before changing either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In terms of PSD2, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/secure-authentication">secure authentication</a> can come from a variety of interactions. A common example is a consumer making a purchase through an app on their phone using payment information stored in the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To verify the user during the transaction, the app may rely on both knowledge (the user is signed into their account) and inherence (the user performs a facial scan from their phone at the point of purchase).&nbsp;</p>
 Dynamic Linking 
<p>Whenever a payment processor uses SCA, they must (under PSD2 regulations) also use “dynamic linking” during the transaction. This means that additional security measures are in place to link the transaction to a specific amount and security tokens to verify legitimacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dynamic linking includes the following steps:</p>
 
 The payer (consumer) must be made aware of the exact amount of the transaction and who the recipient of the payment is.&nbsp; 
 The payment method must generate an authentication code tied to the amount of the transaction and the recipient.&nbsp; 
 The payment service provider can derive the amount and recipient from that number once it reaches its destination. 
 If anything changes (amount or recipient) then the transaction automatically fails.&nbsp; 
 
 What Is 3D Secure 2 and How Does it Apply to SCA? 
<p>In general consumer payment processing in the United States, there isn’t an equivalent law that governs processing at the same scale as the EU. However, some private-sector solutions can meet SCA laws. One of these is 3D Secure 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This standard includes several necessary mechanisms that meet SCA standards, including:</p>
 
 Frictionless Authentication: 3D Secure allows payment providers to include more authentication information as a part of a transaction. Using secure channels, this data remains private but can be used to strengthen authentication through MFA while streamlining the entire process.&nbsp; 
 Challenge Flows: If the user/merchant transaction provides enough information for a bank or credit network to authenticate, they’ll authenticate. If not, the transaction will be challenged and require additional authentication information.&nbsp; 
 Various Data Points: 3D Secure 2 can collect several data points from apps and browsers to authenticate, including account information, biometric information, and device information, allowing for more secure and dynamic access. 
 
 Powerful Authentication to Meet SCA with 1Kosmos 
<p>The cornerstone of SCA and meeting PSD2 standards is having the authentication standards in place to collect the right information from the customer. Businesses and payment processors must do this while meeting consumers where they are–at their computers and at their mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mutual accountability between the individual and the community attempts to balance the following contradictions:</p>  We want to increase our own freedom and the freedom of others AND communities need to be able to protect themselves from bad actors<br>  Each person should be able to choose the context of their life and to do work that fulfills them AND communities need to be able to organize into something more than just a collection of individuals  <p>We designed Sovereign Accountable Commons (SACs) in order to embed mutual accountability in apps and organizations without needing blockchains to secure the integrity of the space. Because all Holochain apps inherently hold the code underlying SACs, any platform built on Holochain has the ability to follow the principles which we lay out in this article.</p><p>Despite this article's title, SACs would not do away with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) but rather provide a foundation for them to build on. DAO structures allow for action external to the collective of people making up the organization. They use contracts to form into an entity in the same manner as corporations, simply substituting legal contracts with smart contracts. Like other organizations a lot of their day-to-day activities happen outside the sphere of those contracts. In contrast, SACs allow for accountability and action internal to the group, across all platforms. This emphasizes the day-to-day while minimizing the role of contracts, only implementing them when strictly needed. </p><p>This article seeks to describe the main benefits of building decentralized organizations that follow the fundamentals of <a href="https://www.artbrock.com/2016/01/31/the-sovereign-accountable-commons">Sovereign Accountable Commons</a>. Starting with DAOs we consider where decentralized organizations using blockchains fall short of their aspirations, following we propose SACs as a potential solution, and finally we walk through the example use case of a community agreement and its evolution.</p> A Word on DAOs <p>DAO’s promise a way for individuals to collectively own and manage internet-native enterprises. Many speak of collaboration and community. They seek a future where everyone has the ability to access communities of their choosing and to lead lives as free agents, uninhibited by the rule of institutions, governments, and third parties. We applaud this drive for freedom. However, we often see DAOs fall short with their aversion to the messy parts of human organizing and community building. </p><p>The DAO’s external actions function autonomously via smart contracts based on votes, tokenomics, or the community’s other power distribution mechanisms. Internally though we often find a deficit in the community’s ability to manage conflict. Further, the reliance on coded and autonomous action creates an environment where the individual and the collective are estranged. Rather than a community, we find a collection of individuals in competition with each other for support of their ideas and motions. All this is embodied in the explicit trustlessness of on-chain operations. In contrast, the felt community and its day-to-day activities and decisions of many DAOs actually exists in the centralized off-chain world of forums and Discord channels, belying the very premise of these organizations. &nbsp;</p><p>SACs attempt to bridge this gap. Rather than pushing the hard parts of collaboration and organization to deterministic, coded solutions, we seek instead to use code-enhanced spaces and sense-making tools to support individuals in co-creating community and digging into the messy parts of human interaction.</p> What is a Sovereign Accountable Commons <p>Sovereign Accountable Commons are coded spaces following a set of fundamental principles in order to collectivize interaction, forming a space where the interests and actions of the individual and the collective don’t collide, but rather mutually reinforce each other.</p><p>As a structure implemented in a digital medium a SAC requires these fundamental properties: </p>  Mutually consented to rulesets which allow peers to operate in a context of equity and clarity.  Accountability via an uncapturable medium of communication and interaction.  The ability to walkaway (fork), with data held in common.  <p>Note that these three principles require each other in order to provide the desired outcome. Let’s examine these properties in more detail. </p><p>Communities begin simply as collections of individuals, which grow to be more than the sum of their parts because of their interaction patterns. Starting from the common ground of explicitly shared, transparent, mutually consented rulesets lays the groundwork for individual alignment with the group. Historically, the rules of physical social spaces have evolved to distribute power to particular people. They inequitably dictate who can speak when, who will be heard, and who will receive benefit. Breaking this equity failure for digital spaces requires a new capacity that begins with and maintains the ability to be explicit about the rules of engagement. </p><blockquote>Starting from the common ground of explicitly shared, transparent, mutually consented rulesets lays the groundwork for individual alignment with the group.</blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/unenclosable-carriers-and-the-future-of-communication-2/">Uncapturable mediums of communication</a> create the conditions for transparency. Think of sitting around a campfire. Everyone can speak and no one can snatch another’s words out of the air. To disrupt someone’s speaking you must speak over them; you must act openly in the public sphere. The exercise of power becomes transparent in the medium and thus makes it uncapturable. In contrast, we can see an example of capture with Amazon banning particular words in their warehouse worker’s internal communications in order to disable attempts at unionizing. The company and workers have asymmetric abilities to communicate and control information, and hold asymmetric relationships to the visibility of that control. </p><p>Accountability requires us to be able to tell accurate stories about what has happened, and everyone’s voices matter to attain that accuracy. SACs enforce individual’s accountability to each other and their community by having everyone sign everything they say and do, thus recording it in the public sphere. Similarly, because of the consent, transparency, and common-ground of the communications medium, the community becomes accountable to its individual members. If one member is treated unfairly, the community cannot hide it, not even from other communities. Accountability in SACs comes from:</p>  Provenance: knowing who said and did what. SACs achieve this through the signing of all speech acts similar to how transactions are signed on the blockchain.  Clarity: defining the meanings of particular words, actions, and community norms in order to enable the recording of not only what members say but what they mean.  Membranes: defining the borders of a community (processes of access and removal in the community, transparency of different information, etc.). The group holds both the barriers and affordances to cross between different spaces in common agreement. This provides a context for interaction.   <p>When a context no longer suits part of a community they also have the option of walkaway which helps to maintain consent through the right to disagree. Each member has the ability to fork the community or join another, taking their data and the public data of the community with them. A non-trivial action, we will explore community forking further in the upcoming article Walkaway or Why Forking Matters. </p><p>A SAC that maintains these fundamental properties can take many forms — chat applications or social media platforms come to mind as obvious examples because of the way this description of SACs focuses on social interaction. But a mapping application can benefit from the same principles, as can a film review site or any form of application we might term a “platform”.</p><p>DAOs can also benefit from these fundamentals. In order for these principles to apply across the entirety of the DAO, all digital activities of the organization should be performed on SAC compliant applications. This ensures continuity and keeps members accountable equally to what they post on the community forum as well as their votes on issues of treasury management. As all Holochain applications are inherently SAC compliant, DAO’s built on Holochain have easy access to these benefits.</p>SACs enable new possabilities for the individual (Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@blackodc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Su San Lee</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>) Benefits to the Individual: SACs for a Freer Society <p>We desire a freer society where everybody has the ability to choose their own work and right placement — freedom of action and association. With SACs we aim to create an underlying structure, a set of principles for systems of communication and organization in digital space, intended to allow greater freedom and to increase one’s ability to consent to relationships rather than being forced into them by the power of institutions. DAOs are, however, institutions. They are organizations of people who come together to do something collectively that no one person could do on their own. As we go on to describe, following the principles of SACs would allow for a more consensual environment as the proliferation of social spaces provides participants with alternative organizations.</p><blockquote>This fundamentally challenges the monopoly on the internet by large corporate players that dictate the terms of engagement</blockquote><p>In a SAC the rules of a community become clear, available to any, and mutually created/consented to. Because of this, people gain the ability to choose communities that suit their needs and avoid those that don’t. The capacity to easily create new communities through simple setup protocols and especially walkaway, will greatly increase the variety of communities to join. This fundamentally challenges the monopoly on the internet by large corporate players that dictate the terms of engagement. </p><p>This would lead to right placement: arrangements and relationships where individuals find alignment between their particular skills, desires, and the needs of their community. Sometimes we know more about what we don’t want than what we do want, so SACs can support the discovery process of moving people towards right placement through a combination of engagement and optionality. As communities would not have leverage to force anyone to do what they do not consent to, the pressure to work as a part of the community without the demand then acts to filter people into activities that bring them joy. </p><p>Similarly, to quote James Carse in his book Finite and Infinite Games: “Whoever must play, cannot play.” Thus, choice is a necessary precondition to play. SACs then aim to create room for play through the proliferation of choice and consensual engagement. The ability to collectively rewrite the rules intends to provide infinite spaces and iterations for play, while at the same time building particular contexts for creativity to emerge within. </p><p>Imagine a DAO built out of multiple apps running on these fundamentals. People would self-select into communities rather than out of them. With many options for other communities to select into, community members can actually consent to participate rather than having that participation be a necessity. And through an ease of customization, each person can use the version of the apps that they prefer, editing and augmenting as needed to create their ideal digital environment. Building a social space together as a shared commitment, groups can design an experience of meaningful work and community. Each part of the DAO would enable this because the whole structure constantly realigns towards these principles.</p>SACs help align people's needs and enable communities. (Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alinnnaaaa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Alina Grubnyak</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>) Benefits to the Organization/Community: SACs for an Accountable Society <p>The set of tools that communities gain through SACs center on remedying the breakdowns in understanding that arise when no longer communicating face to face. Foremost of these is accountability. The tools of provenance and clarity allow the community to mediate and work through disagreements that participants have with each other by finding shared meaning and intent behind the participant’s actions and statements. This transformative justice based response leads to healing rifts in the community. When membranes become involved it is to limit harm and if necessary remove a community member, but the system first acts to add clarity and create shared contexts.</p><p>Other tools, like those developed with <a href="http://emergingleaderlabs.org/Gameshifting_Overview">Gameshifting</a>, can be used in conjunction with SACs and aim to assist in setting the context of communication, allowing participants to signal their comfort and understanding in a conversation, shift through the different stages of a discussion, and determine the methods used to make decisions. </p><blockquote>Communities form out of active participation and interaction. By building shared meaning, communities define themselves.</blockquote><p>SACs seek to make the processes and context of discussion, decision, and community explicit. As addressed previously, the current DAO space views the technical processes as paramount and sees access to a platform equivalent to participation in a community. We see the inverse as true. Communities form out of active participation and interaction. By building shared meaning, communities define themselves. In a decentralized space, openingly accessible and editable rulesets, combined with the accountability of membranes, provide a path towards this sort of meaning making. Thus, these aspects of the technical system would provide a space for communities to work through the difficult social dynamics of being in relationship to each other. </p><p>We also find the double meaning of accountability important here. Not just accounting for the motion of tokens, but now also the interactions of speech and intent. The metaphor of accountability refers to both bookkeeping and storytelling. Through the development of non-monetary currencies, which tell stories about how resources get used, a DAO can go beyond market based methods for collectively managing resources. </p><p>Take a watershed for example. A DAO set up to manage water use over hundreds of miles will face difficulties if it only concerns itself with the amount of water which gets used, ignoring information about the how, where, and why. Water, a partially rivalrous good, is free to share, but mismanaging it hurts everyone using it. Broader ecological questions would also come into play, as would divisions of power and governance in subject specific matters based, for instance, on Indigenous groups’ ancestral claim to the land and its management. A DAO used for this purpose might need stricter membranes and governance systems; the DAO might also need to develop new ways of accounting, utilizing unique, shifting metrics for understanding water use. Clarity and consent as well as the evolvability of the community’s rules and organization enable all of this, from the development of metacurrencies to contextual distributions of power based not on token ownership but rather deeper social relationships and connections to particular issues.</p><p>Evolution serves as a useful metaphor across SACs. Because SACs utilize DNA-like grammars — code blocks that enmesh themselves to create particular contexts — communities and applications alike can grow and change as their macro-social context does. The coded grammar of the app/platform/DAO does not need to remain the same but can rather be added to, changed, or fractured off to create something new. While our watershed DAO might have more issues forking because of the relationships to power in meatspace, it can still evolve over time, for instance to account for new ways of measuring the ecological impact of a dam. The DAO does not have to bind itself to one currency or system of value because SACs maintain integrity even as they shift their protocols and methods of accounting.</p> Example of a Community Agreement in Flux: <p>Let’s quickly consider how SACs help to mediate and enable the merging of protocols and social processes. <br><br>A community can define any number of governance methods for different processes depending on their needs, but SACs always require a few key stages for the editing of their rulesets in order to maintain consent and clarity. Define: the stage of initial proposal and proposition to the community. Refine: the stage of edits and adaptations, whatever the community input mechanism. Align: final decision making and enactment of the new rules, whether determined by consensus, a representative vote, or otherwise. This outlines a standard that defines the process the community uses to edit standards and forms the base for all other governance in the community. The recursivity embedded in this structure allows the social and the protocolary to coexist and maintain their flexibility. </p><blockquote>In order to collectively remedy the issue, the community does not punish either member for the conflict but rather starts a process to mediate their misunderstanding and to develop greater clarity for the future.</blockquote><p>Take the hypothetical example of a community that set in their initial charter the phrase “we will treat all members with respect”. Sometime later a member accuses another of treating them disrespectfully. Documentation of their interactions is available for all to audit, but there remains a lack of clarity on what respect entails. Perhaps cultural understandings of respect clash, each participant working from different traditions of what constitutes “appropriate manners.” In order to collectively remedy the issue, the community does not punish either member for the conflict but rather starts a process to mediate their misunderstanding and to develop greater clarity for the future. This starts with defining what respect means and what it means to act towards each other with respect. This initial definition would then be refined through community input, perhaps in this case particular input coming from discussions with the members in conflict to rectify the confusion that initiated their dispute. Other input might come from a comment period or a survey managed by predefined parties. Finally the community either accepts or rejects the proposal in the alignment phase. These stages focus on the social, but translate that process to effect code. Whatever the social governance process, the accountability mechanisms of SACs keep the system secure.</p> Conclusion <p>To sum up, we see Sovereign Accountable Commons as a set of principles that ensure clarity and accountability within and across platforms. DAOs, in particular, have the opportunity to benefit from these principles and their corresponding protocols because they allow for interactions and assurances previously only possible with in-person organizing. By allowing DAOs to move beyond protocolary design, we can bring the social contexts of community into digital governance. </p><blockquote>By allowing DAOs to move beyond protocolary design, we can bring the social contexts of community into digital governance.</blockquote><p>We see SACs as an infrastructure that equally benefits the individual and the organization. By working to align the mutual goals of those two parties, SACs minimize the effects of conflict while emphasizing its benefits. By creating a container for mediated conflict, communities can safely engage in productive iteration. As communities evolve, individuals can seek out right placement, doing the work that best benefits the community while also being personally fulfilled. </p><p>While built from a limited set of base principles, SACs open up many new areas of inquiry and design. Stay tuned for upcoming articles on Soft DAOs, the art of forking, uncapturable carriers, and more.</p>

<p>In today’s digital landscape, the people of India contribute significantly to digital transactions and the resultant data generation. However, until now, there is no formal framework for managing this data, and the ownership, privacy, security, and consent that comes with&nbsp;them.</p><p>All that will likely change with the introduction of a new technology standard called ORGANS. In particular, ORGANS enables individuals to give their consent for using their data in a specific way. In addition, it empowers individuals to own their data and selectively share it with just the entities they want, thereby preserving their data’s privacy and security.</p><p>Read on to know all about the ORGANS standard and how it can change the way companies collect data from individuals.</p> What is the ORGANS Framework? <p>ORGANS is an acronym&nbsp;for,</p>  O -&gt; Open Standards  R -&gt; Revocable by individuals  G -&gt;&nbsp;Granular  A -&gt; Auditable  N -&gt; Notice to all parties&nbsp;involved  S -&gt;&nbsp;Secure  <p>Let’s talk a bit about each of these attributes.</p> Open Standards <p>Interoperability is a crucial building block as it enables different systems and organizations to “talk” to each other and better process the information that flows through them. This interoperability is essential in our current Web 2.0 and future Web 3.0 apps because it enables data to be shared easily across systems. When all organizations embrace the open standards envisioned in ORGANS, data flow and usability will be seamless.</p> Revocable <p>Data privacy is all about putting individuals in control of their data. With ORGANS, every user can determine their data usage and, more importantly, enjoy the choice to revoke access to their data&nbsp;anytime.</p> Granular <p>Personal data comes in many forms, from email addresses to employment letters. Users must have the option to selectively share only data that’s pertinent for a specific use case. For example, if a user has to submit proof of age to enter a nightclub, then date of birth alone is enough. The user doesn’t even have to share their first and last&nbsp;name.</p><p>This ability to share just the required data is an essential part of preserving the data privacy of individuals.</p> Auditable <p>The data shared by individuals should be readable by humans and machines for quick, easy, and cost-effective verification. Also, the organization collecting the data can store the confirmations in secure records/logs (machine and human-readable form) for easy reference and auditing.</p> Notice <p>ORGANS advocates transparency and accountability in data sharing and handling. To this end, ORGANS emphasizes sending notices to all concerned parties if data changes, is revoked,&nbsp;etc.</p> Secure <p>Any application built on the ORGANS framework must be secure by design. Though ORGANS doesn’t lay down specific technologies for implementing security, it’s safe to say that many next-gen technologies like verifiable credentials fit this requirement.</p><p>In a nutshell, ORGANS is a framework for creating applications that promote data ownership, privacy, and security.</p> What does ORGANS mean for&nbsp;you? <p>You may wonder how ORGANS can change your data privacy and security as a user. Simply put, you go from accepting the terms and conditions of an online service to determining what data organizations can use, for how long, and for what purpose. As a result, you create and share portable digital identities and credentials while staying in control of your data continuously.</p><p>Source: NITI</p><p>From an organization’s standpoint, building applications based on ORGANS can be a game-changer for your business. These futuristic applications not only put data privacy at the heart of your operations, but can also help you earn the trust of your customers. Not to mention that such applications will meet future compliance standards and can, overall, provide a competitive advantage for your organization.</p> Affinidi’s Consent&nbsp;Manager <p>Affinidi’s Consent Manager follows the ORGANS principles to empower you to create consent policies and handle your customers’ consent for using your services and applications. This plug-and-play solution can integrate with your existing or future applications and scale well with your business&nbsp;growth.</p><p>For more details on how you can use Affinidi’s Consent Manager, please <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/consent-manager-early-access">reach out to&nbsp;us</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/understand-the-organs-framework-before-building-privacy-preserving-apps-cfc00e00a90c">Understand the ORGANS Framework Before Building Privacy-Preserving Apps</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

In this week’s recap, we will look at ECB’s new guidelines over crypto asset licensing, compulsory pre-registration undertaking for Canadian virtual assets exchanges, the South Korean financial authority’s decision to ban sixteen exchanges, and a yearly crypto investment limit set by two Ontario-based exchanges. So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.‍</p><p>Don’t forget to subscribe to our weekly recap post, comment, and&nbsp;share!</p> ‍ECB Releases new Guidelines for Streamlining Crypto Asset Licensing Across the 27 Nation Economic&nbsp;Bloc <p>Last Wednesday, the European Central Bank (ECB) <a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2022/html/ssm.nl220817_2.en.html">released criteria</a> they are considering to streamline digital asset regulations as the crypto-related activities and services are currently not governed by a unified regulatory framework in the&nbsp;EU.</p><p>The European central bank will take into account the internal governance, crypto firms’ business models, and “fit and proper” assessments in line with the licensing mechanism that other corporations have to&nbsp;follow.</p><p>This new guideline is a big step toward ensuring financial stability in the 27-nation economic bloc, considering how several banks are seeking permission to offer crypto services and products.</p><p><a href="https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/publications/newsletter/2022/html/ssm.nl220817_2.en.html">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Canadian Regulators Asks Crypto Platforms to Provide Pre-Registration Undertaking <p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) announced that crypto trading platforms from now on should provide pre-registration undertakings in order to continue operating while their application is being considered.</p><p>“By giving these undertakings, crypto trading platforms agree to comply with terms and conditions that address investor protection concerns,” the announcement states.</p><p>Currently, the initial pre-registration undertakings of Coinsquare Capital Markets Ltd. and Crypto.com are published by the Ontario Securities Commission.</p><p>But, CSA is also negotiating pre-registration filings with other crypto trading platforms that will be made available on the CSA&nbsp;website.</p><p>If a crypto trading platform fails to file an undertaking or does not adhere to the requirements of an undertaking, CSA may pursue legal action against the&nbsp;firm.</p><p><a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-expect-commitments-from-crypto-trading-platforms-pursuing-registration/">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> South Korea to Ban 16 Unregistered Crypto Exchanges <p>The South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has announced that it will ban sixteen unregistered crypto exchanges providing services to its citizens without authorization.</p><p>According to the press <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/78319">release</a>, KuCoin, MEXC, Phemex, XT.com, Bitrue, ZB.com, Bitglobal, CoinW, CoinEX, AAX, ZoomEX, Poloniex, BTCEX, BTCC, DigiFinex, and Pionex are under FSC’s&nbsp;radar.</p><p>The officials were concerned about the crypto exchanges’ lack of the information security management system (ISMS) certificate, which puts consumers at risk of having their personal data compromised.</p><p>South Korean authorities view the involvement of unregistered financial institutions as a severe breach of&nbsp;law.</p><p>Any unregistered firms engaging in illicit economic activities in South Korea carry a sentence of up to five years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million won ($38,000).</p><p><a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/78319">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p> Ontario Crypto Exchanges Slaps CA$30k Annual Limit on&nbsp;Altcoins <p>Recently, Canada-based crypto exchanges Newton and BitBuy <a href="https://help.newton.co/hc/en-us/articles/8216687424915-What-are-these-new-regulatory-changes-August-2022-">announced</a> a CA$30K annual ‘buy limit’ for ‘restricted coins’ for Ontario&nbsp;users.</p><p>According to the new rules by Newton, users in Ontario will have a CA$30,000 “net buy limit” on all cryptocurrencies, except for Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin&nbsp;(LTC).</p><p>According to Newton, these adjustments are being made to “protect crypto investors like yourselves” and ensure that investors are informed of the risks involved with investing in digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Users will be categorized as Retail Investors, Eligible Investors, or Sophisticated Investors.</p><p>The buy limit for retail investors is CA$30,000, whereas, for eligible investors, it’s CA$100,000, and for accredited investors, there is no buy&nbsp;limit.</p><p><a href="https://help.newton.co/hc/en-us/articles/8216687424915-What-are-these-new-regulatory-changes-August-2022-">Read more&nbsp;here</a></p><p>‍There’s no stopping the regulatory blitzkrieg. In fact, the authorities have just begun, and there is a lot more to come. Speaking of regulations, the most important piece of crypto regulation is the Travel Rule. Although only a few countries have adopted it currently, the day is not far when most countries will adopt it. After all, FATF is urging countries to adopt it on an urgent basis. That is why Virtual Asset Service Providers must prepare for the Travel Rule compliance regardless of their home country’s Travel Rule adoption&nbsp;status.‍</p><p>All VASPS will need for Travel Rule Compliance is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS).

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p><p>I am often asked “does using a cloud service alter risk?” I always reply to this question with “well it depends”. Every organization has its own set of circumstances, and the answer needs to take these into account. It is also important to think about how the responsibility for security is shared between the service provider and the customer. This blog outlines the core business risks and what organizations need to consider.</p>
 Business Risks 
<p>While much discussion focusses on the technical risks, at the business level there are three distinct cyber risks, and using cloud services can have an impact on all of these.</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – the more organizations depend upon their IT services, the greater the impact any service outage or cyber incident will have. 
 Data breaches – data is now the most important business asset, and any loss of intellectual property or sensitive and regulated data will have a serious impact. 
 Compliance failure – organizations are now faced with a wide range of obligations coming from a tidal wave of regulation and legislation. Failure to comply with these will lead to sanctions. 
 
 IT Service Infrastructure 
<p>Poorly secured service infrastructure can result in all of the above business risks, and securing that infrastructure against all the potential risks is challenging. The large cloud service providers have the skills and resources to secure their infrastructure to a level beyond that possible for many enterprises. <br>For example, many small businesses run their IT services in environments with poor physical security. They may have little or no control over physical access or protection against fire and floods, and disruptions to the power supply or communications networks. This is described eloquently in a presentation by Mark Evans entitled: The reasons why RLB moved to the cloud. All the major cloud services provide their services from datacentres with strong controls over all of those aspects.&nbsp; <br>However, there is still a residual risk because <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU">some cloud services have been impacted</a> by disruptions, and the customer always needs to consider this.</p>
 Data Confidentiality 
<p>Data is the most important business asset of the modern enterprise and needs to be protected against unauthorized access and changes. Its confidentiality and integrity can be compromised while it is in transit, in storage, and being processed, and using cloud services places all three of these outside of the customer’s direct control. <br>Organizations must evaluate these risks based on the sensitivity of their data and ensure that it is appropriately protected both on premises as well as in the cloud. Organizations using cloud services should protect their sensitive and regulated data using certified strong encryption algorithms and implement strong controls to protect the encryption keys. Cloud services must provide capabilities to help their customers protect their data as well as supporting the various technologies that the customers may adopt.</p>
 Data Resilience 
<p>Loss of access to your business data would have a severe impact. The prevalence of ransomware attacks has emphasized the need for data resilience. In addition, the changes in working patterns following the COVID-19 pandemic have also increased organizational dependency on cloud services.&nbsp; <br>There is a temptation to believe that the use of a cloud service removes the need for the customer to consider the resilience of their data. The responsibility for data held in cloud services is shared between the tenant and the service provider, and there are many situations where the tenant is responsible for the resilience of their data. For example, while many cloud services promise very high levels of data resilience, these do not cover the data being deleted by the customer. <br>Whether or not you use a cloud service you need to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80762/cloud-backup-and-disaster-recovery">back up your data</a> and have a<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/incident-response-management"> tested disaster recovery plan</a>.</p>
 Service Access Management 
<p>Controlling which people and which devices can access your assets is a fundamental security control. It is your responsibility to control access to your business services and data, whether or not, they are held in the cloud. This is an essential part of a Zero Trust approach. <br>Virtualized services such as those delivered from the cloud add a new challenge in this area. The virtual service elements need access to each other and the service infrastructure, and failure to manage this can lead to data breaches. An example of this led to a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/capital-one-to-pay-190m-settlement-in-data-breach-linked-to-seattle-woman/#:~:text=Capital%20One%20Financial%20agreed%20to,and%20stole%20their%20personal%20information.">data breach and a large financial penalty</a>. <br>Many organizations have mature processes and technologies in place to manage access to their on-premises services. However, these may not be well integrated with their use of cloud services. This is especially important in the area of privilege management.</p>
 Privilege Management 
<p>Managing IT services uses <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80636/privileged-access-management">accounts with privileged access</a>, and it is vital to control these. These accounts are the targets of cyber attackers – since they provide a route into the organization’s IT infrastructure. They can be misused by insiders, and even a simple mistake can have a severe impact on the business-critical service. <br>The cloud service provider needs these accounts to manage their service and there are concerns that these could be used to access the cloud customers’ assets. In particular, there are concerns that governments could legally demand that the cloud service provider turn over their customers’ data. This is effectively the risk underlying the Schrems II judgement.&nbsp; <br>In addition, where many departments with a large organization use the same cloud service, there will be many local administrators. The scope of these administrators’ privileges should be limited to prevent malice or mistakes from affecting other parts of the service.</p>
 Complexity 
<p>The more complex the system, the more difficult it may be to protect. One argument for using a cloud service is that it provides a consistent environment and together with application modernization using containers it reduces complexity. Unfortunately, most organizations now have a hybrid environment using multiple clouds as well as on premises delivery of business applications. <br>This hybrid environment is even more complex because each cloud has its own security model and associated tools. According to the <a href="https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR">Cloud Migration Stats - 2022 Flexera State of the Cloud Report</a> the top challenges are trustworthiness with security, risk and compliance as well as cost management. These challenges stem from the added complexity from the multiple environments.&nbsp; <br>Organizations need to adopt a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/security-fabric-modernizes-cybersecurity">security fabric</a> paradigm to assist with this complexity.</p>
 Transparency 
<p>For highly regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals the issue is transparency of cloud service controls. In these industries, it essential to be able to prove the existence and effectiveness of controls to demonstrate compliance. Currently it is not practical for the large CSPs to allow tenants to audit the services they use, and so tenants must rely on independent third-party attestations that the services comply with standards and regulations. This is an inhibitor to the take up of cloud services in these sectors. <br>Cloud service providers will need to provide much greater transparency around their controls. This should be done in a way that allows an organization using the service to map both their own controls and the controls in the service to their compliance obligations. This should ideally be automated, for example through APIs, in a way that allows compliance to be monitored in near real time. Some cloud vendors are moving towards this to meet <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/a-sovereign-cloud-is-about-more-than-just-privacy">cloud sovereignty </a>obligations.</p>
 Summary 
<p>The business risks associated with the use of cloud services depend upon several factors. The cloud is only one service delivery model in today’s complex hybrid, multi cloud IT environment. Organizations should consider at least the aspects described above in their own context. KuppingerCole can provide advisory services to help find the best approach for your organization.

 Keeping abreast of the different EU online gambling rules and requirements can be confusing, time-consuming, and incredibly expensive. Here’s how IDV solutions can help organizations easily follow multiple countries’ compliance regulations. 



<p>The popularity of online gambling continues to rise, despite the introduction of diverse and increasingly complicated regulations, and severe risks surrounding identity fraud.</p>



<p>In the UK, it comprises nearly <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/taking-a-more-in-depth-look-at-online-gambling">40% of the overall gambling market</a>, while in Europe online gambling is growing at <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/behind-the-success-of-the-growing-european-online-gambling-market-301187049.html">around 10% per year</a>. According to the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/resource-post/european-online-gambling-key-figures-2021-edition/">European Betting &amp; Gaming Association (EBGA)</a>, the market value of online gambling is expected to reach more than €29.3 billion by the end of 2022.</p>



<p>The recent increase in online gambling can be explained by a) the Covid effect, increasing the time people spend online, and b) <a href="https://1883magazine.com/biggest-european-casino-trends-for-2022/">technological advancements</a> that enable gamblers to bet anytime, anywhere.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/a-wintertime-world-cup-and-its-impact-on-online-betting/">Qatar World Cup 2022</a> coming up, and hundreds of new online casinos opening every single day, the rapid increase in online gambling shows no signs of slowing.</p>



<p>However, gambling operators have a balancing act to handle when it comes to offering frictionless onboarding processes, maintaining high conversion rates, and meeting all licensing requirements.</p>



 Regulations, risks, and rewards 



<p>As there is no uniform legislation in the EU that governs gambling services, each member state is autonomous and free to regulate how they see fit. For example, some countries allow all types of gambling, while others <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/cyprus/gaming/1147366/gambling-laws-in-europe">restrict certain forms</a> such as only permitting poker or casino games, for example.</p>



<p>Keeping abreast of regulatory differences can be confusing, time-consuming, and expensive. Some of the most common gambling regulations concern age limits, which means verifying the age of players is essential in preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>. There are also specific national and regional laws that gaming operators must follow. Find out more in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/">overview of both the EU &amp; UK Online Gambling Regulations</a>.</p>



<p>The rewards for capitalizing on this growing market are extraordinary (an industry expected to be worth over <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/10/2460420/0/en/Online-Gambling-Betting-Market-Worth-USD-172-23-Billion-by-2030-Growth-Size-Share-Revenue-Drivers-Trends-Opportunities-Challenges-Top-Players-Regional-Analysis-Types-Applications.html#:~:text=Online%20Gambling%20%26%20Betting%20Market%20Worth%20USD%20172.23%20Billion">US$172 billion by 2030</a>), however, the risks are high as well.</p>



<p>As with many online platforms, online gambling poses an increased risk of fraud and security breaches than traditional gambling as criminals have set their sights on this industry. They have been known to set up fake online casinos or hack the mainline casinos to steal sensitive information.</p>



<p>There are also additional social responsibility concerns with online gambling, as it is considered to be a <a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/release/new-study-shows-online-gambling-more-addictive-casino-gambling">much more addictive</a> form of gambling, due to the increased likelihood of it turning into a habitual part of a consumer’s everyday life, like watching television.</p>



<p>Online gambling can also be used to launder money, with criminal gangs choosing online platforms to transfer money anonymously.</p>



<p>Operators must therefore adhere to online gambling regulations to not only protect their customers, but their organization from being exploited for criminal purposes. If they do not, they run the very real risk of fines, or even being banned from the marketplace.</p>



<p>Commenting on the recent <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/online-operator-leovegas-fined-gbp1-2-million">£1.32 million fine</a> of gambling operator, LeoVegas, Leanne Oxley, Gambling Commission Director of Enforcement and Intelligence, said, “We identified this through focused compliance activity, and we will continue to take action against other operators if they do not learn the lessons our enforcement work is providing.</p>



<p>“This case is a further example of operators failing to protect customers and failing to be alive to money laundering risks within their business.”</p>



<p>LeoVegas was found to have exhibited social responsibility failures, including not setting an enforced 45-minute break following six hours of use, and anti-money laundering failures, such as financial triggers for anti-money laundering reviews being too high.</p>



 







 Need for speed 



<p>With so many regulatory risks associated with online gambling, it is understandable if gambling operators decide to cash in their chips and focus on a different line of business.</p>



<p>Businesses that do enter the online gambling market, and comply with regulations, are also often plagued by sluggish UI, and poor customer experience. In fact, <a href="https://egr.global/compliance/news/report-up-to-30-of-online-gambling-customers-abandon-sign-up-process/">research</a> shows that 30% of online gamblers have abandoned the onboarding process when registering a new account with a gambling website due to its complicated sign-up processes.</p>



<p>The importance of offering a fast and smooth, multi-jurisdictional, and KYC-compliant onboarding experience cannot be overstated. As every potential customer needs to be verified before being allowed to gamble, players will no doubt flock to the website or gambling platform that can verify their information the quickest. This need for speed is becoming increasingly important in both the KYC, and online gambling arenas. If player onboarding is too complicated, or has too many hurdles, organizations run a real risk of <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/security-and-risk/2018/online-gambling-authentication-security-digital-identification/">significant drop-off</a>.</p>



 How to leverage IDV and KYC for a better and safer online gambling experience 



<p>Although it may seem overwhelming, implementing a robust KYC procedure should be seen as an opportunity to offer a better and safer customer experience, and the first step in a productive working relationship between an ID verification company and online gambling operator.</p>



<p>This partnership can help operators meet the many challenges associated with verifying customers’ identities, while ensuring their users practice <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">responsible gaming</a>. It can also help in perhaps one of the most crucial aims of IDV: fraud prevention.</p>



<p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">the UK saw an increase of 43% in online gambling fraud</a>, and, since fraudulent gambling activity spikes during major sporting events, now is the time to implement a KYC procedure, before the Qatar World Cup 2022.</p>



<p>IDnow offers a seamless onboarding process, reducing verification times and increasing compliance with all major European regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, for example, uses artificial intelligence to check security features on ID documents, with a key focus on security.</p>



<p>As the leading European identity verification provider, IDnow’s solutions have a proven track record of success, providing conversion rates of up to 90%, and are not only compliant within the DACH and UK markets, but assist rapid scalability with compliance in 195 countries and support in over 30 languages. IDnow can be trusted to deliver security, support, engagement with regulators, and the prospect of global scalability.</p>



<p>Leveraging IDV and KYC will allow gambling operators to offer a safe, secure and friction-less experience, which is a win-win, for the business and the consumer.</p>

<p>The work of Mydex CIC has been recognised by the Community Interest Company Regulator in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-interest-companies-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022/cic-regulator-annual-report-2021-to-2022">latest Annual&nbsp;Report</a>.</p><p>The report notes how CICs have grown in vision and ambition, demonstrated resilience over the pandemic and branched out into many new and unexpected fields. Some, including Mydex, are now thinking at an international level.</p><p>To highlight these developments the Report also includes case studies that illustrate this expanding vision and ambition. One of them is from Mydex CIC. It&nbsp;says:</p><blockquote>Mydex CIC will be turning 15 years old this year. In our time, many people have been surprised to discover we are a CIC as we don’t fit their expectations of what a ‘normal’ CIC looks like, for many&nbsp;reasons.</blockquote><blockquote>First, our mission revolves around digital technologies and, specifically, personal data. Our goal is to empower citizens with their own data by providing them with personal data stores that enable them to collect, use and share their own data independently of the organisations that traditionally collect data about us. We operate at the cutting edge of new technologies.</blockquote><blockquote>Secondly, unlike many CICs which operate locally, to fulfil our mission we need to operate at scale — providing personal data stores to every citizen in the country&nbsp;… and, as we grow, across many countries. Our ambitions are both national and international.</blockquote><blockquote>Thirdly, we don’t just provide front line services. We are building data storage and sharing infrastructure that could become a part of how the entire economy works. Our mission is long-term, unfolding over decades, not just&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>Finally, the way we do good is multifaceted. We don’t only help individuals protect their privacy; we enable social inclusion, use data to tackle social problems such as poverty, and redress the balance of power between citizens and global data behemoths. We are also helping to unleash economy-wide economic benefits — reducing the costs that both citizens and service providers incur in collecting and using personal&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>So why, given these differences, do we think CIC status is important? One strategically vital reason is that in our field of personal data, demonstrating trustworthiness is essential to achieving our mission. It’s easy for organisations to make high-falutin’ statements about ‘consumer empowerment’ or ‘privacy protection’. Legally embedding such things into everything you do is a different matter.</blockquote><blockquote>A second reason follows. When push comes to shove, our society and economy rests on two main types of enterprise: companies seeking to maximise their profits and organisations that rely on subsidies from one source or another. Huge untapped opportunities lie between these extremes, with viable, sustainable enterprises that cover their costs, are not reliant on handouts and may make a profit — but whose main function and impact is to maximise positive external social and economic benefits. We believe that the CIC model allows us to point to the potential of a new and different economic model, and we are glad to be a part of&nbsp;it.</blockquote> The missing&nbsp;middle <p>In its report, the Regulator notes that over 26,000 CICs are now operating in the UK. They’re beginning to impact the way the economy works. But their potential impact reaches much further than this — into the very way we think about economics itself.</p><p>In Mydex’s view, society’s current understanding of what makes an enterprise economically successful is both wrong and damaging. Stated simply, this understanding is that an enterprise’s economic success is measured by the profits it&nbsp;makes.</p><p>A moment’s thought soon reveals this to be nonsense. Take two insurance companies. One is a Mafia-front for a protection racket. It charges its ‘customers’ an insurance premium, a name given to the extortion people have to pay the Mafia for not burning their houses or workplaces down. The other is a genuine insurance company, working hard with its customers to reduce fire risk and paying out if a fire takes&nbsp;place.</p><p>The Mafia outfit is fabulously profitable but leaves misery and destruction in its wake. The genuine company is far less profitable but helps avoid destruction and alleviates misery. Which entity makes the greatest economic contribution? The Mafia one, because it has highest accounting profit?</p> Real results are always on the&nbsp;outside <p>The particulars of this example are deliberately extreme to make the point. But they illustrate a universal truth: the economic results of an enterprise are always experienced and measured by what happens outside its organisational boundaries.</p><p>To understand the economic contribution that any enterprise makes, we need to assess the degree to which it sustainably improves human lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. The test of an electricity company’s economic success is not how much profits it makes, but how efficient and effective it is at providing sustainable electricity to all who need it. The test of a motor car company’s economic success is how efficient and effective it is at providing its customers with safe mobility. The test of a hospital’s economic contribution is how efficient and effective it is at healing the&nbsp;sick.</p><p>Note two crucial things about&nbsp;this.</p>  None of these external results are measured in terms of money. They are measured in terms of life: access to energy, mobility, health.  How much money profit an enterprise makes — an artefact of invented accounting conventions that focus only on the inside of the organisation — is unrelated to how successful it is at “maximising positive external social and economic benefits”, as we put it in the CIC Regulator’s report.  <p>Our current society seems to be organised around a comprehensive denial of this basic economic fact. It leaves us with a soul-sapping ‘choice’ between profit maximising enterprises whose real economic contribution is often questionable or even negative, and activities that need to be subsidised — but with nothing addressing the missing&nbsp;middle.</p><p>Would we have our current cost of living and climate crisis if energy companies’ purpose was to make energy available safely and affordably, rather than maximising profits for shareholders? In the midst of a drought, UK water companies are wasting a trillion litres of water through leaky pipes while managing to organise 775,704 separate occasions of dumping sewage into England’s rivers — a feat that apparently cost them six million hours of work to organise. In recent years, they have also managed to pay out more than £72bn in dividends to shareholders. Does that make them economic successes or economic failures?</p><p>An enterprise doesn’t have to deliver maximum profits to outside investors to be economically viable and to make a positive economic contribution. If it earns enough to cover its costs, it is financially sustainable. After that, its real economic success is the degree to which it finds a way to improve peoples’ lives in a way that is safe, affordable and accessible. It’s this missing middle where the big opportunities lie.</p><p>Mydex is proud to be a CIC, and proud to be recognised as making a contribution by the CIC Regulator. In our view, the CIC philosophy of earning money in order to make a social and economic contribution is the only positive, sustainable philosophy to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>No matter what its formal legal status happens to be, every company should be a community interest company, and its performance should be judged in this&nbsp;way.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/should-all-companies-by-community-interest-companies-a49fc9f3e9ba">Should all companies be Community Interest Companies?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Zero Trust is rapidly gaining popularity as a modern alternative to traditional perimeter-based security. While it is (rightfully) mainly considered a concept rather than a product, a new market segment has developed. Those solutions apply this concept to network-based access to existing applications and other systems by creating a logical identity- and context-based overlay over existing (and presumed hostile) networks. Alexei Balaganski has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80474/zero-trust-network-access">examined this new market for KuppingerCole Analysts research</a>&nbsp;and talks to Matthias about how this can speed up ZT deployments.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/lc-zero-trust-network-access"></a>

<p>Various people in the Holochain ecosystem are getting ready for DWeb Camp, a gathering of distributed web builders and supporters in California, USA. It’s happening next week!</p><p>The Holochain team is ironing out some bugs in Holochain, making sure all the infrastructure is working, and making final calls on which demo hApps we’ll bring with us to show off. The hREA team is getting excited about weaving peer-to-peer, multi-resource accounting principles into the DWeb story. Bear, our director of ecosystem growth, is volunteering as a space steward at the the <a href="https://github.com/fluencelabs/DWeb-camp-peer-to-peer/blob/main/README.md">People-2-People Tent</a> with Anna Lenakova from <a href="https://fluence.network/">Fluence Labs</a>. Members of projects like <a href="https://kizuna.foundation/en/">Kizuna</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn">Acorn</a>, <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">Flux</a>, <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>, <a href="https://github.com/artbrock/clutter">Clutter</a>, <a href="https://core.network/">Core Network</a>, <a href="https://trustgraph.net/">Trust Graph</a>, and <a href="https://www.perspect3vism.org/">Perspect3vism</a> will be there, along with Holo team members and friends from around the community like Marcus and Guillem, who led last month’s <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive</a>. And we’ll also be joined by <a href="http://krafel.info/">Paul Krafel</a>, an ecosystem restorer and elementary school teacher who <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/548071.Seeing_Nature">wrote a book</a> that has nothing to do with computers but has been highly influential to many people in Holochain-land.</p><p>If you’re going, we’re so looking forward to meeting you. It shouldn’t be hard to find us; we’ll be everywhere. And the whole DWeb community is wonderfully welcoming, thoughtful, caring, and interesting. You’ll have so many great conversations at breakfast, in the river, in the forest, and between events.</p><p>If you’re not going, you may be wondering why I’m sharing all these details. Well, it’s because I’m excited about how the Holochain ecosystem has grown since the last DWeb Camp in 2019. Back then, there were just a few staff members and hard-core supporters sharing about a DWeb toolkit that barely even existed yet. Now, a pretty significant group of us are heading there with: a working framework, a P2P hosting network, a bunch of working apps, and a pretty awesome community to share, explore, and build with the others in the DWeb world.</p><p>That said, we’re not thinking of this as a place to ‘sell Holochain’. Even if we wanted to, nobody would listen — DWeb Camp is not that kind of crowd. And that’s part of the reason we like it so much. Instead, we’re going there to learn, to listen, to share what we’re working on, and to build mutually supportive relationships. On this theme, I’m particularly interested in one event, an attempt to <a href="https://gitlab.com/getdweb/dweb-camp-2022/-/issues/77">map the projects that make up the DWeb</a> and look for opportunities for interoperability. This was a <a href="https://dwebcamp2019.sched.com/event/S4vH/building-bridges-connecting-tech-stacks-for-humane-ux">vision</a> I carried with me to the last DWeb Camp, and I’m hoping to see more conversations about building bridges between networks.</p><p>And now it’s time for some Holochain release notes!</p> Holochain 0.0.152: Replacing coordinator zomes <p>Release date: 3 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.16<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.144</p><p>The big news in this release is the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/conductor/api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.UpdateCoordinators">`update_coordinators`</a> admin API endpoint, which lets you replace the coordinator zomes in a DNA without forking the user into a new DNA space. As you may remember, this is made possible by the recent <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordinator zome split</a> in Holochain 0.0.144. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1494">#1494</a>). This is a huge improvement for app maintainability, allowing you to keep your core data model consistent while adding features and fixing bugs in your hApp’s business logic.</p><p>Other small changes:</p>  <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.144/hdk/hash_path/path/struct.TypedPath.html">`TypedPath`</a> is exposed in the HDK’s prelude so it’s easier to reference it in your zome. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1470">#1470</a>)  The new <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.0.16/hdi/prelude/enum.OpType.html">`OpType` helper</a> has gotten some good documentation. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1505">#1505</a>)  Bugfix: Cryptographic primitives now have constant-time encoding when they’re being output via `debug`, which protects against timing attacks. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1495">#1495</a>)  <p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220803124141">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.153: HDI version info in CLI <p>Release date: 10 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.17<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.145</p><p>The Holochain conductor has a `--build-info` argument which tells you which HDK versions it’s compatible with. Now it will also tell you the HDI versions. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1511">#1511</a>) Known bug: Although this feature worked, it was preventing automated builds, so it was removed in Holochain 0.0.154.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220810012252">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.154: Sandbox gets a new Lair <p>Release date: 17 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.18<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.146</p><p>The `hc sandbox` command, which lets you spin up throwaway conductor configurations, has been upgraded to use the new Lair 0.2.0 API. This means that all generated sandbox configuration files are now incompatible and will need to be regenerated. See the changelog for <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_cli_sandbox-0047">instructions</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1515">#1515</a>)</p><p>As mentioned, the addition of HDI versions to `holochain --build-info` caused build automation problems, so it’s been removed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1521">#1521</a>) But don’t worry; it’ll be <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1523">re-added</a> in Holochain 0.0.155.</p><p>Read the full <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20220817013233">changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.155: Execution-limiting bug fix <p>Release date: 20 Aug 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.0.11 to 0.0.19<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.139 to 0.0.147</p><p>This is an out-of-schedule release which fixes a bug that was discovered in a recently introduced execution-limiting feature. This feature is meant to prevent DNAs from consuming too much resources (think infinite loops and the like). It works by terminating a zome call (including validation and other callbacks) after a certain number of WASM VM operations, currently set at 10 billion. However, the counter was accruing at the cell level, not the function call level, so cells would become inoperable after a certain amount of work, regardless of how much work was done in a given call. This is now fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1514">#1514</a>)</p><p>The conductor binary’s `--build-info` flag has also been re-enabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1523">#1523</a>)</p> Holochain Launcher 0.4.11: New Holochain versions supported <p>Release date: 19 Aug 2022</p><p>This version adds support for three more Holochain versions, including one legacy version:</p>  Holochain 0.0.145 (HDK 0.0.138 / HDI 0.0.10)  Holochain 0.0.152 (HDK 0.0.144 / HDI 0.0.16)  Holochain 0.0.154 (HDK 0.0.146 / HDI 0.0.18)  <p>Here’s something I hadn’t previously reported on: The bundled version of DevHub only supports DNA manifests that target Holochain 0.0.143 (HDK 0.0.136) and older. That’s because the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">integrity/coordinator split</a> in Holochain introduced changes in the DNA manifest file. A future version of Launcher will include an updated DevHub that supports hApps built with Holochain 0.0.144 (HDK 0.0.137 / HDI 0.0.9) and newer.</p><p>Get the release <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.11">here</a>.</p> Holochain In Action: Lots of action <p>I have two Holochain in Action videos for you! The first, published on 3rd August, unpacks the entertaining Burner Chat hApp developed by Matthias M, Łukasz G, and Thomas S at the Developer Immersive last month. In it, you’ll get a chance to see how they used a combination of the DHT for peer discovery and signals which bypass the DHT to create disappearing messages and a real-time experience.</p><p>The second, published on 17th August, takes a look at We, a system created by Lightning Rod Labs for building collaborative spaces. You can read more about the purpose behind We in <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390">this blog post</a> by Eric Harris-Braun.</p> See you in a couple weeks! <p>Well, I’m off to DWeb Camp; I’ll write more when I get back. Many hApps and developer tools are being created and polished, and I want to start showcasing more of them. And I’ll be sure to bring plenty of photos and videos back from DWeb Camp to share with you!</p><p>Cover photo by Brad Shirakawa at <a href="https://archive.org/details/campdaytwojuly19bradshirakawaimages/page/n105/mode/2up">archive.org</a></p>

   The ground for Fed-issued guidelines for banks planning to engage in crypto-related activities was set last year with the joint announcement of the OCC and the&nbsp;Fed.

<blockquote>The ground for Fed-issued guidelines for banks planning to engage in crypto-related activities was set last year with the joint announcement of the OCC and the&nbsp;Fed.</blockquote><blockquote>The Fed made it clear in its new guidelines that although the crypto space may provide a new opportunity to the banks, they must have a system in place to ensure consumer protection at all&nbsp;times.</blockquote><blockquote>Under the new guidelines, any bank that plans to or is already engaged in any activity involving crypto assets must notify the Fed and the state regulator.</blockquote><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has issued additional guidance for banks considering or already engaged in activities involving crypto assets. The central bank emphasized in the guidelines that firms must notify the Fed, alert their state regulator beforehand, and make sure what they do is legally permitted.</p><p>This move comes after several Democratic senators, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called the OCC to rescind its previously issued guidance on crypto and replace it with “a comprehensive approach in coordination with other prudential regulators.”</p> Clarity on the&nbsp;Matter <p>Last year, U.S. banking regulators, including the OCC and the Fed, jointly said that they intend to clarify on kind of activities banks could engage in involving crypto as well as whether firms were able to facilitate crypto trades on behalf of customers and hold digital assets on their balance&nbsp;sheet.</p><p>Now, on Tuesday, the Fed said it is publishing its latest guidance. While crypto could offer “potential opportunities” to banks, firms need to have systems in place to ensure they do not threaten safety and soundness or consumer protections, the Fed said in a statement.</p> Prerequisites for Banks to Provide Crypto&nbsp;Services <p>As per the supervisory letter, banks supervised by the agency should take several steps before engaging in activities involving crypto, including determining if existing laws dictated any particular filings and if activities under consideration were legally permissible.</p><p>Banks should further have adequate risk management systems and controls in place in order to ensure that any endeavors were conducted safely and soundly and were in compliance with consumer protection rules, added the&nbsp;Fed.</p><p>The central bank has also published guidance for financial institutions to access its “master accounts,” which they need to participate in the global payment&nbsp;system.</p><p>This Monday’s announcement moves the Fed one step closer to possibly allowing Wyoming special purpose depository institutions (SPDI), like Kraken Bank, access to these accounts so they would not need banks as intermediaries.</p><blockquote>“The new guidelines provide a consistent and transparent process to evaluate requests for Federal Reserve accounts and access to payment services in order to support a safe, inclusive, and innovative payment system,” said Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard in a statement.</blockquote><p>Under the Fed’s guidance, Tier 1 banks would be federally insured, but while Tier 2 banks won’t be federally insured, they will still be subject to the federal banking agency’s supervision. On the other hand, the last Tier 3 banks are neither federally insured nor will they be put through prudential supervision, which likely would apply to the Wyoming crypto&nbsp;banks.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>With crypto companies suffering the brunt of the crypto winter, which has led to the downfall of some of the leading companies in the digital assets space, the U.S. authorities have now begun to set the ground rules to contain the fallout and ensure consumer security. The Fed’s new guideline is one of the many initiatives to bring stability to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>The regulatory actions are not limited to the United States alone, as other governments and international bodies, too, have started many such initiatives to bring crypto assets under the regulatory net. For instance, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has rolled out the Travel Rule to ensure that cryptocurrencies aren’t used in illicit activities, such as money laundering and terrorism financing.</p><blockquote>Under the Travel Rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are obligated to collect and share personally identifiable information (PII) of both the beneficiary and the originator of crypto transactions. Although only a few countries have adopted the Travel Rule, sooner or later, almost all countries will start enforcing the Travel Rule over&nbsp;VASPs.</blockquote><p>Thus, it is ideal that VASPs prepare to comply with the Travel Rule. And to begin complying, VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution, such as the Veriscope, the best solution available in the market today.

<p>A popular idiom, “More Haste, Less Speed,” perfectly encapsulates how some Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), such as cryptocurrency exchanges, are complying with the FATF Travel Rule, which is something that Shyft Network’s Head of Strategy, Malcolm Wright, experienced firsthand. Hastily done Travel Rule compliance can lead to more troubles, bringing VASPs back to the&nbsp;square.</p><p>Recently, a cryptocurrency exchange emailed Malcolm demanding some Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from him about a USDC deposit into his&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>(<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965575365050187776?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">Image Source</a>)</p><p>The identity of the crypto exchange will remain anonymous here, as this is not really about them but the inaccurate Travel Rule compliance process per se, which is something that even Malcolm highlighted in his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965575365050187776?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web">LinkedIn&nbsp;post</a>.</p><blockquote>The effort the crypto exchange is putting in to comply with the Travel Rule is commendable, but it does lead to four significant risks, which need to be highlighted.</blockquote> Risk #1: Security&nbsp;Risks <p>Sharing Travel Rule compliance data through emails can lead to phishing attacks. In fact, all a malicious actor will need here to pull off a phishing attack is a domain name with one letter difference.</p><p>There is data to back the claim. Reports indicate that <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/1670277/%5BCollateral%5D%20Tessian%20Guides,%20Infographics,%20eBooks/%5BTessian%20Infographic%5D%20Must-Know%20Phishing%20Statistics%202021.pdf">96%</a> of phishing attacks can be attributed to&nbsp;emails.</p> Risk #2: Legal &amp; Moral&nbsp;Troubles <p>One cannot share personally identifiable information of the sender without explicit consent from them. This is what even Malcolm highlighted in his&nbsp;post.</p><p>Imagine the horror if the crypto exchange with whom the user shares someone else’s PII falls into the hands of a malicious actor through a phishing attack or the VASP loses it due to inadequate privacy&nbsp;control.</p> Risk #3: Incomplete or Inaccurate Data <p>There’s a high chance that a user will send inaccurate or incomplete PII, given there are no safeguards to prevent such an instance while exchanging the data through emails. This can cause a significant rise in operational overheads beyond the usual email processing and customer support&nbsp;costs.</p> Risk #4: Poor User Experience <p>Last but not least, collecting Travel Rule compliance data through email is a UX disaster. It will lead to unhappy users, which will make them choose your competitors, especially if it is every transaction.</p> What’s the Solution? <p>Technology is the answer. It can solve all the challenges VASPs will encounter while complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><blockquote>Identify counterparty VASPs&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>Get accurate originator &amp; beneficiary data with consent&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>No additional headcount costs&nbsp;✔</blockquote><blockquote>Fully secured &amp; transparent ✔</blockquote><p>That, too, within seconds. Yes, you read that right. All you need here is Shyft Veriscope! It can help ensure that a VASP complies with all three components of the Travel Rule: AML/CFT, Data Privacy, and Data Security.</p><p>Visit our website to read more about Veriscope: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">https://www.veriscope.network/</a> and contact our BizDev team for a discussion here: <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/contact">https://www.veriscope.network/contact</a>.</p><p>Also, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/shyftnetwork">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Medium</a> for regular updates on all things crypto regulations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/veriscope-the-only-answer-to-your-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-woes-15a79bdd29e7">Veriscope: The Only Answer to Your Crypto Travel Rule Compliance Woes</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Catchy title, but where is this going? In the world of identity and access management, as Ubisecure we know we can help customers manage single sign-on(SSO) sessions no matter how complex their environment. It doesn’t matter if you have a dozen separate applications, each with their own local username and password, or if you have tens or hundreds of partners that you want to give secure, authenticated access to. We know we can help you. But we’re often asked, “how?”. Well, this is where SSO integration for the old, the new and the strange comes into play.</p>
<p>Our Identity Platform can integrate applications with both SAML and OIDC; each protocol has its own method to authenticate a user session. And we can create adaptors for nonstandard applications which integrate via a CIBA framework. But, SAML, OIDC and CIBA, how do I know if I use these already?</p>
 The Old 
<p>For those of you who know, SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) uses a series of XML-based protocol messages to create user sessions. There is typically a human user, an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP). That is – you on your web browser, a service that can identify you with authority and the place you are asking your web browser to log into. Keep in mind the IdP and the SP might look the same to you – but your browser knows the difference. Launched as 1.0 in 2001 and updated to 2.0 in 2005, SAML is the “grand old man” of authentication.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of thousands of applications, probably millions, which use SAML to securely authenticate users to services. SAML is tried, true and robust. If your company or partner has been offering services online since before 2010, then the SAML protocol is in use to authenticate users – human and machine. It’s no problem, Ubisecure Identity Platform supports SAML out of the box.</p>
 The New 
<p>OIDC or OpenID Connect. This is a decentralised authentication protocol which uses OAuth 2.0 as its authorisation framework. In brief, OIDC is a series of secure message exchanges that allow you to delegate access of your online content to a third-party resource or service. It’s the “give this app access to only these 10 pictures on my phone”.</p>
<p>Like SAML, OIDC also has a human user and identity provider (IdP). However, differs from SAML by using a relying party (RP) to securely control and limit the personal information or resources you are granting access to. This sounds a little complex but is really an elegant way for you to trust a known resource to control access to your information and only give out the specific information you want, when you want it. And revoke access when you want to; this is nearly as important as granting access. As OIDC was finalised in 2007, it’s not that much younger than SAML – but still the few years between the release of the two protocols makes OIDC the new kid on the block</p>
<p>If you use Facebook or Google, Twitter or hundreds of other applications or services, you have been using OIDC. Do you use your Office365 identity to log into your company’s ticketing or intranet site? That’s OIDC functioning to authenticate you, via Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. It then creates an access token and id token to tell your company’s applications that you are a valid user and should be granted access.</p>
 The Strange 
<p>Ok – SAML and OIDC are pretty clear. They can both identify you as a user from a central location and exchange your right to access information from an online location. What happens when you discover that you have an application that is either COTS (commercial off the shelf) or homegrown that just doesn’t follow the standards? It’s an essential application, used for key business functions and it can’t be altered or rewritten quickly enough. This application needs to be available to your partners, but you don’t want the hassle of managing user accounts for all those external staff. Seems like a bind, but we have a solution here.</p>
<p>OIDC CIBA – OpenID Connect Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication, or just CIBA for short. Ubisecure’s Identity Platform has a CIBA framework that can help to integrate this non-standard (or strange) application. While this isn’t a plug and play solution, you or your System Integrator will need to work with our Sales Engineering team to identify your essential applications APIs, then integrate them into our CIBA adaptor. We will connect to your partner’s user directory via SAML or OIDC and to your key application via this CIBA adaptor.</p>
<p>In the modern reality, a diverse range of legacy and new applications coexist. Blending on-premises and cloud services is often the quickest way for any organisation to grow resulting in a hybrid IT environment. Of course, it’s better to follow open standards, either SAML or OIDC. But when your business requirements extend beyond the norm, by either the protocols used or into a hybrid deployment, come talk to us. We have long experience with SSO integration for complex environments, no matter if they are “old”, “new” or “strange”.</p>

  <p>You will use Vue and Spring Boot to build a todo list web application. The application will include CRUD abilities, meaning that you can create, read, update, and delete the todo items on the Spring Boot API via the client. The Vue frontend client will use the Quasar framework for the presentation. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) will secure the Spring Boot API and the Vue client using Okta as the security provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This project has two major parts:</p>

 
   Spring Boot API 
   Vue client 
 

<p>The Spring Boot app will include an H2 in-memory database and will use Spring Data JPA to map our todo data model to a database table for persistence. As you’ll see, the server will leverage Spring Boot’s ability to quickly expose data via a REST API with minimal configuration.</p>

<p>The client will use <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue 3</a> and the Quasar framework. <a href="https://quasar.dev/">The Quasar framework</a> provides components and layout tools to help build Vue applications quickly with a consistent, high-quality user interface.</p>

<p>Before you dig into the tutorial, I want to quickly introduce the technologies for those that might be unfamiliar. Feel free to skip down to the <a>prerequisites</a> section if you’re already familiar with Vue and Spring Boot.</p>

 What is Vue.js? 

<p>Vue is a JavaScript view library, like React and Angular. It’s designed to be incrementally adoptable, and the core library focuses solely on the view layer.</p>

<p>In my experience, Vue.js is a great alternative to React. I learned React first and came to use Vue later. Like React, Vue uses a virtual DOM, provides reactive and composable view components, and enforces a strict one-way parent-child relationship when defining properties and state. This means that it is performant and avoids many confusing state relationships that can occur without one-way data binding.</p>

<p>However, unlike React, Vue uses templates instead of JSX (a potentially welcome and more immediately accessible option). Vue gives you component-scoped CSS using style tags in single-file components. In practice, this difference is pretty significant because, in React, the JSX and CSS-like syntax are close enough to HTML and CSS to be confusing but not the same, which creates problems initially. (Ever gone from a language that doesn’t require semicolons back to one that does? It’s something like that.)</p>

<p>I find Vue to be a simpler, cleaner implementation. React requires a deep dive. You gotta take the red pill and go all the way. It’s a super powerful system, but you have to be all in. Vue is a little friendlier and a little easier to get started.</p>

 Introducing the Quasar Framework 

<p>The <a href="https://quasar.dev/">Quasar Framework</a> builds on top of Vue to add a cross-platform component library and grid layout system. It also provides many tools for deploying Vue-based applications to basically any platform you can think of, from web single-page and progressive web apps to mobile apps and Electron-based desktop apps. In this tutorial, you’ll only be using the layout and component library features. Still, Quasar’s big push is to allow developers to write a single web application and deploy it to any platform with a consistent look with minimal changes.</p>

 About Spring Boot 

<p>The server technology you’re going to use is Spring Boot. Pure, unadulterated Spring (pre-Spring Boot) is a bit of a behemoth: super powerful but potentially time-sucking and frustrating. I’m pretty sure the whole computer conference phenomena came about so that people could learn and understand old-school Spring XML files. It certainly drove large sections of the computer publishing empires.</p>

<p>Spring Boot was Spring’s answer to this complexity (and to frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Grails). They did a great job of distilling down all the power of Spring into a simple, quick, easy-to-use web framework. You can have a fully functioning resource server with a ridiculously small number of lines of code and a few annotations.</p>

<p>Plus, when you’re ready, you have all the power of Spring under the hood, just waiting.</p>

<p><a></a>Prerequisites:</p>

<p>Before you start, please make sure you have the following prerequisites installed (or install them now).</p>

 
   <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Java 11</a>: or use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN!</a> to manage and install multiple versions 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: the Okta command-line interface 
   <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">HTTPie</a>: a simple tool for making HTTP requests from a Bash shell 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node 16+</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html">Vue CLI</a>: you’ll use this to bootstrap the Vue client 
 

<p>You will need a free Okta Developer account if you don’t already have one. But you can wait until later in the tutorial and use the Okta CLI to log in or register for a new account.</p>

<p>Instead of building the project, you can also <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example">clone the repo</a> and follow the instructions there to configure it.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect app 

<p>Open a Bash shell. Create a parent directory for the project. Eventually, this will include both the resource server and client projects.</p>

   <code>mkdir spring-boot-vue-crud
cd spring-boot-vue-crud
</code>   

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Copy the client ID and issuer URI somewhere safe. You’ll need them for both the client and resource server applications.</p>

 Bootstrap a Spring Boot app using Spring Initializr 

<p>You’re going to use <a>the Spring Initializr</a> to create a starter project for the resource server. You can look at the project website if you want, but here you’ll use the REST API to download a pre-configured starter.</p>

<p>The following command will download the starter project and un-tar it to a new directory named <code>resource-server</code>.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.tgz \
  -d bootVersion=2.7.3 \
  -d javaVersion=11 \
  -d dependencies=web,data-rest,lombok,data-jpa,h2,okta \
  -d type=gradle-project \
  -d baseDir=resource-server \
| tar -xzvf - &amp;&amp; cd resource-server
</code>   

<p>The dependencies you’re including are:</p>

 
   <code>web</code>: <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">Spring Web MVC</a>, adds basic HTTP REST functionality 
   <code>data-jpa</code>: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa">Spring Data JPA</a>, makes it easy to create JPA-based repositories 
   <code>data-rest</code>: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-rest">Spring Data REST</a>, exposes Spring Data repositories as resource servers 
   <code>h2</code>: the <a href="https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html">H2</a> in-memory database used for demonstration purposes 
   <code>lombok</code>: <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">Project Lombok</a>, adds some helpful annotations that eliminate the need to write a lot of getters and setters 
   <code>okta</code>: <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> that helps OAuth 2.0 and OIDC configuration 
 

<p>Project Lombok saves a lot of clutter and ceremony code. However, if you’re using an IDE, you’ll need to install a plugin for Lombok. See the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/">project’s installation docs</a> for more information.</p>

 Configure Spring Security 

<p>Open the application properties file and update it. You’re changing the server port so it doesn’t conflict with the default Vue local server (which also defaults <code>8080</code>).</p>

<p><code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code></p>

   <code>server.port=9000
okta.oauth2.issuer=&lt;your-issuer-uri&gt;
okta.oauth2.clientId=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>You need to replace the two bracketed values with the values you generated above for the OIDC app using the Okta CLI.</p>

<p>You can run the bootstrapped project right now and see if it starts. It should start but won’t do much.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure Spring Security. The class below configures web security to allow all requests, effectively bypassing security. This is just so you can test the resource server initially. You’ll enable security shortly.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/SecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
            .anyRequest().permitAll();
        return http.build();
    }

}
</code>   

<p>Replace the <code>DemoApplication.java</code> file with the following.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/DemoApplication.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.ApplicationRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }

    // Bootstrap some test data into the in-memory database
    @Bean
    ApplicationRunner init(TodoRepository repository) {
        return args -&gt; {
            Random rd = new Random();
            Stream.of("Buy milk", "Eat pizza", "Update tutorial", "Study Vue", "Go kayaking").forEach(name -&gt; {
                Todo todo = new Todo();
                todo.setTitle(name);
                todo.setCompleted(rd.nextBoolean());
                repository.save(todo);
            });
            repository.findAll().forEach(System.out::println);
        };
    }

    // Fix the CORS errors
    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean simpleCorsFilter() {
        UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource source = new UrlBasedCorsConfigurationSource();
        CorsConfiguration config = new CorsConfiguration();
        config.setAllowCredentials(true);
        // *** URL below needs to match the Vue client URL and port ***
        config.setAllowedOrigins(Collections.singletonList("http://localhost:8080"));
        config.setAllowedMethods(Collections.singletonList("*"));
        config.setAllowedHeaders(Collections.singletonList("*"));
        source.registerCorsConfiguration("/**", config);
        FilterRegistrationBean bean = new FilterRegistrationBean&lt;&gt;(new CorsFilter(source));
        bean.setOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE);
        return bean;
    }

    // Expose IDs of Todo items
    @Component
    class RestRespositoryConfigurator implements RepositoryRestConfigurer {
        public void configureRepositoryRestConfiguration(RepositoryRestConfiguration config, CorsRegistry cors) {
            config.exposeIdsFor(Todo.class);
        }
    }
    
}
</code>   

<p>This demo application does three things that are helpful for demonstration purposes. First, it loads some test todo items into the repository.</p>

<p>Second, it configures the REST repository to expose IDs for the todo items.</p>

<p>Third, it defines a filter to allow cross-origin requests from <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. This is necessary so that the Vue application, which is loaded from <code>http://localhost:9000</code> via the local test server, can load data from the Spring Boot resource server at <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p>For more info on CORS (cross-origin resource sharing), take a look at <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">the Mozilla docs</a>.</p>

<p>Now, create the data model for the todo items.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/Todo.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import lombok.*;

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
@Data
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Todo {

    @Id 
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    @NonNull
    private String title;

    private Boolean completed = false;
    
}
</code>   

<p>Notice the use of the Lombok annotations (<code>@Entity</code>, <code>@Data</code>, and <code>@NoArgsConstructor</code>) to keep the code simple and clean.</p>

<p>The todo items have two fields: a title string and a completed boolean. The fields are annotated with Spring Data JPA annotations that allow the Java class to be mapped to a database table for persistence.</p>

<p>Create a repository to persist the data model.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/TodoRepository.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.data.rest.core.annotation.RepositoryRestResource;

@RepositoryRestResource
interface TodoRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;Todo, Long&gt; {}
</code>   

<p>This is a Spring Data JpaRepository that can persist the data model you just defined. Because it is annotated with <code>@RepositoryRestResource</code> (and because the <code>data-rest</code> dependency was included), this repository will be automatically exposed as a web resource.</p>

 Test your Vue and Spring Boot app 

<p>Run the app using the following command from the <code>resource-server</code> subdirectory.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Open a new Bash shell and use HTTPie to test the resource server.</p>

   <code>http :9000/todos
</code>   

<p>You should see a response like the following:</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 
...

{
  "_embedded": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/1"
          },
          "todo": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/1"
          }
        },
        "completed": false,
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Buy milk"
      },
      {
        "_links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/2"
          },
          "todo": {
            "href": "http://localhost:9000/todos/2"
          }
        },
        "completed": true,
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Eat pizza"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  ...
}
</code>   

<p>Stop the resource server using <code>CTRL + C</code>.</p>

 Secure your Spring Boot API 

<p>Edit the <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> file and change the filter chain’s bean definition to enable a resource server.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/OAuth2ResourceServerSecurityConfiguration.java</code></p>

   <code>@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http.authorizeRequests()
        .anyRequest().authenticated()
        .and()
        .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
    return http.build();
}
</code>   

<p>This configuration requires JWT auth on all requests.</p>

<p>Restart the server. Use <code>CTRL + C</code> to stop it if it’s running.</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Use HTTPie again to try and request the todo items.</p>

   <code>http :9000/todos
</code>   

<p>You will get an error.</p>

   <code>HTTP/1.1 401 
...

401 Unauthorized

</code>   

<p>The resource server is finished. The next step is to create the Vue client.</p>

 Create a Vue JavaScript client 

<p>Use the Vue CLI to create a new application from the project’s root directory and navigate into the newly created <code>client</code> directory. Install the Vue CLI if you don’t have it installed with <code>npm i -g @vue/cli</code>.</p>

   <code>vue create client
cd client
</code>   

<p>Pick Default ([Vue 3] babel, eslint) when prompted.</p>

<p>Wait for it to finish. Add the Quasar framework.</p>

   <code>vue add quasar
</code>   

<p>You can just accept the defaults. For me, they were the following.</p>

 
   Allow Quasar to replace App.vue, About.vue, Home.vue and (if available) router.js? Yes 
   Pick your favorite CSS preprocessor: Sass with indented syntax 
   Choose Quasar Icon Set: Material Icons (recommended) 
   Default Quasar language pack: en-US 
   Use RTL support? No 
   Select features: Enter to select none 
 

<p>Add additional dependencies for HTTP requests, logging, routing, and authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i axios@0.27.2 vuejs3-logger@1.0.0 vue-router@4.1.3 @okta/okta-vue@5.3.0
</code>   

 
   <code>axios</code>: an HTTP client request library 
   <code>vuejs3-logger</code>: a logging library 
   <code>vue-router</code>: the standard for routing between pages in Vue 
   <code>okta/okta-vue</code>: the Okta helper for Vue 
 

<p>To learn more about how Okta integrates with Vue, look at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-vue">the GitHub page</a> for the <code>okta/okta-vue</code> project. More resources and example applications are listed in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/vue/">the Okta docs for Vue</a>.</p>

<p>Replace <code>main.js</code> with the following. Look at the <code>OktaAuth</code> configuration object. Notice the client ID and issuer URI are pulled from a <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p><code>src/main.js</code></p>

   <code>import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import {Quasar} from 'quasar'
import quasarUserOptions from './quasar-user-options'
import VueLogger from 'vuejs3-logger'
import router from './router'
import createApi from './Api'

import {OktaAuth} from '@okta/okta-auth-js'
import OktaVue from '@okta/okta-vue'

if (process.env.VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI == null || process.env.VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID == null || process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URI == null) {
  throw "Please define VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI, VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID, and VUE_APP_SERVER_URI in .env file"
}

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: process.env.VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI,  // pulled from .env file
  clientId: process.env.VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID,  // pulled from .env file
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
})

const options = {
  isEnabled: true,
  logLevel: 'debug',
  stringifyArguments: false,
  showLogLevel: true,
  showMethodName: false,
  separator: '|',
  showConsoleColors: true
};

const app = createApp(App)
  .use(Quasar, quasarUserOptions)
  .use(VueLogger, options)
  .use(OktaVue, {oktaAuth})
  .use(router)

app.config.globalProperties.$api = createApi(app.config.globalProperties.$auth)

app.mount('#app')
</code>   

<p>Stated very briefly, the file above creates the main Vue app and configures it to use the dependencies you added: Quasar, VueLogger, OktaVue, and the router. It also creates the API class that handles the requests to the resource server and passes it the <code>$auth</code> object it needs to get the JWT.</p>

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the client project root directory. The Client ID and Issuer URI are the values you used above in the Spring Boot <code>application.properties</code> file. The Server URI is the local URI for the Spring Boot API. You can leave this unless you made a change (this gets used in the <code>Api.js</code> file).</p>

<p><code>.env</code></p>

 <code>VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
VUE_APP_ISSUER_URI=&lt;your-issuer-uri&gt;
VUE_APP_SERVER_URI=http://localhost:9000
</code> 

<p>It’s important to note that putting values like this in a <code>.env</code> file in a client application does not make them secure. It helps by keeping them out of a repository. However, they are still public because they are necessarily visible in the JavaScript code sent to the browser. In this use case, it’s more of a configuration and organizational tool than a security tool.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the <code>.env</code> file out of the repository, you need to update the <code>.gitignore</code> file. There’s no particular need to do this for the Client ID as it will be publicly available anyway.</p>

<p>Replace <code>App.vue</code> with the following.</p>

<p><code>src/App.vue</code></p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;q-layout view="hHh lpR fFf"&gt;

    &lt;q-header elevated class="bg-primary text-white"&gt;
      &lt;q-toolbar&gt;

          &lt;/q-avatar&gt;

        &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon="logout" v-if='authState &amp;&amp; authState.isAuthenticated' @click="logout"/&gt;
        &lt;q-btn flat round dense icon="account_circle" v-else @click="login"/&gt;

    &lt;/q-header&gt;

    &lt;q-page-container&gt;
      &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;
    &lt;/q-page-container&gt;

  &lt;/q-layout&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  name: 'LayoutDefault',
  data: function () {
    return {
      claims: null
    }
  },
  watch: {
    'authState.isAuthenticated'() {
      this.$log.debug(("watch triggered!"))
      this.updateClaims()
    }
  },
  created() {
    this.updateClaims()
  },
  methods: {
    async updateClaims() {
      if (this.authState &amp;&amp; this.authState.isAuthenticated) {
        this.claims = await this.$auth.getUser()
      }
    },
    async login() {
      await this.$auth.signInWithRedirect({ originalUri: '/todos' })
    },
    async logout() {
      await this.$auth.signOut()
    }
  },
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>This top-level component defines the header bar and includes the router component. The header bar has a login or logout button and will show the authenticated user’s email address when logged in.</p>

<p>The app gets the authenticated user’s email address from the JWT claims. (A claim is a piece of information asserted about the subject by the authenticating authority.) This happens in the <code>updateClaims()</code> method, which is triggered when the component is created, and is also triggered by a watch method so that it is updated as the authenticated state changes.</p>

<p>Create a new file to encapsulate the resource server access logic.</p>

<p><code>src/Api.js</code></p>

   <code>import axios from 'axios'

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.VUE_APP_SERVER_URI,
  timeout: 2000
});

const createApi = (auth) =&gt; {

  instance.interceptors.request.use(async function (config) {
    let accessToken = auth.getAccessToken()
    config.headers = {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`
    }
    return config;
  }, function (error) {
    return Promise.reject(error);
  });

  return {

    // (C)reate
    createNew(text, completed) {
      return instance.post('/todos', {title: text, completed: completed})
    },

    // (R)ead
    getAll() {
      return instance.get('/todos', {
        transformResponse: [function (data) {
          return data ? JSON.parse(data)._embedded.todos : data;
        }]
      })
    },

    // (U)pdate
    updateForId(id, text, completed) {
      return instance.put('todos/' + id, {title: text, completed: completed})
    },

    // (D)elete
    removeForId(id) {
      return instance.delete('todos/' + id)
    }
  }
}

export default createApi
</code>   

<p>All of the requests to the server go through this module. Take a look at how the access token is retrieved from the global <code>auth</code> object and injected into every request.</p>

<p>Create the router file.</p>

<p><code>src/router/index.js</code></p>

   <code>import { createRouter, createWebHistory } from 'vue-router'
import { navigationGuard } from '@okta/okta-vue'
import Todos from "@/components/Todos";
import Home from "@/components/Home";
import { LoginCallback } from '@okta/okta-vue'

const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/todos',
    component: Todos,
    meta: {
      requiresAuth: true
    }
  },
  { path: '/callback', component: LoginCallback },
]

const router = createRouter({
  history: createWebHistory(process.env.BASE_URL),
  routes,
})

router.beforeEach(navigationGuard)

export default router
</code>   

<p>The router has three paths. The home path and the todos path are straightforward. The Okta Vue SDK provides the last path, <code>/callback</code>, to handle the login redirect from the Okta servers after authentication.</p>

<p>Create the <code>Home</code> component.</p>

<p><code>src/components/Home.vue</code></p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;

<p>This component encapsulates the card that holds all of the todos and the todo-associated interface elements. It also handles the rest of the functions related to updating todos on the server and in the local cache.</p>

<p>You’re welcome to delete the <code>HelloWorld.vue</code> component if you want. Or you can leave it. It’s not needed.</p>

 Confirm your Spring Boot and Vue todo app works 

<p>Make sure the Spring Boot API is still running. In a separate Bash shell, from the resource server directory, run the following command (if it is not already still running).</p>

   <code>./gradlew bootRun
</code>   

<p>Start the Vue app using the embedded development server. From the client directory:</p>

   <code>npm run serve
</code>   

<p>Open a browser and navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You’ll see the “please log in” page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log into the app using Okta’s sign-in interface.</p>

<p></p>

<p>That will redirect you to the Todo app’s main screen.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should be able to delete items, add new items, rename, and filter items. All data is stored on the Spring Boot resource server and is presented by the Vue + Quasar frontend.</p>

 Do more with Spring Boot, Vue, and Okta 

<p>You built a Spring Boot resource server backend and a Vue frontend in this tutorial. The Vue client used the latest Vue 3 version with the Quasar framework. The app included full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) capabilities. It was all secured using Okta.</p>

<p>You can find the source code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example">@oktadev/okta-spring-boot-vue-crud-example</a> repository.</p>

<p>In this vlog, our Chief Operating Officer, Huzefa Olia, joins our Chief Marketing Officer, Michael Cichon, to discuss why Okta needs an identity layer.</p>
<p></p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>All right. Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, the chief marking officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here this morning with Huzefa Olia, our chief operating officer, to discuss how to make single sign-on a bit more secure. Huzefa, welcome to the vlog this morning. How are you?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Interesting topic, Michael. Pleasure to be here.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, listen, I appreciate you taking time. I know between the analyst briefings, the customer meetings, you’re pretty busy. I appreciate you taking time this morning. I want to start off talking a little bit about the Lapsus$ breach at Okta. I know some folks say it’s not a big deal, the breach only lasted 25 minutes. Other folks are saying this is a big deal. So what actually happened? And with Okta being a market leader, what does this say about the state of single sign-on?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. So the breach happened not directly within Okta, but it happened with a service provider that Okta uses. Lapsus$ was able to social engineer a password for one of the vendors that Okta uses, and through that, tunnel into the network. And I believe they had access to two or maybe three of customer data or customer instances that Okta manages. Through the reports that we have seen or what Okta has published, it essentially says none of the critical information was released to them. As part of the breach, they did manage to see more information around some collaboration sites that that particular customer had. So although the impact wasn’t as severe, but it happening to an identity provider, to a single sign on-engine like Okta is extremely critical. And I think it just leads to this particular discussion that we’re having right now, that what can be changed when it comes to any kind of an authentication that happens.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay So the breach wasn’t any real deficiency in Okta itself. It’s the reliance on passwords. And this has been a problem for business all along. It’s the account takeover, email account takeover at a partner, a company that’s not your own, but you inherit that as a business, you inherit that risk from your supply chain. So with that as context, what should customers of single sign-on be doing to shore up their security?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Great question. So if we look at it and just peel off all the different layers and whether it came from a supplier or whether it came internally, whatever that is, the essential or fundamental thing is the way we authenticate today is broken, irrespective of the type of system that we authenticate into. And what I mean by that is in this specific example and in all the different breaches that have happened, the model has been that a user’s password/PIN has been compromised. So every time when you’re relying on a knowledge-based authentication where a user is in the middle, a user’s knowledge of their password or PIN is important, social engineering is going to continue to happen. And there are more advanced methods of that happening. The essential method to change is move away from this knowledge-based authentication and do it based on possession, possession of a factor that you have, possession to say that this is my identity that I’m using to authenticate.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So possession on its own is not new. We’ve had this for a while with things like YubiKey and other devices that you would plug into your laptop to prove you have a physical key. But what is new and novel about this possession factor today?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>So always, possession was primarily based as a second factor for authentication. We are never moving away from the passwords, primarily because we relied on that to authenticate a user’s identity, your password where you’re a proxy to who Michael is to authenticate. With systems that are out there, one of them and I’m plugging 1Kosmos over here, essentially what we are doing is that in your authentication flow, A, we are proving your identity by digitally verifying who you are and using that certificate-based authentication where you’re possessing that device, where your certificate is enrolled, and then proving who you are instead of a password by using your biometrics to authenticate. So that changes the whole notion of how a possession-based authentication would work as well. You’re no longer using it as a second factor, but you’re using it as the primary factor in the authentication.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So passwords authenticate, but passwords don’t prove identity. At 1Kosmos, we talk about adding in identity layer, if you will. Can you talk a little bit more about what… You said prove identity. What does that mean? Can you translate that for people?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>So the way we have seen how identity and access management works today is it’s not necessarily an and. Every identity sits in a separate silo, and access management sits in a separate silo. Where from an identity standpoint today, you often may or sometimes you maybe proving who the user is, but that is one time and that resides in a separate repository. And authentication doesn’t care about the user’s identity. They care about the user ID, which is very, very different.</p>
<p>A Michael Cichon, I know who you are, is very different compared to an MC shown, who I just am trusting and saying that I’m going to provide that access. So we are bridging that particular gap. And the way we do this is anytime a user is coming into an environment, yes, we do the identity proving and verification, but we do the continuous verification of the user’s identity. And then in addition to that, we no longer rely on any kind of an MC shown ID to authenticate the user. We ask the user to prove who they are by authenticating using their biometrics. So the whole notion of identity and access management working together actually would make sense in this case.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So depending on the needs of the business, there’s different levels of this identity proving, correct?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And there are standards which are there in the market today. The most leading one in US is the NIST Identity Assurance Level. And there are different levels that you can get to depending on how do you want to get the user. If I have a low entry point or if my system is not as critical, I may want the user to log in to my system if they have an IAL level of one. But if it’s production and if it’s a critical system, I would like the user to be IAL level two or higher when they’re authenticating. And as well as when they’re authenticating, I want to use a factor that I can trust. And there are multiple different biometrics factors, which are there in the market today.</p>
<p>You mentioned a couple of them, YubiKey, where as well as other kind of device biometrics, like your Face ID and Touch ID that Apple provides. All of them great. But if you really, really want to know who the user is, then a live selfie is extremely important. When I am enrolling you, Michael, in my organization, you’re proving who you are, but I am taking some kind of a video recording with you. When I’m authenticating you, I want that same kind of a flow as well. And that’s something, again, which is unique into our platform where we not only take a certain level for a user, but we also try to authenticate them using those live biometrics.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. Okay. So the 1Kosmos platform, we know it’s certified to the NIST standard, certified to the IDO2 standard. The biometrics are also certified, correct?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>That is correct, certified with iBeta.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, great. So bringing this back to Okta, how does 1Kosmos then work to complement Okta?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. This goes with respect to Okta or any kind of a single sign-on engine, which is out there. Single sign-on engines are wonderful and are an essential requirement now in any kind of a large enterprise today. How we work with a single sign-on provider like Okta is that we would integrate with them. So anytime you’re logging in into an Okta or a single sign-on engine a user, instead of entering the username and a password one time, you would no longer even have to do that. You will essentially be authenticating using your biometrics that would be enrolled using 1Kosmos. And 1Kosmos has all the plumbing that has been built in within Okta or any kind of other single sign-on provider that is out there.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Interesting. So when Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone, he introduced the new stylus, which was the finger. And now, we are introducing basically yourself as the authenticator. So what’s the user experience like then?</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>As we say, instead of remembering a complex password, now you log in with a blink and a smile.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Blink and a smile. That’s awesome. Okay. Well, that’s the questions I had for you. This has been really interesting for me. I think you’ve been pretty clear in helping us understand this. We do have a webinar coming up. It’s called After Lapsus$, How to Protect Your SSO Environment from Vendor and Contractor Compromise. This particular webinar is happening on August 18th at 10:00 AM Pacific and 1:00 PM Eastern Time. So if you’re seeing this log after that date, that will, of course, be available on our website as a replay. So thank you very much, Huzefa. I appreciate your time today. Have a great rest of your day. And so long, everybody.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
 
<p>Thank you for having me.</p>

<p>As part of our series on understanding more about the vLEI, the new Verifiable Credential to identify organisations and organisation representatives, this article is a follow-up to a previous post <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials/" title="Introduction to Verifiable Credentials">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>. This time, we will look in more detail at how W3C specification verifiable credentials work.</p>
<p>The Verifiable Credentials (VC) specification by W3C provides a way to express credentials on the web. In this article I’m giving an overview of components and terminology related to VCs, and also some information about other technologies and specifications that are needed when implementing verifiable credentials.</p>
 Claims 
<p>Before I go into the components, I’ll run through a quick explanation on claims as a critical concept to understand for verifiable credentials. A claim is a name-value statement about a subject. The subject is typically a person, but it could also be a thing, such as hardware device. Examples of claims are:</p>
 
 Person’s first and last name, date of birth etc. 
 Organisation name 
 Personal ID 
 … and many others 
 
<p>The concept of claims is familiar to those who have been working with federation protocols, such as OpenID Connect and SAML.</p>
 Example 
 “credentialSubject” : {
&nbsp; “id”: “did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867”,
&nbsp; “birth_date”: “1970-01-01”
} 
 Components of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>A Verifiable Credential (VC) is a collection of claims made by an issuer (recap issuers in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-management/verifiable-credentials/" title="Introduction to Verifiable Credentials">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>). VC metadata describes properties such as type, expiration and issuer of a credential. VC proof is used to verify the integrity of a credential. A proof is typically expressed as a digital signature, made with the private key of the issuer.</p>
<p></p>
 Example 
 {
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "e9ea3429-b32f-44ad-b481-b9929370bb90",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "type": [ "VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "issuer": { "id": "did:example:2d28bb79-87a9-4224-8c63-d28b29716b67" },
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "issuanceDate": "2022-01-01T00:00:00Z",

 Verifiable Presentation 
<p>Verifiable Presentation (VP) is a collection of Verifiable Credentials (VC). Typically, a VP contains a single VC, but in more complex scenarios (such as selective presentation or delegation) there could be many VCs within a single VP.</p>
<p>VP proof is used to verify the integrity of presentation. Proof is the holder’s counter signature of a collection of VCs where each VC has been individually signed by its issuer.</p>
<p>As with verifiable credentials, proof is typically expressed as a digital signature made with the private key of the holder. Usually, the VP holder and subject of VCs within the verifiable presentation is the same. In more complex scenarios, the holder and subject could be different. In such cases some information or rules need to exist that allow correlating VCs.</p>
<p>VP metadata describes properties such as expiration and nonce. The nonce is a random value generated by the relying party when requesting a VP, letting the relying party prevent re-play of VP tokens. In effect, VP is a classic challenge response authentication protocol.</p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp; "holder": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "proof": {}
} 
 Decentralised Identifier 
<p>A Decentralised Identifier (DID) is an identifier that is used to identify the subject, issuer and holder of verifiable credentials and presentations.</p>
<p>A DID is formatted as a URI starting with prefix “did:”, followed by the scheme identifier and a scheme specific part (did:scheme:address).</p>
<p>Numerous DID schemes have been defined, yet not all schemes have the same capabilities. Some schemes operate on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains. Others take more traditional approaches, such as simply referencing http resources, or even X.509 certificates.</p>
<p>Basically, the DID is an indirect reference to public keys, usually controlled by the entity the DID represents. This way, the keys of an entity can, for example, be rotated without the DID value having to change.</p>
 Example 
 did:example:e762e3b0-1cf9-4899-925f-9a6ae50a8ad6 
 DID document 
<p>The DID scheme defines how to resolve a DID value into a DID document. The DID document is a way to present metadata and public keys of the entity. The public keys are needed to verify VCs and VPs.</p>
 Example 
 {
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "@context": [],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867",
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "verificationMethod": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867#key-1",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": "JsonWebKey2020",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "publicKeyJwk": {}
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp; ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "authentication": [ "#key-1" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "assertionMethod": [ "#key-1" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp; "controller": [ "did:example:7564cb9c-165c-4857-a887-bfc2460af867" ]
} 
 Trust Model 
<p>For claims to be verifiable, the relying party must establish trust with the issuer of the Verifiable Credential (VC) with the claims.</p>
<p>One possible model for a relying party is to use out of band methods to establish trust, where the relying party simply knows the DID value of the issuer being the trust anchor.</p>
<p>More complex models allow implementing chains of trust where a VC issued by the trust root could delegate trust to other intermediary VC issuers.</p>
<p>Self-attestation is a model where the VC is issued by the subject itself. In this case, the claims are not verifiable but could still be useful depending on the use case.</p>
 Digital Wallet 
<p>The digital wallet application holds Verifiable Credentials (VC) from issuers. The wallet creates Verifiable Presentations (VP) for relying parties with user’s consent. This application can exist on a user’s device, it can be hosted on a server, or it could be a combination of both.</p>
<p>Simon Wood looks at Identity Wallets used in the vLEI specification in more detail in his blog <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101-issuance-and-wallets/" title="vLEI &amp; Identity Wallets">vLEI &amp; Identity Wallets</a>.</p>
 Self-Sovereign Identity 
<p>The wallet plays a critical role in implementation of the self-sovereign concept of Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>The wallet must not release information to relying parties without the user’s consent. Also, it must not let the VC issuer know when and where the VCs have been used. The latter property is one of the most significant differences compared to traditional OIDC and SAML based federated systems.</p>
 Selective disclosure 
<p>Selective disclosure lets the wallet app compose VPs from selected properties of VCs. This enables a wallet to “pick and choose” claims from VCs without disclosing full details and thus improving privacy. A typical example is a claim such as “age over 18”. This lets a relying party know the subject’s age is over 18 without disclosing the exact date of birth.</p>
 Issuing Credentials 
<p>Users receive Verifiable Credentials (VC) from credential issuers and store the VCs in their wallets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To create VCs, the issuer needs to verify the identity of the user so that it can issue credentials with the correct claims.</p>
<p>Because the VCs are bound to a subject DID, the issuer must also verify the user is in control of the subject DID. One method is for the issuer to request the user to create a digital signature that is verifiable with the public key referenced by the DID.</p>
 OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance 
<p>Federated Identity Providers (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-provider/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/" title="IdP">IdP</a>) already implement user identity verification and they have repositories with claims and other statements about users. It is expected that many IdPs will be extended to become issuers of VCs. The OpenID Connect for Verifiable Credential Issuance (VCI) is a set of extensions to standard OIDC flows that enable interoperability across digital wallets and identity providers. The VCI flow takes care of both DID and identity verification requirements.</p>
 Relying Party 
<p>A Relying Party or Verifier is the entity that receives Verifiable Credentials (VC) embedded within a Verifiable Presentation (VP) from a user’s wallet.</p>
<p>To get a VP from a wallet the Relying Party sends a Presentation Request to the user’s wallet. Properties of the request indicate things like what claims the Relying Party expects to receive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After receiving a VP, the task of the verifier is to verify the integrity of both the VCs embedded within a VP and the VP itself. To do so, the verifier must look up public keys of both the subject and the issuer by resolving DIDs.</p>
 OpenID Connect for Self-Issued OP 
<p>To request and receive VPs from a wallet, a set of extensions to standard OIDC flows have been designed. The OpenID Connect for Self-Issued OP (SIOP) flow allows a relying party to request VPs from a wallet using a protocol that resembles the OIDC implicit flow.</p>
 Presentation Exchange 
<p>Presentation Exchange lets a relying party request particular types of credentials and claims. This specification defines filters and conditions that the wallet evaluates when it is constructing a VP from the set of VCs it has stored.</p>
 Example 
 {
  "id": "8cbe12c7-5d6b-4bfa-81c9-57855daebc77",
  "input_descriptors": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "id": "ExampleCredential",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "constraints": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "fields": [
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "path": [ "$.type" ],
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "filter": {
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "type": "array",
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "const": [ "VerifiableCredential", "ExampleCredential" ]
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }
 &nbsp;&nbsp; }
  ]
} 
 Token types and formats 
<p>The Verifiable Credential spec itself being very generic does not define any token format. The examples captured in this article are from JSON-LD formatted tokens.</p>
<p>In addition to JSON-LD there exist many other token formats such as VC-JWT, Mobile Driver’s License (mDL), AnonCreds and KERI ACDC. Each token format has its own characteristics, such as text or binary formatting, different cryptographic proof types, support for selective disclosure etc.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The privacy improvements by the Self-Sovereign aspects of Verifiable Credentials are a significant improvement compared to traditional federated systems.</p>
<p>The current W3C VC specification is highly generic. This presents a challenge to implementations wanting to achieve interoperability. Work on the next version of the W3C VC has already started, with the goal of addressing, amongst others, interoperability problems.</p>
<p>OpenID for Verifiable Credentials work simplifies some implementation challenges by reusing concepts and terminology from the very well-known OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 group of specifications.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Undoubtedly, many technology companies enjoyed an outstanding success during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses changed in several fields and we saw situations that we would have rarely expected before: switching to online shopping, online education, remote working, minimizing trips and avoiding human contact, just to mention a few. Lockdown forced humanity to look for a shelter against the confinement, and people found it in technology, which became the main protagonist in our everyday life. This scenario made companies like Zoom, Google, Apple, Meta, and others grow explosively. In the light of this unprecedented growth, IT professionals started claiming more money for the same roles, and technology companies started hiring so many new employees to meet the demand of the market. These events pushed the interest rates down and opened the door to more investors, especially beginners, into the stock market. With this high demand and the prices going up, tech companies have seen their greatest peak between 2020 and 2021. The question now is, if the technology industry seemed so promising and successful in the past two years, why do some professional investors not want to keep the investments up in this market?</p>
<p>Jim Chanos, a well-known American investment manager, compared this phenomenon with the revolution of the dotcom companies in 2000, which he defined as an “era on steroids” due to the exponential growth of these kind of corporations (“<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/news/22/06/27900928/short-seller-jim-chanos-betting-against-data-centers-heres-why">Jim Chanos</a>”). On the other hand, and regardless the opinion of some experts, many technology companies affirmed that they had a solid business model, and banks stated low interest rates to ensure cash flow in the market. Some firms could not prove their profitability, thus, they created their own metrics to justify their success. Speculations are not something new in the economy, in fact we have seen this repeated times along the history, and basically it happens when some assets receive a much greater value than their real one. An aggravator in the current context is that the stock market based the value of the companies on something that is not tangible, instead of considering their capabilities to generate business in the coming years, and it was a huge mistake. This pumped a bubble that, unfortunately, has no other future but busting when the reality knocks the door, and it always happens. While some experts such as Stanley Druckenmiller (Duquesne) say that the tech bubble already popped, others like Chris Senyek (Wolfe Research) say that we are at the edge of it (“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/12/twenty-years-after-the-dotcom-crash-is-techs-bubble-about-to-burst-again">The Guardian</a>”).</p>
<p>It is hard to make predictions with all the political, ethical and economic substantial changes going on. The panorama does not look very promising: the new lockdown in China due to the rise in COVID cases caused delays at the Shanghai port, the busiest one in the world. This situation created a slowdown in the supply chain because there are ships waiting to be loaded and unloaded, and this delay impacted the inflation globally. The energy system in Europe counted with Russian resources and, in light of the current conflict, an energy crisis is happening in the continent. The main decision has been to reduce the energy supply, which does not just affect only the European region, but also the world. Apparently many industries are affected and technology is not the exception.</p>
 The beginning of the fall 
<p>Contrary to the popular belief that 2022 would be a year for recovery, many organizations experienced a big fall. The first giant that exposed the situation was Netflix confirming in March the loss of 200.000 subscribers in the first quarter, and the situation worsened in April, when the company decided to withdraw the services from Russia showing support to Ukraine in the war (“<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2022-04-19/lat-et-ct-netflix-loses-subscriber-first-quarter">Los Angeles Times</a>”). But this is not the only case. Companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Spotify, PayPal, Amazon, revealed a loss of between 20 to 65% of market capitalization. The same fate has befallen the cryptocurrency industry, which led to freeze the investments, especially from the start-ups. Against this drastic scenario, CEOs and investors opted for a drastic decision: layoffs. The cybersecurity industry for example has strikingly decided to follow this strategy, despite a considerable growth in revenue and increase in ransomware attacks against which they must defend against. But why?</p>
<p>As a justification to this strategy, some experts compare the current crisis to those in 2000 and 2007, indicating that the fall in terms of employees and employability is unavoidable, that they need to protect the companies, and having less employees is a way to lower the expenses. The main focus would be now to direct the budgets to more stable assets. However, there are others saying that this is an alarmist perspective. The reality is that during the growth of the speculative bubble, technology companies spent a considerable amount of money in hiring new employees and in adjusting the company to the value they had in the market. But when the market went back to the real value, all these new employees would not be necessary anymore. &nbsp;In any case it is important to understand the two sides of this coin: the benefits to the company’s finances, and the reaction of internal employees. Looking at this from the business perspective, it is self-explanatory that having fewer employees in a company shows a growth slowdown and considering the decrease in the stock prices it represents a big financial relief. On the other hand, considering the situation from employees’ perspective, seeing many colleagues being fired from their roles awaken a general alert within the organization, and at the same time may push them to improve their performance to avoid being in those shoes. If we look at it from this perspective, a company that is facing difficult times needs people who are motivated to develop new ideas and use their endeavors to move out from that situation. In the end, once the bad times have passed, the organization will only keep those human resources who demonstrate tenacity, creativity, strength and high performance.</p>
<p>Although the advantages seem to be clear, a layoff impacts the business unavoidably. When the company recovers and looks for new talents, people will think twice before accepting an offer because they might think that their position would be at risk against the possibility of another financial crisis. Going deeper, we can think about the legal consequences for the company. There are agreements in different countries to compensate taxes for instance, and a massive layoff could affect the initial negotiations with the governments. In a similar vein, if the company decides to go for a merger to preserve the business, legal issues and employees’ condition would be a determinant factor that could block the negotiation. It is difficult to deny that a massive layoff causes stress on the employees, and if the situation escalated, probably some companies would discard the possibility of merging, reducing then the chances to get a better deal.</p>
 What comes next? 
<p>With the volatility of the market in sight, and the political and economic uncertainty present, many companies are just in a brief pause to analyze the full picture and decide the next steps. Financial analysts and investors recommend putting the money into companies that base their value in solid and tangible actives, and to split the investment, avoiding big expectations only on one of them. Experienced investors are very careful at the moment when investing in technology companies because it is highly risky to root for companies that created their own metrics to justify their great valuation in the market instead of having a look at the actual profits and benefits of the organizations. It is true that during at least the last 10 years, the market has prioritized the growth over the stability, and this offered more uncertainty around the economy. However, there is something certain, and is that the show must go on. A good way to go would be looking at the current scenario not as a crisis, but as a stage in which technology companies should come up with new and more attractive ideas to offer in the market, other than new metrics and promises. Moreover, we could say that the companies should work on low-cost proposals and B2B agreements, where the boost of income could make a great impact to some extent. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is definite that surviving in a highly competent market such as the IT sector is hard, and although layoffs seem to be the necessary path to cut the budget, there are other solutions that could make a less tragic impact to the business, the society and the global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  Dock has released a new feature on the mobile <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> app enabling users to create and manage decentralized identifiers that empower them to fully own and control their data.  Centralized and federated (e.g. signing in with a Facebook and Google account) identifiers can make organizations a target for large scale data breaches and enable companies to track people’s online behaviour as well as share their personal data without their knowledge. DIDs help users prevent tracking and correlation.  With the Dock Wallet, users can securely create, export, import, edit, delete, and copy/share their DIDs. The wallet enables users to fully own, control, and manage their credentials that are issued as Verifiable Credentials such as a university degree or government ID.  <p>We’re excited to announce that users can now conveniently create and manage their decentralized identifiers (DIDs) from the <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> phone app. Up until recently, people were using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> to create their DIDs. The Dock Wallet enables users to fully own, control, and manage credentials that are issued as <a href="https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a> such as training certificates, driver’s license, and university degree.</p><p>We’ll go over step-by-step instructions on how to create, export, import, edit, delete, and copy/share your DIDs.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What Are DIDs and Why Do They Matter? <p>For a long time we have been using user names, passwords, and emails which are centralized and/or federated (e.g. signing in with a Facebook or Google account) digital identifiers to access apps and websites. But these identifiers often enable many companies like Google to use data to track online behaviour, resulting in people’s data being used for ad targeting, and organizations risk being a target of hacks or large scale data breaches when they store user information on centralized storage systems. </p><p>In contrast to centralized identifiers, <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) solve many of these problems. They enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. </p><p>A decentralized identifier is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is independent of any organization. </p><p>Example of a Dock DID:</p>You can create as many decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as you want for different purposes.<p>DIDs:</p>  Allows the owner (organization or individual) to fully own and control their data  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Don’t contain personal data or wallet information  Enable private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  Can be associated with Verifiable Credentials  <p>You can make as many DIDs as you want for different purposes or interactions. For example you can have: </p>  DID 1: Used only for educational purposes that store credentials like a university degree and training certificates  DID 2: Used only for buying and trading NFTs  DID 3: Used only to hold different types of IDs like driver’s license, state ID, and passport  You can conveniently select which DID you want to use to authorize a verifier to receive data. DIDs and Verifiable Credentials <p>Verifiable Credentials are digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. These credentials are associated with the DIDs you create. </p><p>Examples of documents that can be issued as Verifiable Credentials:</p>  Driver’s license  University and college degrees  Passport  Course/training completion certificates  Your Verifiable Credentials are associated with the different DIDs you create.<p>Below are Step-By-Step instructions on how to create and manage your DIDs from the Dock Wallet.</p> Create a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Select DIDs at the bottom of your wallet and click on the + sign on the top right of the screen</p><p>Step 2: Select Create New DID</p><p>Step 3: Name your DID like educational credentials, NFTs, IDs etc. and select Create</p><p>Step 4: Choose a DID type. Difference between the two keys:</p><p>did:key</p><p>did:dock</p><p>Free to create this type of DID</p><p>Costs tokens to create this type of DID</p><p>DID isn’t stored anywhere</p><p>DID is stored on the blockchain</p><br><p>Will later have the capability to support several key pairs so you can choose which key pair to apply such as using different keys for different applications while still using the same DID.</p><p>Step 5: Select Create after selecting did:key for example and naming it</p><p>For the advanced options for developers:</p>  Schnorrkel (sr25519, recommended): Determines what cryptography will be used to create this account. Note that to validate on Polkadot, the session account must use “ed25519”.  Secret deviation path: You can set a custom derivation path for this account using the following syntax “/&lt;soft-key&gt;//&lt;hard-key&gt;”. The “/&lt;soft-key&gt;” and “//&lt;hard-key&gt;” may be repeated and mixed. An optional “///&lt;password&gt;” can be used with a mnemonic seed, and may only be specified once.  <p>Step 6: did:key is created</p><p>Step 7: This is the next step if you select did:dock. Name your DID and select the DID Payment Account. If you have multiple accounts, you will see an extra field on this screen for you to choose which account to use to pay for the DID.</p><p>Step 8: Select Confirm. </p><p>Step 9: You now have a new DID!</p> Export a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Click on the three dots of the DID you want to export and click Export DID</p><p>Step 2: Create a password</p><p>Step 3: Choose where you want to send your DID.</p> Import a DID <p></p><p>If your DID was created somewhere else like Dock Certs, you can export a DID and later import it into the Dock Wallet. </p><p>Step 1: Click on the three dots of the DID you want to import and click Import existing DID</p><p><br>Step 2: Select the DID JSON file. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.</p><p>Step 3: Enter your wallet password.</p><p>Step 4: Enter a DID name like “online shopping”</p><p>Step 5: Your DID has successfully been imported.</p> Edit a DID <p>Step 1: Select the three dots for the DID you want to edit and select Edit DID</p><p>Step 2: Enter a DID name and press Save</p><p>Step 3: The DID name has been edited.</p> Delete a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Select the three dots for the DID you want to delete and select Delete DID</p><p></p><p>Step 2: Select Delete</p> Copy/Share a DID <p></p><p>Step 1: Click Share</p><p>Step 2: Copy the DID and share it where you want.</p> Conclusion <p>Dock has released a new feature in the mobile Dock Wallet app enabling users to create and manage decentralized identifiers that empower them to fully own and control their data. Centralized and federated identifiers are less secure because they are often at risk of being a target for large-scale data breaches, hacks, and tracking/storing user data. </p><p>Decentralized identifiers enable organizations and people to fully own and control their data. People can create as many DIDs as they want for different interactions and purposes. Users can securely store their Verifiable Credentials on their Dock Wallet that are associated with their DIDs.</p>

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know about the new regulatory framework.&nbsp; 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, which was provisionally agreed-upon by the European Parliament on June 30, 2022, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. MiCA is also likely to attract operators and users to the market, as it is the first regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) at EU level. &nbsp;</p>



 What is MiCA?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA is a regulatory framework for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets</a> traded on digital platforms. It covers three types of crypto assets: Utility tokens, which provide access to goods or services;- payment tokens, which are used as a means of payment or can be traded for other MiCA-regulated tokens; and e-money tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies and used to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>



 What does MiCA do?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has established rules for the issuance, admission to trading, and operation of crypto assets, as well as requirements for the providers of crypto asset services. The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) has been set up to specifically promote cooperation between member states on blockchain technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the benefits of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has a number of benefits, including better regulatory clarity for CASPs in the EU, improved investor protection, enhanced financial stability, and the promotion of innovation. MiCA will also make it easier for member states to cooperate on blockchain technology, as the EBP will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of best practices.&nbsp;</p>



 Who will MiCA impact?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will impact all CASPs offering services to clients in the EU. This includes exchanges, custodian wallet providers, issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other CASPs. MiCA will not apply to persons who buy or sell crypto assets for their own account.&nbsp;</p>



 What does this mean for non-European crypto service providers?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How will MiCA play into AML regulation?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will complement the EU’s existing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD)</a> by providing a specific regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will require CASPs to put in place <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML measures</a>, such as Customer Due Diligence and reporting of suspicious transactions. MiCA will also allow national competent authorities to exchange information on suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities involving crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses. However, CASPs will need to ensure that they comply with MiCA’s rules and requirements when they come into effect.&nbsp;</p>



 When will MiCA come into effect?&nbsp; 



<p>The MiCA regulation is still subject to approval by the European Parliament and the European Council. The European Commission will also need to implement further acts to specify certain technical requirements for MiCA-regulated activities. MiCA is expected to come into effect by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CASPs are recommended to stay up to date with MiCA, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure they remain compliant.&nbsp;</p>

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know.&nbsp; 



<p>On June 29, 2022, the European Union published a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/anti-money-laundering-provisional-agreement-reached-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">provisional agreement on the transparency of crypto asset transfers</a>. The agreement will extend the European Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) to include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets,</a> meaning that the sender and beneficiary of all applicable or centralized crypto transactions need to be identified.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opponents to the new regulation argue that TRF violates EU charters on privacy, and that the collection of Personal Identification Data will not necessarily help in the fight against money laundering. While those in the crypto community that relished the anonymity of decentralized transactions are likely to be unhappy with this development, others see it as a sign that regulation is finally catching up with the industry and bringing much-needed clarity for crypto asset service providers (CASPs).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps most importantly, though, is that the greater safeguards are sure to go some way to tackling fraudsters and scammers in the area of digital – fiat currency conversion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tighter regulations mean that not only will regulators track crypto to fiat exchanges, but they will also be monitoring decentralized transactions where a transfer is made between a centralized service provider and an unhosted wallet. This looks set to change the anonymity of operating in a decentralized self-sovereign environment.&nbsp;</p>



 Why was TFR extended to crypto assets?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The regulation is a response to the growing use of crypto assets for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/combating-financing-of-terrorism-cft/">terrorist financing</a>. Crypto assets are often used for these purposes because they can be transferred quickly and anonymously. By requiring information on the source and beneficiary of the funds, authorities will be able to track these transactions and investigate any suspicious activity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the latest TRF update, the European Union is catching up, and beginning to implement some of the recommendations from the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, the global money laundering and terrorist financing organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this time, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/non-fungible-token/">Non fungible tokens (NFTs),</a> which represent ownership in digital art or other collectibles, are currently excluded from the scope of these rules. Within the next 18 months, the European Commission will evaluate whether certain NFTs should fall into this scope or require their own regulatory regime.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the new rules for crypto transactions?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>CASPs will now be required to collect and store information on the source and beneficiary of the funds for each transaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This rule, known as the “travel rule”, already exists in traditional finance and requires that information on the source of the asset and its beneficiary travels with the transaction and is stored on both sides of the transfer. CASPs will be obliged to provide this information to competent authorities if an investigation is conducted into money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Does this include transactions to and from unhosted wallets?&nbsp; 



<p>In contrast to the original proposals, the current agreement now excludes private unhosted wallets that are not operated by regulated CASPs. In practice, this means that private wallets and person-to-person transfers conducted without a provider do not fall under the requirements of the “travel rule”.&nbsp;</p>



 What does this mean for CASPs?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The new rules will require CASPs to perform a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC-check</a> on the source and beneficiary of the funds for crypto transactions. This information must be made available to competent authorities if an investigation is conducted. In addition, crypto transfers above €1000 between exchanges and unhosted wallets owned by an individual will need to be reported to the national authorities. Crypto peer-to-peer wallets that are not hosted by a provider will not be subject to these rules.&nbsp;</p>



 When will the agreement come into effect?&nbsp; 



<p>Updates to the TRF regulation are expected to come into effect as part of a greater package of updates to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5th AML directive (AMLD5) </a>by 2023. TRF updates are also expected to be aligned to the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/30/digital-finance-agreement-reached-on-european-crypto-assets-regulation-mica/">Markets in Crytpo Assets (MiCA)</a> regulation, which will introduce a European licensing scheme for CASPs. These regulations are expected to be in force by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>As one of the largest KYC providers in Europe, serving clients globally and locally, we have a clear view of this industry from a unique perspective. First, we support ‘smart regulation’ which, above all, is aimed at building trust in this digital ecosystem. The crypto space, which has grown at unprecedented speed, offers investors big and small a new and creative way to invest. The fragmented regulatory landscape has produced opportunities for significant gain and loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>



<p>“For adoption to grow into mainstream and to curtail scams and fraud, harmonized standards and accountability are essential to continue growth. The EU’s new rules offer a path forward that will allow Europe to become a mature crypto hub. KYC will play a central role and IDnow is here to support issuers and providers with meeting their compliance requirements,”&nbsp;added Armata.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Users will benefit from the transition to decentralized identity.&nbsp; 



<p>Identity and access management, or IAM, is the security function that makes it possible for the right users to access the right resources (applications or data).</p>



<p>IAM solutions are widely deployed and very mature, but for users the current approaches fall short. These solutions are difficult to manage, privacy invasive, and often lead to unwanted outcomes such as identity and financial theft.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a new approach to IAM. It overcomes many of the current IAM shortcomings and focuses on the user’s needs. DI simplifies how cryptography is applied so that it better protects a user’s resources while making it even easier for them to use.</p>



 Legacy IAM: a Centralized Identity Architecture&nbsp; 



<p>The first and perhaps still the most common type of IAM is based on a centralized model. In this model, a user signs up directly with a service (e.g., creating an account). During signup (and subsequent logins), the user gives the service personally identifiable information (PII) such as username, password, email address, mobile phone number, credit card information and other types of personal data. Typically these days, the user will also set up two factor authentication (2FA) to strengthen user authentication, which can require even more PII.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using IAM terminology, the service is both the identity provider (creates the user’s account and stores user attributes) and the service provider (provides the application and data). The access control policy is implemented at the service and it’s common to find group-based, role-based, and attribute-based models (or combinations) in use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Often, an enterprise’s employees and customers all use this centralized model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Centralized IAM has some key drawbacks for the user:</p>



  Remembering:&nbsp;Over a few years, users could create hundreds of service accounts. For each account, they must remember all their different username (could be email, phone #, or custom) and password combinations. Ideally, each account has a different password (for security) and username (for privacy). If the user has enabled 2FA, they must also give additional information at login (e.g., a one-time password or SMS code). The growth in the password manager products market is testimony to just how difficult users can find managing accounts and authentications.&nbsp;  New PII tracking:&nbsp;Users are providing their PII data to many different services—perhaps 200+. This puts the user’s PII data at great risk since any of those services could sell the data they collect or have their user information stolen. Consequently, loss of privacy, identity theft, and financial theft are on the rise.&nbsp;  



<p>Figure 1 shows the centralized model. With this model, the service is both an identity provider and a service provider. It also maintains the access control policy. Users create accounts on the service, provide it with PII, and access the service.&nbsp;</p>



Figure&nbsp;1: Centralized IAM



 Federated Model for IAM&nbsp; 



<p>The second most common type of IAM is where a user signs up with a major identity provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Apple, etc.). When users want to access a new service, instead of creating a new account, they use federated login (or social login). Usually this appears as a “Sign in with …” login on the service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under this model, the identity provider and the service provider are distinctly separate. Using protocols such as SAML, OAuth or OpenID Connect, the user is federated from the identity provider to the service provider. Both providers maintain a trust relationship between them. The user no longer needs to be authenticated at the service provider. At first glance, this improves on the centralized IAM model, because the number of services where a user must create an account is markedly reduced and the user uses fewer username/password/2FA combinations. While this model is much more manageable for the user, it&nbsp;significantly impacts the user’s privacy&nbsp;since&nbsp;the identity provider knows all the federated services the user accesses, when they connect, and which of the user’s PII the service provider is using.<a>[1]</a></p>



<p>The service provider creates the access control policy and requests the user’s PII from the identity provider as required. There can be only one identity provider for the user at this service provider—whereas decentralized identity users can present credentials from multiple identity providers (more later). The downside is that the user’s personal data is still being distributed among numerous services, which impacts the user’s privacy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The user doesn’t own their identity provider’s account. If the identity provider (e.g., Facebook) suspends or deletes the user’s account, the user is cut off from the identity provider as well as from any services that were federated through the service provider!</p>



<p>Figure 2 gives an overview of the federated model. The identity provider and the service provider are distinctly separate, but there is still a trust relationship between them. The service provider also creates the access control policy, which determine how a user’s PII is used and disseminated. The service provider requests PII from the identity provider.</p>



Figure&nbsp;2: Federated model for IAM



 Decentralized Identity Model for IAM&nbsp; 



<p>DI is specifically designed to improve security and the user experience. DI is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/34632/decentralized-identity">described</a>&nbsp;as:</p>



<p>… an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>The DI approach is quite different from the centralized and federated identity models. While identity providers still exist in this model, they are providers of cryptographic verifiable credentials (VCs). VCs are signed electronic data structures that carry claims about the user, which the identity provider asserts. VCs have many security benefits for the receiver of the credential (service provider). Specifically, the receiver of the credential can:</p>



  Be assured of the identity of the identity provider (creator) of the credential  Be assured of the integrity of the credential (it can’t be modified without detection)  Be assured the identity provider hasn’t revoked the credential  Accept credentials from different identity providers (credential issuers), which can contribute to the access control policy. This creates resilience when some credentials may have expired (e.g., use a passport’s claims when a driver license may have expired).  



<p>An identity provider issues a VC to the user for storing in the user’s identity wallet. The identity wallet is an element that DI systems introduce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized ledger (e.g., Sovrin, Indicio, cheqd, etc.) provides the foundation of trust in the DI environment. This new component replaces the functionality that centralized identity systems (e.g., centralized PKI) currently provide.<a>[2]</a></p>



<p>When the user wants to access a service (the service provider), they assert claims from the VCs (received from one or more identity providers). This assertion/presentation of claims process is done via a&nbsp;proof&nbsp;of possession and control of the credential. The user uses their identity wallet to present the requested claims to the service provider. The access control policy at the service provider is based on attribute-based access control (ABAC) since the decisions are made on the attributes/claims present in the credentials.</p>



<p>Two important aspects of DI relate to the user presenting VC proofs to the service provider:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity provider doesn’t need to be aware of the legal identity of the user accessing the service provider and there is no interaction between service provider and identity provider.<a>[3]</a>  The user is in full control of approving or denying what PII (from their VCs) is presented to the service provider. Both aspects improve privacy and security over the centralized and federated models by&nbsp;asserting&nbsp;authentication information rather than&nbsp;providing&nbsp;it.  



Figure&nbsp;3: DI-based IAM



<p>Figure 3 presents the DI model. The identity provider and service provider activity is distinctly separate, but there is still a trust relationship between them. The identity provider issues VCs (containing claims) to the user. The user holds the credentials and presents them (as proofs) when required at the service provider. The service provider creates the access control policy, which is attribute-based.&nbsp;</p>



 The Role of the Identity Wallet 



<p>The identity wallet is at the heart of the DI user experience. In the wallet, the user creates and manages their decentralized identities and any VCs they receive. For each new decentralized identity, the wallet creates a:</p>



  Private/public key pair (usually based on elliptic curve cryptography such as ed25519)  Decentralized identifier (DID).  



<p>Once the wallet has created a key pair/DID, the user can interact with a DI ecosystem. To communicate and receive a VC from an identity provider, the wallet establishes a DIDComm connection (a durable, secure connection to allow two parties to communicate) between the identity wallet and the identity provider. In the same way, the identity wallet establishes a DIDComm connection with the service provider to present (as proof) claims from the VCs. This process introduces strong cryptography, but the user is no longer required to remember and present a username/password to either the identity provider or the service provider. This simplification comes from allowing the user to be authenticated after demonstrating&nbsp;control&nbsp;of the decentralized identity’s private key, rather than by presenting a secret credential (e.g., password).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 4 displays a few screens from the Sudo Platform’s mobile identity wallet. On the left, the user can view any VCs currently stored in the identity wallet. The second screen is a list of (DIDComm) connections the wallet has established. The third screen shows the user selecting specific PII elements to share from a credential. The fourth screen shows activities related to that credential.</p>



Figure&nbsp;4: Sudo Platform identity wallet



 The Role of VCs&nbsp; 



<p>VCs are the core technology enabling DI-based IAM. An identity provider creates VCs and issues them to a user who can later assert them (or a subset of their claims) to a service provider. VCs are designed for protecting the user’s privacy, and have privacy/security preserving innovations:<br></p>



  Service providers never need to communicate the user’s actions to the identity provider.  Users can control what PII from a VC is available to the service provider. They might disclose all of a credential’s claims, a subset of the claims, or even privacy-preserving zero knowledge proofs or ZKPs (more later).  Service providers can be sure of the identity of the VC creator, that the credentials haven’t been modified, and that the identity provider hasn’t revoked the credentials.&nbsp;  Users no longer need username and password combinations to connect with the identity provider and the service provider.  



<p>There are two VC standards:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Credentials</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anoncreds-wg.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anonymous Credentials</a>&nbsp;(AnonCreds).</p>



 The Role of the Decentralized Identity Ledger 



<p>The DI ledger is another new component of the DI-based IAM model. It provides the foundation of trust to the environment and functions loosely like a&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;PKI. Many different DI ledgers exist; the most common are Hyperledger Indy-based ledgers.</p>



<p>Before an identity provider can issue credentials to a user, they must first establish their own identity foundation on a DI ledger. This process (using Hyperledger Indy as an example) includes writing to the ledger the:</p>



  Issuer’s DID&nbsp;  Schema of the credential&nbsp;  Credential definition (relates the Issuer DID and credential schema)&nbsp;  Revocation definition (in the case where the service provider needs to check on whether a credential has been revoked).  



<p>Since the DI ledger stores this information, the service provider can accept the security of a VC without having to check with the identity provider directly.</p>



 The Role of Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) 



<p>ABAC is the natural embodiment of the DI-based IAM system. This process enables the user to present claims (based on elements contained within VCs) to the service provider, and the service provider should be able to authenticate a user’s identity based on those claims. For example:</p>



<p>If a user presents a claim from a valid US driver license stating they are over age 21, they can avoid presenting their actual birth date. This allows a receiving merchant/verifier to verify whether a customer is over the minimum age required for certain activities, such as purchasing alcohol.</p>



<p>If a user presents proofs from their US passport, COVID-19 vaccine certificate, and a country visa, a receiving airline can verify whether a traveller meets current travel requirements and thereby is allowed to purchase plane tickets to that country.</p>



 The Full DI-Based IAM Model—Putting It All Together 



<p>Figure 5 gives an overview of the full DI-based IAM model. The identity providers issue VCs to users. Users store those VCs in their identity wallets. To access a resource from a desired service, the user presents verifiable claims (i.e., elements of the VCs) to the service provider. The service provider’s verifiable credential verifier checks the claims have not been altered, are issued by a trusted identity provider, and the containing credentials have not been revoked. If the verifier is satisfied in all those conditions, it can present the claims to the policy decision point so they can make a decision according to the ABAC policy.</p>



Figure&nbsp;5: DI-based IAM



 A Practical Security Use Case&nbsp; 



<p>One of the major advantages of DI is&nbsp;better security but simpler interactions. A user can be issued VCs into their wallet and subsequently present them on request to a service provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 6 gives an example of a user who is trying to find a new job. They apply for positions listed at an employment service. Before the employment service will put forward the user’s application to prospective employers, the service wants to verify two things:</p>



  User identity (KYC): The employment service asks the user to present their driver license (via a VC proof).  University qualifications&nbsp;(as listed on their resume): The employment service asks the user to present their university qualification (again, via a VC proof).  



<p>Since the user has previously received a VC-based driver license from their state department of motor vehicles (DMV) and a verifiable credential-based university qualification from their university, this process is convenient and easy for both the user and the employment service. Neither of them has to deal with paper copies or credentials (copying them and having them certified) or force in-person meetings. Everything can be done immediately and easily via electronic transfers.</p>



<p>The other advantage for the user is&nbsp;privacy. The employment service does not have to communicate with either the DMV or the university to confirm the VC proofs. Just by accessing the ledger, the employment agency can be sure the credentials are authentic and have not been revoked.</p>



Figure&nbsp;6: Applying for a job through an employment service



 Privacy-Preserving Use Cases 



<p>The employment service use case we just discussed shows how DI increases identity security while keeping interactions simpler and more private for the user. In that example, a user conveyed their full identity and their university qualifications to an employment service. This required the secure transfer of specific information elements from the VCs. Many use cases follow this paradigm.</p>



<p>Another type of use case focuses on preserving the user’s privacy. These use cases do not require the user to disclose actual data elements from VCs. Instead, they require only a ‘true’ or ‘false’ assertion based on those values. The proof method is cryptographically generated using a function known as a zero knowledge proof (ZKP). ZKPs allow a prover to prove a data item to a verifier without disclosing the data item itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These next uses cases illustrate when a ZKP-based verification is better than disclosing specific data elements:</p>



  Proof of age: In some countries, individuals must attain a set age before they can perform certain actions, such as purchasing alcohol. To prove their age, the person could use a driver license or passport, because these documents show their actual birth date. But disclosing their birth date would be providing too much PII since they are only really required to prove they are older or younger than the specified age. Instead, the person could use a ZKP to assert they are over the minimum age and safeguard their actual birth date.  Proof of qualification: Some jobs require a college degree as a qualification of employment. When applying for these jobs through an employment service, a person might only need to use a ZKP to assert they hold a college degree rather than disclose PII such as their alma mater, dates of enrolment, GPA, transcript information, etc. Giving only the required information (possession of a degree) means the user keeps their more unique information hidden and therefore more secure.  Proof of residency: In some locales, certain rights are conveyed only to residents since they pay taxes and visitors do not. A resident could use their driver license or passport to assert eligibility, but these documents would reveal more PII, such as street address and date of birth. If the resident used a ZKP, they could assert their residency without disclosing any unnecessary personal information that could be misused.&nbsp;  



<p>In each use case, the user could prove they meet the specified criteria (e.g., age, college degree, residency) without disclosing more specific information than necessary. This type of credential proof allows people to stay in control of their private information and grant access to it only as needed.</p>

<p>With so many login attacks out there, it’s hard to keep track of them all, but credential stuffing is on the rise and is important to be able to recognize.</p>
<p>What is credential stuffing? Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack that uses stolen usernames and passwords, AKA credentials, and enters them into many, many login forms in an attempt to gain access to these accounts.</p>
 How Are Passwords Compromised? 
<p>Passwords are by far the most common form of <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a>; as such, they are often the most vulnerable form of authentication credential. This is because, like all other forms of data, passwords have to be stored and protected in various ways… and anytime you store information, there are often several ways that information may be compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the most part, login credentials can be compromised through a few basic methods:</p>
 
 Database Breach: Platforms often store passwords in databases, against which they compare login credentials to authenticate users. For the most part, intelligent and security-focused enterprises encrypt databases, using hashes to obfuscate passwords. However, many old and unprepared databases may still use cleartext storage.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In either case, if a hacker steals passwords from a database they can read, they can link the username and password to each other. Additionally, since usernames are often emails, the hacker has access to the user’s email address.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Social Engineering: One of the most common forms of hacking, social engineering involves gaining access to information or system resources through social interactions–typically, emails or other messages that pose as legitimate business communications.<br>
<br>
Suppose an employee falls prey to such an attack. In that case, they don’t just give up their own account–they give up the knowledge that a particular account name and password combination potentially works for other systems and platforms.<br>
<br>
Of course, if a hacker tricks an administrator with access to user credentials, then all bets are off. Such an attack can be more damaging than a database breach because the hacker can extract completely unprotected user data from the system. 
 Brute Force Attacks: While not as famous as the other versions of hacks, brute force attacks can compromise passwords in the same way as a social engineering or breach attack. 
 
<p>Compromised passwords are the cornerstone of credential stuffing attacks. Without stolen passwords, there is no ability to perform such an attack.&nbsp;</p>
 What is a Credential Stuffing Attack? 
<p>Credential stuffing is an attack where hackers take stolen credentials from one platform and attempt to use or “stuff” them into as many different platforms, service providers, or institutions as possible. For example, suppose a hack exposes a database of usernames and passwords from a retailer. In that case, hackers will then attempt to use those credentials on hundreds of common platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, banking websites, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The timeline for a credential stuffing attack will generally follow a specific timeline:</p>
 
 Database Breach: An attack, either through a direct database hack, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attack</a>, or brute force attack, uncovers a database of authentication credentials.&nbsp; 
 Stolen Data Purchase or Distribution: This database is advertised, either to the public or via the dark web. Some hackers will announce their attacks and release the information to the public. Most will attempt to sell that database to the highest bidders.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note that a database isn’t a finite thing. Hackers will sell that information to anyone willing to pay, which means a massive potential for credential stuffing attacks.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Automated Brute Force Attacks: Once a hacker has possession of an authentication database, they will feed it into automation tools that attempt to use these credentials (and, in some cases, modified versions of the credentials via dictionary or hybrid attacks) to open any other account on other popular platforms.&nbsp; 
 Account Compromise: If the login credentials match another account, the hacker now has access and may use that account to launch further attacks, steal money or personal information, or commit fraud.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When combined with <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/password-spraying/">password spraying</a> tactics, stuffing can threaten users across hundreds of providers and platforms.</p>
 The Increase of Credential Stuffing Attacks 
<p>Poor cyber hygiene has led to the drastic rise in credential stuffing attacks. The unfortunate reality of cybersecurity is that the human element is often the weakest link, which is no truer than in authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does that lead to credential stuffing attacks? Simply put, when users reuse credentials (specifically login names and passwords) across different accounts, they open up both accounts to attack. This is because if one is compromised, the other may be as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, this isn’t the user’s fault–for example, if one platform experiences a data breach, the user bears some responsibility to change their passwords, but they didn’t cause the problem. However, poor judgment during a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/whale-phishing/">phishing attack</a> means that a user could potentially threaten two or more systems.</p>
<p>And, with consumers juggling dozens of different accounts, the temptation to just use the same credentials is real. This is why, as <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/05/20/financial-services-credential-stuffing/">reported by Security Intelligence</a>, there were 193 billion credential stuffing attacks in 2020 alone.&nbsp;</p>
 How Can I Defend Against Credential Stuffing Attacks? 
<p>Some of the best defenses against credential stuffing attacks are implementing best practices in your organization, and encouraging users to do the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common defenses against credential stuffing attacks include:</p>
 
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): One of the weaknesses of single-factor password authentication is that there is no way to ensure the user is who they say they are. MFA prevents this in most cases because the secondary authentication methods (biometrics, one-time passwords) will usually be tied to the user or their devices.&nbsp; 
 
<p>If the hacker has the user’s device (unlikely in a broad stuffing attack), then advanced spoof prevention measures can close the security gap.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secondary Passwords: You can often mitigate credential stuffing by requiring other credentials, like a secondary password or PIN alongside a password.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Note that secondary passwords aren’t MFA. Multi-factor authentication requires different types of authentication. However, multiple passwords can blunt a stuffing attack because it’s unlikely the hacker would have the right combination of two different passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 
 CAPTCHA: CAPTCHA requires a human user to interact with an image or audio artifact to verify their liveness. Automated credential stuffing attacks aren’t typically equipped to interact with individual CAPTCHA challenges. However, if the attacker is targeting a specific person and not dozens, they might easily bypass this.&nbsp; 
 
 Shore Up Your Password Defenses with 1Kosmos 
<p>Passwords are often the weakest link in authentication security. Users simply cannot juggle so many passwords while maintaining adequate security. The result? Unintended and risky security holes where a weakness on one platform can undermine security on another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the answer? A modern identity and authentication platform removes typical password system weaknesses. 1Kosmos BlockID offers <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication </a>bolstered with biometrics, identity proofing, and an intuitive user experience that encourages users to employ good cyber hygiene practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1Kosmos supports security against credential stuffing with the following key features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. This form of authentication would eliminate the threat of a credential stuffing attack as we eliminate credentials.&nbsp; 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.&nbsp; 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime, and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user.&nbsp; 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target.&nbsp; 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.&nbsp;

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/08/six-takeaways-from-gartner-hype-cycle-for-digital-identity-2022/&nbsp;">Six Takeaways from Gartner® Hype Cycle™ for Digital Identity, 2022</a></p>
<p>KeyFactor recently looked at key insights from the Gartner Hype Cycle for digital identity in 2022 and broke down what they meant. One interesting point they make is that while most people think of digital identity in terms of how people identify themselves online, the proliferation of IoT devices in recent years means that machine identity is outpacing human identity. With machine identity incorporating digital devices of all kinds, APIs, applications and containers, Gartner notes that the ratio of machine identities to humans is now 10:1. The result? A growing concern that many security teams are struggling to keep up. As bad actors adapt to the new increase in targets, Security Boulevard reports that “attacks grew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/venafi/the-future-of-security-lies-in-machine-identity-management/">400% from 2017 to 2021</a>, and in 2020, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-security-and-risk-trends-for-2021">50% of cloud security failures</a> resulted from inadequate management of machine identities and permissions.” You can find the full Gartner Hype Cycle report here.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.cuna.org/articles/121322-synthetic-identity-fraud-the-chameleon-of-fraud-trends&nbsp;">Synthetic identity fraud: The chameleon of fraud trends</a></p>
<p>In our ever expanding virtual world this article serves as an excellent reminder to be selective about&nbsp; whom you share your data with, and who you allow access to. Eric Tran-Le, Vice President and head of Actimize Premier at NICE Actimize, writing on behalf of the Credit Union National Association, provides a deep dive into what synthetic identity fraud is. Synthetic identity fraud is when someone cobbles together a new identity from whatever authentic information they can find and falsifies the rest. Tran-Le explains that&nbsp; this type of fraud is so difficult to catch because&nbsp; “Financial institutions [are] struggling with the lack of a single source of truth for identity verification, siloed identity verification data sources, and inaccurate identity data across data sources.” Being able to trust who they are talking to on the customer side is critical for financial institutions, and Tran-Le touches on a few ideas for how to reduce risk before the article ends. We would adjust that list slightly in order to add the option for verifiable credential solutions, which Indicio has delivered for several financial institutions, and is the backbone of our recently launched <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> actionable credential suite: Indicio’s open source answer for any organization needing a trusted, verifiable, and complete data solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ&nbsp;">Cost of a Data Breach Report 2022</a></p>
<p>IBM recently published their Cost of a Data Breach Report for 2022 and some of the numbers are staggering: From the global average total cost of a data breach being USD 4.35 million to it taking, on average, 277 days to identify and contain a data breach, the numbers signal the high cost of cyber insecurity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few of the statistics we found interesting – and terrifying:</p>
 
 83% of companies that suffered a data breach admit it’s not their first one 
 “organizations that don’t deploy zero trust incur an average of USD 1 million in greater breach costs compared to those that do deploy” 
 “The most common initial attack vector in 2022 was stolen or compromised credentials, responsible for 19% of breaches in the study” 
 
<p>A quick reminder that decentralized verifiable credentials facilitate the continuous verification required by Zero Trust approaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/digital-healthcare-security/141202/">Digital healthcare adoption requires better security</a></p>
<p>Ansgar Steden, the Chief Revenue Officer for Utimaco, provides a unique look into the security of healthcare and the trust the public have in that security in this article for Open Access Government. Due to the COVID 19 pandemic there was a significant rise in virtual healthcare, with the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) app&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/16-million-repeat-prescriptions-the-power-of-a-digital-nhs/140226/">being downloaded over 16 million times.</a>” Now, the NHS is looking into using technology to improve the healthcare available virtually. Some of the ideas include: access to high definition remote operations, connecting ambulances to more immediately see patients in critical conditions, and devices for real time monitoring of patients’ vitals. While these are all things that would be helpful to doctors and patients, the volume of sensitive information needing to be shared presents a massive security risk. Indeed, hospitals and healthcare organizations are already the sector paying the most for data breaches according to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3R8N1DZJ">IBM’s Data Breach Report</a>. The article calls out the need for increased trust before these new features will see widespread adoption, saying, “Devices need to ‘know and trust’ each other and so digital identity becomes paramount.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the best solution is decentralized verifiable credentials that provide privacy-preserving features. There’s an entire open-source codebase developed by Indicio and SITA&nbsp; that can be deployed for these kinds of use cases at the <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea Project</a> at Linux Foundation Public Health.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Ann Cavoukian, Executive Director of the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre. 
<p>In our series opener, Ann Cavoukian discusses Privacy by Design – the 7 foundational principles, the issues that it aims to solve and how Privacy by Design has evolved and is being used in today’s tech products.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“You want to prevent the privacy harms from arising, not just resolve them after the fact, you want to prevent them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Ann Cavoukian is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts.&nbsp;Dr. Cavoukian served an&nbsp;unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognising Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Dr. Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Center for Law, Science &amp; Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to join us a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And you might have heard about Privacy by Design before all the influence that has had in products and regulations, et cetera. And today, we’ll hear about that from its own creator. So, our guest today is Dr. Ann Cavoukian. She is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts.</p>
<p>Dr. Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, network infrastructure, and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. Today, Dr. Cavoukian is the Executive Director of the Global Privacy and Security by Design Centre. Good morning.</p>
<p>Dr. Ann Cavoukian: Good morning, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And it’s fantastic having the pleasure of having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Ann: Thank you. It’s my pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us shortly how, yeah, your journey to this word of privacy and digital identity?</p>
<p>Ann: Well, you know, it’s interesting. When I became Privacy Commissioner, for the first term in ’97, I think, I joined the office and it was full of brilliant lawyers who wanted to apply the law to data breach or privacy infraction and get a good resolution, which is great. But I wanted something earlier than that. I wanted something that was proactive. That by design could be embedded into the operations that you have, bake it into the code, make it a presence, so that you could prevent the privacy harms from arising. I wanted a model of proactive protection. And it took a while to sell this to my staff, to my lawyers. But I literally created Privacy by Design at my kitchen table over three nights. It was all about being proactive. That’s how it came about.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, super interesting. If you can tell us, what is that concept for the ones who are not so completely familiar.</p>
<p>Ann: So, Privacy by Design is all about being proactive. You want to prevent the privacy harms from arising, not just resolve them after the fact, you want to prevent them. And in order to do that, you have to embed the necessary measures into the design of your operations. And privacy, as the default, the second foundational principles of the seven is probably the most important one. What it says to your customers, or your citizens is we don’t expect you to go and search through all the terms of service and the legalese in the privacy policy for the opt out clause that says, “Do not use my personal information for any purpose other than the primary purpose I’ve consented to.” No, no, that takes hours to do. We don’t expect you to do that. We will give you privacy as the default setting. Automatically, we will give you privacy, you don’t have to ask for it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly why it will be ideal if all products that we started using are like that. If you can tell us a bit of all the– well, the problems, some of the problems, I know you have many, some of the problems that Privacy by Design aims to solve.</p>
<p>Ann: At the beginning, the initial problem was that lawyers viewed it not as a legal structure, which is not. It’s trying to be very adaptive to the code, bake it into the code. I always say you got to work with whatever code you have to your operations, that’s where you have to focus. So that was quite different for a lot of people who take a very legalistic approach to it.</p>
<p>But the other thing is, you have to convince your CEO, your executive, your board of directors that this is a valuable pursuit so that they will devote time and attention to allowing you to create Privacy by Design and embedding it in your operations. Now, it’s always to your benefit. Companies that have become certified for Privacy by Design, have come back to me and said they love it. They love it, because it shows their customers the lengths they’re going to, to protect their privacy. So, it builds trust, it builds loyalty and attracts new opportunity.</p>
<p>So, it works very well once you’ve got it going. But people have to be committed to it. And I always say to companies, “Do you have a data map?” And they go, “Huh?” See what data map does. Often companies want to give privacy to their customers and at the first instance when they enter into the company, purchase something, a service or whatever, they get their consent, their positive consent for the primary purpose of the data collection. But the problems arise after that. Often that personal information flows throughout the office to various departments that may be using it in ways that were never consented to.</p>
<p>So, unless you have a data map that flows the direction that data takes within your company, you’re not going to know that. So, I always tell companies get a data map, ensure that you can, you know, like in a diagram almost, indicate what the data flow is. And then you’ll see if you need to obtain some additional consent for secondary uses of the data that were never contemplated.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, you mentioned data map and it’s a term that I rarely hear actually, rarely read, I think it’s…</p>
<p>Ann: I think I created it, but I don’t know I always talk about it. And then people go, “Yeah, that’s a good idea.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. What I mean is that I’m sure not many CEOs, as you mentioned, or people who are responsible for billing to service is on their top of their mind so yeah.</p>
<p>Ann: Not top on mind. That’s for sure.</p>
<p>Oscar: If you could tell us briefly the seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>Ann: Sure. The first one prevent the harms. You want to be proactive so that you could prevent the harms from arising. It’s very, very clear. The second one is privacy as the default setting. And that’s– I talked about that quite a bit. It’s absolutely critical, in fact, it’s considered to be so important. When they enacted the GDPR in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, they included not only my Privacy by Design, but specifically privacy as the default setting as well. So that’s very important.</p>
<p>The third one embedded in design is absolutely critical. If it’s not baked into the code into your operations, it’s going to be overlooked. The fourth one you have to have, what I always say full functionality. Get rid of the zero-sum mindset of privacy versus security, or privacy versus data utility. It can’t be either, or, win, lose. It has to be win-win, privacy and data utility. You make a positive sum, and you get multiple positive gains, privacy and security always intertwined.</p>
<p>And the next one talking about security. While the term privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections and security alone, in this day and age of daily hacking and phishing, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end, with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, start with a solid foundation of security throughout your entire organisation. Give individuals access to their own data.</p>
<p>I always say to companies and governments, you may have custody and control of someone’s data, but it doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to the data subject. So, give them the right of access that they have, allow them to gain access to personal information you have on them. And companies actually have come back to me, companies that are certified for Privacy by Design, and they say, “We love this. We love this principle. Because once we give customers access to their own data, they come back to us and say – No, no, that’s no longer the case. That was true about me two years ago, here’s what’s going on now.” So, they correct the information. They increase the accuracy of the information we hold. And it increases the quality of the data we have. So, they love it.</p>
<p>And the last principle, keep it user centric. When you keep it focused on the user, all of this flows out. Because it should all be around the individual, when it’s personal information you’re dealing with. Because personal information is about identifiable individuals. So, you have to keep it focused on the user, and what they permit, what they don’t permit, things of that nature. So that’s it. Seven foundational principles by design. To me, it’s like motherhood. But to most people, it takes a while to digest.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, pretty solid principle. And thank you for reminding those seven principles that I guess– I think most of us have read at least a few times. But thank you for the reminder. And I would like to know, because it’s been a while since you created that, has that paradigm really evolved changed until now since published or how do you say?</p>
<p>Ann: It has grown enormously in terms of where it’s being followed. It’s followed in 165 countries all around the world. All new laws seem to reflect Privacy by Design. Of course, the GDPR, you know, and the European Union. But other new laws like Brazil enacted a new law last year, they included Privacy by Design in it. And the US is going to be enacting a federal law, there’s Privacy by Design in it. So increasingly, new laws are including Privacy by Design. And also, it’s been translated into 40 languages, 40 languages all over the world .</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s a great achievement having 40 languages already so it’s spreading and spreading as it should be, of course. You have mentioned I think couple of times already, Certification of Privacy by Design, so who does that?</p>
<p>Ann: So how that works is if you think you’re doing Privacy by Design in your company, and you want to get certified, you come to me, send me an email. And with your consent, I partner with KPMG, with your consent, I send KPMG to you to review your information holdings in your operations, to confirm that you are in effect doing Privacy by Design. And usually, they have a few suggestions to make it better. And once they give me a report that you are indeed following Privacy by Design, then I issue a certification and you’re certified. That way, you’re golden.</p>
<p>I always tell people, if you’re certified with Privacy by Design, put it on your website, tell the whole world you’re doing this, because it builds such trust. Customers and companies that have been certified have come back to me and said, “We have the trust that has waned over the years. It’s now returning. Customers appreciate the lengths we’re going to, to protect their privacy. We retain the customers and the loyalty that customers we have. But it’s attracting new customers, attracts new quality, new information to us in terms of what their interests are. So, it’s growing our operations.” They love it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Excellent. So, it’s yourself, your organisation who does the certification.</p>
<p>Ann: With KPMG. KPMG does the actual going in and examining everything.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Excellent. Good to know. Absolutely. If you can tell us also how Privacy by Design is being put in practice besides, of course, certification. Tell us a bit how it’s put in practice in today’s technology products, if you can– tell example if you can.</p>
<p>Ann: Sure. In smart cities, for example, what do smart cities do? They collect a lot of information, everywhere. So my first advice to smart cities, is the minute you collect any personal information from a vehicle that’s driving down the street, or people walking down the street, or an apartment building or whatever, the first thing you do is you de-identify the data. You strip any personal identifiers from the data because that can be used in ways that were never intended, certainly hasn’t been consented to.</p>
<p>But once you have the personal identifiers removed, then it’s just someone’s walking down the street, but you don’t know who that is. Someone’s driving this car to this location, you don’t know who. That’s what’s critical. You don’t need the personal identifiers linked to the data, you just want to get a sense of what’s happening in the city, and how this movement flowing and things of that nature. So that’s one example.</p>
<p>Oscar: Smart cities. Also, in hardware physical products it’s also Privacy by Design?</p>
<p>Ann: Certainly, in terms of the computers that we have, in the mobile devices that we have smartphones, et cetera, Privacy by Design is essential. And the only company that I always point to is Apple. Apple is amazing. They have a – why of course I have an iPhone, because they have end to end encryption. The data are completely encrypted. So, I may be talking to you, you and I can exchange data, but no third parties can gain access to that data in an unauthorised manner. So, encryption is critical. And especially on mobile devices that collect so much personal information, phone calls, emails, texts, et cetera. You must have very strong encryption from end to end, and Apple, and the iPhone is the only company that I know that does that all the time.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Yeah, absolutely, smart cities, you mentioned, well, Apple as the mobile phones and we use all the time mobile applications, web services, different types of products. How, for instance, imagine that I suggested to start using a new product, let’s say a new mobile application. How do I know if that product has been designed with Privacy by Design? Is there a way to know in advance should I buy this product?</p>
<p>Ann: Well, unless they’re certified, you won’t know. But I always say before you use any new product or service, always ask the questions. What will you be doing with my personal information? I’m giving you my personal identifiable data for this purpose and this purpose alone; can you confirm that that’s the only use you will subject it to? Is there any chance of unauthorised third parties gaining access to my data, in which case I’m not interested, I’m out. So, you have to always post the questions before you start a new product or service. It’s critical.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, but that’s post your question to yourself, or you’d say you have to contact the – to them.</p>
<p>Ann: You’ve got to ask it to them, what you’re dealing with , always. And I always do that. But you’d be amazed at the wonderful answers you get. Once you show, you reveal your interest in privacy, they come bxack with, “Oh, we can do this. We can do this. We can do that.” They just take it for granted. You don’t care. But once you show that you care deeply about privacy, they increase your protection dramatically.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, that’s great to hear. Actually, I should do it more often, definitely.</p>
<p>Ann: I do it all the time as you can imagine.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right. OK, I will follow your advice. Absolutely. One final question for you, Ann, fantastic conversation with you. For all business leaders who are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Ann: Trust. You want to gain the trust of your customers. Right now, trust is fleeting. It has diminished dramatically. The concern for privacy has increased dramatically in the last two years. Every public opinion poll in the last few years, Pew Internet Research et cetera, has put in concern for privacy at an all-time high. 90% of people indicated they’re concerned about their privacy. 92% are concerned about loss of control over their personal information.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in the management of your company, you want to gain trust. And you do that, by communicating with your customers. You tell them the lengths you’re going to, to protect their privacy, that you have great respect for them. And you will alert them if you have any additional needs for additional information, and you come back to them and obtain their consent. This builds trust like no other and it will build their business greatly.</p>
<p>Oscar: Trust. Just put in the word trust on the agendas, I think it’s… definitely.</p>
<p>Ann: And the Germans have a wonderful term for this. I always say privacy equals control, personal control over the use and disclosure of your personal information. The Germans have a term for this called informational self-determination. It should be the individual who determines the fate of his or her personal information. So, I love that term. It’s a good one to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Oscar: It is, self-determination, absolutely. Well, thank you very much, Ann, for this very interesting conversation. Would you please tell us, for people who like to learn more about the work you’re doing or get in touch with you, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Ann: They can go to my website, GPS, G P as in Paul, S as in Sam, by design centre, all one word, gpsbydesigncentre, spelled C-E-N-T-R-E.com, <a href="http://gpsbydesigncentre.com">gpsbydesigncentre.com</a>, they’ll find everything.</p>
<p>Oscar: Absolutely, we will do. Fantastic. Again, thanks a lot, Ann, for this interview and all the best.</p>
<p>Ann: It’s my pleasure. Have a great day.</p>
<p>Oscar: Have a nice day. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>MALTA and GIBRALTAR // August 16, 2022 — In an era of interconnectivity, cross-chain utility still remains an untapped source of potential for encouraging growth between blockchain communities.</p><p><a href="https://www.hashguardians.io/">HashGuardians</a> and the<a href="https://t.co/9i3Xv9mGbo"> Stakernauts community</a> are teaming up to provide some of the first cross-chain Gamefi utility on either of their native blockchains — Cardano and the Sirius Chain by<a href="https://proximax.io/"> ProximaX</a>. Currently, HashGuardians NFT owners are able to earn passive staking rewards in the form of HashCoins, the in-game currency of the HashGuardians Universe. Starting this September, owners will also have the opportunity to earn staking rewards in the form of MetX, the Gamefi token for the Stakernauts initiative. Dubbed <a href="https://files.proximax.io/pub-research/Transcendental_Stkg_Prtcptn_Doc_030822.pdf">Transcendental Staking</a>, this novel cross-chain staking program marks the first steps for both projects in creating additional cross-chain utility for NFT&nbsp;owners.</p><p>Transcendental Staking is an innovative method of staking whereby owners of tokens from other chains can come together, participate in a staking activity, and get rewarded with a cryptocoin from the hosting chain. Stakernauts, a community initiative under the Sirius Chain, is pioneering this method of staking to extend staking and remove barriers that limit the earnings of token&nbsp;holders.</p>Some unique HashGuardian NFTs<p>HashGuardians is a leading play-and-earn title being developed on the Cardano blockchain. Launching their NFT-based playable characters during the earliest days of NFTs on Cardano, HashGuardians has consistently been at the forefront of creating functional utility for their players. Staking rewards and the first playable content launched in late 2021, while HashCoin NFT minting and a complete play-and-earn gameplay loop (The Infinity Jump Tower) went live in early 2022. Most recently, HashGuardians has launched full playable utility for all 10,000 of their NFT characters — a rare feat amongst NFT games on any blockchain. Each HashGuardians NFT is a completely unique, fully-animated playable character ready for adventures throughout the HashGuardians Universe.</p><p>“Our mission is to create engaging gameplay that gives the power back to our players,” says F. Katzmarek, HashGuardians CEO. “We want players to control their assets and reap the rewards of being part of the HashGuardians community. We are excited to welcome the ProximaX and Stakernauts community to HashGuardians and appreciate this opportunity to further increase the utility of our NFT collection.”</p><p>HashGuardians NFT and MetX holders that opt into the staking program will be able to register their Sirius wallet address for monthly MetX airdrops. Reward amounts will vary, depending on the number of HashGuardians NFTs and MetX held in the users’ respective blockchain wallets. MetX has a three-part utility on the Sirius Chain, where it serves as the token of choice for ecosystem Gamefi projects. Alongside the Stakernauts’ cross-chain collaborations, MetX will be used in Xarcade — a gaming focused marketplace, and MetaXar — an interactive experience focused on gamifying the link between blockchain gaming projects. Read here for specific information on <a href="https://files.proximax.io/staking/HashGuardians_Transcendental_Stkg_120822.pdf">how to&nbsp;stake</a>.</p><p>By building bridges across blockchains, HashGuardians and the Stakernauts seek to take early initiative in exploring the potential of cross-chain collaborations. With their strong presence in the Asia Pacific region, Stakernauts represent some of the fastest growing markets for blockchain gaming enthusiasts, while HashGuardians’ strong presence in the North American and European markets helps connect existing NFT collectors to the Stakernauts community.</p><p>Stakernauts’ mission is to break down blockchain barriers to build a community of communities. It is driven by the need to bring together an entirely fragmented cryptospace and form a guild of sorts so that communities can share their common goal of earning collectively and cross promoting projects that can be mutually beneficial to all&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Stakernauts is promoted by the people who created the Sirius Chain by ProximaX as part of a bigger picture. It is envisioned that the communities of Stakernauts will be involved in Xarcade — a games marketplace&nbsp;, and MetaXar — a Metaverse project- by Sirius Chain. Further, it is hoped that HashGuardians will be among the firsts to roll out its project in the Metaverse and offer its community an “extended play” of their activities and earn beyond its own rewards — thereby giving its players a multiplier earning&nbsp;effect.</p><p>About HashGuardians:<br>With a focus on the intersection of blockchain technology and engaging, fun gameplay, HashGuardians is developing a multifaceted project with elements designed to appeal to any gamer or blockchain enthusiast. Pre-Alpha gameplay content is now available for HashGuardians NFT holders. Built upon the Cardano blockchain and featuring a play-and-earn economic model, the HashGuardians Universe will enable players to directly benefit from gameplay through claimable NFTs and HashCoins (in-game currency). Players earn rewards both passively and actively, and will have opportunities to engage in mini-games, quests, and adventures whether they have 15 minutes or 2 hours available.</p><p>Additional Information:<br>Project Website: <a href="https://www.hashguardians.io/">HashGuardians — NFT Game<br></a>HashGuardians Discord Community:<a href="https://discord.gg/hashguardians"> https://discord.gg/hashguardians<br></a>HashGuardians Intro Video:<a href="https://youtu.be/bfFOkwuDuVQ"> https://youtu.be/bfFOkwuDuVQ</a></p><p>About ProximaX<br>Sirius by ProximaX is a next generation blockchain with advanced built-in features such as multi-layer multisig, validator rewards, fast finality, cross-chain swaps and much more.

 US Senate Bill Proposes to Make CFTC the Go-to Regulator for Bitcoin, Ether, and Other Digital Commodities  According to the legislators, the proposed bill would give the cryptocurrency sector the much-needed regulatory certainty it&nbsp;needs. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- A US Senate bill was introduced last Wednesday to grant direct control over crypto assets deemed as digital commodities to&nbsp;CFTC.</blockquote><blockquote>- If the proposed legislation becomes a law, it will make it mandatory for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPS), such as exchanges, and custodians, among others, to register with the&nbsp;CFTC.</blockquote><blockquote>- The proposed bill referred to Bitcoin and Ether as digital commodities.</blockquote><p>Last Wednesday, a bipartisan group of senators from the Senate Agriculture Committee unveiled a <a href="https://www.boozman.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2022/8/boozman-stabenow-booker-and-thune-introduce-legislation-to-regulate-digital-commodities">proposal</a> to grant more regulatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over the digital commodities markets. The proposal also applies to Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets viewed as commodities.</p><p>The sponsors of this legislation include Arkansas’ Republic Senator John Boozman and Michigan’s Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow.</p><p>According to the legislators, the proposed bill would give the cryptocurrency sector the much-needed regulatory certainty it needs by consolidating much of its regulatory monitoring under a single regulator.‍‍</p> Protect Consumers‍ <p>If the proposal becomes a law, it will mandate that businesses providing crypto platforms, including custodians, brokers, and exchanges, register with the&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>And the CFTC would impose conditions on such registration to ensure that cryptocurrency businesses maintain sufficient financial resources, avoid conflicts of interest, stop abusive trading practices, uphold fair pricing, and strengthen cybersecurity protections, among other consumer protection measures.‍‍</p> Growing Popularity of Digital Assets in the&nbsp;US‍‍ <p>A <a href="https://finbold.com/americans-prefer-crypto-over-a-traditional-savings-account-study-shows/#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20State%20of,who%20own%20certificates%20of%20deposit.">January 2022 report</a> states that the number of Americans holding crypto has surpassed the number of Americans having access to savings accounts.</p><p>This is a significant sign of how crypto assets are experiencing a massive uptick in terms of adoption in the United States. Thus, regulators and authorities are demanding strong crypto regulatory measures to protect investors &amp; promote innovation.</p><p>The chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen. Stabenow, also believes that regulating the crypto industry is crucial amid its growing significance in the United States financial ecosystem.</p><p>Thus, she noted in the announcement, “One in five Americans have used or traded digital assets — but these markets lack the transparency and accountability that they expect from our financial system. Too often, this puts Americans’ hard-earned money at&nbsp;risk.”</p><p>But Sen. Stabenow has no intention to clamp down on the SEC’s powers to deal with what it sees as violations of the securities regulations. This is why she clarified that the proposed bill is not aimed at regulating every aspect of the cryptocurrency market or limiting the powers of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate digital assets that behave more like securities.</p><p>In fact, she commended the SEC’s work, noting, “We’re not defining what a security is. I have great confidence in Chairman Gensler to be able to use his authorities.”</p><p>Senator Booker, too, referenced the growing number of Americans investing in digital assets as the motive behind this proposed legislation.</p><p>He noted, “As the number of Americans engaging with digital assets continues to grow, it is critical that we clarify and strengthen the regulation of our financial system.”</p><p>Sen. Booker added, “This bipartisan legislation will enhance oversight over digital commodities, taking an important first step to ensure that the digital marketplace operates fairly with commonsense rules in place and protects consumers entering this market.”‍</p> ‍CTFC: The Perfect Crypto Regulator?‍‍ <p>Although Sen. Boozman claimed that the CFTC is the rightful regulator for crypto businesses, he believes that the proposed legislation will enable the commodities and securities authorities to collaborate closely.‍‍</p> The SEC is Here to&nbsp;Stay‍ <p>The SEC will still be in charge of some elements of the crypto industry’s regulation, but the bill doesn’t provide specifics.<br>Interestingly, the proposed bill’s reference to Bitcoin and Ether as commodities is in line with the recent statements Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, made. After all, Mr. Gensler claimed that almost all other digital currencies are securities.‍‍</p> The Next&nbsp;Steps‍‍ <p>Sen. Stabenow and Sen. Boozman said they wanted to move the bill forward as soon as possible but did not give a specific time frame. The time for legislative action will close before the midterm elections in November.</p><p>The bill will now be sent to another committee in its next phase, where it will be discussed and voted on in the Senate after surviving the markup phase, and if passed, it will then be sent to the&nbsp;House.‍</p> ‍A new Tool for&nbsp;CFTC‍‍ <p>Sen. Thune believes that CFTC needs new tools to regulate the evolving commodities market amid the emergence of new-age technologies.</p><p>Thus, he noted, “Technology continues to transform digital commodities, and it’s critical that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has the proper tools to regulate this growing&nbsp;market.”</p><p>He believes that the proposed legislation will empower the CFTC to deal with any uncertainties rising from the crypto assets market while protecting the consumers.‍‍</p> Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto&nbsp;Bill‍ <p>The groundwork for crowning the CFTC as a crypto regulator began in June with the introduction of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/us-senators-kirsten-gillibrand-cynthia-lummis-introduces-the-responsible-financial-innovation-act-to-regulate-digital-assets-in-the-country">the Lummis-Gillibrand Crypto Bill</a>. Although its mission is not yet accomplished, it set off a chain of events in the direction of its final goal, such as the most recent US Senate Bill proposing to grant regulatory powers over digital commodities, including Bitcoin and Ether, to the&nbsp;CFTC.</p><p>Introduced by US Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), the bipartisan cryptocurrency bill included provisions to grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulatory jurisdiction over digital assets and to establish an advisory council to draft guiding principles (CFTC).‍</p><p>A flurry of crypto legislative proposals &amp; statements make it clear that governments around the world will not let the digital assets industry continue without regulatory oversight. Global bodies and watchdogs, such as the FATF, too, are leading the charge in bringing crypto assets within the regulatory net. Thus, Virtual Asset Service Providers, such as the exchanges, brokers, custodians, etc., will have to comply with international as well as jurisdictional-level regulations sooner or later if they are not doing so&nbsp;already.</p><p>The FATF’s Travel Rule has been adopted by only 10+ countries, but this is likely to change soon with the global financial watchdog turning on the heat towards countries that have not taken any concrete steps yet. Thus, VASPs must stay prepared. But there’s nothing to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>All VASPs need is a Travel Rule Solution (TRS) to comply with the Travel Rule. And we have the best TRS available in the market today: Veriscope. It is the only answer to the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs face while complying with the Travel Rule.

<p>Driver’s licenses were one of the top three most breached data attributes in 2021, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (<a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/publication/2021-annual-data-breach-report-2/">ITRC</a>). To make matters worse, many driver’s licenses are counterfeit or altered, making them inauthentic. The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) is committed to eliminating these issues by implementing the “one driver, one record” driver’s license concept. This is why 1Kosmos has partnered with AAMVA to automate driver’s license verification within the BlockID platform.</p>
<p>BlockID integrates with AAMVA to confirm instantly whether driver’s license data is authentic by confirming with a nationwide registry of motor vehicles (RMV) lookup. This allows government agencies, financial institutions, and employers to verify that a driver’s license provided by a citizen, customer or employee actually belongs to them based on RMV records. This way, identity verification is automated which gives organizations confidence that a user is who he or she claims to be. Let’s take a closer look at how this process works within the BlockID platform:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some key advantages of the 1Kosmos AAMVA verification are:</p>
 
 Meet eKYC (Electronic Know Your Customer) compliance by verifying customers’ identity as part of the onboarding process 
 Meet AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance with screening and monitoring capabilities 
 Easy to integrate web-friendly software 
 Data privacy — all data is encrypted and any PII is purged immediately after verification 
 Various U.S. document types supported 
 A seamless customer experience during account opening and re-onboarding

<p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> has been a pioneer in the revolutionary Web3 space. Since 2017, our expert team has been building cutting-edge Verifiable Credentials and Self-Sovereign Identity technology. We created this complete guide on &nbsp;Self-Sovereign Identity to explain its importance to organizations and individuals as well as how the tech works in a simple way.</p><p>TL;DR</p>  As we access apps and websites, organizations by default are dominantly using centralized and federated identity management (e.g. signing in with a Google or Facebook account) systems. Centralized systems often make organizations vulnerable to large-scale hacks and data breaches. With federated systems, credential system providers like Google may use people’s personal data to store and track their online activity without their knowledge.  Because ID and credential verification processes are very slow, expensive, and outdated, certificate fraud and lack of product traceability are big problems around the world.  To solve many of these problems, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) was developed. Self-Sovereign Identity is a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a central authority. For organizations, SSI technology enables them to create fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials and instantly verify the authenticity of a credential.  Self-Sovereign Identity is made up of 3 pillars: blockchain, decentralized identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials.  Self-Sovereign Identity technology can be applied to diverse use cases including issuing fraud-proof certifications, supply chain product tracking, and speeding up workforce recruitment times.  <p>Introduction</p><p>How would you feel if you found out that your doctor had a fake degree? </p><p>If you’re a food supplier, how would you contain a contaminated batch of products when you can’t trace it back to its origin? </p><p>And did you know that cybercriminals <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190219006067/en/Cyber-Criminals-Cash-in-on-Millions-With-Formjacking-Posing-a-Serious-Threat-to-Businesses-and-Consumers">earn up to $2.2 million</a> through formjacking attacks by stealing 10 credit cards per website?</p><p>While all of these situations seem completely unrelated, they actually all tie back to the recurring problems of outdated verification systems and reduced security with traditional identity management systems.</p><p>As we access apps and websites, organizations are dominantly using centralized and federated identity management systems (e.g. signing in with a Google or Facebook account) by default. The centralized system puts data at risk of large scale hacks and breaches while the federated model enables companies to track user data without their knowledge. Unsurprisingly, cybersecurity spending increases every year.</p><p>These problems are what motivated the development of the Self-Sovereign Identity model to manage digital identities. There are many advantages to Self-Sovereign Identity that we’ll dive into more detail later, including:</p>  Fully owning and controlling your data  Increased security and privacy  Eliminating central points of failure  Data can’t be tracked and correlated (data that is used to trace back to someone’s identity or track online behavior)  <p>Table of Contents</p>  What Is Self-Sovereign Identity? <p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. In contrast to centralized identity management, you are the boss of your identity and get to decide who gets to see your data. You can also remove access to your data any time.</p><p>Before diving into the details of Self-Sovereign Identity, it’s important to know what digital identity is first. A digital identity is any data that exists online that can be traced back to an individual or organization. Identifiable data includes passwords, user names, bank accounts, and social media photos.</p><p>SSI technology allows people to self-manage their digital identities without depending on third-party providers to store and manage the data. Currently, Self-Sovereign Identity is used interchangeably with the term <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a>. </p><p>There are three main participants in the SSI system: </p>  Holder: Someone who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives Verifiable Credentials.  Issuer: Party with the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials.  Verifier: Party checking the credential. &nbsp;  <p>The interactions between the holder, issuer, and verifier is sometimes called "the trust triangle." Every time information is requested by a verifier, the holder chooses whether to allow access to their data. </p> 3 Pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and decentralized identifiers are 3 pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity.&nbsp;<p>Self-Sovereign Identity is made up of 3 pillars: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personal identifiable information.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can present to verifiers.  <p>For example, let's say a new gym opens and every employee must have a First Aid training certificate, which is valid for three years.</p>  Holder: Sandy the job applicant  Issuer: First Aid training organization  Verifier: Gym  <p>Here is how these roles interact in a Self-Sovereign Identity system:</p>  Sandy (holder) has a digital identity wallet app on her phone that stores her Verifiable Credentials.  Sandy successfully passes her First Aid training and the training organization digitally issues her training certificate that she then keeps securely on her app. Her certificate is now fraud-proof.  Sandy applies to the gym (verifier) and presents her Verifiable Credential (the certificate) and the gym can instantly verify her credential by simply scanning a QR code.  <p>In this case, the gym trusts only the First Aid training organization as an issuer and Sandy wouldn’t be able to fake the certificate. The training organization’s DID is publicly known and only First Aid certificates issued by this issuer as Verifiable Credentials would be recognized as valid for verifiers. </p><p>If someone tried to make Sandy a fake digital certificate by changing the data, the verification would fail. The failed verification confirms that the certificate is not authentic because the signature wouldn’t match the issuer’s DID or the hash (acts like a digital fingerprint) would be wrong.</p> Principles of Self-Sovereign Identity With a Self-Sovereign Identity system, users fully own and control their data and decide who to share it with.<p>Many people have written about the principles of identity, including Kim Cameron’s “<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms996456(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN">Laws of Identity</a>” and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webpayments-ig/VCTF/charter/faq.html">W3C Verifiable Claims Task Force FAQ</a>. While there is no clear consensus on what Self-Sovereign Identity is among different thought leaders and organizations, there are 10 key principles that summarize the essential aspects of SSI. </p><p>1) Existence: A user must be able to exist in the digital world without the need of a third party.</p><p>2) Control: People must have ultimate authority over their digital identities and personal data.</p><p>3) Access: Users must have easy and direct access to their own data.</p><p>4) Transparency: The way an identity system and algorithms are managed and updated must be publicly available and reasonably understandable. The solution design should be based on open protocol standards and open software.</p><p>5) Persistence: Identities must be long-lasting. Solution developers should implement sufficient foundational infrastructure and design sustainable commercial and operational models.</p><p>6) Portability: People must be able to bring their identities and credentials anywhere, transport their data from one platform to another, and not be restricted to a single platform.</p><p>7) Interoperability: Identities should be as widely usable as possible by various stakeholders. Organizations, databases, and registries must be able to quickly and efficiently communicate with each other globally through a digital identity system.</p><p>8) Consent: Users must give explicit permission for an entity to use or access their data. The process of expressing consent should be interactive and well-understood by people.</p><p>9) Minimization: A digital identity solution should enable people to share the least possible amount of data that another party needs to minimize sharing of excessive and unnecessary personally identifiable information.</p><p>10) Protection: People’s right to privacy must be protected and safeguards should exist against tampering and monitoring information. Data traffic should be encrypted end-to-end.</p> Origins of Self-Sovereign Identity Self-Sovereign Identity was developed largely because governments and companies were sharing tremendous amounts of information and tracking people's online behavior without their knowledge.<p>There are a growing number of discussions about SSI around the world among citizens, companies, and governments. But where did this digital identity approach come from? </p><p>Christopher Allen is a standards and identity practice specialist at the blockchain development startup Blockstream and a veteran developer. He believes that <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/a-brief-history-of-ssi-where-does-it-come-from-a-timeline/">SSI began in the early 90s</a> when Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) mentioned the idea of “Web of Trust,” which is the first hint of what could become a Self-Sovereign Identity. PGP is a security program used to decrypt and encrypt email and authenticate email messages through digital signatures and file encryption. </p><p>The “Web of Trust” was an approach where trust could be established by allowing peers to act as introducers and validators of public keys and anyone could be a validator in the PGP model. While this approach was a great example of decentralized trust management, the limitation is that it focused on email addresses that depended on centralized hierarchies. This, in addition to other reasons, is why PGP never became broadly adopted. </p><p>In 1996, Carl Ellison wrote a paper on digital identity called “Establishing Identity Without Certification Authority.” He mainly argued that there was a need for a method to establish identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities. </p><p>SSI really gained momentum in the 21st century as the internet developed more. In his article, “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/04/27/the-path-to-self-sovereign-identity/">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a>,” Allen discussed his vision for Self-Sovereign Identity where digital identity can enable trust while preserving individual privacy. He says SSI is much needed during this time because governments and companies are sharing tremendous amounts of information and correlating everything from purchases, people’s locations, and who they associate with. SSI can help protect people from increasing control from people in power. </p><p>Countries, governments, and companies often associate people’s identity with state-issued credentials like driver’s licenses and social security cards. But for SSI advocates, this is problematic because it implies that people can lose their identity if a central authority removes it from them. With a Self-Sovereign Identity, no entity can remove your digital identity. </p> <br>4 Key Phases in the Evolution of Digital Identity <p>The models of online identity have gone through these four main phases since the internet was invented: </p>  Centralized identity  Federated identity  User-centric identity  Self-sovereign identity  <p>Right now we are dominantly using centralized identifiers like emails, phone numbers, and user names to authenticate our identity to access websites and apps. As we create more accounts, our personal data is being spread more and more on the internet.</p> Phase 1: Centralized Identity (Administrative Control by a Single Authority or Hierarchy) <p>As the internet was first developing, centralized authorities became the issuers and authenticators of digital identity. <a href="https://www.iana.org/about">IANA</a> (1988) was an organization that determined the validity of IP addresses and <a href="https://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> (1998) arbitrated domain names. In 1995, certificate authorities helped commerce sites authenticate their identities. </p><p>Some organizations went beyond centralization and created hierarchies where the root controller would choose other organizations to each oversee their own hierarchy. But the root controller would always have more power. As the internet grew, centralized authorities and hierarchies gained more power as more people had to manage a growing number of digital identities while having no control over them. </p><p>This model is a siloed one where systems are isolated from each other as people have to create a digital identity account for every platform. The average person has <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100 passwords</a> and a study from the University of Sydney conducted a survey among social media users from Australia, UK, and US revealed that a third of people <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/survey-finds-a-third-of-people-dont-trust-social-media-companies-with-thei/596830/">don’t trust social media companies with their data</a>. This creates a bad user experience as they have to manage an increasing number of accounts.</p><p><a href="https://gipviahy.com/gifs/Jasmine-Star-omg-work-laptop-ciPzVXFVbAcdFEHubs"></a></p> Phase 2: Federated Identity (Administrative Control by Multiple, Federated Authorities) <p>Because of the problems that resulted from the first siloed digital identity model, federated identity was developed. A federated identity allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains using a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps. A federated identity links a user’s identity across multiple identity management systems so they can access different applications efficiently. </p><p>Microsoft’s Passport initiative in 1999 was one of the first to offer a federated identity. But the problem is that Microsoft was at the center of the federation which made it almost as centralized as traditional authorities. </p><p>In federated identity systems, personal data is often being stored, tracked, and shared to other parties without people’s knowledge. In 2019, Facebook had 540 million user records exposed on the Amazon cloud server (<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/millions-facebook-user-records-exposed-amazon-cloud-server/">CBS</a>). Currently, there is a hacker attack <a href="https://aag-it.com/how-often-do-cyber-attacks-occur/">every 39 seconds</a>.</p> Phase 3: User-Centric Identity (Individual or Administrative Control Across Multiple Authorities Without Requiring a Federation) <p>In 2000, the <a href="http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1068/988">Augmented Social Network</a> established the groundwork for a new kind of digital identity for the next generation of the internet. They recommended that a persistent online identity should be built into the architecture of the internet. The key advancement to digital identity is the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity.</p><p>The Identity Commons (2001-Present) began to compile the new work on digital identity with a focus on decentralization. Their most important contribution was their creation of the Internet Identity Workshop working group, or IIW (2005-Present), where they advance the idea of decentralized identity in a series of semi-yearly meetings. They focused on a new term: user-centric identity. </p><p>The user-centric identity model suggests that users are in the middle of the identity process, the user must have more control over their identity, and trust must be decentralized. IIW’s work supported different methods for creating digital identity including OAuth (2010) and OpenID Connect (2014). User-centric approaches tended to focus on user consent and interoperability. </p><p>However, powerful institutions prevented them from realizing their goals. Today, the ownership of user-centric identities remains with the entities that register them. Being user-centric isn’t enough. &nbsp;</p> Phase 4: Self-Sovereign Identity (Individuals Have Full Control Across Any Number of Authorities) <p>Self-Sovereign Identity is the next step beyond user-centric identity. The term Self-Sovereign Identity was used more in the 2010s when people advocated not just that people be at the center of the identity process but that they are the rulers of their own identity.  </p><p>There were a growing number of discussions of SSI within international policy that were largely driven by the refugee crisis in Europe. Many people lacked a recognized state-issued identity as they had to flee their homes.</p> Problems With Centralized Digital Identifiers, Credentials, and IDs   Centralized digital credentials, like health and safety training certificates and university degrees, &nbsp;are easy to forge. The only way to check their authenticity is by contacting the issuing organization, which can take days to even months to confirm the information you need  Traditional IDs like a driver’s license or other government-issued IDs are not private as the verifier can access all the information on a credential that they often don’t need like date of birth and address  The verification of credentials is dependant on the issuer and if their service is offline or disappears, then people can’t prove the authenticity of their credentials to a verifier  Data can be stored, tracked, and shared by third parties  More than <a href="https://gatefy.com/blog/key-points-verizon-data-breach-report-dbir-2020/#:~:text=In%20number%2C%20hacking%20was%20present,through%20lost%20or%20stolen%20credentials.">80% of breaches</a> within hacking involve brute force or the use of lost or stolen credentials.  Data stored on an issuer’s centralized servers have an increased risk of becoming targets for hacks, breaches, or leaks   Examples of the Consequences of Data Breaches<br> <p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/four-states-warn-unemployment-benefits-applicants-about-data-leaks-n1212431">33,000 unemployment applicants</a> were exposed to a data security breach through the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program</p>  Yahoo holds the record for the <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/data-breach-statistics">largest data breach of all time</a> with three billion compromised accounts  Annually, hospitals spend <a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/hospitals-spend-64-more-on-advertising-after-a-data-breach">64% more</a> on advertising the two years following a breach  In 2018, a Marriott International data breach affected roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html">500 million guests</a>   Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity Management for Organizations, Individuals, and Developers<br>  Organizations   Significantly reduce costs, inefficiencies, and resources by verifying credentials like nurse licenses or online course completion certificates instantly instead of days, weeks, and months  Issue fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials efficiently and at a much lower cost  Improve security with public-key cryptography  Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks, breaches, lawsuits, and fines by storing less user data   Individuals   Full ownership and control over your identity without relying on a third party  Create your own DIDs and fully manage your data with a digital wallet  You can choose which data to share and with whom to share it with while having the ability to remove access to the data at any time  Personal data is not stored on centralized servers  You don’t have to provide unnecessary and excessive information than what is requested like showing your full address if you only need to confirm your age  <p>Developers</p>  Build apps that eliminate the need for password, which creates a better user experience  Removes inefficient authentication processes like using text or email for secondary verification  Request data directly from users rather than a third party  <p>A Self-Sovereign Identity platform like <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> enables people and organizations to create, manage, and store their data on a decentralized network.</p><p>How Does Self-Sovereign Identity Management Work?</p><p>We’ll go over the key details of the three pillars of SSI which are blockchain, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials and how they work together. </p> SSI Pillar 1: Blockchain<br> Dock CEO Nick Lambert explains what a blockchain is and how it works.<p>Blockchain is a system of recording information on a digitally distributed database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network. These computers are called nodes. The way that blockchain is designed makes it very difficult to change, hack or cheat the system. Each block has unique data about the previous block and once the data on the blocks are verified, they are added to the blockchain. </p><p>Key Features of a Self-Sovereign Identity Blockchain:</p>  Decentralized: Blockchain uses a peer-to-peer network where no one party can change or manipulate the way a blockchain should act. Nodes can be anywhere in the world as long as they have the required equipment to be part of the network. If it’s a permissionless blockchain, anyone can join the network.  Distributed ledger (record of transactions): Every node in the network gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that it hasn’t been tampered with. When new data is verified, everyone adds this information to their copy of the blockchain.  High security with immutability: Blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. Every block has a hash (string of letters and numbers) of the previous block, which acts like a unique digital fingerprint. If the hash changes on a block, everyone in the network will know that it has been tampered with and tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes and not be added to the blockchain.  <p>Let’s consider a company where only one person has access to financial records and history. If they changed the numbers, who would know about it? There may be limited or no traceable evidence or record of this change so they can easily steal money or commit fraud. But if all transactions were recorded on a permissioned blockchain, other staff could audit and check the transactions to ensure they are accurate.</p><p>Here is how each party uses the blockchain in a Self-Sovereign Identity system:</p>  Holder: Owner of the Verifiable Credential (e.g. driver’s license) has their public DID on the blockchain.  Issuer: When an issuer, like a government department, provides a Verifiable Credential to a holder like a driver’s license, they sign it with their DID and associated private key. The department’s DID and associated public key will be on the blockchain.  Verifier: A verifier, like an on-demand driving company, can check the blockchain to ensure that the government department they trust did in fact issue the license because the credential was signed by the issuer’s DID that is on the blockchain.   <p>A blockchain allows the holder, issuer, and verifier to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials.</p>Dock's Solutions Architect explains what data goes on the blockchain and how privacy is protected in Self-Sovereign Identity management.<p>The identity and credentials are not stored on the blockchain but rather on the holder’s digital wallet.</p><p>What is stored on the blockchain</p><p>What is not stored on the blockchain</p><p>An issuer’s and holder’s public keys associated with their DID</p><p>A holder’s personal data like date of birth, name, and credit card details</p><br><p>Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;</p> SSI Pillar 2: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)<br> Mike explains how decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work and their benefits.<p>Everyone who has an online presence has a digital identifier like an email address or user name. Today, we mostly rely on centralized identifiers such as Google, Facebook, email providers, or mobile network operators to connect to websites and apps. But these digital identifiers are often used to store, track, and share user data. Companies can know who we messaged, what we bought, where we live, our location, and so on. </p><p>Thankfully, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) allow people to create digital identities that they can securely connect to their Verifiable Credentials that don't reveal personal information without authorization. DIDs allow us to have full ownership and control of our data. Having multiple DIDs makes it harder for someone to correlate those DIDs together. </p><p>A DID is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is independent of any organization. DIDs are publicly known by relevant parties. </p><p>Here is an example of a Dock DID:</p><p>A DID:</p>  Is created by the user  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Does not contain personal data or wallet information  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>People can make as many DIDs as they want for different purposes and interactions. For example, someone can generate three different DIDs:</p>  DID 1: For their online shopping only  DID 2: For cryptocurrency-related services like trading and buying NFTs  DID 3: Professional purposes like holding their educational credentials such as a university degree and course certificates  Users can create as many DIDs as they want for different purposes and interactions. Private and Public Keys That Come With DIDs <p>To learn how private and public keys work, it’s important to understand what encryption is. Encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling its contents so only certain people can look at your message. </p><p>There are 2 types of encryption: </p>  Symmetric encryption: One key (password) is used to encrypt and decrypt data. Think about securing access to a document by choosing a password like “catsrule.” In order for someone to open the document, they need to type in “catsrule.” In this example, a single password (key) is used to encrypt and decrypt the document. <br>  Asymmetric encryption: The encryption key (also called the public key) and the corresponding decryption key (also called the private key) are different. Asymmetric encryption is also known as public-key encryption.  <p>Let’s say Ellen has a confidential document she wants to share with her colleague Ken. She uses an encryption program to protect the document with a password that she chooses. She sends the message to Ken who can’t open the message because he doesn’t know the password in the same way that he doesn’t have a “key” to open the lock to access the document. </p><p>Ellen doesn’t want to share the password through email because other people can use it to decrypt any message between Ellen and Ken. This is the problem with symmetric encryption and what asymmetric encryption tries to solve. </p><p>With asymmetric encryption, Ellen and Ken have to generate a key pair on their computers. A public and private key will be linked to each other. A public key can be used to encrypt data and only the matching private key can be used to decrypt data. But if you know someone’s public key, you can’t access their private key. </p><p>Ellen and Ken can use asymmetric encryption to communicate securely with each other. </p>  They first exchange their public keys  When Ellen sends her confidential document, she encrypts it with Ken’s public key  Ken then uses his private key to unlock the document. Because of asymmetrical encryption, only Ken can decrypt the message. Even Ellen can’t decrypt it because she doesn’t have Ken’s private key.  Ken and Ellen should never share their private key. If someone gets Ken’s private keys, a hacker can decrypt all messages intended for Ken. But the hacker can’t decrypt messages sent to Ellen because that requires her private key.   <p>Asymmetric encryption is used where security is very important including a website with the address https://, secure emails, or cryptocurrency to make sure only the owner of a wallet can withdraw or transfer money from it.</p>Every DID comes with one or many private and public keys.<p>Every DID comes with one or many private and public keys. </p>  Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign Verifiable Credentials. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.  Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.   <p>Think about a mailbox on the street that is public and many people know the location. Anyone can drop in letters but only the owner can open it up. The mailbox’s address would be like the public key that is safe for everyone to know. The owner of the mailbox is the only one who has the private key that is needed to open up the mailbox. </p><p>For additional security, you can generate a new public key whenever you transact with a different party to reduce the chances of someone correlating data. This practice can be compared to having a different password for every new website you create an account for. It’s not safe to use “itsreallyme123” for every site. It’s better to have longer and complex passwords to reduce the risk of your information being hacked.</p> SSI Pillar 3: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) <p>ID cards, certificates, and degrees can easily be faked and organizations have few to no options of verifying their authenticity without doing a tedious, manual process of checking with the issuer of a credential like a university or licensing organization. But Verifiable Credentials allow verifiers like an employer, government department, or app to verify credentials in seconds! </p><p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically-secured version of paper and digital credentials that people can present to parties that need them for verification. An employer for example can simply use an app to scan a job candidate’s QR code to confirm that they have a bachelor’s degree without needing to spend days or weeks contacting a university to verify if someone’s degree is authentic. </p><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C</a> is an international community of member organizations, staff, and the public collaborating to set international standards for the World Wide Web. When digital credentials conform to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 standards that they established, they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials. </p><p>The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0 is a “specification [that] provides a standard way to express credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable.” W3C created standards for Decentralized Identifiers, URL, and others.</p> Key Benefits of Verifiable Credentials   Issuing Organizations: Save money and time issuing Verifiable Credentials efficiently, including the option to issue in bulk, prevent fraud, and reduce manual work.  Verifying Organizations: Save time, resources, and money by verifying credentials instantly without having to contact issuing organizations.  Individuals: Only provide the relevant information to a verifier without disclosing unnecessary information and confirm claims without revealing the actual data.  Developers: Enhance the user experience by authenticating securely without the need for passwords.  <p>There are two main ways Self-Sovereign Identity blockchain companies can enable people to preserve privacy: </p><p>1) Selective Disclosure</p><p>You can decide which data of a credential you want to show to a verifier without revealing unnecessary information than what is requested. For example, if you need to be at least 18 to receive a service, you can show your birth date from your license that was issued as a Verifiable Credential without showing your name or address. </p><p>2) Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</p><p>With zero-knowledge proof technology, Self-Sovereign Identity providers go even further to help people maintain privacy by proving you are 18 years old or over without even revealing your date of birth. This is made possible with the use of cryptography where the holder can show the verifier that they meet a certain requirement (like minimum age, income, or area of residence) without needing to show the data that supports that proof. </p> How Blockchain, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials Work Together <p>We’ll go through an example that demonstrates how all of these pillars of SSI work together. </p><p>Let’s say there’s an online course on how to use a project management tool that will issue a certificate as a Verifiable Credential after students complete the course. </p>  Holder: Dawn Lopez completes the Jira Advanced Course and has a digital identity wallet  Issuer: Zip Education is an online course provider that issues a certificate to course graduates  Verifier: Employer hiring someone with project coordination skills and trusts Zip Education as an issuer    Dawn creates a DID with her digital identity wallet for professional purposes and the DID automatically comes with a private and public key pair.  Dawn successfully completes Jira Advanced Course.  Zip Education uses their private key to sign and issue a certificate to the student using Dock Certs. The Certs API is connected to their existing system.  The Dock blockchain holds the public DIDs of Zip Education and Dawn.  Dock Certs generates a PDF and JSON version of the certificate and Zip Education emails this credential to the student. Dock will soon have an update to automatically send the credential to the holder’s wallet. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.  Dawn imports the credential on her Dock wallet.  An employer who trusts Zip Education as an issuer verifies the credential by uploading the JSON file onto Dock Certs.   <p>Here is another example of how public and private keys are used in the SSI system. </p>  Holder: Tommy  Issuer: Government department  Verifier: Online English education company  <p>An online English education company in Japan wants to hire contract teachers from the USA and Canada only. They use Verifiable Credentials as part of their screening process to ensure that teachers are residents in North America.</p>  Tommy has a DID in his Dock Wallet and wants to add his passport details on it  Tommy goes to the government office and the staff asks him to scan a QR code, which enables a secure connection and exchange of DIDs  The staff uses the private key to sign and issue the digital passport as a Verifiable Credential  Tommy accepts the credential and stores it in his wallet  The online education company requests data to confirm that he lives in Canada or the USA  Tommy authorizes the online education company to see his relevant data  The company verifies the credential that confirms that he lives in Canada  In this example, the government issues a passport to someone as a Verifiable Credential. Self-Sovereign Identity Wallet <p>A secure Self-sovereign Identity wallet is essential because it allows people to carry their credentials anywhere on their phone or digital device. Portability is one of the principles of SSI.</p><p>Key aspects of an SSI wallet:</p>  Enables people to securely store and manage DIDs and Verifiable Credentials without relying on a third party  A holder must give the authorization to share data to a verifier who needs to confirm eligibility to access services or products  Makes it harder for companies to track or correlate information back to the user  People can access websites and apps without revealing personal information or any more details than necessary  People can sign in with a DID rather than creating a new account with a user name and password to access another website or app  <p>If Sarah wants to buy alcohol and needs to prove she is at least 18 years old, she can do this without revealing her date of birth or any other details about her identity by using a Self-Sovereign Identity wallet that has implemented zero-knowledge proof technology. </p>  The cashier requests data from her wallet that confirms that she is at least 18 years old (with her driver’s license) and Sarah is prompted to give permission to share the data  When Sarah approves the request, this creates a secure connection between the store and Sarah’s wallet while exchanging DIDs.  Sarah’s driver’s license confirms that she is at least 18 years old. Because of zero-knowledge proof technology, her license details like the actual date of birth and her full name are not revealed at all and the store trusts that the data provided by the issuer, the licensing organization, is legitimate. A verifier can use the issuer’s DID and associated public key on the blockchain to check that the data in the user’s wallet is authentic.   <br>Dock Wallet Dock's Self-Sovereign Identity wallet enables users to securely manage their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials.<p>The <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a> is a secure Self-Sovereign Identity wallet that allows people to securely store their DIDs and Verifiable Credentials and take them anywhere. You can import Verifiable Credentials through QR code or a JSON file. </p> Self-Sovereign Identity Use Cases <p>SSI can be used in many ways across a variety of sectors and new use cases are continuously being developed. Below are just a few examples.</p><p>Supply chains</p><p>Verify parties and documents instantly in the supply chain while tracing the source of products that are tracked on the blockchain. </p><p>Streamline the recruitment process</p><p>Organizations that want to recruit high-quality candidates efficiently can verify educational and professional credentials like a university degree and professional certificates instantly with SSI. This will save days to weeks compared to traditional manual verification processes. </p><p>Healthcare</p><p>In order to provide efficient and consistent service based on accurate information on a patient’s identity and medical history, SSI can help maintain an accurate record that can be shared efficiently with relevant healthcare providers. </p><p>Authenticating employees and contractors<br>Organizations can issue Verifiable Credentials for an employee or contractor status. Holders can login with their Self-Sovereign Identity wallet. Organizations can add credentials that expire for temporary contractors. </p><p>Cross border processes and duties</p><p>Track shipment credentials and how they are used. </p><p>Know Your Customer Compliance (KYC)</p><p>KYC compliance can be streamlined by implementing Verifiable Credentials during the client onboarding process. Instead of doing a different KYC process for every service you sign up for, you can reuse your KYC credentials. For example, if Company A ran a KYC and issued you Verifiable Credentials, you can reuse these same credentials when you sign up for Company B to speed up the KYC process. </p><p>NFTs</p><p>SSI can help prove who created, owned or currently owns non-fungible tokens (NFTs) across their lifecycle. SSI can enable someone to prove they own an NFT without having to connect their ETH wallet. </p><p>Income proof for financial and government services<br>You can provide proof of income without revealing your actual total earnings. </p><p>Voting for an organization like a club or company<br>SSI can be used to ensure that only members can attend and vote. Their credentials will be linked to their DID and their names won’t be revealed. &nbsp;The organization can trust that people are who they say they are and they have the right to vote because they can cryptographically prove they own the rightful DID.</p><p>Immigration and demographic information <br>Verifiable Credentials can include details that would be needed to qualify for government services such as being old age, a veteran, Native/Aboriginal, or have a disability status. VCs can speed up the verification process because people can use these credentials to apply for a government program or prove something about themselves quickly with no wait times.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity Standards <p>SSI standards that help people create and manage their digital identities are a continuous work in progress. Standards include data models, open-source code, APIs, and more. These are the key standards that have been developed:</p> W3C: Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations 1.0<br> <p>The W3C Credentials Community Group explores the creation, storage, presentation, verification, and user control of credentials. The group published a first version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/05/vc-data-model/CGFR/2017-05-01/">Verifiable Claims Data Model and Representations 1.0</a> in May 2017. The specification discusses the criteria of verifiable claims. By this standard, a self-sovereign architecture for verifiable claims is one where the holder of a verifiable claim is in complete control of their identifier and how they are used.</p> W3C DID: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 <p>The W3C DID Working Group established standards for DIDs in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0</a> where they specify a variety of criteria including a common data model, DID operations, and an explanation of the process of resolving DIDs to the resources that they represent. </p> Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <p>The <a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity-foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> is an engineering-driven organization that represents a diverse, international collection of organizations and contributors working together to establish an open ecosystem of decentralized identity that is accessible to everyone. </p><p>DIF has a variety of working groups establishing standards and protocols (a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices) including the following: </p>  Identifiers and discovery: DIF members are working on protocols and implementations that enable the creation, resolution, and discovery of DIDs and names across decentralized systems like blockchains  Authentication: Members design and implement DID-based authentication spec, standards, and libraries  DID Communication: Produce one or more specifications that embody a method for secure, privacy, and authenticated message-based communication (where possible) where trust is rooted in DIDs.  Secure data storage: Create one or more specifications to establish a foundational layer for secure data storage.    Trust Over IP Foundation <p>The <a href="https://trustoverip.org/why-toip/overview/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> was founded in 2022. The organization: </p>  Promotes global standards for confidential and direct connections between parties  Leverages the opportunities for interoperable digital wallets and credentials  Protects citizen and business identities by anchoring them with verifiable credential signatures  <p>They have several working groups including: </p>  Governance stack: Working to define models and interoperability standards for governance frameworks that enable business, legal, and social trust between entities implementing the Trust over IP architecture stack.  Technical stack: Define the technical standards, test suites, and interoperability certification standards for the Trust Over IP architecture stack    How to Create a Self-Sovereign Identity With Dock Mike walks through the steps of how to create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential with Dock Certs.<p>Dock is a Self-Sovereign Identity platform, where people can create DIDs, issue, and verify credentials.</p>  Create as many DIDs as you want in Dock Certs  Easily issue Verifiable Credentials with the option to issue in bulk  Instantly verify credentials by uploading a JSON file under Credentials&gt;Verify   Summary of Key Terms <p>Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. </p><p>Centralized identity: Administrative control by a single authority or hierarchy.</p><p>Data breach: When an unauthorized person or party steals, views, transmits, copies, or uses information.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personal identifiable information. </p><p>Federated identity: Allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains using a single set of credentials.</p><p>Holder: Someone who owns the Verifiable Credential and stores it in their digital wallet app.</p><p>Issuer: Person or organization with the authority to issue Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people and organizations to prove ownership, sign Verifiable Credentials, and give consent to share selected data. </p><p>Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to. </p><p>Selective Disclosure: You can decide which data of a credential you want to show to a verifier without revealing unnecessary information than what is requested.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity: A model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on anyone or organization.</p><p>User-centric identity: This model suggests that users are in the middle of the identity process, the user must have more control over their identity, and trust must be decentralized.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can present to verifiers.</p><p>Verifier: The person or organization checking the credential.</p> Conclusion <p><br>Since the invention of the internet, people have dominantly used centralized and federated identifiers like emails and user names to access websites and apps. Centralized identity systems often make organizations vulnerable to large scale hacks and data branches while federated systems can enable companies to use people’s personal data to store and track their online activity without their knowledge. Centralized identity management systems have resulted in recurring data breaches, loss of individual control of their data, stolen identities, and the spread of confidential information. </p><p>Also, because ID and credential verification processes are very slow, expensive, inefficient, and outdated, credential fraud and lack of product traceability is a big problem in many sectors, particularly in supply chain and licensing.</p><p>These problems led to the development of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. There are a growing number of use cases that can implement Self-Sovereign Identity management across a variety of sectors including healthcare, finance, education, and cryptocurrency.</p><p>Key Benefits of Self-Sovereign Identity Solutions</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Individuals</p><p>Developers</p><p>Significantly reduce costs and resources by verifying credentials, certificates or documents instantly instead of days and weeks</p><p>Full ownership and control over your identity without relying on a third party&nbsp;</p><p>Build apps that eliminate the need for password, which creates a better user experience</p><p>Issue fraud-proof Verifiable Credentials efficiently and at a much lower cost</p><p>Create your own DIDs and fully manage your data with a digital wallet&nbsp;</p><p>Removes inefficient authentication processes like using text or email for secondary verification</p><p>Improved security with public-key cryptography</p><p>You can choose which data to share and with whom to share it with while having the ability to remove access to the data at any time</p><p>Request data directly from users rather than a third party</p><br><p>Reduce the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks, breaches, lawsuits, and fines by storing less user data&nbsp;</p><p>Personal data is not stored on centralized servers</p><br><br><p>You don’t have to provide unnecessary and excessive information than what is requested like showing your full name if you only need to confirm your country or residence</p><br><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>In the first three parts of the GlobaliD 101 series, we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-id-wallets-68fa77e6d0d7">Part 3:</a> Why the ID Wallet is the first step toward achieving a new vision for digital&nbsp;identity  <p>At first, every company was a tech company. Every business needed a digital strategy. Back in 2017, Goldman Sachs’ CEO famously stated that the storied investment bank <a href="https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-digit/submission/goldman-sachs-a-technology-company/">was actually a tech company</a>: “We are a technology firm. We are a platform.”</p><p>Not long after, every company was a fintech company. Every business needed a way to manage money and payments. As Andreessen Horowitz’s <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/21/banking-on-the-future/">Angela Strange wrote</a> in 2019, “I believe the next era of financial services will come from seemingly unexpected places… Fintech is eating the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Fast forward to today, and every company is an identity company. Every business needs to connect with customers and users as well as manage their data, privacy, and trust in a compliant way.</p><p>In other words, every company is a verifier as part of the <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Trust Triangle.</a></p><p>The problem is that most companies are focused on their core business — they’re not experts in the domain of identity, security, and data management. With the way digital identity works today, this becomes an incredibly expensive exercise, not only for businesses and institutions but also for society at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Home Depot is in the business of selling home improvement supplies both in retail stores and online, but since 2014, the company has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-home-depot-cyber-settlement/home-depot-reaches-17-5-million-settlement-over-2014-data-breach-idUSKBN2842W5">spent nearly $200 million</a> in relation to a data breach that impacted over 52 million of its customers.</p><p>We’ve all seen the headlines — Home Depot is hardly alone in&nbsp;this.</p><p>Businesses and institutions have taken on much of the cost of an archaic approach to digital identity:</p>  $1 million per year <a href="https://www.newswire.com/news/new-research-most-people-have-70-80-passwords-21103705">spent</a> on password support costs&nbsp;alone  $6 million average <a href="https://www.akamai.com/lp/report/ponemon-the-cost-of-credential-stuffing-report">loss</a> from credential stuffing  $7-$30 million <a href="https://www.globalscape.com/resources/infographics/data-compliance-costs">spent</a> on data protection compliance  6%-9% of bank revenue <a href="https://www.ascentregtech.com/blog/the-not-so-hidden-costs-of-compliance/">spent</a> on compliance  $60 million per year <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9b18d648-4ff5-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc">spent</a> by financial institutions on KYC (Know Your Customer)  $163 billion in U.S. unemployment <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/27/fraud-had-significant-role-in-163-billion-leak-from-pandemic-era-unemployment-system.html">fraud</a> in&nbsp;2021  <p>That’s just the tip of the&nbsp;iceberg.</p><p>Identity needs don’t just increase expenditure and bloat for established firms, they also serve as barriers to entry for new upstarts, serving as a bottleneck for innovation.</p><p>There’s also the flipside to this, where companies and institutions that want to maintain a more frictionless experience for users must face the reality of diminished trust on their platforms — from bots to fake news, contributing to society’s growing trust&nbsp;deficit.</p><p>What if there was another&nbsp;way?</p><p>What if companies didn’t have to choose between focusing on their core business and becoming an identity company? What if companies could trust their customers and users without having to collect and store sensitive personal information? What if platforms didn’t have to pick between real users and a more frictionless experience?</p><p>What if companies could empower their users along the&nbsp;way?</p><p>That’s the GlobaliD vision.

<p>85,000 USD in OCEAN is available for Web3 data economy projects!</p> Introduction <p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month, rewarding projects that are aligning and contributing the most value to the ecosystem.</p><p>Round 21 has 85K USD worth of OCEAN, or 200K OCEAN available, whichever is larger in USD terms. (Calculation is on August 8th, 2022, at midnight UTC.) 75K USD is available via the regular grants program, and 10K USD via our micro-grants run by <a href="https://www.algovera.ai/">Algovera&nbsp;AI</a>.</p><p>Round 21&nbsp;Dates</p><p>All times are midnight&nbsp;UTC.</p>  Proposals Submission Deadline is September 6 at midnight&nbsp;UTC  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by Proposal Submission Deadline.  Two-day proposal Due Diligence Period ends September 8  Voting Starts on September 8  Voting Ends on September 12  Funding Deadline on September 26  <p>Goals in Improving OceanDAO</p><p>We are tuning OceanDAO towards these&nbsp;goals:</p>  A culture of contributing. Biasing to those who are engaged with the community and who are aligned with our value-add mission.  Quality outcomes. Rewards flow to contributors (with OCEAN) who are effective at delivering results.  Improve DAO efficiency. More efficient capital spending, yet lighter tracking&nbsp;overhead  <p>Approaches to Improving OceanDAO</p><p>Towards these goals, we have received feedback from the community on possible approaches. After many iterations of discussion and design, we have arrived at the following.</p><p>The main change we are stewarding is a culture of “show don’t tell”: show us what you did, rather than tell us what you’re going to do. This is the main shift required for us to prepare ourselves for a future of retroactive grants (ETA Round 22+) where the community decides how much they’d like to reward you for the outcome, related to your number of yes votes, minus no votes, balanced through quadratic funding.</p><p>Second, we have come to see that OceanDAO is better suited to earlier-stage funding of projects. As projects get stronger, they are in better shape to seek funding from <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/shipyard">Ocean Shipyard</a> grants program, complementary ecosystem grants programs, investors (angels, VCs), and potentially launching their own token. Given this, we have tuned OceanDAO to give more space to earlier-stage projects compared to experienced projects, by capping the total funding amount for a project or team to 100k USD lifetime.</p><p>There is a category of an experienced team that has been using its funds to dole out micro-grants to their own sub-community. It doesn’t fit Shipyard because it’s too close to inception; it isn’t appealing to investors because it grants; yet it’s of value to the Ocean ecosystem and we want to encourage this. So, we have earmarked 10K USD to the first recipient of this, Algovera&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Between us preparing for retroactive grants (which help DAO efficiency) and shifting experienced projects to Ocean Shipyard and other sources, we feel comfortable reducing the total amount available per month, from 100K USD to 85K USD (including the 10K micro-grants). We tuned the funding ceilings per tier accordingly.</p><p>Round 21&nbsp;Specs</p><p>Total funding of 85,000 USD&nbsp;(min.)</p>  10,000 USD will be allocated for Algovera AI micro-grants.  100,000 USD max. per project in a&nbsp;lifetime  100,000 USD max. per team in a lifetime (not including Advisors)  <p>Funding ceiling per tier, in a round (max possible that a project can request in a&nbsp;round):</p>  New projects — 3K USD (New project: never previously received a grant from OceanDAO))  Existing projects — 7.5K USD (Existing project: have completed one grant from OceanDAO)  Experienced projects — 15K USD (Experienced project: have completed two or more&nbsp;grants)  <p>Grant Funding Categories</p><p>OceanDAO provides grants for a variety of project&nbsp;types.</p>  Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;Software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>Submitting Proposals</p><p>We encourage you to submit proposals early.</p><p>To submit proposals, use the <a href="https://seed.oceandao.org/">Proposal Portal</a>. A tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Write-Proposal">here</a>.</p><p>Proposals will then be published on Ocean <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-16/76">Port</a>. Port is also where voters can read proposal details and ask questions.</p><p>All proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO voters receive funding, shortly after voting concludes.</p><p>Teams can reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a>, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016658239610920">here</a> for any guidance or assistance.</p><p>Please, do not submit proposals through Ocean Port directly anymore as you will run the risk of not having your proposal accepted.</p><p>Project Standing</p><p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing, to stay eligible in future Funding Rounds. The <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Funding Tiers</p><p>Funding Tiers are achieved by teams delivering on their grant promises, to unlock higher funding ceilings.</p><p>The Funding Tiers&nbsp;are:</p><p>1. New&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: as described earlier  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN&nbsp;token.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 6,000 USD available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  6,000 USD for New Teams (non-outreach category)  3,000 USD for New Teams (outreach category)  17,500 USD for 2nd/3rd Time&nbsp;Teams  13,000 USD for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  35,500 USD for General (all projects)  <p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>There is specific tech that the core team and Ocean technical community would love to see built. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Round-21-Tech-Earmarks">Here’s the list for R21</a>. It’s earmarked, therefore building towards it gives you “air cover” wrt competition.</p><p>Note that R21 has earmarked for integration with Chainlink, TheGraph, Filecoin, and Arweave. (Ocean Shipyard specs for these are not quite ready&nbsp;yet.)</p><p>You can find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech WG discord&nbsp;channel</a>.</p><p>Other OceanDAO&nbsp;Features</p><p>Quadratic Funding: Instead of projects receiving a binary grant (either 100% or 0% of what they asked for), all proposals will receive grant amounts relative to how much engagement they received, while still abiding by other rules such as Earmarks and Funding Ceilings.</p><p>Minimum USD amount: Projects can set a minimum they are willing to accept and return the funds if they are insufficient. This drastically increases the probability of receiving a grant, on top of Quadratic Funding. (You can reduce your Deliverables commenting in Port if you only receive a minor part of your overall requested budget.</p><p>Voting Boosts: Quadratic Voting helps distribute voting power better.

  <p>Risk-based authentication (RBA) is quickly growing in popularity amongst identity and access management solutions. The reason is simple: it allows for improved customer experience by reducing friction in authentication journeys while maintaining appropriate security levels. While you can find many publications about what signals or technical controls RBA uses, the architecture of risk policies is somewhat customized and not widely discussed. Enterprises usually rely on their identity experts or vendors (third parties) during the implementation efforts. One of security's most important and essential goals is to enable and enrich business, therefore establishing a high-level logic that can be applied to various models.</p>

<p>Is there a blueprint you can universally use to deliver quality and relevant policies yourself? Which stakeholders should take part in designing risk policies?</p>

 The stakeholders 
<p>Identity architects should refrain from making the ultimate decision about risk policies in isolation from the rest of the business. Depending on the organization's structure, policy creation may require cross-business unit collaboration. After all, your privileged access management (PAM) and workforce identities may be something your security team oversees. Customer identity and access management (CIAM), on the other hand, may reside a bit closer to the business, namely the product. It depends on the use case, but the key stakeholders for CIAM are usually involved with security, risk, product management, and identity.</p>

 The classic outcomes of risk in authentication 
<p>Let's take a look at business-specific factors and discuss risk outcomes in authentication. There is no industry standard in RBA, but most vendors have adopted the three-level model of low/medium/high. In simple terms, these designations mean:</p>

<p>Low: You do nothing. (Access is allowed.)</p>
<p>Medium: You do something. (For example, you compensate for the risk using multifactor authentication [MFA].)</p>
<p>High: This marks the end of the road. (Access is denied.)</p>

<p>What most organizations tend to forget is that there is always a fourth outcome, which I like to call "default," but, in reality, it should be called "failed." If you look at RBA as an enhancement of the authentication (nonessential), the failure to assess the risk should not be a disqualifying factor. If you cannot validate the username and password, there's no path to success because it's strictly essential for security. If the security baseline, however, accounts for specific risk levels, you have to classify it as essential, and then the inability to assess risk could mark the end of the road (access denied).</p>

<p>What should the business do if the system failed to evaluate the signals? After all, your RBA engine may be that of a third party, or it may be using a third party to deliver signals, like an IP address reputation service. What's interesting is that there is no right or wrong answer. It depends on the business and on risk levels that business is willing to accept (risk appetite).</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 1: The (Forgotten) Default Outcome 
<p>Any security or risk wizard will tell you it is a balancing act. The more security, the more the friction (at least in principle). Business (product) may vote for "low," as much as the security or risk teams vote for "high." Usually, the argument would be supported by some numbers. An example would be loss associated with an estimated number of false positives.</p>

<p>You could venture a rule of thumb here and say, "when in doubt – average out," meaning default to "medium." While it's not a showstopper, this level provides a certain amount of assurance.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 2: The Risk Outcome Formula 
<p>How do you calculate risk scores to deliver the right outcomes? The answer is of paramount importance. Though it's a finite number of permutations, every use case and every business will be different. CIAM will be different from workforce identity and access management in the same way that government use cases differ from the private sector. Some solutions allow you to assign weights to the signals, and this is a first step in modeling the risk. But many think of the risk score as a direct derivative of signals in some proportionate mathematical model.</p>

<p>Averaging risk scores out across the board is ineffective. It makes sense in some use cases (global email providers, for example), but not everywhere all the time. You know your audience and use cases well enough to build a high-level picture of what should be classified as normal and what would be considered anomalous. To put it into context, here are examples of what you need to examine.</p>

 The landscape of devices being evaluated 
<p>For the workforce, you may be issuing a standard laptop to our employees. Therefore, a drastic change of context (moving from MacOS to Linux) should be a stronger signal than in a consumer case, where I may use my laptop (MacBook), my wife's desktop (an old iMac), or my son's iPad to purchase items online.</p>

 Geolocation 
<p>Geolocation is often called impossible travel. An organization, like an air-traffic control center, for instance, has a secure location, from which the staff operates. Due to safety and strict regulations, employees must work from the operation center. They will never experience an impossible travel scenario, so it should be a signal strong enough to take us to the "high"outcome on its own. A business using VPN technology (without split-tunnel approach) is prone to false positives as far as impossible travel is concerned. If you hit anomalous geo-velocity on its own, you should classify this as "medium."</p>

 Signal combinations 
<p>In the example above, impossible travel may be anomalous but plausible. Therefore, you can treat it with MFA. (The risk was "medium.") What if it was accompanied with a strong user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) signal, such as an operating system change? If the user moves from MacOS to Windows along with impossible travel, does that still qualify as a "medium" risk? Certain signal combinations may elevate to higher risk levels and, in this particular workforce scenario, it could well be classified as "high." The combinations depend on the signals used and the level of knowledge about the customer's patterns. As far as the rest is concerned, it's okay to average out.</p>

<p>Once you have created this blueprint, you can then translate it to technical controls. Both risk engine and policy (or multiple policies) that average, sum or multiply individual signals to to deliver the scores.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 3: The "When" 
<p>Your RBA policy may differ in the function of time. For example, a bank may not want to allow an account to be opened if the request is anonymous (for example, coming from TOR – The Onion Router – or a known proxy/VPN anonymisation service). In the language of RBA, the risk is "high."</p>

<p>If, however, you are trying to access the account, the risk may be classified as "medium." Unfortunately, privacy aficionados will be classified as risky for the foreseeable future. Not because you dislike their desire for total privacy, but because there are so many bad actors trying to cover their tracks in defrauding businesses. This approach has been widely accepted by email providers. Try to open a Gmail account from TOR, and you will see for yourself. Global providers may resort to "medium", while smaller (countrywide vendors) may end the journey and require identity proofing to confirm the requestor.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 4: The "What" 
<p>Risk is not just a front-end function. It has its back-end counterpart. What I mean by that is the criticality or data classification in the protected resources themselves. Confluence or Jira may require an MFA once a month if the risk is "low," but a competitive intelligence portal or a financial system may need much higher assurance levels more frequently. You may want to design policies based on the application classification, too. This involves weighing the signals, calculating, and treating the outcomes differently.</p>

 BUSINESS FACTOR 5: The Custom Model 
<p>It's relatively straightforward to classify the outcomes as "low," "medium," or "high." But what if an organization chooses to use MFA every time? Salesforce is a good example here, and it was a subject of conversation in this year's Identiverse conference. You now need to "do something" as a baseline (just as in a "medium" risk outcome). The "low" and "medium" outcomes are somewhat combined into one, effectively moving into a "low"/"high" framework.</p>

<p>Well, that's not necessarily true.</p>
	
<p>Let's return to the reasons for applying RBA in the first place. It's a balancing act between customer experience (lower friction) and security (fraud prevention). If you need to perform MFA for everybody, you could introduce the MFA cookie. If the risk is "low," you can challenge the user, but only once a while (a day, a week, a month) for a given device/browser. If the risk is "medium," you can challenge them every time.</p>

<p>The business may also determine that no risk level should be a definite showstopper. Once again, it's a balancing act. It turns out that false positives and showstopping friction may be more costly than factoring the fraud loss into the business. There are formulas that allow us to calculate losses from non-returning customers due to false positives.</p>

<p>What you can do is reach for much stronger controls such as MFA methods at certain assurance levels. A push notification is not as prone to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks as one-time passwords (OTPs) are. You could also use multiple channels to confirm the identity (voice recognition and an authenticator app), which makes security much stronger. Ultimately, you may want to carry out proofing as a compensating control to reduce the risk level below its appetite threshold.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, risk calculation and treatment are most effective when you implement the concept of continuous authentication.</p>

 Continuous Authentication 
<p>It's important to remember that risk level may change within the context of a device if, for example, you have multiple app classifications or policies. At the same time, if the bad actor steals your SSO cookie, there's nothing that stops access from being granted to a federated application. RBA could potentially remediate this problem, but only if the authentication is a continuous process. It doesn't require a challenge for credentials every time someone lands on the authorization server or login page (that would defy the SSO concept). But you can honor the session and assess the risk every single time. If it all checks out, the experience is excellent (minimal friction). If you suspect it's fraudulent, you now have an opportunity to stop the access or add controls to validate the request.</p>

<p>OAuth workgroups are working on adding a standard for "origin protection," but it's in its relatively early days. A similar concept is used today in dynamic authorization, where you evaluate every call against a fine-grained, ABAC/PBAC engine. So why not do that for the first out of the three As, too? (AAA = Authentication, Authorization, Accounting.)</p>

 Brace for False Positives 
<p>No matter how well you design the risk policies, you will hit false positives. If it's designed well, there won't be many, but you need to be prepared to treat them. Ideally, you will have a whitelist or an override mechanism that allows you to quickly remediate showstopping paths if they're inappropriate. This is a business function that you need to develop yourself. While risk solutions may have technical controls to allow you to bypass certain signals or outcomes in the journeys, the decision about which one is classified as a false positive and its validation is entirely the business's responsibility. You may have a salesperson going into a meeting with an amazing prospect who recently has been hacked and their IP reputation is low (bad). They may be using a VPN or a service to make their guests anonymous. You really want to be able to run the demo no matter what. A good process and procedure of classification and remediation is essential.</p>

 One-Off, or a Continuous Process? 
<p>RBA deployment is not a one-off process. When considering risk outcomes and the ability to calculate them, break them down into a binary classification of those you know about and those you need to learn about. Known credential attacks (spraying, stuffing, brute-force) can be acted on right from the beginning, while user behavior is something the system needs to learn.</p>

<p>Aside from that, analyzing RBA data periodically (every six months, for example), will allow you to further fine-tune the policies and the engine. You may find that your most risky events come from a specific geolocation, network, or application, in which case you would tighten the controls around those use cases. On the other end of the spectrum, you may find there are a lot of false positives, and you may want to relax the controls a little around where they occur.</p>

 How Does ForgeRock Autonomous Access Fit into This Model? 

<p>The ForgeRock Autonomous Access engine design allows for the flexibility to create desired outcomes. Its custom logic adapts to almost any scenario or blueprint you want to implement, while the orchestration in the journeys (authentication trees) allows for accommodating "the when" and "the what" and for managing controls for false positives.</p>

<p>It also allows for fine-tuning of the AI/ML models, which is unique in the market. Autonomous Access is an extremely powerful anti-fraud tool that is easy to implement and follows the logic of the business-first approach.</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>Risk-based authentication is a brilliant concept. It may seem that it's all about signals and treating risk. But of equal importance are the calculation of security breach likelihood, tweaking of the engine, and customizable policies designed for specific operations.</p>

<p>If you are considering implementation of risk-based authentication, engage with key stakeholders and look at the technology/security as a function of a "business first" approach. Adapt the product to your enterprise instead of accepting the default model from the vendor. That way you can create excellent journeys, with minimal friction for your consumers (both external and internal), and a quality security posture driven by fraud prevention. It's a balancing act and "secure-enough" is much better than just "secure."</p>

<p>BOTLabs GmbH Secures Polkadot Parachain Slot</p><p>BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, is proud to announce plans to move the <a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> blockchain from the Kusama Relay Chain to the Polkadot Relay Chain. The Polkadot parachain slot required for this move was secured by BOTLabs in auction 24 last&nbsp;week.</p><p>The <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> Relay Chains provide shared security to parachains. Kusama is the experimental network, while Polkadot provides additional levels of stability and security. KILT is a blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous, verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). KILT went live in September 2021 after winning a Kusama parachain slot.</p><p>During the last 11 months many new functionalities were added to KILT, and the network has proven its efficiency and utility to tens of thousands of users. Fifty partnerships within the blockchain and identity ecosystems have been established; Web3 apps including <a href="http://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> has been developed using KILT Protocol and the KILT blockchain. KILT has proven to be a mature infrastructure.</p><p>Now large-scale enterprises in the accounting, media and medical sectors are starting to implement business cases on KILT. These production systems will require extreme stability and bank-level security, which KILT cannot provide within the experimental Kusama network. So it’s time for KILT to move to Polkadot.</p><p>We will follow the original plan of “one KILT network, one KILT Coin”. By mid-October 2022, the network will be moved seamlessly from Kusama to Polkadot, leaving all functionality and the following data unchanged:</p>  All KILT Coin balances (including vesting)  All addresses  All attestations and credentials  All DIDs  All web3names  <p>There will be no difference for the user. All KILT Coin balances will be moved automatically onto the new Polkadot parachain. There is no change to the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">KILT Token Economy</a> and there is no fork or redenomination.</p><p>The migration to Polkadot is exciting news and sets the stage for KILT’s growth across the industry and institutional landscapes. We would like to thank the fantastic Kusama community for all the support, the fun, the engagement and the chaos. And we are excited to continue our work with the impressive projects on Polkadot, as KILT strives to become the fundamental digital identity infrastructure within the Polkadot ecosystem and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Next week a timeline and FAQs with technical and governance details will be published. Until then, here are answers to a few questions you may&nbsp;have:</p> FAQs <p>Q: As a KILT Coin holder, DID-owner, credential-holder, staker/delegator, or web3name owner: what will change for&nbsp;me?</p><p>A: Nothing.</p><p>Q: After the move, will my KILT Coins be available on both the Kusama and Polkadot parachains?</p><p>A: No. They will be automatically moved for you to the Polkadot parachain.</p><p>Q: As a KILT Coin holder, DID-owner, credential-holder, staker/delegator, web3name owner: is there any action required from&nbsp;me?</p><p>A: No.</p><p>Q: As a collator, an exchange, or a project using KILT RPC or extrinsics, is there anything I have to&nbsp;do?</p><p>A: Yes. When KILT starts on Polkadot, you will need to change an endpoint. Documentation will be available in early September, well in advance of the&nbsp;switch.</p><p>Q: Will the switch to Polkadot occur after Lease 9 starts later this&nbsp;month?</p><p>A: No. The switch will be initiated via a governance proposal in mid-September by BOTLabs, then the KILT community will vote. If approved, the switch will be enacted in early&nbsp;October.</p><p>Q: Was there a crowdloan for KILT’s Polkadot slot and I missed&nbsp;it?</p><p>A: No. KILT has a low-inflation <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19_KILT_Token_Metrics_Revised_Version.pdf">token economy</a> that does not allow for further crowdloans. New crowdloans would dilute the community.</p><p>Q: Then who was parathread 2057?</p><p>A: BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol, bid anonymously for KILT last week as&nbsp;#2057.</p><p>Q: Did BOTLabs sell KILT coins and use the money to pay for the&nbsp;slot?</p><p>A: No. BOTLabs has not sold any KILT Coins since KILT launched in September 2021.</p><p>Q: Wasn’t it planned that the KILT Treasury bids for the&nbsp;slot?</p><p>A: Yes, but that would have required a functioning bridge between Kusama and Polkadot. This bridge doesn’t exist yet. And waiting isn’t an option — KILT’s upcoming enterprise integrations require the stability and bank-level security that Polkadot provides.</p><p>Then the next Polkadot parachain slot (June 2024) should be obtained by the KILT network itself, using Treasury&nbsp;funds.</p><p>Q: Who are these large enterprise partners that will be integrating KILT?</p><p>A: We will announce KILT integrations later this fall with top accounting firms, global media companies and medical institutions.</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a blockchain R&amp;D company founded in 2018 and based in Berlin.

<p>Holochain is all about teaching computer networks to act like healthy human networks: sharing resources, contributing and receiving, cooperating to reach a useful shared approximation of the truth. So it was no surprise to me to see that very thing happening among the humans who came to our first in-person Holochain &amp; Rust Developer Immersive in Kelchsau, Austria.</p><p>I could attribute this to the careful participant selection process stewarded by Liz Penny and Muhammad Meigooni. Both of them have lots of experience seeing people’s characters and calling out their best natures, skills they earned working together in educational organisations like <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>.</p><p>I could also point to the way that Marcus Phillips, the lead curriculum designer and facilitator, set expectations at the beginning of the course — explaining that when we all move together in our learning journey, we each move faster. In particular, when we don’t understand a concept and have the courage to voice our confusion, we help out everyone who secretly has the same questions.</p><p>And while all of this work contributed to the personality of the group, and requires many years of skill and experience to execute well, it’s also true that the participants themselves are simply great people. They devoted themselves to helping each other out as they journeyed together. They chopped carrots and put dishes away. They collaborated on inspiring, useful, and silly Holochain apps. They hiked, swam, philosophised, and played fussball. I don’t want to get too gushy, but I think the students and staff created a magical culture together.</p>Working through a hard problem togetherA student-led outdoor tai chi class What was the course like? <p>I have to be honest — between grocery shopping, food prep, photography, and other operational tasks, I didn’t get to focus on the coursework as much as I’d hoped. But what I did take in, I loved. And the other students clearly got a lot out of it too.</p>Sometimes misunderstandings are just as educational as perfect understanding<p>I was there partly to learn more about Marcus’ unique educational approach. As co-founder of Hack Reactor, he’s had a lot of opportunities to learn what works and what doesn’t. And what he’s discovered is that you can understand any complex subject if you break it down into bite-sized pieces that build on pieces you already understand. The goal is to find the shortest path through an infinite landscape of ideas, building each idea upon the last. Sounds pretty obvious, but it’s an art — it’s hard to design a curriculum that does this well. (On some nights I glimpsed the curriculum team furiously refining the next day’s slides, trying to get them just a little bit more elegant and digestible.)</p>The curriculum team refining tomorrow’s slides<p>Back in June I asked Marcus about the core of his approach. He said it boiled down to two rules:</p>  Never introduce a new concept until the concepts it builds on are thoroughly understood.  Move from understanding to experience as quickly as possible, because success is a great motivator.  <p>I found rule 1 particularly compelling. It naturally leads to the bite-sized pieces approach I mentioned before. The curriculum team — Marcus, Muhammad, and Guillem Cordoba — applied this rule rigorously to every concept, shaping and reshaping each slide until it was brief yet thorough.</p><p>It’s also what led Marcus to make the bold but comforting statement that in your learning journey you will get it wrong — and that’s okay. In fact, he encouraged us to get it wrong as often, as quickly, and as publicly as possible, because that’s the fastest way to explore every nook and cranny of our understanding. Once we were even told to “think about all the possible ways that [this concept] could be misunderstood” and share them.</p>Marcus walking students through a challenging distributed computing concept<p>Underneath this, of course, was the understanding that this was a safe place to get things wrong. This was something that the entire team established early on — not just at the beginning of the course but during intake interviews too. And I saw my fellow classmates practicing this, in their respectful listening during lectures and in spontaneous mutual support sessions with each other during free time.</p>Students discussing the finer points of Holochain in the evening<p>It was only when we all felt comfortable with a concept and had no more questions that we moved on to the next concept. Interjections were encouraged. The facilitators asked us to reflect back what we heard, then worked with us to refine our understanding. We didn’t have to go over every detail, but we did get the chance to grasp the basics well enough to be able to fill in the blanks for ourselves later.</p><p>This seems counterintuitive. You might think that this process would slow the whole thing down. But it really works. Instead of taking four days to learn Rust, we finished in only three — which left us more time to learn Holochain! And that’s what everyone was there for anyway.</p><p>Many developers are already familiar with other ‘slowing down to speed up’ techniques. Test-driven development, pair programming, agile development, and Git workflow policies sometimes feel like speed bumps in the moment, but they streamline our processes and avoid catastrophic problems later on. I think this was similar; it’s much easier to untangle a small misunderstanding now than a big one later.</p>Guillem explaining the Holochain host API Capstone project: Holochain hackathon <p>After all the lectures and exercises, it was time to build something. After all, the goal of the course was to get people proficient in hApp development. The facilitators invited students to share what they wanted to work on and join projects that they found interesting.</p><p>And there were some pretty interesting projects:</p>  Łukasz G, Matthias M, and Thomas S created <a href="https://github.com/matthme/ephemeral-chat">Burner Chat</a>, a hilarious but fully working prototype of an ephemeral chat application. Its tag line is ‘no privacy, no encryption, just signals’, and as you could imagine, it uses signals rather than the DHT to send messages between nodes. As you type, each character is sent individually to the other participants — but your chat window is only so large, so the oldest part of the message progressively disappears. There were a lot of laughs and emoji confetti.  Wesley F <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks/pull/1">added internal linking</a> to Lightning Rod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a>, a collaborative text editor built on Holochain. This effectively turns Notebooks into a real-time wiki or a multi-user knowledge manager. This is a project of particular interest for Wesley — he’s passionate about knowledge management apps, which help him organise his thoughts and uncover new insights. The DNA plumbing is in place and the UX is basic but functional; I’m excited to see what he and others build on top of this!  Loren J, a Holo alumnus currently working on a popular social app for communities called <a href="https://hylo.com/">Hylo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-communities/pull/14">updated</a> the Holochain-powered <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/holo-communities">Hylo Communities</a> app to work with the most recent version of Holochain. Holo acquired the Hylo codebase before open-sourcing it and <a href="https://holo.host/wp-content/uploads/Holo-Terran-Collective-Partner-on-Collaborative-Software-.pdf">handing</a> <a href="https://medium.com/terran-collective/in-partnership-with-holo-terran-collective-is-building-hylo-the-collaboration-platform-for-a-224dd6d1be1e">over</a> stewardship to the <a href="https://www.terran.io/">Terran Collective</a>, a software dev shop in San Francisco. Given this history, it’s great to see Hylo getting some Holochain love once again. Loren has more plans to integrate Hylo with Holochain; I’m looking forward to seeing what emerges in the coming months.  Duke J shared his recommendations and vision for an ideal suite of Holochain developer tools. This may not have been his first choice, but it became his focus as he faced challenges getting started on his hApp. As frustrating as it was for him, it did lead to great insights into how to improve the experience for new Holochain app developers. I’m hoping we’ll see his feedback make its way into our scaffolding and build tools in the future.  Abdoulaye D and Ryan L started work on a browser extension to add Holochain functionality to existing web apps. It loads Holochain’s <a href="http://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">JavaScript client</a> into the current web page, allowing it to access your local conductor if it has permissions. This led Ryan to start work on another project: a tool to generate a JavaScript API that’s tailored to a specific coordinator zome. It will be able to read the zome’s public functions and call signatures, then create function stubs in JavaScript that call the conductor’s app API and handle serialisation and deserialisation of parameters and return values.  Guillem shared his plan to upgrade <a href="http://github.com/holochain/syn/">Syn</a>, a low-level toolkit for building real-time collaborative apps like Notebooks, to use <a href="https://crdt.tech/">conflict-free replicated data types</a> (CRDTs). Syn currently uses a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation">operational transforms</a>, which work great when everyone is online but are clunky when people have patchy internet connections. CRDTs are more complex, but they’re much more robust against failures — even total loss of connectivity. When the user comes back online, their changes sync without conflict.  Marcus outlined his vision for peer-to-peer economic networks that resist the worst effects of power concentration even as they grow to global scale.  <p></p> How was the food? <p>Delicious, if I may say so. It was a pleasure to take care of our students, working with our cook, Tayyab, to create nourishing dinners of Pakistani, Austrian, Canadian, and other heritages. The staff and students loved it too.</p>Enjoying chickpea curry togetherSausages and sauerkraut — about as Austrian as it getsIf the Holochain community only remembers me as a good soup cook, I will still be perfectly content How was Austria? <p>Beautiful. Many of us got out to see the country in our free time — but the world just outside our door was also lovely.</p>The view from the ski slope above our chaletRunning errands in nearby KitzbühelGuillem, Paul, and Matthias visiting Krimml waterfall What did the students think? <p></p><blockquote>I definitely feel much more confident and familiar with both Rust and Holochain, although there are a few advanced topics, especially deployment to Holo hosting network and architecture design patterns. But that would only make sense in a longer program or round 2 advanced concepts.</blockquote><blockquote>I feel really empowered and hAppy (;-D). And started to really appreciate Rust for the first time in my life.</blockquote><blockquote>The location was beautiful, quiet and apart from distractions. The food was nourishing and delicious. The operations staff were caring, committed and fully engaged. Rock stars!</blockquote><blockquote>Everyone was absolutely wonderful and caring. There wasn’t a moment I didn’t feel comfortable, safe, and heard. The amount of work they put in to make that happen and the seemingly effortlessness to do it speaks volumes to the skill and attention they all had. I am very appreciative and couldn’t sing all of their praises enough.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you! This experience was just perfect. I'd wish we had more time, why not 4 weeks? 🙂 (e.g. 1 week Rust, 2 weeks Holochain excercises + 1 week final project)</blockquote><blockquote>Short of calling each of you out individually and smothering you with accolades I hope you all know that you did a great job and I sincerely hope more people get to experience all that you (and holo) have to offer. Cheers.</blockquote> What’s next? <p>Many students are already involved in the Holochain development community, creating hApps and developer tools. They’re now equipped to be more successful — and to mentor the next generation of hApp developers.</p><p>As for future education programmes, this Developer Immersive is a prototype. As you know, Holo has committed $2 million USD to developer education over the next couple years, because we know that growing the skill, strength, and employability of the hApp developer community is critical to Holochain’s success.</p><p>Future courses are likely to take different shapes. Not everyone has the free time and funds necessary to fly across the world and spend two weeks learning about a new technology. Most of us have day jobs, families, and homes to take care of. So Holo also plans to work with the curriculum team to create online courses, both scheduled and work-at-your-own-pace.</p><p>Each of these formats is valuable; each is also best suited to different people and their life situations.</p>  In-person courses are intense and focused, allowing people to skill up rapidly. There’s also something about being in the same room with each other, something about the connections that form, that make the experience deep, rich, and productive.  Virtual courses are great for people who need to stay at home but still want the experience of moving with others, sharpening your understanding against each other.  Work-at-your own courses are best for people whose time constraints prevent them from participating in a scheduled course. They work best for highly motivated self-learners.  <p>Are you eager to join a future course? <br><a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/l37YeTm3?typeform-source=holo.host">Join our interest list</a> and we'll be contacting you about the next developer education opportunity.</p><p>Want to keep up to date on what's happening in the Holo &amp; Holochain world? <br><a href="https://holo.host/newsletter-signup">Sign up for Holo Newsletter</a> and receive monthly updates.</p>

  <p>ABSTRACT: Digital assets are only as safe as their private keys. Securing private keys through responsible key management has thus been a major focus at Blockchain Commons, under our <a href="https://www.smartcustody.com/">#SmartCustody</a> initiative. Unfortunately, securing keys ultimately isn’t just a logistical problem or a technical problem. It’s also a legal problem because US courts have inserted themselves into the process by demanding keys, often as a part of discovery.</p>

  <p>Turning over keys to courts not only introduces major threats to the digital assets controlled by the keys, but it also fundamentally misunderstands the purpose and use of private keys. There are better tools for court-based discovery, public keys prime among them. There are better, more traditional ways to enforce the turn over of assets. Requiring the disclosure of private keys instead is a needless threat not just to digital assets, but to our rights as well.</p>
</blockquote>

 

<p>Increasingly, attorneys in the United States are asking courts to force the disclosure of private keys as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions, and increasingly courts are acceding to those demands. Though this is a relatively recent phenomenon, it’s part of a larger problem of law enforcement seeking back doors to cryptography that goes back at least to the U.S. government’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures">failed introduction of the Clipper Chip</a> in 1993.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, today’s attacks on private keys in the courtroom have been more successful, creating an existential threat to digital assets, data, and other information protected by digital keys. That danger arises from a fundamental disconnect between this practice and the realities of technologies that leverage public-key cryptography for security: private-key disclosure can cause irreparable harm, including the loss of funds and the distortion of digital identities.</p>

<p>As a result, we need to support legislation that will protect digital keys while allowing courts to access information and assets in a way that better recognizes those realities. The private-key disclosure law <a href="https://youtu.be/61c3sYGqO-E?t=1063">currently being considered in Wyoming</a> is an excellent example of the sort of legislation that we could put forth and advocate for in order to maintain the proper protection for our digital assets and identities.</p>

<p><a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0105">Wyoming Senate Filing 2021-0105</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    No person shall be compelled to produce a private key or make a private key known to any other person in any civil, administrative, legislative or other proceeding in this state that relates to a digital asset, other interest or right to which the private key provides access unless a public key is unavailable or unable to disclose the requisite information with respect to the digital asset, other interest or right. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to prohibit any lawful proceeding that compels a person to produce or disclose a digital asset, other interest or right to which a private key provides access, or to disclose information about the digital asset, other interest or right, provided that the proceeding does not require production or disclosure of the private key.
</blockquote>

 The Realities of Private Keys 

<p>The forced disclosure of private keys is deeply harmful because it fundamentally runs at odds with how private keys work. Attorneys (and courts) are usually trying to force the disclosure of information or (later) the relinquishment of assets, but they’re treating private keys just like they’re physical keys that they could demand, use, and give back.</p>

<p>Private keys do not match any of these realities. As Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///1971">Chris Rothfuss</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no perfect analog for a modern cryptographic private key in existing statute or case law; it is unique in its form and function. As we build a policy framework around digital assets, it is essential that we appropriately recognize and reflect the characteristics of the underlying public / private key and cryptographic technologies. Without clear, unambiguous legal protection for the sanctity of the private key, it is impossible to ensure the integrity of the associated digital assets, information, smart contracts and identities.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That appropriation recognition and reflection requires us to understand that:</p>

<p>1. Private keys are not assets.</p>

<p>Private keys are fundamentally the way we exert authority in the digital space, an interface between our physical reality and the digital reality. They may give us the ability to control a digital asset: to store it, to send it, or to use it. Similarly, they may give us the ability to decrypt protected data or to verify a digital identity. However, they are not the assets, the data, nor the identity themselves.</p>

<p>It’s the obvious difference between your car and your electronic key fob. The one is an asset, while the other lets you control that asset.</p>

<p>As Jon Callas, Director of Technology Projects at the EFF, says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>  “They don’t even want the key, they want the data; asking for the key is like asking for the filing cabinet rather than the file.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2. Private keys are not the proper tool for discovery.</p>

<p>Treating private keys as a tool to ensure the discovery of information fundamentally misunderstands their purpose. Private keys are not how we see something in digital space, but instead how we exert authority in digital space!</p>

<p>Turning back to comparisons, it’s the difference between a ledger and a pen. If you wanted accounting information, you’d ask for the ledger; you wouldn’t ask for the pen, especially not if it was a pen that allowed you to write undetectably in the handwriting of the accountant!</p>

<p>Former Federal Prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan, when offering <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a> in favor of Wyoming’s private-key disclosure law, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>  “the court could order a disclosure or an accounting of all the digital assets that are held, and then those assets could be disclosed and the location of whether they are held across different platforms or even different wallets. But giving the key is actually giving access to those assets. That is the difference.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, there is an electronic tool that meets the needs of discovery: public keys. Wyoming has recognized that in their <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">legislation</a>, saying that a private key should never be required if a public key would do the job (and they parenthetically noting at hearings that their current understanding is that a public key will always do the job). If our concern is revealing information that will help to catch and prosecute criminals, then public keys are the answer.</p>

<p>3. Private keys are not physical.</p>

<p>Electronic private keys and physical keys are very different. A physical key could pass through many hands and there could be the expectation that it was very likely not duplicated (especially if it were a special key, such as a safety-deposit-box key), and that when the key was returned to the original holder, they would once again have control of all of the linked assets. The same is not true for a private key, which could be easily duplicated by any of the many hands it passed through, with no way to ascertain that had happened.</p>

<p>Returning to the example of a car’s key fob, it would not be appropriate to force the disclosure of the unique serial number stored within a car fob for the same reason it’s not appropriate to force the disclosure of a private key. Doing so, would give anyone who gets that serial number the ability to create a new fob and steal your car!</p>

<p>4. Private keys serve many purposes.</p>

<p>Finally, private keys are likely to have a lot more purposes than physical keys, especially if a court decides to go after not just a specific private key, but the root key from an HD wallet or a seed phrase. Root keys (and seeds) might be used to protect a wide variety of assets as well as private data. They may also be used to control identities and to offer irrefutable proof that the owner agreed to something through digital signatures.</p>

<p>The authoritative uses of private keys are so wide and all-encompassing that it’s hard to come up with a physical equivalent. The closest analogy, which was brought up by Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen at one of the Wyoming hearings, would be if a court demanded access to a hotel room by requiring the hotel’s master key, which can provide access to all rooms. But, a private key is more than that, so it would be as if the court also required that someone with signatory powers at the hotel sign a bunch of blank contracts and blank checks. The potential for harm with the disclosure of a private key is just that high for someone who is using it for a variety of purposes — and there will be more and more people doing so as the importance of the digital world continues to increase.</p>

 The Realities of Courts 

<p>Going beyond the fact that a private key is the wrong tool for courts and that it’s often being used in the wrong way, there are a number of other problematic realities related to the courts themselves and how and when they’re trying to access private keys.</p>

<p>5. Courts are not prepared to protect private keys.</p>

<p>To start with, courts don’t have the experience needed to protect private keys. This danger is made worse by the fact that a single private key is likely to pass through the hands of many different court staff over time.</p>

<p>But, this isn’t just about courts. The problem of creating safe ways to transfer public keys is far bigger. It’s something that the cryptographic field as a whole does not have good answers for. Blockchain Commons’ Christopher Allen attested in his  testimony in Wyoming that the “immense difficulties of transferring a private key are a risk that allows bearing of false witness.” Putting courts, without crypto-expertise, in the middle of the problem could be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Perhaps cryptographers will resolve these issues in time, and perhaps someday courts will be able to share in that expertise if they decide doing so is a good use of their time and resources, but we need to consider keys whose disclosures are being forced now.</p>

<p>6. Courts are requiring premature disclosure.</p>

<p>The current situation with key disclosure is even more problematic because it’s occurring as part of discovery or other pre-trial motions. Discovery rulings are <a href="https://www.resolvingdiscoverydisputes.com/appeals/obtaining-review-of-discovery-rulings/">almost impossible to appeal</a>, which means that in today’s environment key holders have almost no recourse for protecting the token of their own authority in digital space.</p>

<p>7. Courts are more demanding of digital assets than physical assets.</p>

<p>We recognize that courts should be able to require the usage of a key. Compelling usage is nothing new, but the private key is not required for that, simply a court order.</p>

<p>If someone refuses to use their private key in a way compelled by a court, that’s nothing new either. The physical world already has plenty of examples of people refusing such orders, such as by hiding assets or just refusing to pay judgements. They are handled with sanctions such as contempt of court.</p>

<p>Asking for more from the electronic world is an overreach of traditional judgements that also creates much greater repercussions.</p>

 The Repercussions of Disclosure 

<p>Using the wrong tool for the wrong reasons and putting it in hands not ready to deal with it will have calamitous results. Here are some of the most obvious repercussions.</p>

<p>1. Asset Theft</p>

<p>Obviously, there is a danger of the assets being stolen, as a private key gives total control over those assets. These assets could go far beyond the specifics of what a court is interested in, because of the multitude of uses for keys.</p>

<p>2. Asset Loss</p>

<p>Beyond the problem of purposeful theft, keys could be lost, and with them digital assets. Former federal prosecutor Mary Beth Buchanan raised this concern in her <a href="https://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/wyoming-select-committee/private-key-disclosure-buchanan/">testimony</a>, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Evidence is lost all the time.” If that evidence was a private key, which might hold a variety of assets, information, and proofs of identity, the loss could be tremendous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Majority Whip <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislators///2035">Jared Olsen</a> agreed with this concern at a recent Wyoming hearing, noting that a judicial assistant could delete a key and cause a loss of $8 billion dollars in Bitcoin when there was only a judgment for $100,000. He said he was “concerned about just simply handling it”.</p>

<p>3. Collateral Damage</p>

<p>Thefts or losses resulting from the disclosure of a private key could also go far beyond an individual before the court. Increasingly, assets are being held in multisignatures, which may grant multiple people control over the same assets. By requiring the disclosure of a key, a court could negatively impact people entirely unrelated to the proceedings.</p>

<p>4. Identity Theft.</p>

<p>Because private keys might also protect the identifier for digital identity, their loss, theft, or misuse could put someone’s entire digital life at risk. If a key was copied, someone else could pretend to be the holder and even make digital signatures that are legally binding for them.</p>

 Support This Legislation 

<p>Protecting private keys is one of the most important things that Blockchain Commons has ever worked on. As Blockchain Commons’ founder Christopher Allen said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“I find the protections of this Private Key Disclosure bill crucial for the future of digital rights.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wyoming State Legislature Senate Minority Leader Chris Rothfuss affirmed this, adding:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>” Christopher Allen has been an invaluable member of our blockchain policy community, bringing a lifetime of technical expertise to advise our committee work and inform our legislative drafting. Mr. Allen has emphasized the particular importance of protecting private keys from any form of compulsory disclosure.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need your help to make it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re an experienced member of the cryptocurrency or digital asset field or a human-rights activist, please submit your own testimony in support to the <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Committees/2022/S19">Wyoming Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology</a>. The bill will be coming up for further discussion on September 19-20 in Laramie, Wyoming.</p>

<p>But, Wyoming is just the start. They are doing an excellent job of leading the way, but we need other states and countries to follow. If you have connections to another legislature, please suggest they introduce <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/InterimCommittee/2022/S19-2022061423LSO-0058v0.2.pdf">similar language to Wyoming’s bill</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t feel comfortable talking with a legislature, you can help by advocating for the protection of private keys as something different than assets.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our new world of digital assets and digital information will succeed or fail based upon how we lay its foundations today. It could become a safe space for us or a dangerous wild west.</p>

<p>Properly protecting private keys (and using public keys and other tools for legitimate judicial needs) is a keystone that will help us to build a sturdy edifice.</p>

				  Indicio is committed as a company to participating in and supporting the open source community, which is why we are excited to announce that Daniel Bluhm, our engineering team lead, is running for co-chair of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) Interoperability Group.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daniel is an engineering team lead at Indicio and has been an active contributor to the decentralized identity space for over three years, as a maintainer of multiple projects in Hyperledger Aries and a contributor to Hyperledger Indy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One claim to fame is that he&nbsp; was&nbsp; one of the original members of the&nbsp; Hyperledger Indy Agent Working Group and continued contributing to it as it grew and into the Hyperledger Aries project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to contributing code to DIF, he is also the original author of the DIDComm-js library that’s been in use for the past few years. One last feather in his cap we will mention —although there are many more — is that he was the lead engineer on the Indy DID Method implementation effort, which represents a critical step forward in Hyperledger Indy interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting challenges for Daniel is finding ways that allow multiple different technologies&nbsp; to interact and work together at the same time – which is exactly what the team working on Hyperledger Aries has been striving for. For example, Aries agents have agent-to-agent communication taking place over DIDComm protocols, which enables implementations from different vendors and communities to interact. To enable the full verifiable credential/decentralized identity ecosystem, we also need ledger-to-agent communication in addition to agent-to-agent communication. As the community continues to build, Daniel is excited to shift his focus to more interoperability with ledgers outside of the Hyperledger ecosystem, such as Cheqd, Ion, EBSI, etc.</p>
<p>Being an experienced contributor to Aries and DIDComm, Daniel is well equipped to help represent that community in interoperability discussions and he looks forward to the opportunity:</p>
<p>“I am passionate about interoperability and believe it is key to adoption of decentralized identity and, by extension, a future where everyone’s privacy is better protected online. I look forward to getting more involved at the DIF! :)” —Daniel Bluhm</p>

<p>I recently stumbled upon an article titled “<a href="https://amp-insurancejournal-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/amp.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2022/07/12/675516.htm">Travelers Wants Out of Contract With Insured That Allegedly Misrepresented MFA Use</a>” and I was immediately intrigued. Since I work at an organization that solves MFA problems for organizations my first thought was, why would this happen?</p>
<p>I’m not going to call out the organization in question here, you can read the article for yourself to learn more about that. But let’s uncover what happened:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The cyber policy application signed by the CEO and “a person responsible for the applicant’s network and information security” that the company used MFA for administrative or privileged access.&nbsp; 
 However, following the May ransomware event, the insurer first learned during an investigation that the insured was not using the security control to protect its server and “only used MFA to protect its firewall, and did not use MFA to protect any other digital assets.” 
 The organization was the victim of a ransomware attack in December 2020 when hackers gained access using the username and password of an administrator, the organization told the insurer of the attack during the application process and said it improved the company’s cybersecurity. 
 
<p>Let’s quickly discuss cyber insurance:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m sure you all have a policy, even if you’re not sure. Cyber insurance (also referred to as cyber liability insurance or data breach insurance) provides insurance coverage for events including data breaches, downtimes, and cyberattacks. Cyberattacks may include malware, ransomware, phishing, DDoS, hacking, insider threats, and more. Offerings and coverage will vary depending on the policy issuer.</p>
<p>So while the organization did have MFA in place, they did not fully commit to using it even after they experienced a previous breach. To me there are a couple of issues:</p>
 
 If an organization puts an MFA solution in place why not use it?&nbsp; 
 In this case, it feels like the organization brought in MFA just to meet a requirement, not for actual security needs.&nbsp; 
 
<p>When organizations focus on checkbox compliance, they get into trouble, case in point. It’s important for organizations to build a culture of security, not one based on checkbox compliance. I know I’m stating the obvious, but breaches are real and will happen to you if you’re not prepared. An insurance policy should not be the fallback.</p>
<p>We all have insurance policies in our personal lives. I’m pretty confident that very few people leave their keys in the car and unlocked and when the car was stolen, then be surprised if the insurance company did not pay the claim. There is a level of responsibility required of the policyholder to do what they can to prevent an incident that would lead to a claim. Unfortunately for Travelers, it looks as though their client did not take any responsibility to protect their environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our core values here at 1Kosmos is to make authentication easy AND secure for end users. So for organizations that may not have the best security practices, they can at least implement a technology that improves security and is very easy to use. That usability will go a long way toward protecting the environment because users will be more inclined to use it, making the environment more secure. Make your insurance your MFA, and leave the policy for when things happen beyond your control.</p>

<p>We have heard a lot about Decentralized Identity in the last few years. For both Spruce and TBD, Decentralized Identity and user control are at the center of both our missions, and we are excited to announce that we achieved another milestone towards interoperability.</p><p>We can only leverage the full potential of Decentralized Identity if we have a heterogeneous network (or network of networks) of issuers and verifiers that can produce and consume each other's data. The real power of decentralized identity is multiplied by network effects and interoperability is key to achieving that.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) data model standard is one first step to achieving vendor interoperability. It defines a common data model but it doesn’t define how to generate and how to verify the cryptographic proofs in VCs. </p><p>The VC standard defines extension points to plug in embedded or external proofs for the creation and verification of VCs. <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/data-integrity-spec/">W3C Data Integrity Proofs</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JSON Web Tokens</a> (JWTs) represent such proof types that can be used in combination with VCs. Both proof types can be created using various signature algorithms and parameters.</p><p>Spruce and TBD are the first two organizations to demonstrate support for all <a href="https://w3id.org/security/suites/jws-2020#jose-conformance">five JWS algorithms</a> for <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/lds-jws2020/">JsonWebSignature2020</a> (Data Integrity Proofs) and JWTs, for VCs and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">W3C Verifiable Presentations</a> (VPs), which is a major step toward vendor interoperability.</p><p>More details about the Conformance Test Suite which was developed by members of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF) and the interoperability test reports can be found here:</p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#tbd">TBD’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/JWS-Test-Suite/#spruce">Spruce’s test results of JWS Test Suite</a>   <p>At Spruce, we are very excited to work on open standards and work alongside organizations like <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a> and <a href="https://transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> to create the foundation of a network of independent issuers and verifiers to accelerate the adoption of decentralized identity.</p><p>Also a shoutout to Orie Steel from <a href="https://transmute.industries/our-technology/">Transmute</a> who spearheaded the development of the Conformance Test Suite.</p> <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

Since phishing and social engineering attacks are primarily targeted at people, the human factor continues to be an important element CISOs need to consider in order to protect their organizations from cyber-attacks. Most data breaches are caused by human error, negligence, or lack of awareness, for example, by simply clicking the wrong link. So, it is common for employees to increase their digital footprint without being aware of the risks involved.</p>
<p>We hear this repeatedly: “Humans are the weakest link in cybersecurity.” This negative characterization of human nature is deeply ingrained in the cybersecurity industry. As a result, it prevents us from talking about how to better involve people in cybersecurity processes. In contrast to technology and technical processes, however, people are inconsistent and unpredictable. The human factor problem is complex because, by its nature, it involves a serious sociological, psychological, and philosophical discussion. Unfortunately, this conversation is beyond the scope of this post.</p>
 Fostering a cybersecurity culture 
<p>In the fight against cyberattacks, human intuition and creativity will always be crucial. During times of geopolitical tensions, for instance, security analysts can predict human behavior, anticipate criminal activities, and understand why threat actors target specific organizations. However, cybersecurity cannot and should not be the responsibility of a single team or department. It must be a shared responsibility across the entire organization, as well as its extended ecosystem of partners, suppliers, and customers.</p>
<p>As organizations embrace hybrid work models and accelerate cloud adoption, they have become more susceptible to account takeovers and other types of fraud. Therefore, it is important for employees to understand how cyberattacks can impact their businesses and how to protect themselves from day one. New employees should receive cybersecurity awareness training as part of their recruitment and onboarding process. In addition, security awareness training should be an ongoing process that must cover a wide variety of topics and examples of phishing, ransomware, and social engineering attacks.</p>
<p>Although security training is useful and imperative, employees do not always use this knowledge without an incentive to do so. Some see gamification as a potential mean to promote active participation in cybersecurity activities, but that alone won’t be effective if there are no actual tools in place that will enable it. The modern cybersecurity landscape has become too broad and complex to be understood by individuals alone, so employing a defense-in-depth strategy may prove essential. By modernizing and automating IT processes, perhaps we can reduce and improve the human factor impact on cybersecurity.</p>
 Modernizing and automating IT processes 
<p>Instead of teaching people not to click on unsafe links, you might consider installing a mail security gateway that will block unsafe links. Instead of worrying about data loss when working from home – deploy a zero-trust access solution that will make those losses impossible. Instead of trying to prevent rogue administrators from destroying your infrastructure – use solutions that don’t need an administrator. Let users do what they are best trained for – earn profit for your business.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this does not imply that security training and awareness programs should be abandoned, since awareness already stops a number of attack vectors and lowers the need for expensive tools. Thus, implementing automated solutions and cultivating a cybersecurity culture simultaneously can help your organization stay safe from cyberattacks. While the human factor continues to be a major problem in cybersecurity, it is essential to implement the right tools. It is much easier to blame the end user for a data breach than to address the bigger and more challenging problem of modernizing and automating IT processes.</p>

<p>CIP and KYC are vital procedures and guidelines to help keep customer data secure while also verifying a customer’s identity.</p>
<p>What is KYC CIP? Know your customer and customer identification procedures both relate to identifying someone based on their activities or information.</p>
 What Is Know Your Customer? 
<p><a href="http://irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/list-of-approved-kyc-rules">Know your customer</a> laws are requirements around customer identification and verification imposed on financial institutions to address fraud issues. Several laws intersect customer identity and verification, leading to KYC. KYC laws were initially part of anti-money laundering laws, put into place to mitigate laundering and fraud in investment firms and other high-value financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal? To ensure that financial institutions know who their customers are, follow reasonable procedures to verify their identities, assess their suitability and trustworthiness, and continue monitoring their behavior for any warning signs of malicious or fraudulent activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that “customers” here does not refer to day-to-day consumer interactions. Rather, it refers to businesses, investment firms or other individuals/organizations (fertile grounds for fraud and money laundering) looking to open business or investment accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/kyc-software/">KYC programs</a> contain three core components:</p>
 Customer Identification Program 
<p>Customer identification programs are a way to use customer documentation to verify that the customer is who they claim to be—a process defined and mandated by law. We will go into more detail about CIP in the next section.&nbsp;</p>
 Customer Due Diligence 
<p>Once the customer has been verified, the financial institution must perform due diligence to determine the trustworthiness of that individual. More specifically, the institution will perform background checks and verifications with professional references to determine that the customer isn’t a criminal or politically exposed person.</p>
<p>There are three different levels of due diligence:</p>
 
 Simplified Due Diligence: When the risk of fraud or theft is low, the organization may perform SDD. At this level, there is no required identity document verification required. This approach will only be used when the customer poses little or no risk of fraud. 
 Basic Customer Due Diligence: At the level of CDD, your organization must collect some basic forms of information from the customer to compare against criminal databases or other third-party sources of information.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: Some customers pose heightened risks for fraud—they may have a criminal background or they may be a PEP potentially vulnerable to bribery or blackmail.<br>
In this case, banks must conduct EDD procedures that could include collecting more background information, verifying their source of funding, requesting documentation on their wealth and its structure, or researching media reports and interviewing third parties.&nbsp; 
 
 Ongoing Monitoring 
<p>Just because the customer passes the initial screening doesn’t mean they will remain honest forever. Financial institutions must implement continuous monitoring activities around their customers to ensure the bank’s security and prevent future incidents of bank fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the factors that the organization may monitor as part of such a program include the following:</p>
 
 Unusual expenditures or transfers, typically much larger than average 
 An increased volume in transactions 
 Transfers or deposits to or from foreign banks&nbsp; 
 Transactions with anyone on a criminal or sanction list 
 
<p>Such activity may trigger filing a suspicious activity report. At a bare minimum, banks should have regularly updated risk reports to demonstrate the financial and legal risks they are taking and the steps they’ve taken to mitigate unlawful activities.&nbsp;</p>
 What Are Customer Identification Procedures? 
<p>Customer identification procedures are internal procedures that financial institutions implement as part of their verification process under KYC. The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 officially stated that financial institutions must maintain an internal CIP to aid the government in stopping money laundering. The U.S. The Patriot Act of 2001 expanded and codified the law for banks, savings and loans, and credit unions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal of any CIP is to effectively and within the bounds of compliance verify a customer’s identity. This first step of the KYC process is critical for security purposes and all the steps that follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few basic steps for any CIP process:</p>
 
 Data Collection: The bank must collect, at minimum, the name, date of birth, address, and Social Security number. However, to appropriately identify the customer, the bank may (and usually will) collect other information, typically documentation with photographic identification included.<br>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/authentication-identity-verification-system/">Identity Verification</a>: The institution verifies the customer’s identity. While the specifics of this process aren’t set into stone for every organization, they must be sufficient to ensure the customers’ identity reasonably. This can include comparisons against third-party databases, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a>, document verification, and identity assurance procedures.&nbsp; 
 Record Authorization: In addition to document verification and identification, the bank should compare the customer against government databases, no-fly lists, or known terrorist lists to determine criminal culpability. 
 Record-Keeping: The bank must document all their procedures for document verification and authorization. This means maintaining documents of records requests, secure storage of identifying information, explanations of discrepancies of data collected, and steps made towards resolution.<br>
 
 Record Retention: Banks must store and keep customer records for five years after the date the account or accounts are closed or, in the case of credit cards, after the account becomes dormant. 
 Customer Notice: The bank must provide adequate notification to customers about their document collection and identification processes, including the information they are collecting.&nbsp;

  <p>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) are essential practices for modern software development. In this post we cover the basics of how to add CI/CD for a JHipster microservices architecture and Kubernetes as the target cloud deployment environment.</p>

<p>Briefly, continuous integration is the practice of integrating code into the main branch of a shared repository early and often. Instead of integrating features at the end of a development cycle, code is integrated with the shared repository multiple times throughout the day. Each commit triggers automated tests, so issues are detected and fixed earlier and faster, improving team confidence and productivity. The chosen continuous integration platform is from CircleCI, a company founded in 2011 and headquartered in San Francisco. They offer a free cloud to test their services.</p>

<p>Continuous delivery is the practice of releasing to production often in a fast, safe, and automated way, allowing faster innovation and feedback loops. Its adoption requires the implementation of techniques and tools like Spinnaker, an open-source, multi-cloud, continuous delivery platform that provides application management and deployment features. The intersection between CI and CD is not always clear, but for this example, we assume CI produces and validates the artifacts and CD deploys them. The CI/CD workflow for the exploration of the proposed tools is illustrated below.</p>

 Create a Java microservices architecture 

<p>If you haven’t tried JHipster yet, you can do the classical local installation with npm.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7.9.2
</code>   

<p>If you’d rather use Yarn or Docker, follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">jhipster.tech</a>.</p>

<p>You can also use the example <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/tree/main/reactive-jhipster">reactive-jhipster</a> from GitHub, a reactive microservices architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring WebFlux, Vue as the client framework, and Gradle as the build tool. You can find the complete instructions for building the architecture in a previous post: <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.
Create a project folder <code>jhipster-ci-cd</code>.</p>

   <code>cd jhipster-ci-cd
http -d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples/bc7cbeeb1296bd0fcc6a09f4e39f4e6e472a076a/reactive-jhipster/reactive-ms.jdl
jhipster jdl reactive-ms.jdl
</code>   

<p>After the generation, you will find sub-folders were created for the <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> services. The <code>gateway</code> will act as the front-end application and as a secure router to the <code>store</code> and <code>blog</code> microservices.</p>

<p>The next step is to generate the Kubernetes deployment descriptors. In the project root folder, create a <code>kubernetes</code> directory and run the <code>k8s</code> JHipster sub-generator:</p>

   <code>mkdir kubernetes
cd kubernetes
jhipster k8s
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You must set up the Docker repository name for the cloud deployment, so go ahead and create a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a> personal account, if you don’t have one, before running the k8s sub-generator.</p>

<p>Choose the following options when prompted:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Root directory: ../ 
   Which applications? (select all) 
   Set up monitoring? No 
   Which applications with clustered databases? select store 
   Admin password for JHipster Registry: (generate one) 
   Kubernetes namespace: demo

 Configure Okta for OIDC authentication 

<p>One more configuration step before building the applications, let’s configure Okta for authentication. You must run the commands at the root folder of the project.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Add the settings from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> to <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Enable the OIDC authentication in the <code>jhipster-registry</code> service by adding the <code>oauth2</code> profile in the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

<p>We are going to build the <code>gateway</code> and <code>store</code> in a continuous integration workflow with CircleCI.</p>

 Set up CI for JHipster with CircleCI 

<p>First, create the CircleCI configuration for the <code>store</code> microservice and the <code>gateway</code>. “What about the <code>blog</code> app?”, you might ask. I’m not including it in this example to streamline this tutorial. You should be able to configure it similar to the <code>store</code> if you want to deploy everything.</p>

   <code>cd store
jhipster ci-cd
</code>   
   <code>cd gateway
jhipster ci-cd
</code>   

<p>For both applications, choose the following options:</p>
 
   What CI/CD pipeline do you want to generate? CircleCI 
   What tasks/integrations do you want to include? (none) 
 

<p>You must tweak the generated configuration at <code>store/.circleci/config.yml</code>, as the following changes are required for successful execution:</p>
 
   Change the execution environment of the workflow to a dedicated VM, as that is required by the <a href="https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/continuous_integration/circle_ci">TestContainers</a> dependency in tests. The chosen environment is <a href="https://circleci.com/developer/machine/image/ubuntu-2004">LinuxVM</a>, a standalone Ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine. 
   As the dedicated VM includes Docker, the Docker installation step in the configuration must be removed. 
   Add a conditional step for building and pushing the image to Docker Hub, only if the branch name is <code>main</code>. 
 

<p>Note: You can also configure the job to only build specific <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference#branches">branches</a>.</p>

<p>The final <code>config.yml</code> must look like this:</p>

   <code>version: 2.1

  build:
    environment:
      DOCKERHUB_USER: your-dockerhub-username

                    -Djib.to.auth.password=$DOCKERHUB_PASS          
</code>   

<p>Do the same updates to the <code>gateway/.circleci/config.yml</code> file. Additionally, the following change is required:</p>

 
   Add <code>~/.cache/Cypress</code> as a cache path 
 

<p>Be sure to replace <code>your-dockerhub-username</code> and set the correct <code>IMAGE_NAME</code>.
The final <code>config.yml</code> for the <code>gateway</code> must look like this:</p>

</code>   

<p>To take advantage of the one-step GitHub integration of CircleCI, you need a <a href="https://github.com/signup">GitHub</a> account. After signing in to GitHub, create a new public repository <code>store</code>. Follow the instructions to push the existing repository from your local machine to GitHub using the command line. Do the same with the <code>gateway</code> project.</p>

<p><a href="https://circleci.com/integrations/github">Sign up</a> at CircleCI with your GitHub account, and on the left menu choose Projects. Find the <code>store</code> project and click Set Up Project. Configure the project to use the Fastest option (Use the <code>.circleci/config.yml</code> in my repo) and type <code>main</code> for the branch. Click Set Up Project to continue.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Do the same for the <code>gateway</code> project. The configuration triggers an initial pipeline execution that will fail, because you still must set up Docker Hub credentials for both projects, allowing CircleCI to push the container images. At the <code>store</code> project page, on the top right, choose Project Settings. Then choose Environment Variables. Click Add Environment Variable. and set the following values:</p>

 
   Name: <code>DOCKERHUB_PASS</code> 
   Value: your Docker Hub password, or better, a Docker Hub access token if you have 2FA enabled. 
 

<p>NOTE: For creating a Docker Hub access token, sign in to <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>, and choose Account Settings in the top right user menu. Then, on the left menu, choose Security. Click New Access Token and set a description for the token, for example, circleci. Then click Generate and copy the new token. You can use the same token for both projects <code>store</code> and <code>gateway</code>.</p>

<p>Once a project is set up in CircleCI, a pipeline is triggered each time a commit is pushed to the configured branch. The pipeline in execution appears on the Dashboard page. You can also manually trigger the pipeline from the Dashboard if you choose the project and branch from the pipeline filters, and then click Trigger Pipeline. Before moving on to the next section, manually execute the store pipeline and the gateway pipeline once, to push the first image of each to Docker Hub.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: If you modify the configuration, and encounter CircleCI cache errors, the only way I found to recreate the cache is to update the version prefix, for example:</p>

   <code>v2-dependencies-{{ checksum "build.gradle" }}-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}
</code>   

 Install Spinnaker on Google Kubernetes Engine 

<p>Although CircleCI supports deployment for common targets, Spinnaker is a deployment manager that supports multiple cloud providers, promoting artifacts through stages (dev, staging, UAT, production), and creating continuous delivery workflows. Spinnaker does not support CI, but it can listen to events and collect artifacts produced by external CI systems.</p>

<p>You can choose among the following installation environments for Spinnaker:</p>
 
   Distributed installation on Kubernetes 
   Local installation of Debian packages 
   Local git installation from GitHub 
 

<p>For this example, the distributed alternative was selected. But before the installation, learn about some key concepts in Spinnaker configuration.</p>

 Understand Spinnaker artifacts and accounts 

<p>A Spinnaker artifact is a named JSON object that refers to an external resource, for example, a Docker image or a file stored in GitHub. In a pipeline trigger, you can specify an expected artifact, and Spinnaker will compare the incoming artifact from the trigger and bind it to be used by the trigger or another stage in the pipeline.
Also in Kubernetes, the deployed manifests can be provided statically or as an artifact. In this example, manifests are provided as artifacts stored in GitHub.</p>

<p>For Spinnaker to access and act on resources, like Docker registries, cloud providers, and code repositories, different types of accounts must be enabled in the Spinnaker configuration, along with the credentials. In addition, the configuration has the optional step of associating Spinnaker with a Kubernetes service account, allowing you to restrict permissions over the cluster resources granted to Spinnaker.</p>

 Install Halyard 

<p>As described in Spinnaker <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/">docs</a>, the first step is to install <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/halyard/">Halyard</a>. For a local install in MacOS:</p>

   <code>curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spinnaker/halyard/master/install/macos/InstallHalyard.sh
sudo bash InstallHalyard.sh
</code>   
<p>Verify the installation with:</p>

   <code>hal -v
</code>   

<p>You must also install <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/"><code>kubectl</code></a>, the Kubernetes command line tool, to run commands against the clusters.</p>

 Choose GKE for Spinnaker deployment 

<p>The second step is to choose a cloud provider for the environment in which you will install Spinnaker. For Kubernetes, Spinnaker needs a <code>kubeconfig</code> file, to access and manage the cluster. For creating a <code>kubeconfig</code> for a GKE cluster, you must first create the cluster. Google Cloud provides a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free">free tier</a> of their services that grants you $300 in free credits if you are a new user.</p>

<p>After you sign up, install <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install"><code>gcloud</code> CLI</a>. When you reach the end of the process, the last step is to run <code>gcloud init</code> and set up authorization for the tool. Also install the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubectl-auth-changes-in-gke">Kubectl authentication plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Create the cluster for the Spinnaker deployment with the following line:</p>
   <code>gcloud container clusters create spinnaker-cluster \
--zone southamerica-east1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade
</code>   
<p>Then fetch the cluster credentials with:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials spinnaker-cluster --zone southamerica-east1-a
</code>   

<p><code>get-credentials</code> will update a <code>kubeconfig</code> file with appropriate credentials and endpoint information to point <code>kubectl</code> at a specific cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine.</p>

<p>Create a namespace for the Spinnaker cluster:</p>

   <code>kubectl create namespace spinnaker
</code>   

<p>The Spinnaker <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/install/providers/kubernetes-v2/#optional-create-a-kubernetes-service-account">documentation</a> recommends creating a Kubernetes service account, using Kubernetes role definitions that restrict the permissions granted to the Spinnaker account. Create a <code>spinnaker</code> folder in the root folder or any other location. Add the file <code>spinnaker-service-account.yml</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: spinnaker-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources:
      [
        'namespaces',
        'configmaps',
        'events',
        'replicationcontrollers',
        'serviceaccounts',
        'pods/log',
      ]
    verbs: ['get', 'list']
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['pods', 'services', 'secrets']
    verbs:
      [
        'create',
        'delete',
        'deletecollection',
        'get',
        'list',
        'patch',
        'update',
        'watch',
      ]
  - apiGroups: ['autoscaling']
    resources: ['horizontalpodautoscalers']
    verbs: ['list', 'get']
  - apiGroups: ['apps']
    resources: ['controllerrevisions']
    verbs: ['list']
  - apiGroups: ['extensions', 'apps']
    resources: ['daemonsets', 'deployments', 'deployments/scale', 'ingresses', 'replicasets', 'statefulsets']
    verbs:
      [
        'create',
        'delete',
        'deletecollection',
        'get',
        'list',
        'patch',
        'update',
        'watch',
      ]
  # These permissions are necessary for Halyard to operate. We use this role also to deploy Spinnaker itself.
  - apiGroups: ['']
    resources: ['services/proxy', 'pods/portforward']
    verbs:
      [
        'create',
        'delete',
        'deletecollection',
        'get',
        'list',
        'patch',
        'update',
        'watch',
      ]

---
apiVersion: v1

</code>   

<p>Then execute the following commands to create the service account in the current context:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

kubectl apply --context $CONTEXT \
    -f ./spinnaker-service-account.yml

TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret --context $CONTEXT \
   $(kubectl get serviceaccount spinnaker-service-account \
       --context $CONTEXT \
       -n spinnaker \
       -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') \
   -n spinnaker \
   -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)

kubectl config set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-token-user --token $TOKEN

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT --user ${CONTEXT}-token-user
</code>   
<p>Enable the Kubernetes provider in Halyard:</p>

   <code>hal config provider kubernetes enable
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You will see warnings related to missing configuration. Be patient, in the following steps all will be solved.</p>

<p>Add the service account to the Halyard configuration:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

hal config provider kubernetes account add spinnaker-gke-account \
    --context $CONTEXT
</code>   

 Choose the installation environment 

<p>The Distributed installation on Kubernetes deploys each Spinnaker’s microservice separately to a remote cloud, and it is the recommended environment for zero-downtime updates of Spinnaker.</p>

<p>Select the distributed deployment with:</p>

   <code>hal config deploy edit --type distributed --account-name spinnaker-gke-account
</code>   

 Choose a storage service 

<p>Spinnaker requires an external storage provider for persisting application settings and configured pipelines. To avoid losing this data, using a hosted storage solution is recommended. For this example, we use Google Cloud Storage. Hosting the data externally allows us to delete clusters in between sessions, and keep the pipelines once the clusters have been recreated.</p>

<p>In the <code>spinnaker</code> folder, run the following code:</p>

   <code>SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME=spinnaker-gcs-account
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST=~/.gcp/gcs-account.json

gcloud iam service-accounts create \
    $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --display-name $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME

SA_EMAIL=$(gcloud iam service-accounts list \
    --filter="displayName:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
    --format='value(email)')

PROJECT=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT \
    --role roles/storage.admin --member serviceAccount:$SA_EMAIL

mkdir -p $(dirname $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST)

gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST \
    --iam-account $SA_EMAIL

BUCKET_LOCATION=us

hal config storage gcs edit --project $PROJECT \
    --bucket-location $BUCKET_LOCATION \
    --json-path $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_DEST

hal config storage edit --type gcs    
</code>   

<p>The last <code>hal</code> commands edit the storage settings and set the storage source to GCS.</p>

 Deploy Spinnaker 

<p>You can verify the deployment configuration with:</p>

   <code>hal config deploy
</code>   

<p>And the storage configuration with:</p>
   <code>hal config storage
</code>   

<p>List the available Spinnaker versions:</p>

   <code>hal version list
</code>   

<p>Set the version for the deployment with:</p>

   <code>hal config version edit --version 1.27.0
</code>   

<p>Deploy Spinnaker to GKE:</p>

   <code>hal deploy apply
</code>   

<p>Even if <code>hal deploy apply</code> returns successfully, the installation may not be complete yet. Check if the pods are ready with <code>k9s</code>:</p>

   <code>k9s -n spinnaker
</code>   

<p>A healthy Spinnaker deployment will look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can connect to the Spinnaker UI using the following command:</p>

   <code>hal deploy connect
</code>   
<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:9000</code> and the UI should load. The Projects tab should look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up CD for a JHipster microservices architecture 

<p>Spinnaker is multi-cloud because it can manage delivery to multiple cloud providers. Some companies use different platforms for production and test environments. In this example, the same cloud provider (GKE) was chosen both for Spinnaker deployment and for the application test deployment.</p>

 Use GKE for Kubernetes deployment 

<p>Now I’ll show you how to add a new Kubernetes account for a different cluster, which will be used for application deployment.</p>

<p>Create a cluster for the JHipster microservices architecture:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters create jhipster-cluster \
--zone southamerica-east1-a \
--machine-type n1-standard-4 \
--enable-autorepair \
--enable-autoupgrade
</code>   

<p>Fetch the cluster credentials:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters get-credentials jhipster-cluster --zone southamerica-east1-a
</code>   

<p>Create the namespace <code>demo</code> for your microservices:</p>

   <code>kubectl create namespace demo
</code>   

<p>In the <code>spinnaker</code> directory, create the file <code>jhipster-service-account.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: jhipster-role
rules:

</code>   

<p>Notice there are some differences with the Spinnaker service account. The k8s manifests generated by JHipster include the creation of <code>secrets</code>, <code>configmaps</code>, and <code>persistentvolumeclaims</code>. The management of those Kubernetes resources must be granted to the service account used for deploying the JHipster k8s manifests.</p>

<p>Create the Kubernetes <code>jhipster-service-account</code>:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

kubectl apply --context $CONTEXT \
    -f ./jhipster-service-account.yml
TOKEN=$(kubectl get secret --context $CONTEXT \
   $(kubectl get serviceaccount jhipster-service-account \
       --context $CONTEXT \
       -n demo \
       -o jsonpath='{.secrets[0].name}') \
   -n demo \
   -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 --decode)

kubectl config set-credentials ${CONTEXT}-token-user --token $TOKEN

kubectl config set-context $CONTEXT --user ${CONTEXT}-token-user
</code>   

<p>Add the account to the Halyard configuration:</p>

   <code>CONTEXT=$(kubectl config current-context)

hal config provider kubernetes account add jhipster-gke-account \
    --context $CONTEXT
</code>   

 Add a Docker registry account 

<p>As the goal is to trigger the pipeline execution when a new image is pushed to Docker Hub, you need to configure a Docker Registry provider with Halyard.</p>

<p>First, enable the Docker Registry provider:</p>

   <code>hal config provider docker-registry enable
</code>   

<p>The following <code>hal config</code> line will prompt for your password (or access token if you have 2FA enabled). Make sure to replace <code>your-dockerhub-username</code>.</p>

   <code>ADDRESS=index.docker.io
USERNAME=your-dockerhub-username

hal config provider docker-registry account add docker-account \
    --address $ADDRESS \
    --repositories $USERNAME/store $USERNAME/gateway \
    --username $USERNAME \
    --password
</code>   

 Add a GitHub artifact account 

<p>The pipeline will deploy k8s manifests from a GitHub repository, so you must also configure a GitHub artifact account. First, enable the feature:</p>

   <code>hal config artifact github enable
</code>   
<p>Generate an access token on GitHub. Sign in, and in the user menu choose Settings. Then on the left menu choose Developer settings. On the left menu choose Personal access tokens. Click Generate new token and copy the token.</p>

<p>Then add your GitHub username and set the new token when prompted:</p>

   <code>ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_NAME=your-github-username

hal config artifact github account add $ARTIFACT_ACCOUNT_NAME \
    --token
</code>   

<p>The new GKE, Docker, and GitHub account configurations must be applied to the deployment before starting the pipeline design:</p>

   <code>hal deploy apply
</code>   

 Create the store microservice pipeline 

<p>The pipeline is the central concept in deployment management with Spinnaker. It is compounded by a sequence of actions, named stages. A pipeline can be triggered manually or automatically, and have an execution history. Connect to the Spinnaker UI again to create the first pipeline.</p>

   <code>hal deploy connect
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>https://localhost:9000</code> &gt; Applications. Click Create Application and just set the application name and owner email. The repository type and additional fields are not mandatory and you can leave all blank for this test.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, on the left menu, choose Pipelines and click Configure a new pipeline. Set a name for the pipeline, for example, store-cd.</p>

 Configure the Docker image triggers 

<p>In the pipeline configuration, click Add Trigger. Set the following configuration for the trigger:</p>

 
   Type: Docker Registry 
   Registry Name: docker-account 
   Organization: your-dockerhub-username 
   Image: your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Artifact Constraints: Choose Define new artifact 
 

<p>In the Expected Artifact form, set the following values:</p>

 
   Display Name: store-image 
   Account: docker-registry 
   Docker image: Fully qualified index.docker.io/your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Use prior execution: yes 
   Use default artifact: yes (set the same account and object path as before) 
 

<p>Click Save Artifact.</p>

<p></p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Spinnaker provides a mechanism to <a href="https://spinnaker.io/docs/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/#override-artifacts">override</a> the version of Docker images, Kubernetes ConfigMaps, and Secrets in manifests, injecting new versions when one of these objects exists in the pipeline context. However, Spinnaker documentation does not have a clear example of the trigger configuration for the Docker image to be available in the pipeline context. To make it happen, you must set it as an artifact constraint in the trigger. If the artifact constraint is not defined, the original image version in the manifests will be deployed, instead of the new image that triggered the pipeline. If no version is in the manifests, <code>latest</code> will be the default.</p>

<p>Add a second Docker registry trigger for the gateway image pushes and click Save Changes.</p>

 Configure the deployment stages 

<p>The store pipeline will execute the following stages:</p>

 
   Deploy the application ConfigMap 
   Deploy the JHipster Registry 
   Deploy the gateway database PostgreSQL 
   Deploy the store clustered database MongoDB 
   Deploy the gateway microservice 
   Deploy the store microservice 
   Enable the gateway service 
   Enable the store service 
 

<p>The Kubernetes configuration created in the folder <code>jhipster-ci-cd/kubernetes</code> must be pushed to a GitHub repository, so Spinnaker can access it using the GitHub artifact account created earlier. But before you push, edit <code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-deployment.yml</code> and set the image name with the fully qualified address:</p>

   <code>- name: store-app
  image: index.docker.io/indiepopart/store
</code>   
<p>Do the same for <code>kubernetes/gateway-k8s/gateway-deployment.yml</code>. This is also required for the artifact substitution to work.</p>

<p>Sign in to GitHub and create a public repository <code>jhipster-k8s</code>. Follow the instructions to push the existing <code>kubernetes</code> folder from your local using the command line.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: At this point, you will be pushing plain secrets contained in the application and Kubernetes configuration. To avoid this insecure anti-pattern, you can run the JHipster registry locally to encrypt application configuration, and also set up <code>kubeseal</code> for Kubernetes secrets encryption. The process is described in a previous post: <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

<p>Go back to Spinnaker UI, and in the pipeline configuration choose Add Stage and set the following values:</p>

 
   Type: Deploy (Manifest) 
   Stage Name: deploy application-configmap 
   Account: jhipster-gke-account 
   Override Namespace: yes 
   Namespace: demo 
   Manifest Source: Artifact 
   Manifest Artifact: Define a new artifact 
 

<p>In the artifact fields, set the following values:</p>

 
   Account: your-github-username 
   Content URL: https://api.github.com/repos/your-github-username/jhipster-k8s/contents/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml 
   Commit/Branch: main 
 

<p>Click Save Changes.
 Repeat the process for adding stages to deploy <code>jhipster-registry.yml</code>, which must depend on the previous manifest. Also repeat for <code>gateway-postgresql.yml</code>, <code>store-mongodb.yml</code> manifests, which both should depend on the <code>jhipster-registry</code> stage. Make sure to set the correct Content URL for the GitHub artifact. It must have the form <code>https://api.github.com/repos/&lt;your-github-username&gt;/&lt;repo-name&gt;/contents/&lt;path&gt;</code>. If you open the URL in a browser, it should render a JSON response.</p>

<p>Add a stage for the <code>store-deployment.yml</code> manifest, it must depend on the <code>store-mongodb</code> stage. For this manifest, you must bind the Docker image from the context. In the deploy manifest configuration, in Required Artifacts to Bind, choose store-image. The option must be available, as the image was set as an artifact constraint in the trigger configuration, making the artifact available in the pipeline context.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Also add a stage for the <code>gateway-deployment.yml</code>, binding the <code>gateway</code> Docker image. It must depend on the <code>gateway-postgresql</code> stage.</p>

<p>Finally, add a stage for <code>store-service.yml</code>, which must depend on the <code>store-deployment</code> stage, and a stage for <code>gateway-service.yml</code>, which must depend on the <code>gateway-postgresql</code> stage. Notice that Docker images have to be bound only for the manifests that contain a reference to the image.
The complete pipeline must look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Test the pipeline manually once. Go to Pipelines and select Start Manual Execution for the store-cd pipeline. Set the following options:</p>

 
   Trigger: leave docker-account: your-dockerhub-username/store 
   Type: Tag 
   Tag: latest 
 

<p>Successful execution will show all stages in a green state:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Get the external IP of the gateway:</p>

   <code>kubectl get svc gateway -n demo
</code>   

<p>Update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the gateway address as a valid redirect. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, edit, and add:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080</code> 
 

<p>Navigate to <code>http://&lt;external-ip&gt;:8080</code> and sign in to the application with your Okta credentials. Then try creating a <code>Product</code>:</p>

<p></p>

 Trigger the CI/CD pipeline with a GitHub push 

<p>For testing the workflow, make a code change in the gateway. Edit <code>src/main/webapp/content/scss/_bootstrap-variables.scss</code> and update the following variable:</p>

   <code>$body-bg: steelblue;
</code>   
<p>Also, the pipeline under test will only trigger if a new image tag is detected. So edit <code>.circleci/confg.yml</code> and update the image name:</p>

   <code>IMAGE_NAME: indiepopart/gateway:v1
</code>   

<p>Commit and push the change to the <code>main</code> branch, and watch the CircleCI CI pipeline triggers. After the new gateway image is pushed to Docker Hub, watch the Spinnaker CD pipeline trigger and deploy the updated gateway. On the left menu choose Clusters, and verify the active gateway deployment now has a V002. If you click over the V002 box, you can also verify the image tag that was deployed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can delete clusters in between sessions to save costs with the following <code>gcloud</code> commands:</p>

   <code>gcloud container clusters delete &lt;cluster-name&gt; \
  --zone &lt;cluster-zone&gt;
</code>   

<p>The cloud storage used by Spinnaker for pipeline persistence generates some costs, you can also delete it with the CLI or using the web console.</p>

 Inspect Spinnaker logs 

<p>For pipeline and trigger debugging, the Spinnaker services <code>spin-echo</code> and <code>spin-igor</code> inform Docker monitoring events and indicate the reasons why an execution was skipped.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods -n spinnaker
kubectl logs spin-igor-7c8bdd94f5-lx5dl -n spinnaker | grep v1
</code>   

   <code>Found 1 new images for docker-account. Images: [{imageId=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1, sendEvent=true}]
New tagged image: account=docker-account, image=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1. Digest is now [null].
Sending tagged image info to echo: account=docker-account: image=igor:dockerRegistry:v2:docker-account:indiepopart/gateway:v1
</code>   

 Spinnaker features and best practices 

<p>When implementing continuous delivery, here are some best practices and key features to be aware of:</p>

 
   Deploy Docker images by digest: Spinnaker documentation recommends deploying images by digest instead of tag, because the tag might reference different content each time. The digest is a content-based hash of the image and it uniquely identifies it. Spinnaker’s artifact substitution allows deploying the same manifest, with the image digest supplied by the pipeline trigger. Using the proposed trigger and a free Docker Hub account as the registry, the digest data seems not to be available. It is also recommended to trigger a CD pipeline off of a push to a Docker registry instead of a GitHub push or Jenkins job, allowing development teams to choose their delivery process without more constraints. 
   Rollbacks: Just as there is a stage for deploying manifests, there are also stages for deleting, scaling, and rolling back manifests. Spinnaker also supports automated rollbacks, as it exposes the Undo Rollout functionality as a stage, which can be configured to run when other stages fail, and to roll back by a number of revisions of the deployed object. ConfigMaps and Secrets must be versioned for the automated rollback to actually roll back code or configuration. 
   Manual judgments: The pipeline can include a manual judgment stage, that will make the execution interrupt, asking for user input to continue or cancel. This can be used to ask for confirmation before promoting a staging deployment to production. 
   Pipeline management: Spinnaker represents pipelines as JSON behind the scenes, and maintains a revision history of the changes made to the pipeline. It also supports pipeline templates, that can be managed through the <code>spin CLI</code>, and help with pipeline sharing and distribution. 
   Canary: You can automate Canary analysis by creating canary stages for your pipeline. Canary must be enabled in the Spinnaker installation using <code>hal</code> commands. The Canary analysis consists of the evaluation of metrics chosen during configuration, comparing a partial rollout with the current deployment. The stage will fail based on the deviation criteria configured for the metric. 
   Secrets management: Spinnaker does not directly support secrets management. Secrets should be encrypted at rest and in transit. Credentials encryption for application secrets and Kubernetes secrets was covered in a recent post: <a>Kubernetes to the Cloud with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>. 
   Rollout strategies: The Spinnaker Kubernetes provider supports running dark, highlander, and red/black rollouts. In the Deploy Manifest stage, there is a strategy option that allows associating workload to a service, sending traffic to it, and choosing how to handle any previous versions of the workload in the same cluster and namespace.

<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re excited to introduce Stefanie van Dyk, People Operations Manager at GlobaliD. Stefanie has been working in customer success and people operations roles for about ten years. She earned an undergraduate degree in sociology from San Jose State University.</p><p>Now, Stefanie is helping build our culture and team here at GlobaliD. During our conversation, Stefanie discussed her role leading the People Operations team, the challenges of operating during a global pandemic, and how she’ll further establish company values that motivate our team members to be the best versions of themselves.</p> Meet Stefanie <p>I’m Stefanie and I’m the People Operations Manager at GlobaliD. I’m in charge of everything that’s HR related from onboarding and recruiting to establishing security protocols and updating company policies. I originally joined the team as an Operations Manager before being promoted to my current position earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>My main focus right now is trying to grow and enhance the company culture here at GlobaliD, which can be tricky since we’re a fully remote company with employees located all around the&nbsp;globe.</p> What attracted her to&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>Previously, I was working in the legal cannabis industry for about two and a half years. I was thrown into that world and had a very eye opening experience where I was able to learn a lot, but I felt I needed to do something that was a little more&nbsp;stable.</p><p>I enjoy the startup space and I had a connection to Margaret Slemmer, who is a partner at Hard Yaka and an initial investor in GlobaliD. Our conversation about the business made me interested because I thought it would be a fun opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a company and see how it&nbsp;grows.</p><p>As I learned more about the identity industry and how we can potentially solve so many problems throughout the world I became even more intrigued. Now, I’ve been here a little over a year and a half and I’ve really enjoyed my time at the company so&nbsp;far.</p> On the People Operations team <p>The People Operations team touches everything across the organization including recruiting, onboarding, culture, performance reviews, compliance, etc. We’re responsible for making sure new employees are properly introduced to their team and set up with all of the necessary equipment or software they need. We also assist with insurance questions, 401ks, equity/options and any other benefits employees want to&nbsp;access.</p> Establishing culture and company&nbsp;values <p>We’re really focused on establishing a great company culture. We’re taking strides to ensure that everybody feels they’re part of a team and playing a part in building something really great. We want our team members to feel excited when they begin work every day, and part of that is providing fun and interesting things for them to do outside of their day-to-day roles. Since we’re a fully remote company it’s even more important that we find ways to gather employee feedback, and then we try to implement those things as soon as possible.</p><p>We’re also working on establishing clear and concise company values. We’re asking employees to think about what we believe in and what we want to live and breathe as an organization. At the end of the day, it’s really important that everybody is on the same page about what we’re actually trying to accomplish.</p> The challenges of operating during a&nbsp;pandemic <p>We prioritize mental health and wellness, and I believe this was especially important during the pandemic when we are all working remotely. When you’re not spending time with people in person it can be harder to identify if they’re going through something they may need help&nbsp;with.</p><p>As part of these efforts, we’re creating a wellness program to combat inactivity and remind people to take a break from their computers. Many people have said they don’t know when to “turn it off” so we’re exploring different platforms that challenge people to get outside for 30 minutes, stretch or just a simple reminder to drink some water. We wake up and go into auto-pilot when we start our day, so six hours can go by and you realize you haven’t had lunch yet. The goal is to create a fun way to remind people to move away from their desks and ​​find a way to have the “water cooler chat” in a remote world and across time&nbsp;zones.</p> On the importance of sharing successes <p>Celebrating each other more often, including some of the small wins is important because it shows how we’re making progress.</p><p>We started a new program where Kevin, our CEO, has started accepting nominations for employees who have gone above and beyond in their role and made a positive impact on the organization. Nominees will be recognized during our bi-weekly team meetings in order to excite and encourage each other to keep working hard. He’s also going to begin sending emails to the entire company to announce big wins — when we gain a new client, secure more funding, release new product updates, etc. We want to be very open and vocal about our success with all of our employees.</p> On her background and career before joining&nbsp;GlobaliD <p>I graduated college with a degree in sociology because I’ve always enjoyed people. After college, I moved to San Francisco and accepted a sales position with a startup company that was a marketing sales enablement platform. It was a small team that included myself and only three other colleagues, but we were very close and one of them is still a mentor to me to this&nbsp;day.</p><p>Eventually, I moved into a customer success role and ended up working in that position for about five years. I liked working with customers, understanding their pain points and developing solutions to try and solve their problems.</p><p>Then I was recruited by a former colleague to work in the cannabis industry. He asked me to be an account manager at a company called Eaze, a cannabis delivery company. My job was to manage all of the company’s partners in Northern California. However, because the industry is so highly regulated and nobody had tried building a cannabis delivery service at the time, there was a lot of uncertainty. Then I got pregnant with my daughter and I decided it was time to find a more stable opportunity.</p> Standout moments or experiences she’s had so&nbsp;far <p>When I first joined the company I met up with a handful of folks from the operations team who lived in the San Francisco Bay area. We took a day off and had a wine tasting adventure. It was a great way to meet some of my new colleagues and learn about the business directly from them. They shared a lot of fun stories and memories about the business and talked about how they’ve already seen the organization come so far from where it started. It really got me even more excited to work at GlobaliD and I started to think about all the possibilities for growth that we&nbsp;had.</p> Her hobbies and interests <p>I’m a big outdoors person and a huge animal lover. I just got back from a camping trip and I’m going to hike half dome for the third time this month, which I’m excited about because it’s a challenging but amazing experience. I enjoy traveling and exploring which is something you can do more of when you’re living the remote work life. It’s a great opportunity to get out there and discover things you couldn’t with a traditional office&nbsp;job.</p><p>After getting married in Mexico earlier this year, I decided that I want to start taking Spanish lessons again soon. I understand Spanish relatively well but would like to be able to have a conversation in another language.</p> What she’s looking forward&nbsp;to <p>I’m very excited about new meetings we’re going to start having called Lunch and Learn’s. They will be quick and simple half-hour meetings where a team member will share information about something they’re working on, or provide more details on their role and day-to-day work life. We’ll encourage everybody to relax, grab a bite to eat and learn more about each other. The meetings will be a great way to gain more insight into what everybody does and create some transparency into each other’s worlds outside of the bi-weekly meetings.</p><p>Another thing we aim to implement later this year is a management training solution. We want to empower our teams and leaders with tools to have effective one-on-one meetings, promote team growth, create a rich feedback culture and more. We want GlobaliD to be a place that encourages everyone to challenge themselves and others and a place where everyone is excited about the opportunity and&nbsp;vision.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about GlobaliD, sign up for the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/global.id/the-globalid-insider-signups">GlobaliD Insider newsletter.</a> You’ll get monthly updates on digital identity, company news and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Also, ICYMI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-meaghan-decorpo-191c9d6ba00b">Meet the Team- Meaghan Decorpo, Customer Care&nbsp;Manager</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Todd Collins, Head of&nbsp;Design</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>  <a>Meet the Team — Erik Westra, Head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-stefanie-van-dyk-3af2016568e1">Meet the Team: Stefanie van Dyk</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>“Multi-cloud” is a tricky term. At its face value, it simply means that your organization is using cloud services from more than one provider, right? But if it’s that trivial, why are so many people talking about “multi-cloud strategies” and why do entire market segments exist only to make managing your multi-cloud deployments slightly less unbearable?</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.flexera.com/blog/cloud/cloud-computing-trends-2022-state-of-the-cloud-report/">Flexera</a>, over 90% of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy, and on average, a business is using the services of 2.6 public cloud providers. But of course, the number alone is not what matters. For example, here at KuppingerCole Analysts, our developers actively consume various cloud infrastructure and services from all the top cloud providers and several smaller ones as well. A more interesting question is why multi-cloud has become such an important strategic driver for so many organizations.</p>
 What is Multi-Cloud Anyway? 
<p>Back when the competition in the public cloud market was just getting started, the selection of services offered by CSPs was quite narrow and focused mainly on infrastructure, such as virtual machines or storage. Choosing a specific cloud was primarily a matter of cost and availability, and there were few reasons to use multiple clouds other than redundancy. In the later years, however, most cloud providers have realized that competing with the market leader on its own terms is not a feasible strategy, and offering unique services that nobody else has is how you attract new customers.</p>
<p>Nowadays, even though everyone agrees that cloud infrastructure has become a commodity, we do know that major cloud service providers are definitely not interchangeable. On the contrary, every cloud has its own set of unique services, which everyone would love to use, even if it means the additional effort of going properly multi-cloud.</p>
<p>Sure, AWS perhaps still has the most varieties of hardware, but Google Cloud might appeal to developers with its powerful app modernization capabilities, while Microsoft Azure has great analytics tools, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers very popular database services. Your choices might vary, of course, but the point still stands — if you are designing a perfect cloud-native application, you would want to combine building blocks from different service providers.</p>
<p>However, even though in theory this has been possible for years, in many aspects, “proper multi-cloud” development is still in its infancy. There are so many challenges developers must solve to make it possible, and even after that, compromises must be made as well.</p>
 The Infantile Disorders of Modern Multi-Cloud 
<p>The most obvious problem is interoperability (or rather the lack thereof). Every cloud comes with its own technology stack — products, data structures, APIs, security, and even identity and access models. This means that to develop a multi-cloud application, you have to learn almost (but not quite) the same things many times over and then make sure they remain compatible with each other as clouds upgrade their services.</p>
<p>Another major challenge is cross-cloud connectivity. Even though it is usually expected that within a single cloud’s infrastructure the traffic is fast and secure, letting your data flow to a different cloud goes against the provider’s business interest. This is why in most multi-cloud deployments, organizations must deal not just with large data egress fees, but with high latencies and the necessity of moving sensitive data over the less than secure public internet.</p>
<p>You should not forget the operational effort, either. Each cloud has not just its own administrative UI, but a whole set of processes, tools, and workflows associated with it. This means that an organization essentially has to hire a separate team to operate each cloud and then somehow ensure that they can work together in a meaningful way. With the growing shortage of skilled IT professionals, you’re looking at the prospect of additional investments not just into your employees, but into third-party tools and services to enable efficient cross-team collaboration. Of course, you can always outsource the project to one of the well-known global consulting firms, but that also requires additional investments.</p>
<p>With limited visibility and disjointed security across different clouds, multi-cloud deployments might lead to misconfigurations, compatibility issues, increased attack surface, and in the end, serious compliance violations and even data breaches. We have extensively covered the risks of migrating sensitive data and business-critical workloads to the cloud <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research">in our research</a>, but for multi-cloud deployments, these risks are multiplied, and the native security controls built into every cloud cannot help deal with them efficiently.</p>
 Multi-Cloud 2.0 – What Should We Look For 
<p>The most trivial way to avoid all these problems is by avoiding multi-cloud completely. For example, you can absolutely run SAP on AWS or Oracle on Azure. But this approach is not ideal because it won’t be a fully managed service.</p>
<p>Another very common way to deal with the lack of interoperability is to introduce an additional layer of abstraction, the multi-cloud lowest common denominator, if you will. The most successful example of this is the Kubernetes platform for orchestrating containerized applications. And while Kubernetes is perhaps one of the best things that has happened to the cloud lately, it has its limitations. Containerization does make your application cloud-agnostic to a large extent, but it cannot magically address connectivity and data egress issues.</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve all these issues and finally allow “multi-cloud” to fulfill its original promise? Well, first, this relies heavily on the cloud providers’ willingness to cooperate instead of competing. If you want your data to flow freely between clouds, their operators must agree to establish fast, low-latency interconnects between their data centers first. And, of course, to stop hoarding customers’ data using exorbitant egress charges. Without this necessary step, the rest is just fantasy…</p>
<p>Still, wouldn’t it be great if we could just mix and match native cloud services from different providers and design our applications from these building blocks without the need to resort to some additional layer of compatibility? Or even better, to make native cloud services aware of other clouds and their data models, identities, compliance controls, etc.? Or, if I may dare to dream big, even manage all those services from the same administrative console and enjoy consolidated support or even billing across clouds?</p>
 Oracle and Microsoft Announce New Multi-Cloud Capabilities 
<p>Well, we might not be quite there yet, but Oracle and Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-database-service-for-microsoft-azure-2022-07-20/">made a big first step</a> toward this multi-cloud future. In fact, the companies have been collaborating on multi-cloud deployments for years already: for example, fast private interconnects between Azure and OCI were launched in 2019 and are now available in 11 regions around the world. With 1.5 ms latency and no ingress/egress charges between the two clouds, customers can achieve the performance and flexibility of their multi-cloud deployments that is comparable to “single cloud” architectures.</p>
<p>But now the companies have gone even further and announced the first fully integrated multi-cloud service: the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/azure/oracle-database-for-azure/">Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure</a>. Now it is possible to run an Oracle Database in the OCI cloud but utilize it directly from any application running on Azure without any connectivity issues. Oracle databases running in OCI now have a completely native look and feel for Azure customers. They can be provisioned and managed directly from Azure or using Azure native APIs. They are fully aware of Azure identities and integrated into Azure networking and monitoring. And at the same time, they offer the full range of Oracle Autonomous Database and Exadata platform capabilities that were previously only available to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, but not on Azure.</p>
<p>The only step customers have to perform is to link their Azure and OCI accounts—the rest is fully transparent. A growing number of Azure’s native services (Power BI, Cognitive Services, Kubernetes, etc.) are already fully aware of and compatible with the new database service. This makes it much easier to develop true cross-cloud applications. Database observability data is also constantly fed into Azure, providing customers with visibility into their infrastructure across the two clouds. Finally, both companies offer a consolidated support model, where you only need to create a single ticket to resolve any issue related to the new services.</p>
<p>This is, of course, just the beginning. Additional Oracle services will be added later and &nbsp;more Azure services will be made “multi-cloud-aware”. Another thing I’d love to see implemented is the integration with Azure security analytics services… But the Oracle Database Service for Microsoft Azure is definitely a big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>When I heard the announcement, my first thought was that people will inevitably refer to the new service as “multi-cloud 2.0”, just as they did with Kubernetes years ago. However, it would be fair to say that this is actually how people have expected multi-cloud to work from the very beginning. So, if you will, multi-cloud is finally out of beta and ready to unlock its full potential.</p>

<p>Welcome to the OWN Insights series, where we invite industry leaders to take us on a thought provoking journey through the Web3 space. Throughout this series, industry leaders will be sharing a space, communicating their thoughts, and helping us to better understand the new iteration of the internet. Please enjoy this article from Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology.</p><p>Web3 is a space with tremendous nuance. The revolution that was spawned by DeFi to advance financial sovereignty has taken on a much bigger meaning. People want to make an impact in ways that are meaningful to them, and they want to do so with value aligned individuals.</p><p>DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), for over a year now, have proven they are a good mechanism for bringing people together along shared values and purpose. People with a shared mission have organized around those beliefs, powered by a variety of tools and methodologies to solve complex challenges together.</p><p>Most DAOs can be categorized in the following groups: Service, Protocol, Investment, Grants, Collector, Social, and Media DAOs. As DAOs continue to grow and mature, so do the categories that wish to organize them in neat little&nbsp;boxes.</p><p>DAO tools have also evolved from where they were only a year ago. Interacting with a DAO has become more complex; going from simple web3 wallets and social platforms to include multisigs, operating systems, p2p compensation, voting platforms, and more recently task and bounty management tools. Standout tools like Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, CollabLand, and Coordinape are leading the DAO tooling revolution.</p><p>It doesn’t seem as if DAOs can be stopped. Quite the opposite actually. The demand for new, novel DAOs is accelerating. Projects like ConstitutionDAO have sparked the imagination of many would-be DAO founders, and accelerated ideas by people who share the same enthusiasm, commitment, and desire to make an impact in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>As the types of DAOs and tooling evolves, so too does the demand from communities that comprise DAOs to create more robust mechanisms to manage and support the project and their contributors.</p><p>A few areas in which DAOs are hoping to improve is onboarding, incentives, and governance</p><p>Member onboarding has for some time been a product of tokens, which DAOs use to govern, and incentivize members. Many DAOs also use tokens to gate communities. To distribute these tokens, DAOs usually perform airdrops to users of their platforms and value-aligned projects and protocols, thus aiming to onboard these individuals to their DAO to participate in community building and governance. A practice that is not perfect but has worked for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>Recently, there has been an evolution in the way airdrops are used to onboard DAO members. More comprehensive “checklists” are used to quantify an airdrop recipient’s interaction with a project or protocol. Additional steps are sometimes taken to introduce them to the governance process of the project and begin participating in it prior to accepting the airdrop. The goal is to find individuals who will more likely align to the DAOs mission and become active, valuable contributors.</p><p>Once onboarded, a DAO must find ways of retaining high-impact contributors. Whether through grants, bounties, or role-based pay, DAOs incentivize contributors to create value and grow the ecosystem. This process usually allows for anyone that is interested in participating in the DAO to do so without too much effort. Generally, this is a process that works well for accelerating contributions from early contributors. However, as a DAO matures, the incentives are often misaligned to veteran contributors who have generated tremendous value to the ecosystem. Longtime members can find themselves competing with new members for bounties and roles that value their contributions as the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Governance in DAOs oftentimes, if not always, is performed through token holdings. The more tokens you own, the larger your voice in a DAO. This process tends to work well in the early days where everyone should have similar footing in a DAO. However, as individuals contribute to a DAO, the value they generate may differ from others. This is especially true with regard to large token holders that may join later and who don’t frequently contribute, or at all. The voices of those avid, frequent contributors who may be more in tune with the needs of the DAO may be drowned out by those with token wealth. This can skew outcomes in favor of those who may be interested in shaping a DAO in ways that are misaligned to the values of the DAO and those who are building&nbsp;it.</p><p>What is next for&nbsp;DAOs?</p><p>The future is bright for DAOs. Recently, much attention has been brought to self-sovereign identity and reputation as it relates to decentralized communities through articles, blogs and papers written by highly-influential personas. This has spawned a new wave of development using Decentralized Identifiers (DID), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and non-transferable NFTs&nbsp;(SBT).</p><p>Projects are experimenting with these novel technologies to identify their use case in DAOs. The promise is that one, or all, of these can unlock an individual’s reputation and create more dynamic and fair onboarding, incentives, and governance practices.</p><p>This clearly marks the beginning of something new and exciting in DAOs, and web3 in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Personally, I am excited for the opportunity to explore and build in this emergent space that continues to evolve before our very own&nbsp;eyes.</p><p>OWN (Ontology Web3 Network) Infrastructure is a series of blockchain protocols and products that provides the much needed tools to create an interconnected, interoperable global blockchain ecosystem. The infrastructure is bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 applications through decentralized identity and data solutions.</p><p>Aimed at allowing Web3 developers to quickly build Web3 applications, saving them from creating basic functions from scratch, OWN includes the Ontology blockchain, ONT ID framework and more. Individuals can also seamlessly and quickly access Web3 through products such as ONTO&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>Follow us on social&nbsp;media!</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daos-are-the-next-unlock-in-web3-fda117e5143b">DAOs Are the Next Unlock in Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The theme behind our product work in the first half of 2022 has been around Interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a company, Northern Block believes in enabling digital identity data for any entity to be exchanged and verified using any platform of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence we have committed ourselves to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of Verifiable Credentials.</p>
<p>It’s very important to us that we continue aligning our product suite against the many existing and emerging technical standards.</p>
<p>As we build in new features in NB Orbit, we want to continue sharing these updates with the community.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2021, we demonstrated AIP 1.0 Compliance of our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet</a> against the Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) (<a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">here</a>). Our work since then has been to move the needle towards AIP 2.0 Compliance for both our Mobile Wallet and <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-enterprise-cloud/">Enterprise SSI Cloud Platform</a>.</p>
<p>Since our <a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-platform-release-notes-q4-2021/">last product release notes were from Q4 2021</a>, we’re overdue in providing you all with an update.</p>
<p>So here it goes..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; Added Support for Connectionless Exchanges 
<p>We’ve enhanced the types of verifications that are possible by adding support for Connectionless Exchanges.</p>
<p>For those interested, we wrote about how we look at connection-based vs connectionless interactions in a recent blog post titled “<a href="https://northernblock.io/why-credential-issuance-should-be-holder-driven/">Why credential issuance should be holder-driven</a>”.</p>
<p>One of the areas in which we demonstrated connectionless exchanges is through the way passwordless authentications are done to gain access to Orbit Enterprise.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Users of Orbit Enterprise are people that are acting on behalf of an organization. They will manage connections, credential schemas and various functions relating to the issuance and verification of credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To act on behalf of an organization, people must have previously established a relationship with the organization, and have had the organization provision them with certain access rights through credential offers.</p>
<p>This means that the person has credentials in their Edge Wallet (or any other AIP compliant wallet) that they must present to Orbit Enterprise to access their organization’s control panel.</p>
<p>Even though the Orbit Enterprise platform verifies the passwordless access credential, we didn’t want to force a connection between NB Orbit platform and mobile holder – hence a connectionless verification is performed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In our previous architecture, we would force a connection between the individual and the platform (NB Orbit) so that the connection-based proof request could happen. We have now changed this process and dropped the forced connection to avoid any federation.</p>
<p>This means that a connection to NB Orbit isn’t necessary for the proof presentation to be verified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2&nbsp; Upgraded Mobile Agent to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ) 
<p>We upgraded our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet agent to Aries Framework JavaScript (AFJ).</p>
<p>We did this to ensure we move towards AIP 2.0 compliance with our mobile agent.</p>
<p>AIP currently has two versions:</p>
 
 AIP 1.0, defines how Aries agents communicate with each other using a single type of verifiable credential, and 
 AIP 2.0, builds on AIP 1.0 including how Aries agents can exchange several types of verifiable credentials, including W3C standard verifiable credentials. 
 
<p>We recently wrote a blog post about <a href="https://northernblock.io/aip-2-interoperability/">the main reasons for which we chose AFJ and what excites us about AIP 2.0</a>.<br>
</p>
 3&nbsp; Upgraded Enterprise Cloud Agent to ACA-Py 0.7.4&nbsp; 
<p>We upgraded our Orbit Enterprise cloud agent to <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/releases">ACA-Py 0.7.4</a>.</p>
<p>We always want to ensure we’re providing the latest agent versions to our customers. This move also gets us to AIP 2.0 compliance on the cloud agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4&nbsp; Added Multi-ledger Support on Enterprise 
<p></p>
<p>We already had existing support for multiple Indy-based ledgers on our Orbit Edge mobile wallet – and we’ve now introduced the same for Orbit Enterprise.</p>
<p>Our enterprise customers can now become credential issuers, holders and verifiers on networks such as NB Orbit TestNet, Sovrin, BCovrin and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5&nbsp; Interoperate with Other SSI Platforms&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>To make our platform as open as possible to interoperate with other SSI platforms, partner organizations (cloud agent and wallets) are free to choose the SSI platform of their choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schema and credential definitions created by partner organizations in other SSI platforms are available on the NB Orbit enterprise App to create credential definitions and generate proof requests.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the added support for multiple ledgers and the enhancements in our B2B invitation process (mentioned in section 7), our customers can have their platform sit independent of any ledger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 6&nbsp; Orbit Enterprise Customization Enhancements 
<p>We have done a lot of upgrades when it comes to the internationalization and localization architecture of our Orbit Enterprise to allow for easier branding and language customization.</p>
<p>For our customers who create new networks and/or wish to onboard subsidiaries or partners on their network, they can now easily brand Orbit Enterprise with their colour schemes, style guides, logos, language, etc.</p>
<p>This is useful for our customers who want their partners to experience their branding rather than NB Orbit branding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 7&nbsp; General Wallet &amp; Platform Upgrades&nbsp; 
<p>There are a few general upgrades that are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>Credential and Connection Management in Orbit Edge Wallet – users can now delete connections and credentials.</p>

<p>Remote onboarding is becoming the new normal, and if your company doesn’t adapt to the new work environment, your company will be left behind.</p>
<p>What is remote onboarding? Remote onboarding is the process of assimilating a new employee into the company and teaching them corporate policies but doing so over technology, whether that be video, phone, or chat.</p>
 Remote Onboarding and Modern Workforces 
<p>A remote workforce is a norm in many industries and job markets rather than the exception. More people work from home than ever before. Many enterprises are learning that supporting a remote workforce, once the right technical infrastructure is in place, can be cost-effective and responsive to modern challenges.</p>
<p>The challenges that arise from such a workforce, however, come in a few critical areas:</p>
 
 Paperwork: Employers must obtain specific employee documentation, including tax forms, waivers, and identification documents. In person, this isn’t a problem, but remote document exchange and verification can prove difficult in many cases. 
 Training: Employees often undergo on-site training with a mentor they shadow throughout the day. With a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/remote-workforce/">remote workforce</a>, making sure your people have the right hands-on training can be tricky. 
 Resources: Outside of hiring paperwork, employees should have the resources they need to do their job, such as documents, records, or tools. They should have access to these resources when they start. 
 
<p>By far, remote onboarding ranks as one of the most challenging aspects of modern business. <a href="https://www.saplinghr.com/10-employee-onboarding-statistics-you-must-know-in-2022">According to a survey from Sapling HR,</a> employees must complete, on average, 54 onboarding activities.</p>
<p>These tasks involve critical document exchanges and administrative tasks, tasks that count toward areas like tax and compliance reporting, payroll and HR documentation, and just basic training for the job.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these tasks will often pertain to security: creating identities for cloud platforms and HR services, signing up for MFA, and onboarding on to any compliant security measures, like identity proofing or document verification.</p>
<p>With that said, it’s critical for enterprises to make remote onboarding easy and effective so that security and efficiency are maintained at every step.</p>
 Remote Onboarding and Security 
<p>Perhaps the most critical part of the onboarding process is worker identification, verification, and security onboarding.</p>
<p>The details of this fact may change depending on the company or industry, but generally speaking, employers are required to confirm worker eligibility and tax documentation. On top of that, any additional security or compliance requirements will invariably include additional authentication steps.</p>
<p>To support remote onboarding, several technologies can come into play:</p>
 
 Document and Identity Verification: An employer expects to have several documents completed during onboarding, including proof of eligibility to work. This includes several steps of identification and verification—prospects that can prove difficult in remote settings. That’s where automated documents and identity verification come into play. 
 
<p>These technologies can help you ensure that a contractor or full-time employee provides accurate and truthful documentation, whether it’s in the form of a driver’s license, passport, or social security card.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these technologies can help enterprises with specific security needs verify identity through images, video chats, and other verification methods.</p>
<p>Finally, self-serve onboarding helps you scale the process without devoting more work hours and technology to it.</p>
 
 Authentication Onboarding: Remote workers will need to access company resources—which means that authentication is critical. HR or the IT department will onboard employees into a multi-factor authentication system by providing credentials, but it’s up to the employee to set up one-time passwords or biometrics from wherever they are at. 
 Liveness Testing and Identity Proofing: Spear and whale phishing are more and more common, with many cases stemming from poor <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/identity-authentication">identity authentication</a> of contractors. Liveness testing can force users to authenticate alongside video confirmation of their presence, while identity proofing can leverage documents and other artifacts to ensure that whoever accesses system resources is who they say they are. 
 
<p>These technologies all refer to specific challenges related to fraud, misidentification, and noncompliance—all of which can be addressed with the right tools and practices.</p>
 What Are Some Best Practices for Onboarding Remote Employees? 
<p>Even with the right technologies, it’s critical for an enterprise to practice strong, secure onboarding for all remote workers and contractors. These practices complement secure technology to provide an organization easy onboarding and to protect company resources.</p>
<p>Some best practices include the following:</p>
 
 Allow Self-Service Onboarding: Depending on your platform, self-service onboarding may be an option. This can include using mobile devices to perform identity proofing and liveness tests, scanning documents for automatic <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/authentication-identity-verification-system/">identity verification</a>, and streamlining authentication credential setup. 
 
<p>With a streamlined onboarding process, you remove the chances that information is lost during communication or that workers will use substandard practices due to the difficulty of the process.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as onboarding technologies improve, verification’s effectiveness, security, and accuracy will just make the process easier.</p>
 
 Assign Dedicated Staff to Onboard: If workers are currently in the onboarding process, ensure that you have a dedicated person assigned to help them. This includes answering questions, directing information to the right people, and ensuring that workers always send information where it should go. 
 
<p>This goes beyond orienting the employee. It helps minimize confusion in setting up critical functions like technology and services and avoids problems that IT would otherwise have to dedicate time to deal with.</p>
 
 Create Easy-to-Follow Task Lists and Expectations: A simple and effective onboarding task list could live in your project management tool. Give access to this list to workers and allow them to work on the items as they will, check items they complete, and communicate via comments or direct messages to streamline the process. 
 Create Community: Remote work can be isolating, and onboarding often serves as the primary way that workers get to know their colleagues. Even if you use remote, self-serve onboarding tools, make sure to create open spaces of communication for new workers through remote events and interactive activities. This can help make those workers feel invited and welcome and reduce levels of isolation that can come from the nature of remote employment. 
 
 Streamline Remote Onboarding with 1Kosmos 
<p>At the heart of onboarding is verification and security, which doesn’t change when workers are remote. Employees must be able to set up secure credentials from wherever they are for a host of services, and employers must have the ability to verify the identities and documentation of those workers.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides a distributed, streamlined, and secure platform to support remote <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/employee-onboarding/">employee onboarding</a>. With advanced self-serve features to ease administrative workloads, you can make onboarding easy for both the employee and your organization. Furthermore, with security standards meeting NIST 800-63-3, IAL2, and FIDO2 certifications, you can guarantee the identity of the worker, the authenticity of their documents, and the security and compliance of your system.</p>
<p>1Kosmos includes the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Identity-Based Authentication Orchestration: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK.

 Mattereum’s “Million Dollar&nbsp;Quartet” <p>As the dust of the latest ‘Crypto Winter’ settles and the panic subsides, the question being asked is ‘What next?’ and it seems the answer that is beginning to condense out of the fog is “connecting physical assets to the blockchain!”. This makes a lot of sense, cryptocurrencies and NFTs as they have been used up to now only have a tenuous connection to the physical world and while for a relatively small group of blockchain fundamentalists this is just fine, for the rest of the world it makes them a niche interest, albeit one that has generated an insane amount of headlines.</p><p>Most physical NFT transactions rely on the truthfulness of the information they are using being baked in already, but what happens when someone is slipping counterfeit items into your supply chain, or is selling things they don’t actually&nbsp;have?</p><p>For the blockchain to achieve the ubiquity it has the potential to, it needs to do something for the real world and make the leap to connecting to the physical. We can see it coming, once <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> was pretty much alone in this space, apart from a few companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/BosonProtocol?s=20&amp;t=IIj1vPuIAFAdvvShGVJP6A">Boson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/4KProtocol?s=20&amp;t=G-Ncks7zWZIBslbyeo0xSw">4K,</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SolidBlockCo?s=20&amp;t=Tjai85B4TtuqJDlK4LIC-Q">Solidblock</a> who may have been inspired by Mattereum’s initial White Paper, but now we can see other start-ups such as <a href="https://twitter.com/LabsAspen?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">Aspen Labs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/stockx?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">StockX</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmericanaNFT?s=20&amp;t=IVjPeJEQcKuVpy57sjDOPg">Americana</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/origin_trail?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">Origin Trail</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rollapp_store?s=20&amp;t=x6Z8D7gJWabOBY12OTORgw">RollApp</a> catching on and doing things like using the blockchain to bring transparency to supply chain management or providing marketplaces for niche products like collectables. While these are all good ideas, they rely on the truthfulness of the information they are using being baked in already, but what happens when someone is slipping counterfeit items into your supply chain, or is selling things they don’t actually have? It all gets a bit messy and expensive as the lawyers get involved and courts have to work out the <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/04/29/nfts-recognised-as-legal-property-in-landmark-case">legal aspects of the blockchain on the fly</a>. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a>, though, nailed down all the legals before ever starting to do anything on the blockchain, so with our Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP) that combines <a href="https://mattereum.com/#:~:text=This%20certification%20legally%20binds%20the,protect%20against%20theft%20or%20fraud.">warranties and NFTs</a> to create the Mattereum Trustable NFT, every transaction comes with a simple and effective legal framework for dealing with any disputes that arise, and it is applicable in over 160 jurisdictions, so there doesn’t need to be costly court cases in every single country to establish the case law for items on the blockchain, it’s just plug and&nbsp;play.</p><p>It has to be said that this kind of thing is something that companies now entering the real world NFT space are only promising for a remote future, so when <a href="https://mattereum.com/">we</a> go out there and say ‘we’ve got this — we can do physical assets connected to the blockchain with all the legals in place and working now’ it’s not entirely surprising that some people think it’s a scam, it’s so far ahead of what anyone else can do. We feel a bit like the Wright brothers; when they first flew, no one believed them; for a year after their first flight the only place you could read about it was in a <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/wright-brothers/online/artifactgallery/?id=5747">beekeeping journal </a>because the editor went to Kittyhawk to see them fly with his own eyes, while other journalists dismissed it as impossible out of hand. We have not been featured in beekeeping journals, but we do have the equivalent — clients who have been willing to look at what<a href="https://mattereum.com/explore/"> Mattereum</a> do for themselves and bring their physical objects to the blockchain through the <a href="https://mattereum.com/#:~:text=This%20certification%20legally%20binds%20the,protect%20against%20theft%20or%20fraud.">Mattereum system</a></p><p>We started with things like Star Trek collectables, which are a lot of fun, but now <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> has stepped up to a new level, with its “Million Dollar Quartet”&nbsp;.</p><p>OK, we haven’t got Elvis and Johnny Cash back from the dead (Jim Morrison, though…well, watch this space), but what we do have is serious clients willing to bring physical assets worth a million dollars or more to the table and put them on the blockchain through the Mattereum system, allowing these high value items to to be bought and sold as Trustable NFTs at the click of a button. Our Million Dollar Quartet features:</p>  Real Estate — <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1bOGR7knhhS9dMNxmyjCxZDw1Fo_2fnp5xkgMBi_gBzc/edit">West London Lets</a> have a £1.6million plot of land for sale as a Mattereum Trustable NFT. You know what a pain it is to buy and sell houses and land using the current system, but with <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> all that paperwork can be rolled up and put into a MAP to make the deal a simple blockchain transaction. We are doing this now and expect to do many more real estate deals in the&nbsp;future.  <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/05/26/lohko-and-mattereum-launch-groundbreaking-verifiable-gold-bullion-nfts/">Gold Bars</a> — We have gold bars available as Trustable NFTs with our partners Lohko. These remain vaulted at an internationally renowned gold vault while the ownership can be bought and sold to anyone anywhere in the world via an NFT, with title to the gold legally enforceable. If you really want, you can actually go to the vault and take out your gold bar using your NFT as proof of ownership.  <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220624005079/en/IG-Wines-Partners-With-Tech-Firm-Mattereum-to-Disrupt-Fine-Wine-and-Whisky-Trading-on-the-Blockchain">Fine Wines and Whisky</a> — through our partnership with IG Wines we have investment grade wines and shares in barrels of whisky that are together worth over £1million available. The wines remain in their cellars and the whiskies in their vaults, while the investment in them can be bought and sold as Mattereum Trustable NFTs (unless you want to claim the bottles and drink them!). We hope to bring more wine and whisky companies to the blockchain very&nbsp;shortly.  <a href="https://mattereum.com/2022/02/24/real-world-asset-nft-auction-for-million-dollar-trumpet-goes-live/">Historic instruments</a> — Mattereum have an incredible Stradivarius family violin created by Giuseppe Guarneri, valued at $1.6million available as a Trustable NFT through our <a href="https://matterfine.art/">Matterfine </a>partnership with renowned luthier Robert Brewer Young and have already sold a more modern treasured instrument, DJ<a href="https://mattereum.com/explore/"> Timmy Trumpet’s custom trumpet</a>, valued at $1million. These instruments are vaulted too, although with Mattereum’s system it is possible to have warranties that could require them to be played a certain number of times a year by specific kinds of performer, setting out the exact terms and conditions under which they could be unvaulted for that&nbsp;purpose.  <p>One of the prominent advantages of the Quartet is stability. These aren’t stable in the way that stablecoins were meant to be stable <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/07/11/cryptocurrencies-pose-financial-risk-ecb-report-defi-stablecoins-contagion/">(until they weren’t</a>), by being pegged to a currency or asset, they are stable in the way that actually owning the gold bar or a bottle of investment-grade wine is stable, because that is what you are doing. Owning a Mattereum Trustable NFT bound to a gold bar means you actually own that gold bar, the value of the NFT is the value of the gold bar, and that is the very definition of stable. Owning one of the Quartet NFTs insulates you from the fluctuations of the Crypto world, because their value is the value of the real world asset they connect you to, but they still give you the convenience of trading them as&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Owning a Mattereum Trustable NFT bound to a gold bar means you actually own that gold bar, the value of the NFT is the value of the gold bar, and that is the very definition of&nbsp;stable.</p><p>This Million Dollar Quartet is just the start; our system is not tied to any specific asset class and can be used to bring literally anything to the blockchain.

If the artist enjoyed sufficient status, the originals were very likely crated away in some vault, where no one saw them at all.

<p>We are pleased to announce that Dock is now an Associate Member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> (DIF). The Decentralized Identity Foundation is an engineering-driven organization that represents a diverse, international collection of organizations and contributors working together to establish an open ecosystem of decentralized identity that is accessible to all.</p><p>As a decentralized identity management platform that complies with internationally-recognized technology standards, we are continuously keeping up to date with key discussions and updates in the industry which is why we joined the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p> What Is Decentralized Identity? <p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/decentralized-identity/">Decentralized identity</a> is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider. The term “decentralized identity” is often used interchangeably with “Self-Sovereign Identity” (SSI). </p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity has 3 main pillars: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information. A blockchain is designed in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Globally unique identifiers made up of a string of letters and numbers that are generated and completely owned by the user.  <a href="https://blog.dock.io/verifiable-credentials/">Verifiable Credentials</a> (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of paper and digital credentials that people can show to verifiers to prove claims about themselves.  The 3 pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are Verifiable Credentials, blockchain, and decentralized identifiers The Importance of Decentralized Identity Standards <p>DIF is continuously working to get global standards in place for decentralized identity technology so stakeholders can use similar standards for future interoperability. Interoperability is the ability of different systems, devices, applications, or products to connect and communicate in a coordinated way without effort from the user. </p><p>Right now, a big challenge with blockchains and Self-Sovereign Identity technology is that many systems are not interoperable. Having a standard practice of how we build decentralized solutions is extremely beneficial for individuals and organizations because it means that they don’t get locked into limited solutions. They can move in and out of platforms as they please because the technology has been built in the same way. </p><p>For example, let’s say there are two <a href="https://www.dock.io/">decentralized digital credential companies</a> that both offer a platform to create DIDs and issue Verifiable Credentials. If they both follow the same DID and VC standard, a user could conveniently transfer their data from one company to another and everything would just work because both platforms are interoperable. In other words, someone could take their Verifiable Credentials from Company A’s wallet and transfer it to Company B’s wallet. A lot of work needs to be done for the industry to get to this level of interoperability, but that is what organizations like the Decentralized Identity Foundation are working towards. &nbsp;</p><p>To give an example, if someone built an app that integrates a decentralized identity wallet on one blockchain, they couldn’t just take that app and transfer it to another network for the app to work. The major problem is being able to look up DIDs on different platforms. For example, Dock DIDs can’t be resolved in an app that is only supporting did:sov or did:ion. To support interoperability, they would have to implement a Dock DID resolver that must be able to get the DID document from wherever it is stored, which could be on a blockchain, the DID key or some other storage. Basically, the resolver retrieves the public keys. </p><p>Right now, there are also no widely accepted wallet specifications, but people are still working on it. Dock is currently using this <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/">W3C wallet specification</a>. </p><p>To give another example of the importance of interoperability, think about how Wi-Fi and bluetooth work. No matter what country you’re in and regardless of the differences in laws, culture, and government structures, Wi-Fi and bluetooth work everywhere. It’s because the technology is implemented the same way anywhere in the world. </p><p>Bluetooth works using short-range radio waves and will work anywhere you have two compatible devices. You don't need any data plan or even a cellular connection. Wi-Fi revolutionized how data is transferred as it connects devices to send data over the air. </p><p>Similarly, with <a href="https://www.dock.io/technology">decentralized identity technology</a>, as we move towards developing global standards that more stakeholders adopt, the more benefits there will be for people and organizations. Having standards will improve the user experience as people can securely take their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials anywhere with their phone with a digital identity wallet. Interoperability will allow people to move platforms conveniently as they please. </p><p>For organizations, having standards will make it easier to efficiently issue, manage, and verify credentials. Decentralized identity technology can drastically reduce costs and resources compared to traditional, manual verification, management, and issuance processes.</p><p>Dock’s decentralized digital credentials technology complies with World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which provides a standard to express credentials on the web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy-respecting, and machine-verifiable. W3C is an international community where member organizations, full-time staff, and the public work to set international standards for the World Wide Web. The organization also created standards for Decentralized Identifiers, URL, and others.</p> Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) <p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation was founded in 2018 to support the emergence of an ecosystem of technologies around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaYYQLDnS6s&amp;t=51s">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs). DIDs are globally unique identifiers made up of a string of letters and numbers that enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. Unlike user names, passwords, emails, and other centralized identifiers that people use to sign into websites and apps, DIDs allow people to authenticate their identity securely while fully owning and controlling their digital identity. </p><p>Here is an example of a Dock DID:</p>A DID is made up of a string of letters and numbers that allow people to authenticate their identity securely.<p>An individual or organization can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. DIDs are like different personas that people can create. For example, someone may want to use a DID just for online shopping and use another DID for professional purposes like showing their educational credentials like their degree or program certificates.</p>People can create as many DIDs as they want for different purposes like a DID for professional purposes or a DID for online shopping. How the Decentralized Identity Foundation Works <p>DIF is committed to working across the ecosystem with organizations while trying to get companies to work together to develop open source and standards to shape the future of decentralized identity. There are a variety of working groups focused on specific projects such as security or DIDComm, a cross-community effort to standardize common DID-anchored capabilities.</p> Decentralized Identity Foundation Groups <p>The main terminology used to organize DIF are working groups, special interest groups, and open groups. Many groups can be working on a few projects at the same time such as advancing specifications and code. An organization has to be a member of the group in order to contribute to the work item. Members often contribute to DIF groups that relate to research and projects that they are working on as an organization.</p><p>Working groups</p>  Standing long term groups like DID Authentication, Identifiers and Discovery, and Claims and Credentials  Scoped by functional areas and designed to drive emerging standard specifications backed up by open source code  <p>Open groups</p>  Lower barrier for membership entry because people don’t have to waive patents to participate  Non-patent relevant deliverables are produced   Examples of DIF Working Groups   <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html">Authentication Working Group</a>: Design, recommend, and implement authentication and authorization protocols (a set of rules or procedures for transmitting data between electronic devices) that rely on open standards and cryptographic protocols using DIDs and DID Documents. &nbsp;<br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims &amp; Credentials</a>: Defining the specs, protocols, and tools to help ecosystem participants and their customers easily integrate DID-signed claims into their apps and services. &nbsp;<br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html">DID communication</a>: Produce one or more high-quality specs that embody a method (“DIDComm”) for secure, private and (where applicable) authenticated message-based communication. <br>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/wallet-security.html">Wallet security</a>: Define a common terminology for understanding the security requirements applicable to wallet architectures as well as wallet-to-wallet and wallet-to-issuer/verifier protocols. This group also works to produce guidelines on how to classify and specify the security capabilities of Verifiable Credential wallets such as key management, credential storage, backup, and the portability of wallets.   Conclusion <p>As an Associate Member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation, Dock will continuously be engaged with key developments in the decentralized identity space. The organization has a variety of working groups to solve diverse problems. </p><p>DIF is continuously working to get global standards in place for decentralized identity technology so stakeholders can use similar standards for future interoperability. Interoperability between decentralized identity platforms is very important as it will allow people to conveniently move their digital identity and Verifiable Credentials between platforms and enable companies to grow their network usage if developers have the option to move their applications from one platform to another. <br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

				<p>Making self-sovereign identity (SSI) more adoptable has always been our North Star at Trinsic. It was in 2019 when we made SSI accessible to the everyday developer through an API. And it was when we <a href="https://trinsic.id/introducing-trinsic-ecosystems/">announced</a> Trinsic Ecosystems, a product that enables developers to implement SSI within entire ecosystems, networks, or marketplaces at enterprise-level scale and performance.</p><p><br>Driven by our motivation to make SSI more adoptable, we built the world’s first turn-key, open source trust registry solution. This work was sponsored by the <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab</a> (eSSIF-Lab), which is an EU consortium that provides funding for projects that build SSI open source tools. Any ecosystem provider can use the trust registry implementation to enable governance in their verifiable data ecosystem.</p><p><br>Below, we dive more into the what and why of trust registries, what we delivered to eSSIF-Lab, and how it all relates to SSI adoption.</p>

				<p>Imagine a scenario where a person is trying to open a bank account with an online bank. To open the account, the bank must verify the person’s identity. This is done by asking to see an identification credential, like a driver’s license. How can the bank trust that the driver’s license came from an authorized issuer and is not fake? The bank could keep and maintain a list of all the DMV office issuers, but that would be impractical. Additionally, how does the prospective bank member trust the bank is only asking for the information that it is authorized to ask for and is not a bad actor?</p><p><br>The scenario above can be boiled down into two questions:<br><br></p>  How does a credential verifier know that the issuer of the credential is trustworthy?  How does a credential holder know that a verifier is trustworthy?  <p><br>To answer the questions above, governance must be established in a verifiable data ecosystem, and trust registries make that possible.</p>

				<p>A <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-is-a-trust-registry/">trust registry</a> is a list of approved issuers and verifiers within an ecosystem and the types of credentials they are authorized to issue and verify. Trust registries are basically a way of saying, “yes, these issuers can issue these credentials (these schemas)” and “yes, these verifiers have the authority to verify that credential” in an ecosystem. Trust registries are created and maintained by a governing entity (or entity groups), which at Trinsic is called an ecosystem provider.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					An ecosystem’s provider creates and maintains the trust registry.
										
								 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the banking example above, instead of the bank having to maintain its own list of hundreds of authorized issuers of driver’s licenses, the bank would only need to trust one DMV trust registry which the ecosystem provider would maintain. If the issuer of the credential is not listed in the trust registry, the verification will not be successful. Similarly, the trust registry would provide the prospective bank member the assurance that the bank is an authorized verifier and is only asking for the information it is authorized to verify.<br><br></p><p>Here is an example of how a trust registry can be expressed in the ‘issuer’ field in a verifiable credential:</p>

				<p>Trinsic was sponsored by eSSIF-Lab to create an open source trust registry solution that integrates with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a>.<br><br></p><p>This was delivered in the form of:<br><br></p>  Application Service  Infrastructure and deployment  Reference implementations  <p><br>We based the solution on the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> Foundation <a href="https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-trust-registry-tf">specification</a> for interoperable trust registries. Because of this, the trust registry implementation we built is architected so that one ecosystem could reference or incorporate a trust registry from a separate ecosystem if needed.</p><p><br>The solution is open source and ready-to-build, so anyone can start using it today to add governance regulation into their ecosystem. To get started and to see the trust registry in action, visit the project’s <a href="https://gitlab.grnet.gr/essif-lab/infrastructure_3/trinsic/trust-reg">GitLab page</a>.</p>

				<p>Trinsic applied to work on this trust registry project with eSSIF-Lab (and luckily got selected!) because we believe that solving governance in verifiable credential ecosystems is crucial for SSI adoption. Without governance, anyone in an ecosystem would be able to issue or verify credentials even if they didn’t have the authority to do so, discrediting the data exchanged within the ecosystem. Trust registries are one way to solve this problem, and we are committed to continue working with the community as other governance solutions are identified.</p><p><br>At this time, the two main community efforts that tackle the problem of verifiable data governance are:<br><br></p>  <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Trust+Registry+Protocol+Specification">Trust Registry Protocol Specification</a>: Incubated at the Trust over IP Foundation, this is the specification that our implementation is based on.  <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">Trust Establishment</a>: Incubated at the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, this is an early stage effort to standardize trust establishment by providing ‘trust lists’ of authorized issuers and verifiers. It is conceptually and functionally almost identical to trust registries.

<p>Web3 decentralized applications (dapps) are in many ways superior to Web2 services. DIDsign, the digital signature service built on KILT, is a sign of what corporates and consumers can expect in a Web3&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a> provides a way to sign any digital file directly in your browser. The DIDsign signature is uniquely linked to the person signing as it is based around an industry-standard decentralized identifier (DID). This is a string of numbers and letters that forms a “digital fingerprint”, allowing users to build a digital identity by adding <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">credentials</a>, a unique <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/introducing-web3name-your-unique-digital-name-for-web3-the-internet-of-the-future-c301a18f75e8">web3name</a> and any other <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/looking-forward-web3name-7af74469043b">information they wish to make&nbsp;public</a>.</p><p>DIDsign offers several advantages over similar Web2 services:</p> Privacy <p>Web2 signing services require the user to upload the documents they want to sign to a server. With DIDsign, files remain under the user’s control on their&nbsp;device.</p><p>The user opens the DIDsign website on their computer and adds the file/s they wish to sign either using the drag &amp; drop function or by selecting from their files. They then sign via their Sporran wallet, a browser extension on their device. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of their signature. Once they have signed, they need to save the signed files and signature (usually as a zipfile) to their device. When the browser is closed, all data is deleted. That means the user’s data is never transferred or monetized.</p><p>Web2 signing services require registering with the service, giving personal details such as name, email address, etc. DIDsign requires no sign in or user&nbsp;details.</p><p>To sign via DIDsign, the user enters their password in their private Sporran wallet when prompted — DIDsign doesn’t need to know anything about them. The recipient also doesn’t need to provide any identifying details: they simply add the signed file into the Verify area on the<a href="https://didsign.io/verifier"> DIDsign website</a> to validate the signature.</p> Security <p>Web2 signing services check only the email of the person signing, which can be hacked. DIDsign allows the signer to add additional verified credentials to their signature, which show their email, social media handles, GitHub account, etc., in both private and public&nbsp;formats.</p><p>These credentials can be generated and verified for free via another Web3 dapp created by BTE, SocialKYC, and are stored privately in their Sporran wallet. The user can choose to make their credentials public via a service endpoint, or can selectively choose to add any or part of them to their signature as extra identity verification. They may also add a unique web3name to their DID. When the recipient checks the signed file in the DIDsign verifier tab, they can see this additional verification.</p><p>Any change to any of the files will invalidate the signature, so the recipient can be sure that the files they receive have not been tampered with. If the files match the signature and have not been changed since they were signed, the signature shows a green check mark next to each file, and next to “Verification” under the list of files. If any of the content of the files have been altered, or if the signature wasn’t included in the zip file, verification will&nbsp;fail.</p> Flexibility <p>Web2 signing services are limited to certain data types (PDF, etc.). DIDsign allows the user to sign any kind of digital&nbsp;file.</p><p>DIDsign allows signing text, image, video, audio, or software files. These may be signed individually, or combined in one&nbsp;file.</p><p>Web2 signing services require signed files to be sent by email only. DIDsign allows sending the signed file by a variety of communication methods.</p><p>The file can be shared via the user’s preferred method (email, Telegram, WhatsApp, via memory stick,&nbsp;etc.).</p> Cost Efficiency <p>Web2 signing services require the initiator to pay. DIDsign is free to use, both for those signing and for those verifying the signature.</p><p>Signing with DIDsign requires the user to pay a once-off deposit and a small transaction fee for their on-chain DID. Currently, deposits and fees in DIDsign are paid in KILT tokens, but the option to pay with fiat (for instance, euro or dollar) will be available soon, making enterprise adoption even easier. Once users have their on-chain DID, they can sign as often as they like (and receive the deposit back if they don’t need the DID any more). Verifying a signed file is always free — the recipient just drops the file into the Verify area on the DIDsign&nbsp;website.</p> Trustless Timestamps <p>With Web2 signing services that offer timestamps, the time of signing is centrally stored by the service or marked on the document. Timestamps with DIDsign are “trustless” as they are recorded on the decentralized KILT blockchain.</p><p>Once the file has been signed, DIDsign offers the option to <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign_Timestamp.pdf">add a timestamp</a>. This is added to the KILT blockchain as a permanent record via the user’s cryptographically-protected Sporran&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>When verified via the DIDsign website, the signed file shows the date and time (local and UTC). Note, because it’s written to the blockchain, it requires a small transaction fee (around 0.004 KILT), and the timestamp is the time it was recorded to the blockchain.</p><p>To reiterate: the user’s data is never saved — instead, a unique hash (a series of letters and numbers) representing the user’s data is written on the KILT blockchain.</p> DIDsign in the Real&nbsp;World <p>Along with individual use, DIDsign can be used on a large scale by institutions such as hospitals, governments or banks, allowing staff to sign, timestamp and send reports. Any fees required for deposits or transactions that require payment can be paid by the institution.</p><p>DIDsign also allows several people to sign the same document separately and confirm that it was signed. For example if a contract needs to be approved by several parties, each party can sign it and send their signature to the others. The document can then be checked against each signature, showing that each party signed the document in its original&nbsp;form.</p><p>See more about how it works in the <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How-to_Guide_DIDsign.pdf">DIDsign How-to&nbsp;guide</a>.</p> Enabling Web3 <p>DIDsign was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE). BTE is a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized identity blockchain protocol with a mission to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. DIDsign is another step towards achieving this.</p><p>We are only at the beginning of mainstream adoption of decentralized blockchain-enabled applications, but already there are several Web3 dapps “built on KILT” that are available and ready to be used. Try them for yourself now and start building your own decentralized digital identity, under your&nbsp;control.</p><p>Even if you have no blockchain experience or KILT tokens, you can set up a Sporran and create credentials for free.

  Holistic Screening provides new capabilities such as multi-asset screening, cross-asset tracing and cross-chain tracing&nbsp; - revealing risk that first-generation blockchain analytics cannot detect.<br><br>  
  Holistic Screening is powered by Nexus, Elliptic’s new blockchain analytics engine, which allows complex, manual cross-chain investigations to be replaced by API calls and automated risk-scoring - driving greater efficiency within compliance teams.  
  
  
  
  
<p>Elliptic pioneered crypto compliance in 2015, with the launch of Elliptic AML, the world’s first Bitcoin transaction screening tool. It eliminated the complexities of blockchain analytics by providing compliance professionals with a single, actionable risk score. Since then we have expanded our offering, providing a comprehensive suite of crypto compliance solutions with the broadest coverage of cryptoassets and blockchains available on the market.</p>

				  Recognized in Digital Safety, Governance, and Privacy Category for Disruptive Technology Leadership  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Indicio</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the market leader in developing Trusted Digital Ecosystems to verify and exchange high-value information, has been named a finalist in the 12th annual <a href="https://www.constellationr.com/events/supernova/2022">SuperNova Awards.</a> Hosted by Silicon Valley research and advisory firm Constellation, the SuperNova Awards “recognize individuals and teams who are prioritizing disruptive technology and transforming their organizations with digital initiatives.” Indicio was chosen as a finalist in the Digital Safety, Governance, and Privacy Category.</p>
<p>Indicio is being recognized for the company’s ground-breaking work with SITA, the world leading provider of IT to the air transport industry, and the government of Aruba. Together they developed a complete Trusted Digital Ecosystem for using decentralized identity and verifiable digital credentials to create a seamless travel system for visitors to the island. This enabled people to share their personal health data — in this case, Covid-19 testing and vaccination — in a privacy-preserving way. </p>
<p>“Savvy digital leaders from all industries have made the move from digital channels to digital business models. Despite a high level of uncertainty, rampant inflation, rising interest rates, uncertain inventory and a massive labor shortage, this year’s SuperNova Award winners have made a significant impact to their businesses,” said R “Ray” Wang, founder and CEO of Constellation Research. “The lessons learned from these organizations provide a strong template and great inspiration for other leaders looking to pave the way in their organizations.”</p>
<p>“This technology lays the foundation for being able to authenticate and share any kind digital data in an immediately actionable way — it’s the verification layer that’s missing from the internet and it comes with a meaningful, powerful ability to deliver personal privacy,”said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “Obviously, both the Aruban government and SITA saw how this could solve the challenge of reopening tourism safely during a pandemic: The technology eliminated fraud and it solved the tricky problem of sharing private health data by removing the need for a direct integration with a person’s health provider or a third party. But they also saw how this solution could transform how we travel, how we work, and, ultimately, how we live in a post-pandemic world. They were visionaries in an incredibly tough time for the tourism and travel sectors — and just as we are honored to be nominated for this award, we honor them for giving us the opportunity to realize their vision.”&nbsp; </p>
<p>Matthys Serfontein, SITA President, Americas, said: “We need to open up the world of travel, safely and securely, by moving ahead in terms of digital credentials to automate and simplify the passenger experience. Working with Indicio, the trial with Aruba is a huge step in showing we can achieve digital travel, making the journey convenient, safe and stress-free for passengers, while at the same time saving airlines and governments considerable valuable time in verifying credentials.”</p>
<p>Indicio is now working with the Aruban government and SITA to pilot an implementation of the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) Digital Travel Credential (DTC), which would create seamless travel for US citizens to Aruba. ICAO is the UN Agency responsible for global air transport standards. In addition, the SITA and Indicio, contributed the custom healthcare elements of the open source codebase used in Aruba <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH) where, in 2021, it became the <a href="https://cardea.app/">Cardea</a> project, a complete open-source code repository for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital health credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“If data can be reliably authenticated without having to check in with its source or cross-check with a third party then that data can be immediately actionable in any kind of context. It’s no longer constrained by the traditional, siloed architecture of the internet,” said Dahl. “And if that data can be shared in ways that allow consent, protect privacy, and deliver security, then that data can be trusted. We say what we’re doing is building Trusted Digital Ecosystems, but that’s a shorthand for rewriting the structure of the internet, the web, digital interaction, and digital relationships. Imagine data being able to instantly prove it is what it says it is and where it came from. That’s a new kind of digital freedom — an open digital landscape that benefits everyone and creates new opportunities.”</p>
<p>In addition to the travel and health sectors, Indicio is building Trusted Digital Ecosystems for climate auditing, for connected devices, for fintech, the metaverse, and supply chains — each a case where identity and data need to be proven in a privacy-preserving way. All of these solutions draw on Indicio’s leadership in the open source community for innovative solutions, and benefit from Indicio’s business experience and field-leading technical expertise.</p>
<p>The 2022 SuperNova Award judges, composed of technology thought-leaders and journalists, selected finalists who demonstrated success in implementing cutting-edge business models and emerging technologies for their organizations. Finalists achieved remarkable results, including competitive advantage, cost savings and quantifiable improvements in agility.</p>
<p>Public voting for the SuperNova Awards will take place online from August 8 – September 2, 2022. The winners will be announced at the SuperNova Awards Gala on October 26 in Half Moon Bay, California, during Constellation’s Connected Enterprise.</p>

As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Huobi Research released the latest survey report “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”. It mentioned: Web3 middleware, including decentralized identity (DID), reputation systems, node services, databases, and Oracles, will solve the problems related to the inability of blockchains to be implemented, and become the “protagonists” of the next round of ecological explosion. It introduced ONT ID, ONTO Wallet, OScore, and believed that these products can promote the prosperity and development of the Web3 ecosystem.  Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to participate in the interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6EEMswsxwg">Benzinga Crypto</a>, a well-known YouTube channel, talking about self-sovereign identity, its opportunities and potential pitfalls, and sharing the suite of decentralized identity products that Ontology has developed.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Huobi Research — “<a href="https://research.huobi.com/#/ArticleDetails?id=295">Web3 middleware: The bet on infrastructures to accelerate Web3</a>”</p><p>“The middleware playbook could be the long term goal for crypto gem hunting. Despite the six years of blockchain development along the likes of decentralized infrastructure and GameFi, there remains roadblocks that hinder blockchain utility. The solution lies with middleware. Middleware connects users, institutions, developers and real world off-chain data all together with different dAPPs. Connecting the world to Web3, users possess decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to prove their identities in metaverse games.”</p><p>Mass adoption of Web3 requires infrastructure that removes barriers to development. DID forms a key part of that infrastructure and Ontology has created a suite of protocols around ONT ID to make development as easy as possible. With a single ONT ID in ONTO, users can control their on-chain assets, manage their identity data, and access various dApps and the wider Web3 ecosystem.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-august-1-8-2022-c4dbdb680a28">Ontology Weekly Report (August 1–8, 2022)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">Trend Report: Identity Fraud 2022</a> – IDnow’s annual report into the challenges and trends from the seedy underworld of identity fraud – is out now, and ready to be downloaded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As everyone’s online presence continues to increase, along with their reliance on digital services, identity fraud has never been a more pressing concern, for consumers and for businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/02/new-data-shows-ftc-received-28-million-fraud-reports-consumers-2021-0">Federal Trade Commission</a> reveals a 70% increase in fraud losses (US$5.8 billion) in 2021 compared to the previous year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation in Europe fared no better, with the British public exposed to several Covid-related identity fraud scams involving <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/nhs-covid-test-scam-exposed-aQBcr0c6Q374">fake PCR tests and vaccine passes</a> throughout the year. Meanwhile, in Germany, financial supervisory authority, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin</a> identified an increasing number of cases involving <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Fachartikel/2022/fa_bj_2204_vorsicht_betrug_en.html">fake job offers</a>, where ‘recruited employees’ were asked to open bank accounts for test purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud has become digital, behind a screen and remote; the work of fraudsters has been greatly facilitated through advanced technology. It is no longer necessary to physically fabricate fake documents, as the resources needed for digital usurpation, such as photos or videos of identity documents, or stolen official documents, are available and accessible with a few clicks on the Dark Web.</p> Lovro Persen, Director Document &amp; Fraud at IDnow Group </blockquote>



<p>“To prevent these frauds, the requirements for remote identity verification need to be further harmonized and standardized on an institutional level, for example European Telecommunications Standards Institute, across Europe. This will allow identification verification (IDV) providers such as the IDnow Group to leverage state-of-the-art IDV technology combined with the expertise of fraud experts,” Persen added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Download the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">Trend Report: Identity Fraud 2022</a> to learn all about the newest fraud and identity theft trends, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam/">army romance scams</a>. Thankfully, the report also contains invaluable information on how, using high assurance verification solutions, organizations can protect the identity of their customers, thereby preventing fraud, whatever the industry, whether finance, insurance, mobility, gaming, esports, travel, or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/trend-report-identity-fraud-2022/">crypto</a>.&nbsp;Check out the report today to discover the benefits of IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, which offers seamless online identification via expert-assisted video chat.  </p>

 by Li Jun, Founder of&nbsp;Ontology Image Credit: Yuichiro Chino/Getty<p>Every time we unlock our phones or open our laptops, we are prompted to enter passwords, codes and captchas to access our data held in servers far away. Within our increasingly interconnected world, everything relies on our identity. For this reason, we are always asked to verify who we really are — both in the physical world and on the web. Traditionally, we do this by typing in passwords online or flashing our passports and licenses to government officials. We surrender our personal information in exchange for services and permission to do certain activities, online and&nbsp;offline.</p><p>Web2 has forced us to accept that the cost of using so-called “free” services such as Google and Facebook comes at the expense of exposing our identity. Once we agree to the privacy policies of websites, our data gets stored in centralized centers owned by a handful of institutions.</p><p>Most of us accept that giving these companies access to our identity is preferable to not having access to the majority of the internet. This means not being able to access social media sites like Facebook and Instagram, book concerts and events online at Ticketmaster and Eventbrite, make travel plans on TripAdvisor and Booking.com, or shop online through Amazon and eBay. Especially in our web-reliant world, this would heavily limit services we can access — or at least make our lives inconvenient.</p><p>Although we have become all too aware of the inherent risk of storing information in a centralized data storage system, the majority of us have simply accepted the fact that our data could be (and has been) compromised at any given time. Moreover, despite legislative breakthroughs such as <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/05/25/gdpr-4th-anniversary/">GDPR</a> in Europe and CCPA in the U.S., it could be argued that globally we have become increasingly flippant about <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/13/report-multiple-data-breaches-common-in-past-year/">data breaches</a> because such news is so constant; it merely exists as a buzz in the background.</p> Web3 and decentralization — what it means for&nbsp;you <p>Now, imagine not having to log in every single time you move between different apps and platforms. Imagine not checking your phone for two-factor authentication. Imagine not worrying about the inevitability of a data breach. As we move from Web2 to Web3, decentralized identity solutions provide a gateway for a seamless experience where users can easily and safely traverse between different platforms.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/03/22/the-state-of-data-in-2022-decentralization/">decentralization</a> is a core tenet of Web3 technology. Decentralization provides users with ownership, access and control of their own data without relying on Big Tech intermediaries.</p><p>This concept of decentralization can also be applied to how identity is stored and verified. Instead of relying on third-party servers, users have complete control over their personal information stored only in their&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>Digital wallets built on blockchain technology provide a secure way to upload verified information confirmed by trusted authorities on your device without relying on third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Besides being encrypted securely on blockchain, additional information about the user is not relayed to others when proving something is true — a concept known as zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). With such technology and security, users will be able to access goods and services in the click of a button that previously required stacks of paperwork.</p><p>Determining your eligibility for a loan or a mortgage will be made easier through seamless verification of your credit history and proof of employment stored in your digital wallet. Getting reimbursed by insurance providers will be made simple through digital receipts and medical records. Applying for college will be made faster with your education history and extracurricular achievements stored in your digital wallet. These are tangible, real-life use cases that will deliver more efficient and effective processes.</p> Bringing trust back to the internet by eliminating bots <p>Not only will the concept of decentralized identity make the user experience of Web3 streamlined, it will also make it a more authentic place. In a Web3 world, fake, spam and bot accounts could be confined to the past. At least, they may decrease if sites require their users to authenticate themselves using the information attached to their digital wallets to prove their identity.</p><p>This might lower cybercrimes and other serious issues online such as catfishing, financial scams and intentionally spreading misinformation, among other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Although the industry is making history and taking strides in creating Web3, there are still issues the industry has not quite yet figured out. We must be realistic and acknowledge the ample room for improvement that exists when addressing ethical challenges and the lack of regulatory frameworks, among many others. Trailblazers of Web3 and its users should be consulted by lawmakers and lobbyists to create laws applicable on Web3 and in the <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2022/04/24/the-metaverse-is-a-transformational-opportunity-for-the-business-world/">metaverse</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, the possibilities for Web3 are endless. The convergence of the physical world and Web3 would create an immersive virtual-reality experience supported by decentralized identity. Decentralized identities could make our digital and physical world much safer and more convenient, providing an immersive space for all, free from the negative externalities presented by big tech&nbsp;giants.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/decentralized-identity-may-be-critical-for-the-success-of-web3-b7eb704feb5f">Decentralized identity may be critical for the success of Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Check out our previous update here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-21/">  Spruce Developer Update #21  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s some of the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p> Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> Sign-In with Ethereum  <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p>  We've released v<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/releases/tag/v2.0.5-beta">2.0.5</a> of our Sign-In with Ethereum TypeScript library which includes checks for code smells and backwards compatibility with legacy versions of the library in order to make the switch even easier. Using <code>validate()</code> will now throw a warning, prompting developers to make the upgrade from <code>validate</code> to <code>verify</code>. &nbsp;   We've specified and implemented <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/capgrok">capgrok</a>, or wallet-signable messages with capability delegations that are human- and machine-readable based on Sign-In with Ethereum. There will be an accompanying EIP related to this work drafted soon. &nbsp;  We've finished work with a major wallet on a direct Sign-In with Ethereum integration, which should be announced soon. Additionally, we're finalizing work on how users can Sign-In with Ethereum on behalf of multisig wallets.   Most of our efforts are currently focused on a product that will make working with Sign-In with Ethereum even easier for developers. Additionally, this initiative will also include enhancements to existing applications, and additional information on user interactions.

<p>The global internet revolution was always considered to be an outcome of perpetual innovations. From Web1 to Web3, the way web and computer systems have evolved in the last two decades has set an unprecedented example of changing functionalities, communication protocols, interactivity, and user experience. There was a time when people were staring at a few static pages on a computer screen, and now they are having a real-life experience with a VR headset entering a Metaverse to shop for their favorite NFTs. Web3 is the third generation of the World Wide Web that is open-source and supported by decentralized networks using blockchain. What started as a military operation and what it has transformed into are completely different. </p><p>Did the internet start as a military operation?</p><p>Let’s start by learning how the whole global web revolution started and what initially it stood for.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  The Invention of the Internet <p>The current revolution of decentralizing the web roots back to the time of when and how the internet was invented. The story of the origins of the internet goes back to the 1950s when the cold war with the Soviet Union was at its peak and both the superpowers possessed deadly nuclear weapons. US’s defense department funded research called Advanced Research Projects Agency (Arpa). In 1969, Arpa created an immobile wired data communication system that was centralized and hence, could be easily disabled by a fragile attack. The whole of Arpanet’s infrastructure evolved into a decentralized system of many computers (with no central command station) distributed across the country. These computers can easily communicate with each other wirelessly. </p><p>A distributed set of computers communicating with each other? </p><p>Have we heard this in the definitions of blockchain?<br></p><p>In 1974, Robert Kahn and Vint Cerf, two Arpanet researchers solved the biggest problem of that time of making two networks communicate with each other. This solution was a set of guidelines that led to the emergence of ‘internetworking’ and with their invention, we saw TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol presented before the world for the very first time.</p> Web1: Read-only <p>Fast forward 15 years to the year 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berner Lee researching at ​​the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN, created a protocol that could link hypertext documents into an information system. By October of 1990, Tim wrote 3 fundamental technologies that constitute the web even today - HTML (HyperText Markup Language), URI (Uniform Resource Identifier), and HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).</p><p>After this, Tim wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”), and right here, the World Wide Web (WWW) was invented. By the end of 1990, the first web page was presented and visible to the world.</p><p>*Important - The Internet and World Wide Web are often mistaken for each other. The World Wide Web is a way of accessing information using the internet and the internet is the networking infrastructure between nodes or computers. </p><p>Source - <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/</a> <br></p><p>From 1991, the whole revolution of the internet to be used by anyone across the world started to grow like wildfire. In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international community devoted to developing open web standards.</p><p>New web browsers like Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator came that made internet surfing mainstream. The whole Web1 movement was powered by regular computers. You could read data on your computer ‘boxes’.</p><p>There were a few thousand web pages created by technically-experienced ‘content creators’ and if you would want to download an image or a video from the internet, it was taking forever.</p><p>However, anyone was free to build on it. Clearly, Web1 was decentralized, open-source, and slow. It’s open-source nature enabled major corporations like Goodle and Amazon to start building their colossal empires, however, things took a different turn.</p> Web2: Read and Write (The Web of Today) <p>The early emergence of Web2 is accredited to the rise of commerce on the internet. Companies started to sell goods and services on the internet. This massive boom of ‘e-commerce’ platforms led of the early 2000s led to the .dotcom bubble. </p><p>E-commerce platforms made interactions with the website possible. Many businesses failed in this debacle although, they laid the foundation for enormous possibilities web was capable of. </p> The Magnificent Rise of Social Media <p>The very first possibility that revolutionized the internet era was to make everyone in this world capable of creating their own webpage without writing a single line of code. Everyone was capable of becoming a content creator and interacting with each other instead of only interacting with the website.</p><p>Platforms like Friendster, Friendfeed, and Myspace were developed by the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, California, and users around the world were able to share anything they wanted on the internet. For the first time, anyone in the world was able to have a social network on the internet. By 2006, we had Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook, the three current giants of social media and the rest is history.</p> Users Became the Products <p>Both e-commerce and social networking platforms made their users have two fundamental requirements to interact with their platform:</p>  An identity to interact on the platform  Blind trust on the platforms  <p>Web2 began the era of centralized technologies and data storage centers where an enormous amount of data started to be stored in a few warehouses owned by a few giants. Censorship, surveillance, and practices like deplatforming were standardized for disagreeing with the platform’s terms and conditions. </p><p>These giants were, and are still able to, influence the data shared with the users, use it effectively to place ads for their advertisers or sell it to other companies to improve their products and their placements.<br>Users’ own data is no more in their own control. Data has now become an asset that is continuing to make the giants richer. As Tim ‘O’ Reilly <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/22823381903">once tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Yes! RT <a href="https://twitter.com/bryce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bryce</a> love this quote "If you're not paying for it, you're not the customer; you're the product being sold." http://bit.ly/93JYCJ</p>— timoreilly (@timoreilly) <a href="https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/22823381903?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2010</a></blockquote>

 Identity and Ownership <p>In Web2, you have numerous digital identities on a myriad of platforms. Most of them are connected to a single account that can be your email id. When you sign up using your Gmail on any website, your email account becomes a point of contact as well as a source of your digital footprint that records each and every online activity connected to your account. </p><p>The most important question of this whole centralized shift again arises:</p><p>Do you control what you can do with this data and who you can share it with?</p><p>In simple words, do you completely ‘own’ and ‘control’” your digital footprint?</p><p>Over the years, we have seen data breaches consistently proving that the new Internet or Web2 has failed to protect user privacy. Global regulations like GDPR are not proving to be enough to protect users’ rights. Billions of dollars have been lost and spent to give the current users of Web2 this one fundamental right they rightfully deserve.</p><p>The debates around data and digital identity to be self-sovereign and privacy-preserved began and this whole movement started to take a new shape - Web3.</p> Web3 Explained <p>Web3 is the next evolution of a blockchain-based Word Wide Web that is decentralized, democratized, and more interactive. With the help of blockchain, developers will be able to build websites, platforms, and applications that are more secure, privacy-preserved, and censorship-resistant.</p><p>Web3 wants to change how you trust a website, how you connect your identity to a website, how your data is stored, and who possesses the control of your data. Web3 wants to make the web a space that is built by the people and for the people.</p> The Origins of Web3 <p>The term “Web3” (often called Web 3.0) was coined by Gavin Wood, the co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot, and Kusama, in 2014. By bringing a group of friends, developers, and pioneering entrepreneurs in the blockchain space together, in 2017, Gavin Wood also set up Web3 Foundation, an organization that rewards grants to innovative projects that are building decentralized web applications and protocols.<br></p><p>The whole Web3 movement gained tremendous popularity as the popularity of blockchain protocols and its products like NFTs, tokens, and Metaverse grew. The movement is joined by the Ethereum Foundation, Mozilla, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Dock, and many more.</p> Has Web3 Transitioned from AI-based to Blockchain-Based? The Role of Blockchain<br> <p>The definition that was describing Web3 evolved over time and due to the popularity of blockchain since the invention of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it was no longer limited to a ‘smart internet’.</p><p>Tim Berner Lee proposed the first concept of Web 3.0 in 2006 which is different from the meaning it has obtained today. He thought ‘Semantic Web’ driven by emerging technologies like AI and Machine Learning are going to play a pivotal role in this evolution. The goal of this Web extension was to make data machines readable. His vision was to make the internet more dynamic, open-source, interactive, and intelligent.</p><p>Was it the shift in the popularity of technologies or the shift in the paradigm, Web3 (Gavin Wood’s iteration) became more popular than Web3.0 (Tim Berner Lee’s interaction), and now, in all the definitions across the Google searches, Web3 is defined as a form of ‘decentralized internet’.</p><p>The primary objective Web3 is now focusing upon is users should own and control their online identity and reveal parts of their identity only when they choose to do so.</p> Web3 - More Than Crypto <p>Web3 has often been mistaken for cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It is true that in the future, they may form a crucial component of Web3. But to limit the scope of Web3 to only tokens and NFTs will be an understatement of this vast technology.</p><p>Since Web3 is based on blockchain technology, we will need tokens to facilitate transactions between 2 users. For any type of content (art, text, image, audio, or video) to have value, they will be needed to convert into NFTs and then transacted for a price agreed between the buyer and seller. Adding to this, Web3 will have numerous incentive and reward mechanisms for user participation, governance, and other technical and non-technical operations.</p><p>However, cryptocurrencies and NFTs constitute only a small part of Web3. Web3 encompasses an extensive range of sectors, industries, and applications. </p> What Makes Web3 Important?  Ownership <p>Ownership of data is the core objective of the Web3. This means users will be able to grant, revoke or modify access to their data anytime. This also means users will no longer need to disclose each and every data related to their online digital identity. Users will have features like ‘selective disclosures’ using which they will be able to disclose only the portion of their information that is requested by a third party.</p><p>Web3 repairs the deepest damage caused by Web2 on the idea of Web. Blockchain-based sign-in systems like Web3 ID become all the more more essential in fulfilling the vision of Self-Sovereign Identity that gives people full control and ownership over their digital identity.</p> Decentralization <p>Web3 is going to be powered by blockchain and tokenized assets (cryptocurrencies and NFTs). Decentralized technologies will enable peer-to-peer interactions between individuals, witnessed and verified by a decentralized network of nodes.</p><p>The P2P and decentralized capabilities of blockchain and Web3 fundamentally change the Web2 data infrastructure. Blockchain has the capability to decentralize storage, governance, and data authentication. Public blockchain infrastructures are open-source, permissionless, and trustless. With no single point of failure and a global community participating in the ecosystem at different levels, Web3 is more secure, dynamic, and interactive.</p> Reputation <p>All the content, texts, audio, images, or videos will be created with a cryptographic signature signed by the public key of the user. Every content will have the stamp of its creator. There can be a voting mechanism to review the content. Reviewers can be rewarded for their reviews and creators can be rewarded based on the impressions and response on their content.</p><p>In Web3, users will carry a reputation based on the content they have created and reviewed. A reputation-based system will influence users to stay honest in the ecosystem and produce good-quality content.</p> Identity <p>A digital identity is a way of verifying who we are online and the body of information about an individual or organization that exists online. A digital identity is an extension of current physical ID documents like passports, bank cards, and driver’s licenses. On the web, it can be your emails, user names, and passwords, social media profiles, platform accounts, etc.</p><p>Web3 is going to change how your digital identity is created, authenticated, and linked to your online activity. Subsequent to this, Web3 authentication systems like <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID</a> (by Dock) let users or owners of the IDs to control the data linked to their digital IDs.</p><p>With the help of Web3 ID, how you will be able to authenticate your identity and sign in to websites and platforms is going to completely change. <a href="https://blog.dock.io/web3-identity/">See more details here</a>.<br></p> Security and Privacy <p>Web3 is capable of leveraging the most powerful features of blockchain to secure data breaches and user privacy. Each asset, financial transaction, or message can be encrypted using cryptographic algorithms. Encryption is the process of taking a message and scrambling its contents so only certain people (with a key than can decrypt)can look at your message. </p><p>Asymmetric encryption or Public-private key cryptography can be used to encrypt our online activity and make it secure and tamper-proof. Asymmetric encryption is when the encryption key (also called the public key) and the corresponding decryption key (also called the private key) are different. </p><p>No data is stored on the blockchain. Blockchain only maintains an online register of all the identities created on it. Blockchain also maintains the proof of verification of all online transactions. Zero-knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) can be deployed to provide extra layers of security for data authentication, verification, and disclosures.</p> Censorship Resistance <p>When Elon Musk proposed to buy Twitter, the very first ecosystem he was willing to create on it was of “Free Speech.”</p><blockquote><p>🚀💫♥️ Yesss!!! ♥️💫🚀 <a href="https://t.co/0T9HzUHuh6">pic.twitter.com/0T9HzUHuh6</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518677066325053441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>The ability to censor content, webpages, apps, websites or users is a power that comes with tremendous responsibility.</p><p>There will be no corporate censorship. User data is no longer controlled however, decentralized voting mechanisms can be in place with the help of governance tokens whether to continue keeping the content on the web or burn it. Interoperability of platforms will allow users to migrate content from one platform to another if the content is negative or does not contribute to the platform’s nature. </p> Automation (DAO) <p>Ethereum brought smart contracts to blockchain and since then, it came to be known as the first decentralized computer. Smart contracts enabled any business model to induce automation from a basic transaction facilitation to building an entirely automated organization like DAOs where each and every operation is automatic and conducted based on the user’s interaction. <br></p><p>Web3 technology stack with developer-friendly APIs and smart contracts can help engineering teams enhance their technical functionalities and migrate to Web3 applications easily. Rewards, passive incomes (staking, interest, etc.), real-time analytics, payments, and many more operations can be automated which can make the business processes flow more efficiently, remove middlemen, and reduce costs.<br></p> Examples of Web3 in real-world <p>NFT marketplaces and DeFi platforms are seen as the two most successful use cases of Web3 apps where the apps are completely automated, open-source, and blockchain-based, and all activity can be traced on the explorers of the blockchain protocols they are built upon.<br></p><p>Currently, all the Web3 and blockchain-based applications want you to attach a wallet like MetaMask to enter the decentralized marketplace and interact on the platform. Other than these two, we have seen dApps experimenting with use cases in all sectors but not all have succeeded. </p><p>When we look at crypto projects that are in the Web3 space, the two most widely categorized use cases are decentralized storage and decentralized identities. <br></p> Wallets vs Web3 ID Sign-In System <p>Web3 IDs provide a lot more functionalities and features than wallet-based authentication. With crypto wallets, developers can verify publicly available data on the blockchain. With Web3 ID, developers can verify private user data.</p><p>With both wallets and Web3 IDs, you truly own what is stored or attached to them. With wallets, you in self-custody of your assets, with Web3 IDs you are in complete control of your data as all your data will be stored in your wallet only. </p><p>Your Web3 ID or DID doesn’t contain any wallet information and your wallet only stores the public keys of your Web3 ID and nothing else. This disconnect between the two helps verifiers to verify your private data with your consent. You will not need to connect the wallet to the platform. You will only need to scan a QR code on the login screen using your Wallet app and that’s it! You have signed in using your Web3 ID.</p>Difference between the sign-in process in Web1, Web2, and Web3 Conclusion <p>Web3 still has a long way to go to get an overarching worldwide adoption. Major corporations are still in their experimental stage and so are startups that are building innovative solutions. All these solutions are agreeing on a common ground of bringing the control of users’ digital identity and data back to who it belongs to the users.</p><p>Web3 is no more a radical concept. Since now Nike and Adidas are ready to sell Steph Curry’s sneaker NFTs on a blockchain and Dock’s Web3 IDs are allowing you to sign in using a blockchain-based identity system, it is not in theory anymore. The practical applications are available that are ready to use or integrated.</p><p>We are still in the early stages of this evolution. In the coming years, we will see new solutions targeting existing challenges with Web3 like security, easy and client-friendly accessibility, usability, and interoperability. Additionally, we will also possibly see how Web3 can be used with other emerging technologies like AI, Machine Learning, IoT, and Biometrics. </p><p>What developers can create with Web3 is limitless. Seeing what we have already created, it is clear at this point that it is the Internet’s future.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve been hearing recently is that decentralized identity is the "next cycle" to continue to drive the adoption of Web3. Decentralized identity is not “the next cycle” following the whole “DeFi season, NFT season, DAO season” narrative. Rather, it’s the continual catalyst that will unlock a new set of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms that were previously unavailable. </p><p>In short, decentralized identity adds the following in a trust-minimized and user-centric manner:</p>  Who you are - which is a core set of claims about a person or entity.  What you can do - which are any available actions based on those claims, which are verified and originated from a relevant source.   <p>We can illustrate this with our good friend Steve:</p>We like Steve<p>In this case, we have a core set of claims that unlock different things for the subject, including physical access, group memberships, and more. </p><p>With current technologies, we can have a user sign-in using their keys (e.g. <a href="https://login.xyz">Sign-In with Ethereum</a>), have <a href="https://spruceid.dev">credentials issued</a> to their identifier (and store them), and use capabilities to retrieve and present those credentials. In a future post, I’ll break down the core basics of decentralized identity – everything from DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, and more. The use-cases that these types of workflows empower will really be what drives the space to another level during the next cycle. </p><p>To start with the basics, we need to set the stage with how the web3 space operates now, and then how it can operate in the future.</p> The Future is Now Blockchain 1.0<p>Our current scope with no external verifiable data deals strictly with asset exchange. Two parties can trustlessly transfer assets with no intermediary, based on a particular time (whether immediate, within a certain amount of blocks), or confirmation thresholds (enough signers to send from a multisig). </p><p>We’ve been able to reinvent an entire set of financial interactions, making them trustless by using this type of exchange, and it’s quite incredible. But beyond that, it becomes difficult to have more meaningful interactions because the more we trust the other side of the trade without additional verifiable information, the more counterparty risk we incur. How do we know <code>0xaLiCe</code> is who they say they are? </p>Exclusively Available on OpenEden&nbsp;<p>Let’s take this a step further by now introducing a case where a form of authenticity is required in some way about one of the counterparties. </p><p>This wonderful painting of Steve requires a bit of provenance tracing in order to be sold, and with that, knowing that the artist is the seller, and was responsible for creating the work. This is because we want a first edition copy of Steve sold directly by the artist (who wouldn't). Adding additional information such as some basic facts about a counterparty reintroduces trust in the transaction. </p><p>This comes with the correlation risk that there is now a name attached to a public key. However, the seller here has taken on this risk because the asset in question is worth more than the cost of the trust portion of this transaction. </p><p>Now with the additional context we’ve added, this interaction becomes safer due to Bob knowing that he’s buying this original Steve from the artist. Bob in this case may or may not associate his name with his public key, as he doesn’t require any form of authenticity. The trust portion of the transaction typically falls on the originator. Alice just needs to know that Bob has the money to pay for the art. Other than that, she couldn't care less who the buyer is. </p><p>That’s the beauty of this space: both counterparties don’t necessarily need the same assurance levels.</p><p><a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/levels-assurance-loas#:~:text=A%20level%20of%20(identity)%20assurance,the%20claimant's%20%E2%80%9Ctrue%E2%80%9D%20identity.">Levels of assurance</a> (LOA) represent the trust cost based on the stakes of the transaction itself. For example, if Alice has a name and a few social media handles tied to a public key, she may be able to prove authenticity when it comes to selling NFTs – a low assurance use case. </p><p>We’ve introduced some risk with these forms of personally identifiable information (PII), but as we go up the chain in information sensitivity requirements, unfortunately, it requires much more risk on Alice who has to meet some criteria for the transaction and disclose information. </p><p>A case where a government-issued identifier might be required would be a scenario in which Alice wants to participate in a permissioned DeFi protocol with KYC [customer/counterparty] requirements. Thankfully are ways in which Alice can prove her identity without having to publicly disclose any of this information:</p>Blockchain 10.0<p>In the case above, Alice can have a credential issued for a particular purpose, store it in a personal data vault, and only authorize access to that credential when she consents to the interaction. Additionally, Alice controls this credential at all times and can present it to any requesting platform: it isn’t limited to a single platform because it’s a credential she owns and controls. </p> What Comes Next  <p>With these kinds of interactions now possible, there’s a lot more we can do in the space, and plenty of new avenues unlocked:</p> DeFi   Currently, lending in DeFi is mostly overcollateralized so there’s a backstop in case of any market uncertainty. With credentials gained from a variety of on-chain and off-chain sources, undercollateralized lending with richer credit histories used as evidence is now possible. With additional information, risk can now be accurately assessed.  Additionally, permissioned trading and lending pools in DeFi are now possible for institutions, as you can accurately identify counterparties with enough assurance through credentialing.   NFTs and DeSoc   Currently, you have limited assurance levels on who you’re interacting with when buying NFTs. By assembling just the right amount of information through credentialing (such as social media accounts and other art-related connections), you know exactly who you’re buying from without having to solely rely on centralized platform verification processes.  Decentralized knowledge bases are now possible, as you can accurately assess the fact that a reputable author or creator is the one producing specialized content.  Decentralized identity and data also open up the possibility of exporting one’s social graph, including all connections, followers, posts, and more that can be portable and travel with users from platform to platform. &nbsp;   DAOs   Decentralized Identity will dramatically change the way DAOs operate, especially in the context of delegation. Your steward won't just be a public key, but a mix of on and off-chain information that makes them both qualified and trustworthy to earn your voting power.  DAO members would now also be able to demonstrate skills and earned certifications that travel with them to different DAOs. For example, in the case of a worker collective, each worker can attest to certifications that they’ve earned in order to assert that they are the most qualified for a job to be done.   <p>Decentralized identity isn’t the next big thing - but instead, it’s the necessary component in order to power a new future. </p><p>However, the future is quite closer than it seems.</p> <p>If you want to chat about decentralized identity or any related use-cases, check out our Discord server:</p><a href="http://discord.gg/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

			 Tokenization is the first step for real-world assets in DeFi 
<p>Before delving into our newsletter, I would like to share with you a great announcement from our team:&nbsp;We are pleased to have integrated our solutions with Fireblocks&nbsp;– an enterprise-grade platform for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets, who serves over 1,300 financial institutions.&nbsp;This integration will enable Fireblocks to provide a turnkey tokenization solution for its customers&nbsp;with the ability to deploy and manage permissioned tokens such as digital securities, stablecoins and loyalty tokens.</p>
<p>We’re very excited about this partnership as tokenization continues to storm into the financial and business development strategies of financial institutions, and this kind of ready-to-use solutions will be the catalyst for the tokenization prosperity. However, while more financial instruments and real-world assets are being brought to blockchain,&nbsp;the full potential of tokenized securities lies post-tokenization.</p>
 Collateralization is currently the main DeFi use case 
<p>It allows users to easily obtain a loan with their cryptocurrency as a collateral from someone else in an investor pool. The whole process takes place on a DeFi platform, run via smart contracts, without any intermediary. However, the same can not be said for tokenized securities yet, due to compliance, valuation, and liquidity issues.</p>
<p>While the traditional finance concept of allowing borrowers to use something valuable as the guarantee to obtain a loan remains the same,&nbsp;in DeFi the trustee is replaced by smart contracts.&nbsp;Instead of middlemen performing manual operations, the codes themselves will execute actions when all conditions are met.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Collateralization of tokenized securities is coming<br>
 
<p>The pledge of tokenized assets is possible but more complicated, which explains why it is little used at the moment: These&nbsp;crypto-lending protocols work well because cryptos are very liquid, and the market prices are well known. It enables DeFi protocols to efficiently calculate the LTV (loan-to-value), and to automate liquidations in the event of nonpayment by the borrower or loss of value of the pledged asset. Indeed, even though cryptocurrencies have high liquidity, they are also volatile.</p>
<p>With security tokens, it is currently more difficult to determine the value of the token, and to get enough liquidity to reach the same automation level of the process. For sure, we have a type of token that is usually backed by the value of real-world assets, so they are less likely to fluctuate as much as they do with cryptos. As a result, liquidations should be less frequent. However, they will still need to be enforced if the borrower doesn’t pay back the debt.</p>
<p>Calculating net asset value (NAV) can be costly, lengthy, and difficult for issuers&nbsp;due to the nature of the underlying assets in general. Valuation service providers, such as our partner Inveniam, are needed in this case so that issuers can adequately and accurately assess their valuation and link this pricing data to their tokens. This will drastically help to use tokenized securities as collateral.</p>
<p>The other problem is the lack of liquidity. Liquidators will only guarantee that they will buy the assets if they get a good price, and if they can resell the tokenized asset on the secondary market. In the crypto market, these liquidations can be fully automated. For digital securities, there is no venue with enough liquidity yet. That is why&nbsp;Tokeny is working actively to interconnect liquidity providers, whether it is decentralized exchange protocols, regulated exchanges or digital trading desks.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Permissioned lending protocols to make DeFi compliant 
<p>Last but not least, it is mandatory for issuers to apply compliance rules in any operations with their tokens. As compliance rules are embedded in the token, the lending protocol will only work with eligible token holders and may also want to restrict its access to certain types of investors. For this, Tokeny already leverages the digital identity system&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_YIFjJk8kF0VZRWfj0LQ5EH-Ez9iFGtRmyvTvhmBYjKhoB-w0bszdfB9iSm4iD_ujP3Lh">ONCHAINID</a>&nbsp;to whitelist users. By using such a digital identity system, lending protocols can provide DeFi services to qualified users in a compliant manner, attract institutional investors, and increase the liquidity of tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The tokenization of assets is the first step in bringing more assets on-chain, leading to greater benefits and more use cases. Our vision is to see tokenized securities at the center of all value chains in the financial market. Isn’t it exciting?</p>

<p>Spring is a long-time friend to enterprise companies throughout the world. When Spring Boot came along in 2014, it greatly simplified configuring a Spring application. This led to widespread adoption and continued investment in related Spring projects.</p>
 
 
<p>One of my favorite Spring projects is Spring Security. In most cases, it simplifies web security to just a few lines of code. HTTP Basic, JDBC, JWT, OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0, you name it—Spring Security does it!</p>
 
 
<p>You might notice I didn’t mention SAML as an authentication type. That’s because I don’t recommend it. The specification for SAML 2.0 was published in March 2005, before smartphones or smart devices even existed. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is much easier for developers to use and understand. Using SAML in 2022 is like implementing a web service using WS-* instead of REST.</p>
 
 
<p>My recommendation: just use OIDC.</p>
 
 
<p>If you must use SAML with Spring Boot, this tutorial should make it quick and easy.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN</a> (for Java 17)</p>

 What is SAML? 
 
 
<p>Security Assertion Markup Language is an XML-based way of doing web authentication and authorization. It works cross-domain, so SaaS applications and other enterprise software often support it.</p>
 
 
<p>Nick Gamb has an excellent overview in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6QSEqDJPo">A Developer’s Guide to SAML</a>.</p>
 
 
            
         
 
<p>If you want to learn how Spring Security implements SAML, please read its <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/login/index.html">SAML 2.0 Login docs</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Add a SAML application on Okta 
 
 
<p>To begin, you’ll need an Okta developer account. You can create one at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com/signup</a> or install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Then, log in to your account and go to Applications &gt; Create App Integration. Select SAML 2.0 and click Next. Name your app something like <code>Spring Boot SAML</code> and click Next.</p>
 
 
<p>Use the following settings:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single sign on URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/okta</code></p>
 
 
<p>Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL: ✅ (the default)</p>
 
 
<p>Audience URI: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Then click Next. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>I’m an Okta customer adding an internal app</p>
 
 
<p>This is an internal app that we have created</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Select Finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Okta will create your app, and you will be redirected to its Sign On tab. Scroll down to the SAML Signing Certificates and go to SHA-2 &gt; Actions &gt; View IdP Metadata. You can right-click and copy this menu item’s link or open its URL. Copy the resulting link to your clipboard. It should look something like the following:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https://dev-13337.okta.com/app/&lt;random-characters&gt;/sso/saml/metadata</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Go to your app’s Assignment tab and assign access to the Everyone group.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Spring Boot app with SAML support 
 
 
<p>Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17. You can install it with SDKMAN:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The easiest way to do this tutorial is to clone the existing <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">Spring Boot example application</a> I created.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d rather start from scratch, you can create a brand-new Spring Boot app using <a href="https://start.spring.io">start.spring.io</a>. Select the following options:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Project: Gradle</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: 3.0.0 (SNAPSHOT)</p>
 
 
<p>Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Security, Thymeleaf</p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also use <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=gradle-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=17&amp;groupId=com.example&amp;artifactId=demo&amp;name=demo&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.example.demo&amp;dependencies=web,security,thymeleaf">this URL</a> or HTTPie:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==3.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
  dependencies==web,security,thymeleaf type==gradle-project \
  baseDir==spring-boot-saml | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you created a brand-new app, you’ll need to complete the following steps:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Add <code>src/main/java/com/example/demo/HomeController.java</code> to populate the authenticated user’s information.</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.saml2.provider.service.authentication.Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", principal.getFirstAttribute("email"));
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/templates/home.html</code> file to render the user’s information.</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org"
      xmlns:sec="https://www.thymeleaf.org/thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Spring Boot and SAML&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"/&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are successfully logged in as &lt;span sec:authentication="name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your email address is &lt;span th:text="${emailAddress}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your authorities are &lt;span sec:authentication="authorities"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All Your Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl th:each="userAttribute : ${userAttributes}"&gt;
    &lt;dt th:text="${userAttribute.key}"&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd th:text="${userAttribute.value}"&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;form th:action="@{/logout}" method="post"&gt;
    &lt;button id="logout" type="submit"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code> file to contain the metadata URI you copied in <a>Add a SAML application on Okta</a>. This value should end with <code>/sso/saml/metadata</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-metadata-uri&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Then, change <code>build.gradle</code> to add Spring Security SAML’s dependency:</p>
 
 
 <code>implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-saml2-service-provider'</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>If you cloned from GitHub, you only need to update <code>application.yml</code> to include your metadata URI. You can remove the other properties as they may cause issues.</p>
 
 
 Run the app and authenticate 
 
<p>Run your Spring Boot app from your IDE or using the command line:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./gradlew bootRun</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Open <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your favorite browser and log in with the credentials you used to create your account.</p>
 
 
<p>You should see a successful result in your browser.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you try to log out, it won’t work. Let’s fix that.</p>
 
 
 
 Add a logout feature 
 
<p>Spring Security’s SAML support has a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/saml2/logout.html">logout feature</a> that takes a bit to configure. First, edit your application on Okta and navigate to General &gt; SAML Settings &gt; Edit.</p>
 
 
<p>Continue to the Configure SAML step and Show Advanced Settings. Before you can enable single logout, you’ll have to create and upload a certificate to sign the outgoing logout request.</p>
 
 
<p>You can create a private key and certificate using OpenSSL. Answer at least one of the questions with a value, and it should work.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout local.key -x509 -days 365 -out local.crt</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Copy the generated files to your app’s <code>src/main/resources</code> directory. Configure <code>signing</code> and <code>singlelogout</code> in <code>application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          okta:
            assertingparty:
              ...
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Upload the <code>local.crt</code> to your Okta app. Select Enable Single Logout and use the following values:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Single Logout URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo</code></p>
 
 
<p>SP Issuer: <code>http://localhost:8080/saml2/service-provider-metadata/okta</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Finish configuring your Okta app, restart your Spring Boot app, and the logout button should work.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Customize authorities with Spring Security SAML 
 
<p>You might notice when you log in, the resulting page shows you have a <code>ROLE_USER</code> authority. However, when you assigned users to the app, you gave access to <code>Everyone</code>. You can configure your SAML app on Okta to send a user’s groups as an attribute. You can add other attributes like name and email too.</p>
 
 
<p>Edit your Okta app’s SAML settings and fill in the Group Attribute Statements section.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Name: <code>groups</code></p>
 
 
<p>Name format: <code>Unspecified</code></p>
 
 
<p>Filter: <code>Matches regex</code> and use <code>.*</code> for the value</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Just above, you can add other attribute statements. For instance:</p>
 








Name
Name format
Value




<p><code>email</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.email</code></p>


<p><code>firstName</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.firstName</code></p>


<p><code>lastName</code></p>
<p><code>Unspecified</code></p>
<p><code>user.lastName</code></p>



 
<p>Save these changes.</p>
 
 
<p>If you cloned the repo earlier, restart your app and log in to see your user’s groups as authorities.</p>
 
 
<p>If you created a Spring Boot app from scratch, create a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class that overrides the default configuration and uses a converter to translate the values in the <code>groups</code> attribute into Spring Security authorities.</p>

        authenticationProvider.setResponseAuthenticationConverter(groupsConverter());

            Set&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; authorities = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
            if (groups != null) {
                groups.stream().map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new).forEach(authorities::add);
            } else {
                authorities.addAll(authentication.getAuthorities());
            }
            return new Saml2Authentication(principal, authentication.getSaml2Response(), authorities);
        };
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 






You might be able to remove <code>permitAll()</code> on the favicon because that was <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/11657">recently fixed in Spring Security</a>.



 
 
<p>Finally, modify your <code>build.gradle</code> file to force the latest version of Open SAML that works with Spring Security 6.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>repositories {
    ...
    maven { url "https://build.shibboleth.net/nexus/content/repositories/releases/" }
}

dependencies {
    constraints {
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-core:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-api:4.1.1"
        implementation "org.opensaml:opensaml-saml-impl:4.1.1"
    }
    ...
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now, if you restart your app and log in, you should see your user’s groups as authorities. Huzzah!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 Add support for Auth0 
 
 
<p>Did you know Auth0 provides support for SAML apps too? Auth0 makes it even easier to configure because its default web applications support OIDC and SAML.</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://auth0.com/signup">Sign up for an Auth0 account</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/api/auth/login?redirectTo=dashboard">log in</a> with your existing one. Navigate to Applications &gt; Create Application &gt; Regular Web Applications &gt; Create.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the name to <code>Spring Boot SAML</code>. Add <code>http://localhost:8080/login/saml2/sso/auth0</code> as an Allowed Callback URL.</p>
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom, expand Advanced Settings, and go to Endpoints. Copy the value of the SAML Metadata URL. You’ll need this soon. Select Save Changes.</p>
 
 
<p>If you configured your app to use these values, authentication would work, but you wouldn’t be able to log out. Scroll to the top of the page, select Addons, and enable SAML.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the Settings tab and change the (commented) JSON to be as follows:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "logout": {
    "callback": "http://localhost:8080/logout/saml2/slo",
    "slo_enabled": true
  }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Enable.</p>
 
 
<p>Change your <code>application.yml</code> to use <code>auth0</code> instead of <code>okta</code> and copy your SAML Metadata URL into it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:
  security:
    saml2:
      relyingparty:
        registration:
          auth0:
            assertingparty:
              metadata-uri: &lt;your-auth0-metadata-uri&gt;
            signing:
              credentials:
                - private-key-location: classpath:local.key
                  certificate-location: classpath:local.crt
            singlelogout:
              binding: POST
              response-url: "{baseUrl}/logout/saml2/slo"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, and you should be able to log in with Auth0.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You might notice that the email and authorities are not calculated correctly. This is because the claim names have changed with Auth0. Update <code>SecurityConfiguration#groupsConverter()</code> to allow both Okta and Auth0 names for groups.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>private Converter&lt;OpenSaml4AuthenticationProvider.ResponseToken, Saml2Authentication&gt; groupsConverter() {

    ...

    return (responseToken) -&gt; {
        ...
        List&lt;String&gt; groups = principal.getAttribute("groups");
        // if groups is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (groups == null) {
            groups = principal.getAttribute("http://schemas.auth0.com/roles");
        }
        ...
    };
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make Auth0 populate a user’s groups, navigate to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules and create a new Rule. Choose the Empty rule template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Groups claim</code>, replace the <code>Script</code> content with the following, and Save.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, modify <code>HomeController</code> to allow Auth0’s email attribute name.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>public class HomeController {

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home(@AuthenticationPrincipal Saml2AuthenticatedPrincipal principal, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", principal.getName());
        String email = principal.getFirstAttribute("email");
        // if email is not preset, try Auth0 attribute name
        if (email == null) {
            email = principal.getFirstAttribute("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress");
        }
        model.addAttribute("emailAddress", email);
        model.addAttribute("userAttributes", principal.getAttributes());
        return "home";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Restart your app, log in, and everything should work as expected.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Support Okta and Auth0 
 
 
<p>You can also support both Okta and Auth0! Modify your <code>application.yml</code> to be as follows, and Spring Security will prompt you for which one to log in with. The <code>&amp;name</code> and <code>*name</code> values are used to set and retrieve blocks of YAML to avoid repetition.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring:

<p>If you restart your app with these settings, you’ll be prompted for both when you first hit <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Deploy to production 
 
 
<p>One quick way to see this app working in a production environment is to deploy it to Heroku. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Install the Heroku CLI</a> and create an account to begin. Then, follow the steps below to prepare and deploy your app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new app on Heroku using <code>heroku create</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a <code>system.properties</code> file in the root directory of your app to force Java 17:</p>
 
 
 <code>java.runtime.version=17</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a <code>Procfile</code> that specifies how to run your app:</p>
 
 
 web: java -Xmx256m -jar build/libs/*.jar --server.port=$PORT 
 
 
 
 
<p>Commit your changes:</p>
 
 
 git add .
git commit -m "Add Heroku configuration" 
 
 
 
 
<p>Set the Gradle task to build your app:</p>
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set GRADLE_TASK="bootJar"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Deploy to production using Git:</p>
 
 
 <code>git push heroku main</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>For authentication to work with SAML, you’ll need to update your Okta and Auth0 apps to use your Heroku app’s URL in place of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, wherever applicable.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed learning how to use Spring Security to add SAML authentication. Integration was as simple as configuring a metadata URI and only became more complicated when you added a logout feature. The ability to convert groups from your identity provider to authorities is pretty slick too!</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the code for this example on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example">@oktadev/okta-spring-boot-example</a> repository. You can find the Auth0 example in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/auth0">auth0</a> branch. See the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-saml-example/tree/okta+auth0">okta+auth0</a> branch for the example that uses both identity providers.</p>

<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> 's expert team has been building cutting-edge Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity technology. We created this complete guide on decentralized identity to explain what it is, how it works, and its many benefits to organizations, individuals, and developers. </p><p>TL;DR</p>  Certificate fraud, fake credentials, slow verification processes, and data breaches are just some of the problems associated with our current centralized digital identity systems that decentralized identity technology can solve.  Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that has the following benefits for:  <p>1) Organizations: Issuing organizations can provide fraud-proof credentials and verifying organizations can instantly check the authenticity of credentials. &nbsp;</p><p>2) Individuals: Fully own and control their digital identity and credentials without relying on any third party to prove their claims.</p><p>3) Developers: Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and inefficient authentication processes.</p>  A decentralized identity system is made up of 3 pillars: blockchain, Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and decentralized identifiers (DIDs).  Decentralized identity technology can be applied to a growing number of use cases including supply chain traceability, issuing fraud-proof certifications, and managing employee IDs.  <p> Introduction</p><p>Not-so-fun facts: </p>  In 2021, almost 1 in 10 qualified nurses who were issued new licenses last year <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/10/1084897499/nurses-are-waiting-months-for-licenses-as-hospital-staffing-shortages-spread">waited six months or longer</a> before they could start working. More than a third of these 226,000 registered nurses and licensed practical nurses waited at least three months.  Supply chain fraud is an increasingly global business risk for organizations. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners say that <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/be/pdf/Markets/supply-chain-fraud.pdf">83.5% of fraud cases</a> it surveyed in 2016 featured asset misappropriation schemes including fraudulent billing and disbursements.  <a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/">71.1 million people</a> fall victim to cyber crimes every year and individuals lose an average of US$4,476  <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">96% of baby boomers, 94% of Gen X, and 93% of Gen Z</a> don’t trust social media platforms to protect their data  <p>But don’t get too down because there’s hope! As decentralized identity technology gains more adoption, people and organizations will be able to share data securely.</p><p>Table of Contents</p>  What is a Decentralized Identity? In a decentralized identity system, there is an issuer, holder, and verifier.<p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.</p><p>A digital identity is the body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online. Data that form a digital identity include: </p>  User names and passwords  Search history  Social security number  Buying history  <p>How decentralized identity benefits organizations</p>  Allows organizations to verify information instantly without having to contact the issuing party, like a driver’s licensing organization or university for example, to ensure that IDs, certificates, or documents are valid. Traditional, manual verification processes take weeks to months which slows down recruitment and processing times while using a lot of financial and human resources. Imagine being able to instantly verify someone’s credentials in seconds by scanning a QR code or running it through a user-friendly <a href="https://verifier.dock.io/">credential verifier tool</a>.  Enables issuing organizations to conveniently provide Verifiable Credentials to people and prevent fraud in a way that greatly reduces costs and increases efficiency.   <p>How decentralized identity benefits individuals</p>  Because the user has full control and ownership of their identity and credentials, they are able to prove their claims without depending on any party.  People can decide which information they want to reveal to specific parties, such as a government or employer.  No party can take away people’s ID once they are stored on their mobile digital identity wallets.  People can easily create and manage their decentralized identity with user-friendly platforms like Dock.  <p>A verifiable proof of existence is often needed for us to exercise our right as citizens to access essential services like healthcare, banking, and education. Unfortunately, 1 billion people in the world <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/global-dataset">don’t have an official proof of identity</a>. With decentralized identity systems, all you need is an internet connection and a smart device which are becoming more accessible in emerging economies.</p> Issue Fraud-Proof Credentials Efficiently at Lower Costs <p>If an organization like a university or training program is issuing credentials, they can do so securely by making credentials fraud proof. Fake diplomas are a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/diploma-mills-marketplace-fake-degrees-1.4279513">billion-dollar industry</a> and it’s very easy for people to forge a certificate. This creates many risks for companies and impacts people’s safety as many people who get fake credentials work in health care or more risky field work operating heavy machinery. Even back in the 80s, there were approximately <a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">5,000 fake doctors</a> in the US and it is now believed that there will be many more. </p><p>By using decentralized identity technology, organizations help prevent fraud to ensure that you are hiring qualified people with authentic credentials. Let’s say a company is looking for a project manager and they have a practice of hiring efficiently to get the best candidates. Many organizations take a long time to recruit and verify the credentials of candidates resulting in them losing out on great prospects as high-quality applicants often get multiple offers. </p><p>Here is how the company leverages decentralized identity technology to hire efficiently:</p>  Mary, the job applicant, manages her decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials on her phone with a Dock Wallet and wants to apply for the company looking for a project manager.  A school issues her a project management certificate as a Verifiable Credential that she stores on her digital wallet and this credential can’t be faked.  The company makes a job offer and they just need to check that her certificate is authentic.  The company requests her data and she is prompted on her phone to give authorization to the company to show her certificate  The company receives a QR code and simply scans it to instantly confirm that her program management certificate is authentic.  They offer Mary the job.  <p>The traditional, manual verification process would normally take weeks to even months.</p> What Is Self-Sovereign Identity? The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) are Verifiable Credentials, Blockchain, and Decentralized Identifiers.<p>The term “decentralized identity” is used interchangeably with <a href="https://blog.dock.io/self-sovereign-identity/">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a>, which is an approach to digital identity that gives individuals control of their digital identities. The three pillars of Self-Sovereign Identity are: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.  Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personally identifiable information.   <p>A growing number of organizations in government and in the private sector around the world are leveraging decentralized identity technology, including <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_2663">the EU</a>. As the world moves more and more towards Web3, which is the next evolution of the internet, an increasing number of people will take back control of their data through decentralization and blockchain.</p><p>Problems and Risks With Centralized and Federated Digital Identity Systems</p>3 models of ID management: centralized identity, federated identity, and Self-Sovereign Identity<p>Centralized Identity Management: Administrative Control by a Single Authority or Hierarchy</p><p>Almost all of our digital identities are connected through services, devices, and apps.</p><p>Our personal information like our credit card, name, and address is being stored and shared on an increasing number of websites while our data is often used by websites to track people to display targeted content and advertise. As people access more websites and apps, the more accounts they have to create and manage, which creates a bad user experience. </p>Centralized identities create a bad user experience by having so many passwords to manage and there is less data security as information is often stored on centralized storage systems.<p>Centralized systems often make digital identities vulnerable to cyber attacks and privacy breaches, including identity theft. Because so much user data is stored in one place, hackers could access a large amount of confidential information. </p><p>Federated Identity Management<br>Because of the problems that resulted from the centralized digital identity model, federated identity was developed. A federated identity allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps. Signing in this way is also referred to as &nbsp;“single sign-on” tools.</p><p>While this method of signing in is more convenient for people because they don’t have to create a whole new account, the main downside is that if your password gets stolen, all of the other sites you used with that single sign-on account <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/single-sign-on-facebook-google-apple/">could be exposed</a>. You would have to trust both companies that offer single sign-on to protect your privacy and security as well as all of the third-party websites that offer these options to implement them correctly. In recent years, there have been several cases of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gk73/google-fired-dozens-for-data-misuse">Google</a> misusing information, including Facebook user data to manipulate people’s moods and Google employees leveraging their positions to steal, leak, or abuse data they may have access to. </p><p>More aspects of our lives require verification of our identities in order to apply for a mortgage, buy a car, or sign up for a new service. People have little to no choice but to surrender their privacy to use the things they want.</p><p>Thankfully, decentralized identity solutions can effectively solve many of these privacy and data breach problems. Decentralized identity gives people full ownership and control of their personal information and credentials.</p> Centralized Identity vs. Decentralized Identity Management <p>Centralized Identity Management</p><p>Decentralized Identity Management</p><p>Increased risk of data breaches from storing data in a centralized system</p><p>Data is decentralized and stored by users in their wallets, which reduces the risk of large scale data breaches</p><p>Data may be collected, stored, and shared with other parties without your knowledge</p><p>Data is only shared when you give authorization</p><p>Data is owned and controlled by organizations, apps, and services</p><p>Data is fully owned and controlled by the user</p> Establishing Standards for Decentralized Identity <p>There are many organizations working to standardize and shape the field of decentralized identity. These are the key organizations: </p>  <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>: An engineering-driven organization focused on developing the foundational elements necessary to establish an open ecosystem for decentralized identity and ensure interoperability between all participants.  <a href="https://decentralized-id.com/web-standards/w3c/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>: The mission of the W3C Digital Identity Community Group is to identify and resolve real world identity issues, to explore and build a more secure trusted digital identity ecosystem on the internet for people, organizations, and things. Their work focuses on the ecosystem’s scalability, interoperability, mobility, security, and privacy.  <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>: An open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the Internet architecture and the smooth operation of the Internet.   Key Benefits of Decentralized Identity Solutions<br> You can sign in securely without a password for platforms that use Web3 ID technology.<p>These are the key advantages of decentralized identity for: </p><p>Organizations: Issue and verify fraud-proof credentials and documents instantly and reduce the risk of data breaches by storing less user information </p><p>Individuals: Own and control your digital identity with more privacy</p><p>Developers: Secure authentication sign-in for app users that eliminates the need for passwords and privacy-preserving user verification is used</p> Benefits for Organizations <p>Decentralized identity solutions come with many advantages for organizations including: </p>  Speed up the verification process at a much lower cost  Prevents credential fraud  Improved data security with public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt information safely  Reducing the risk of being targeted for cyber attacks by storing less user data  <p>Being able to verify credentials instantly is beneficial for a variety of use cases including speeding up the hiring process and reducing the risk of hiring someone without the appropriate credentials. </p><p>Many organizations around the world must follow regulations on how they collect, store, and use user data. If they don’t follow the regulations, they can face penalties and sanctions for breaking the rules or data breaches. </p><p>The impact of data breaches on organizations:</p>  The average cost of a data breach for a small business is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$108,000 a year</a>  The average time to identify a data breach inside an organization is <a href="https://telecoms.com/498656/206-days-ibms-estimate-on-how-long-it-takes-to-find-a-security-breach/">206 days and another 73 days</a> to fix it  Small businesses are the victims of<a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/10-small-business-cyber-security-statistics-that-you-should-know-and-how-to-improve-them/#:~:text=43%25%20of%20all%20data%20breaches,attack%20during%20the%20previous%20year."> 43% of data breaches</a>  For large corporations, the average cost of a data breach is <a href="https://go.kaspersky.com/rs/802-IJN-240/images/GL_Kaspersky_Report-IT-Security-Economics_report_2019.pdf">US$204 per employee</a> while for SMBs it costs an average of US$3,533 per employee   Benefits for Individuals <p>Decentralized identities enable people to:</p>  Fully own and control their data  Prevent device and data tracking as they browse websites  Choose who they want to share their relevant information to  Prevent the spread of their data without their knowledge   <p>A decentralized digital wallet can be used on a phone to securely store your digital identity and credentials with encryption. This approach conceals data which greatly reduces the risk of credential tracking, hacks, and gaining unauthorized access to steal or monetize people’s data. With a decentralized identity, someone has to give authorization to share information when it is requested. </p><p>Verizon’s email hacking statistics show that phishing attempts are responsible <a href="https://dataprot.net/statistics/hacking-statistics/">for 80% of malware infections and almost 95% of all espionage attacks.</a> Also, Facebook has had many data breaches since it was launched. In one instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/facebook-records-exposed-server/#:~:text=In%20the%20researchers'%20write%2Dup,anyone%20to%20access%20the%20data.">540 million records were exposed in a Facebook data leak</a>, which included Facebook IDs, passwords, Facebook friends, photos, and check-ins. This data is a gold mine for hackers planning phishing scams and social engineering attacks.</p><p>With a decentralized identity, passwords don’t exist. Rather cryptographic keys are used to authenticate users when they sign in. You could sign into a website with your Decentralized Identifier data instead of a user name. Basically, you only need to share the information that’s relevant and necessary to access each service. </p> Benefits for Developers <p>Decentralized identity solutions help developers by: </p>  Creating opportunities to build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and an inefficient authentication process that will enhance the user experience  Being able to safely request data directly from users while maintaining their privacy  <p>Imagine shopping on sites that don’t need to build up and store personal details including credit card information. Instead, your verified payment and shipping information is securely transmitted from your decentralized identity wallet. </p><p>Or if someone wants to apply for a loan application, instead of finding all the paperwork, they can give permission to the bank to instantly receive all of the relevant information to show that they are eligible for a loan, including their salary, address, and name. </p> How Decentralized Identity Works <p>A decentralized identity system has these main elements: </p>  Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system. <br>  Decentralized Identity Wallet: An app that allows users to create their decentralized identifiers and manage their Verifiable Credentials.<br>  Decentralized Identifier (DID): A unique identifier on the blockchain made up of a string of letters and numbers that contains details like the public key and verification information. <br>  Verifiable Credential (VC): A digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. These are the main parties in the VC system:    Holder: A user who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives the Verifiable Credential.  Issuer: The organization that signs a Verifiable Credential with their private key and issues it to the holder.   Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.  The main parties in the Verifiable Credentials system are the holders, issuers, and verifiers.<p>Let’s go into more detail about how each of these elements works individually and then how they all work together. </p> Decentralized Identity on Blockchain <p>Blockchain is a digitally distributed database that is shared among nodes, which are computers in the blockchain network, that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. Blockchain’s design allows everyone in the network to know that the information contained is true and valid. Each block has unique data and the blocks combine to complete a chain. The nodes execute functions like sending and receiving information. Blockchain technology is also referred to as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p><p>Key Features of a Blockchain</p>  Decentralized: Public permissionless blockchains use a peer-to-peer network that anyone can join. No one can change or manipulate the way a blockchain should act. <br>  A blockchain acts as a distributed ledger: The digital database runs on a distributed network of computers around the world which makes it hard for someone or an organization to change or manipulate information. In contrast, centralized systems make it easier for someone to change or manipulate information without anyone else knowing because they are the only ones who have access to the records.   <p>But with blockchain technology, every node in the network gets a full copy of the blockchain and the information can be used to verify that it hasn’t been tampered with. When the data is verified, every node adds this information to its own blockchain. Everyone in the network creates consensus where they agree which blocks are valid and which aren’t. Tampered blocks will be rejected by nodes in the network.</p>  Immutable: Each block on a chain contains information from the previous block and the blocks can’t be tampered with or backdated. There is a hash on each block that acts like a digital fingerprint. If the hash changes, the network will know it has been tampered with.<br>  Robust security: The blockchain enables digital signatures and cryptographic hash functions to protect people’s identities from breaches and thefts.  <p>It’s important to note that anyone can join public permissionless blockchains. Permissioned blockchains don't allow anyone to join without authorization because some use cases require that only specific people should access the network. With a permissioned blockchain, a user would need permission from the network owner to become part of the network to access, read, and/or write information on the blockchain. </p><p>Here is how each party uses the blockchain in a decentralized identity system: </p>  Holder: Owner of the Verifiable Credential (e.g. driver’s license) has their public DID on the blockchain.  Issuer: The issuer’s public DID and associated public key is on the blockchain. When an issuer, like a licensing organization, provides a credential to a holder like a driver’s license, the issuer signs the credential with their private key.  Verifier: A verifier like an on-demand driving company can check the blockchain to ensure that the licensing department that they trust did in fact issue the license and who it was issued to. <br>  <p>The blockchain allows everyone in the network to have the same source of truth about which credentials are valid and who authenticated the validity of the data inside the credentials. The blockchain establishes a basis of trust by maintaining a verifiable registry (or records) of:</p>  All DIDs  Proof of credentials issued (if the credential is anchored to demonstrate proof of existence and authenticity)  Public cryptographic keys  Revocation registries  <p>The identity information is not stored on the blockchain but rather on the holder’s digital wallet. The credentials issued using the Dock blockchain are stored off-chain, usually in someone’s decentralized digital wallet app.</p> What Are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?<br> <p>Dock's Solutions Architect Mike Parkhill explains how decentralized identifiers (DIDs) work and their importance.</p><p>A Decentralized Identifier (DID): </p>  Is a globally unique identifier made up of a string of letters and numbers that is stored on the blockchain and independent of any organization  Allows the owner to prove cryptographic control over them  Comes with one or many private key and public key pairs  Does not contain personal data or wallet information  Enables private and secure connections between two parties and can be verified anywhere at any time  <p>Here is a decentralized identifier example that can be managed in a Dock wallet:</p><p>A DID can be used to find connected DID documents that contain relevant information to enable use cases like sign-in, data encryption, and communication. </p><p>Right now, most of us use information like emails, passwords, and user names as identifiers to access websites, apps, and services. But these identifiers have often resulted in: </p>  Our personal information being hacked  Identity theft  Our data being shared with other parties without our knowledge  Making it harder for someone to manage all of the logins  Being at the mercy of service providers who can revoke these identifiers at any time  <p>But DIDs solve many of these problems. They enable a universally accepted standard for exchanging and verifying digital credentials. A party, either an individual or organization, can make as many DIDs as they want for different relationships. DIDs are like different personas that people can create. </p><p>Right now, many people use LinkedIn to show their professional experience and information. But because they don’t want employers to see their personal photos and interests, they make a separate Facebook profile. A DID is similar in that you can make different profiles for different purposes.</p><p>For example, you can have a DID for: </p>  Your personal interests like signing in to shopping websites or showing you are of legal age to buy alcohol  Professional purposes where you can use this DID to show educational or professional credentials to an employer  Accessing different cryptocurrency-related apps and services that need to verify your identity for your trading and investment activities  You can create as many decentralized identifiers (DIDs) as you want and manage them in your digital identity wallet. How Do You Create Decentralized Identifiers? Mike explains how to use Dock Certs to create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential.<p>With a Dock Wallet and Dock Certs, you can create a DID by following these steps:</p>  <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Create an account on Dock Certs and login</a>. If you’re just getting familiar with the platform, you can use Test mode.  <p>2. Click Create Verifiable Credential on the top right.</p><p>3. Create the issuer profile (a university for example) and you can leave the Key Type to the default setting. Then select Create a DID.</p><p>4. Choose among the basic template options, select the DID, click Continue on the top right. </p><p>5. You can add credential recipients manually one by one or in bulk with the Import CSV option.</p><p>6. If you add someone manually, you will enter details like this example below where we are identifying someone by their employee number. Once you fill in all of the details, click Add Recipient.</p><p>7. The information will appear like this:</p><p>8. If you want to do bulk issuance, you can also import a CSV file. Download the sample template, fill it in, and upload it.</p><p>9. The next option is to Persist the credential which means that Dock will securely store the credential on our database (but NOT on the blockchain).</p><p>If you persist the credential, there will be a QR code that shows up on the PDF where the recipient can simply scan the QR code with their Dock Wallet app to import the credential in their wallet.</p><p>10. There is an option to add a registry (record) on the blockchain allowing this credential to be revoked.</p><p>11. You can anchor the credential which will add a hash of the credential (like a digital fingerprint) you issue on the Dock blockchain. This allows someone to verify when and who created it. </p><p>12. &nbsp;Next click Issue Credentials on the top right and you will be able to download the credentials in JSON and PDF formats. A JSON file is a file that stores simple data structures and objects in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format, which is a standard data interchange format.</p><p>The Basic PDF credential will look like this:</p><p>It’s important to know that if you don’t persist or download the credential, you can’t get it back. </p><p>13. The issuer can email the PDF and JSON files to the recipient. Soon we will be releasing the Relay Service to automatically send the credential to the recipient's wallet.</p><p>14. If there is no QR code on the PDF file (because the credential wasn’t persisted), then the recipient has to download and import the JSON file. To do this select Credentials, click on the + sign on the top right corner, and select the JSON file.</p><p>15. The credential will immediately appear in the Dock Wallet.</p> Difference Between Public Key and Private Key Cryptography With an Example Every newly created DID comes with one or many private key and public keys.<p>Each DID comes with one or many private and public keys: </p>  Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign documents. It is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.  Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.   <p>You can have multiple private-public key pairs, and it’s good practice to generate new public keys when sharing information with a different party. This can be compared to using the same password for 10 different websites. It’s not safe to do this for security reasons. It’s better to have different and long complex passwords for all sites. Similarly, it’s better to generate a new public key for each party you share information with. </p><p>Example of how private and public keys would be used</p><p>Let’s say there’s a health and safety training organization that provides certification for construction safety and this course is a requirement for workers to get a job with a construction company. Here is how decentralized identity helps prevent fraud and enables organizations to save a lot of time and resources issuing and verifying credentials:</p>  Carl finishes the program and the training organization requests to connect with his digital identity wallet  When Carl authorizes the training organization to connect, the wallet shares his public DID in order for them to issue the credential.  The training organization signs the digital certificate of completion with their private key and issues the credential. Their public key is stored on the blockchain. The organization can easily and efficiently issue many credentials at the same time with a decentralized identity platform like Dock.  Carl would hold his credential on a digital wallet on his phone that he can bring everywhere.  Carl gives the construction company authorization to see his credentials without showing any unnecessary information about himself like his address and date of birth.  The company instantly verifies the authenticity of his credentials by scanning a QR code and not having to contact the issuer at all because the training organization’s public key is on the blockchain.  <p>Traditional certification verification processes would normally take a few weeks before he can start working because the construction company would have to manually contact the issuer. The previous verification process would be time-consuming and expensive. </p> Layers in the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem  Verifiable Credentials Nick explains the benefits of Verifiable Credentials.<p>Verifiable Credentials are a digital, cryptographically secured version of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification. A few of many examples of information that can be issued as Verifiable Credentials:</p>  Driver’s licenses  Passports  Professional certifications  Employee status  <p>When digital credentials conform to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.0</a>, which is a standard established by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), they can be referred to as Verifiable Credentials.</p>An example of a university degree issued as a Verifiable Credential that is stored on a Dock wallet.<p>Examples of Decentralized Identity Verification</p><p>Maintaining privacy is a major benefit of Verifiable Credentials. Let’s say there’s an on-demand food delivery company that requires applicants to have a valid driver’s license. The company can instantly check the Verifiable Credential to confirm that an applicant has a valid driver’s license. A verifiable presentation would allow an applicant, the holder, to show their license number without sharing unnecessary information like their full name or address. </p><p>In another example, a club’s staff member can scan the QR code of the holder’s Verifiable Credential to ensure they are at least 18 years old. The public DID of the government’s licensing department is on the blockchain which allows the club to verify the authenticity of the Verifiable Credential because the club trusts the department that issued the credential. The Verifiable Credentials create trust between the parties and guarantee the authenticity of the data and claims without actually storing data on the blockchain. &nbsp;</p><p>In another situation, Sofia just moved to Canada without a physical copy of her university degree and she needs to prove her field of study to receive a job offer. Her university then issues her a Verifiable Credential, which is the degree, that is associated with her DID and she can store this in her digital wallet. Sofia then presents the credential to the employer who can instantly verify its authenticity.</p><p>4. Decentralized Digital Identity Web3 Wallet</p><p>A decentralized digital identity wallet enables people to securely store, manage, and share DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. It’s comparable to a physical wallet that holds various IDs and claims about yourself like service cards, bank cards, and licenses. The Web3 wallet will store verified credential details like citizenship, employment, name, and address to prove eligibility, identity, or complete a transaction.</p><p>A mobile identity wallet stores information on the phone rather than a browser’s storage or cloud. The digital wallet allows people to access apps and services without revealing personal information. DIDs also prevent your devices from being tracked and correlated (data may be traced back to someone's identity or online behavior). Verifiers can connect to the user’s Web3 wallet and request data while the user always chooses when to give permission to share data. </p><p>Let’s say Anna wants to sign up for a cryptocurrency trading platform that requires a legal ID to access the site. </p>  The trading platform uses <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Dock’s Web3 ID</a> which allows users to sign into the platform in a way that preserves their privacy  <p>2. Anna uses her decentralized identity wallet, Dock’s wallet, to sign in and the platform requests a credential</p><p>3. Anna scans a QR code and authorizes the website to instantly verify her credential</p><p>4. Once she is verified, Anna can simply sign in with Web3 ID rather than having to create a new account and save another user name and password</p><p>A decentralized identity wallet allows you to have full control over who can access your data without providing any more details than necessary.</p> Decentralized Identity Use Cases <p>Here are just a few of many examples of how decentralized identity technology can solve many problems that result from traditional verification processes and centralized identity management systems in a variety of industries. </p><p>Use case</p><p>Current problem</p><p>Decentralized identity solution</p><p>Health and safety training</p><p>People can easily make fake certificates and in many cases this puts other people and organizations at risk when you have workers in jobs that they aren’t qualified for, especially medical doctors or jobs where that require heavy machinery operation.</p><p>Certification organizations can conveniently issue fraud-proof digital credentials at a lower cost than current traditional, manual processes.&nbsp;</p><p>Enhancing traceability in the food source supply chain</p><p>There are recurring foodborne illnesses that are hard to contain when contaminated food can’t be traced back to its origin.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Regulators are requiring more and more proofs about the origin of products, carbon footprint, use of polluting materials, and not using slave labour, which is very difficult to do.</p><p>Improving traceability in the food supply chain with decentralized identity technology can help prevent the spread of foodborne illness as the data of the contaminated food batch is tracked on blockchain and can be easily traced back to its origin.</p><p>Reducing counterfeit products</p><p>Companies lose a lot of money from product knock-offs and many customers are unknowingly buying fake products&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors join a platform where product data are tracked on the blockchain. Customers can use an app to scan a product QR code to verify that they’re buying an authentic product.</p><p>Financial services</p><p>The verification process to determine eligibility for a loan is time-consuming for the financial institution and the customer.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine applying for a loan and quickly being vetted by banks by only sharing the information that is relevant and removing the majority of manual verification. This could reduce costs and the application time from weeks to days. The bank <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot8-barcelona/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/universal-ledger-agent.md?mc_cid=6984003f25">Rabobank is&nbsp; exploring decentralized identity</a> to reduce mortgage application times.</p><p>Employee ID management</p><br><p>Organizations could issue digital credentials around a person’s role and department that are saved in an employee’s Web3 wallet on their phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Online shopping</p><br><p>Someone could verify their identity on an online store with their DID, which contains the necessary data to buy online including the shopper’s address and credit card information.&nbsp;</p> Summary of Key Terms<br> <p>Blockchain: A decentralized database that is shared among computers in the blockchain network that records information in a way that makes it very difficult to change, hack, or cheat the system.</p><p>Centralized identity management: Administrative control by a single authority or Hierarchy.</p><p>Decentralized digital identity wallet: Enables people to securely store, manage, and share DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Cryptographically verifiable identifiers created by the user, owned by the user, and independent of any organization. DIDs contain no personally identifiable information.</p><p>Decentralized identity: A type of identity management that allows people to control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider.</p><p>Digital identity: The body of information about an individual, organization, or electronic device that exists online, including search history and user names.</p><p>Federated identity management: ​​Allows authorized users to access multiple applications and domains with a single set of credentials like when people can use their Google or Facebook to sign into websites or apps.</p><p>Holder: A user who creates their decentralized identifier with a digital wallet app and receives the Verifiable Credential.</p><p>Issuer: The organization that signs a Verifiable Credential with their private key and issues it to the holder.</p><p>Private key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that allows people to prove ownership, give consent to share selected data, and sign documents. It is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. As an analogy, a private key is like a master key that can access all of your information and the owner should never share their private key with anyone.</p><p>Public key: Made up of a long string of letters and numbers that can safely be shared with anyone you choose to give specific information to.</p><p>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI): A model that gives individuals full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party. This term is often used interchangeably with the term “decentralized identity.”</p><p>Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digital cryptographically-secure versions of both paper and digital credentials that people can present to organizations that need them for verification.</p><p>Verifier: A party that checks the credentials and can read the issuer’s public DID on the blockchain to verify if the Verifiable Credential the holder shared was signed by the issuer’s DID.</p> Conclusion <p>Decentralized identity is a type of identity management that allows people to own, and control their own digital identity without depending on a specific service provider. Decentralized identity technology is solving many of the problems resulting from centralized and federated identity management systems, including widespread certificate fraud, slow and expensive verification processes, and risks of data breaches.</p><p>Decentralized Technology Benefits</p><p>Organizations</p><p>Individuals</p><p>Developers</p><p>Allows them to instantly verify information without having to contact the issuing party like a certification organization or university to ensure someone’s ID and credentials are valid</p><p>Full ownership and control of their identity and credentials as there is no dependence on any party to prove their claims</p><p>Build user-centric apps that eliminate the need for passwords and inefficient authentication processes</p><p>Issuing organizations can provide Verifiable Credentials at a much lower cost while increasing efficiency</p><p>No party can take away people’s decentralized identity and credentials&nbsp;</p><p>Securely request data directly from users while maintaining their privacy</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People can decide which information they want to reveal to specific parties, such as a government or employer</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Easily create and manage their decentralized identity and credentials with a digital wallet app</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

<p>Grazie all’innovazione delle proprie soluzioni di firma, anche quest’anno InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” pubblicata a luglio 2022. Questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader internazionali nel segmento di Firma Digitale.</p>



<p>La firma elettronica si sta avvicinando sempre di più al concetto di Commodity ed è sempre più spesso offerta come funzionalità di base nelle piattaforme di gestione documentale e workflow approvativi. Molte organizzazioni che in passato hanno acquistato e implementato la firma elettronica all’interno dei loro processi stanno rivalutando l’investimento fatto a favore di soluzioni in grado di garantire maggiore affidabilità, sicurezza e compliance. </p>



<p>In Europa, l’adozione di questo tipo di soluzioni è stata maggiormente complessa, soprattutto tra il 2020 e il 2022, in quanto le organizzazioni sono diventate più sensibili ai requisiti legali e normativi per ridurre i rischi di frode e hanno avuto la necessità di integrare le applicazioni precedentemente implementate con fornitori di servizi fiduciari specifici per ogni Paese.</p>



<p>Tra le maggiori complessità va citata quella di avere la certezza rispetto all’identità degli interlocutori di business nei processi di approvazione e firma dei documenti: le funzioni legate all’identificazione degli utenti sono sempre più importanti in quanto spesso richieste dal punto di vista normativo nei casi d’uso B2C e per le transazioni ad alto rischio. Queste funzioni possono includere l’autenticazione forte degli utenti, la verifica dell’identità, l’integrazione di Digital Identity Wallet o l’uso di certificati digitali emessi dauna Certification Authority. In questo scenario la rilevanza strategica dei Qualified Trust Service Provider (qTSP) e delle piattaforme di onboarding è aumentata considerevolmente, rendendo player come InfoCert il naturale interlocutore per la realizzazione di progetti di digitalizzazione dei processi.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/it/soluzioni/transazioni-e-flussi-approvativi-digitali/">GoSign</a>, la piattaforma di firma InfoCert ha, presentato nel 2022 numerose novità che hanno valso alla società il riconoscimento di “Representative Vendor” da parte di Gartner nel Global Market. In particolare, fra le innovazioni recenti è utile menzionare i processi di identificazione “On the Fly” di utenti esterni ad una organizzazione, che possono essere coinvolti in un processo di firma anche senza aver alcun certificato, e che vengono identificati in pochi minuti tramite VideoChat o SPID, e dotati di una firma digitale OTP che garantisce pieno valore legale alle transazioni.</p>



<p>Un altro elemento introdotto recentemente, che fa di GoSign una piattaforma sempre più scalabile e versatile a livello globale, è l’adeguamento agli standard della normativa descritta nel Titolo 21 CFR Parte 11 della Food and Drug Administration, la quale rende la soluzione competitiva per tutte le aziende e multinazionali del mondo Pharma che devono rispettare i requisiti della norma.</p>



<blockquote><p>Nonostante la proliferazione delle funzionalità di firma elettronica, i complessi requisiti normativi possono complicare alcuni casi d’uso. Security e Risk Manager devono trovare un equilibrio tra identità, conformità, sicurezza dei dati, strategia aziendale e IT nella scelta delle soluzioni.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>Grazie alla Market Guide for Electronic Signature di Gartner, orientarsi fra le diverse soluzioni ed esplorare il mercato della firma elettronica è alla portata di tutti; Il report è ormai un punto di riferimento per professionisti e aziende del settore IT e soluzioni tecnologiche, con lo scopo di guidare professionisti e imprese nella valutazione delle soluzioni presenti sul mercato offerte dai diversi provider in ambito Firma Digitale e Servizi Fiduciari.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en">Gartner</a> è una società per azioni multinazionale che si occupa di consulenza strategica, ricerca e analisi nel campo della tecnologia dell’informazione con oltre 15.000 clienti nel mondo, opera da oltre 40 anni, e come IT Advisor anche quest’anno ha rilasciato la sua guida per il mercato della Firma Digitale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anche quest’anno, InfoCert è stata riconosciuta fra i Representative Vendors nella “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” uscita a luglio 2022, questa importante menzione consolida il posizionamento di InfoCert tra i leader del settore Firma Digitale.</p>

<p>Thanks to the innovation of its signature solutions, once again this year InfoCert has been recognized among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors&nbsp;in the July 2022 Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature. This important quote consolidates InfoCert as a leader in the Digital Signature market.</p>



<p>The market of electronic signature has become largely commoditized, and simple electronic signature is increasingly offered as a basic feature in most document management and approval workflow platforms. Many organizations that have integrated electronic signatures in their processes in the past are re-evaluating their investment in solutions that provide greater&nbsp;reliability, security, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Europe, the adoption of these kind of solutions was more complex, especially between 2020 and 2022, as organizations became more sensitive to legal and regulatory requirements to reduce fraud risks and needed to integrate applications previously implemented with local trust service providers for each country</p>



<p>One of the major complexities is to be sure of the identity of recipients within an approval workflow and signing process: these features are increasingly important as they are often required by regulations in B2C use cases and for high-risk transactions. Certainty of identity can include strong user authentication, identity verification, integration of Digital Identity Wallet, or the use of digital certificates issued by a Certification Authority. In this scenario, Qualified Trust Service Providers (qTSP) and onboarding platforms are becoming more and more important, and players like InfoCert are now the right partner to implement digitalization projects.</p>



<p><a href="https://infocert.digital/solutions/digital-transaction-and-approval/">GoSign</a>, the InfoCert signature platform, introduced in 2022 several innovations that made it possible for the company to be designated “Representative Vendor” by Gartner on the global market. Among these innovations, we can mention the&nbsp;“On the Fly”&nbsp;identification process of a stranger or external user, who can now be involved in a signing process even without any signature certificate: GoSign let these recipients be identified in a few minutes through Video Chat or eIdentity and provided with an OTP based e-signature that guarantees full legal value to transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new version, GoSign became, even more, a scalable and versatile platform at a global level, thanks to the adaptation to the requirements described in Title 21 CFR Part 11 of the Food and Drug Administration, which makes the solution competitive for all Pharma companies at global level which must comply with the requirements of this regulation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Despite the proliferation of e-signature capabilities,&nbsp;complex regulatory requirements&nbsp;can increase the complexity of some use cases. Security and Risk Manager must reach a&nbsp;balance&nbsp;between identity, compliance, data security, business strategy, and IT in choosing solutions.</p></blockquote>



<p>&nbsp;The Gartner’s Market Guide for Electronic Signature, support you finding your way through the different solutions and exploring the electronic signature market ; The report is&nbsp;a point of reference for professionals and companies in the IT sector and technological solutions, with the aim of guiding professionals and companies in the evaluation of the solutions on the market offered by the various providers in the field of Digital Signature and Trust Services.</p>



<p>Gartner is a multinational joint-stock company that deals with strategic consulting, research and analysis in IT sector with over 15,000 customers worldwide, has been operating for over 40 years, and as IT Advisor also this year has released its guide for the Digital Signature market. InfoCert was named &nbsp;among the&nbsp;Representative Vendors in the “Gartner Market Guide for Electronic Signature” released in July 2022,&nbsp;this important mention consolidates infoCert’s positioning among the leaders in the Digital Signature sector.</p>

<p>FCW reports that a bill focused on increasing federal government participation in the digital identity ecosystem has been reintroduced in&nbsp; the House and a counterpart has been&nbsp; created and introduced to the Senate. The goal of these bills is to “set up a task force on digital identity and establish a grant program at the Department of Homeland Security to support the creation of interoperable identity credentialing systems for digital identity verification on the state and local level.” The original bill was drafted in 2020, spurred by the increase in identity fraud that has occurred during the COVID 19 pandemic, but was never voted out of committee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202207/will-eu-digital-identity-drop-the-unique-identifier&nbsp;">Will EU digital identity drop the unique identifier?</a></p>
<p>As reported by Biometric Update, the European Union has been working on a digital ID system that would allow member states to issue digital identification to their citizens for travel across borders or proving their identity in general across the EU. However, it appears that EU officials are having second thoughts on a key element of the proposed ID system — a mandate for all EU members to incorporate unique identifiers in their digital IDs. As privacy advocates have pointed out, a unique identifier for each person would mean they could be tracked across any government database.</p>
<p>Such a tracking device would be currently illegal in both the Netherlands and Austria, and unconstitutional in Germany. New language in a proposed amendment from the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy opens the door to technical solutions that secure personal data and ensure trust, such as “cryptographically verifiable identifiers, unique user-generated digital pseudonyms, self-sovereign identities and domain specific identifiers using state of the art encryption technology.”</p>
<p><a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2022/07/why-digital-identity-will-make-or-break-the-metaverse/&nbsp;">Why digital identity will make or break the Metaverse</a></p>
<p>In a comment piece in Engineering and Technology, Onfido’s Matt Peake argues that with marquee brands like Coke and Nike creating experiences in the metaverse, verified identities are critical to preventing fraud:</p>
<p>“Without verified identities in the Metaverse, anonymous bots can wreak havoc. For businesses, business people and celebrities, impersonators can cause damage to their brand and reputation, not to mention the new opportunities it creates for scammers and fraudsters. Ensuring trusted identity will therefore be fundamental to the safety and success of the Metaverse.”</p>
<p>While anonymity is ok, there must be a real person behind the avatar, says Peake. Age verification is critical too — in fact, all the problems we have with identity online are likely to cause havoc in this emerging virtual space. While Peake says the time to address this is now, as the Metaverse is being created, he is short on actual solutions to verify identities. Not so at Indicio, we’re working with Bonifii and Liquid Avatar Technologies to implement privacy-preserving verifiable credentials and decentralized identity in the Metaverse now.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digit.fyi/young-people-at-greater-risk-of-falling-victim-to-identity-fraud/&nbsp;">Young people at greater risk of falling victim to identity fraud</a></p>
<p>GBG, a UK-based identity verification, location intelligence and fraud prevention company, has released its <a href="https://www.gbgplc.com/en/identity-verification/the-state-of-digital-identity-2022/">State of Digital Identities 2022 report</a>. Key findings: Mobile business is increasingly conducted through smart phones, with 67% of decision makers at companies saying that they conduct business this way. And — contrary to what one might expect — young people are more likely to be the victims of digital fraud than those aged over 55: 13% of people aged 18 to 24 across Europe have been victims in the past 12 months, 12% for 25 – 34, and 9% for 35-44, compared to only 4% for 55 and older. One possible reason—younger generations may expect security to be built into the tech they use, with only 62% of young adults responding that it’s their responsibility to protect their information (in contrast to the average of 76% that said it was the user’s responsibility across all age groups).</p>
<p>“Young adults are often labeled by businesses as the most tech-savvy demographic. But there is a large section of this age group who believe dealing with online security should be companies’ responsibility, rather than them looking after it themselves.”</p>

<p>Buy and sell data with H2O, a stable asset backed by&nbsp;OCEAN</p><p>H2O can now be used as a base token on Ocean Market, allowing data buyers and sellers to benefit from more price stability. Let’s dive deep into what H2O is and what benefits it brings to the whole Ocean ecosystem.</p> What is Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> is a decentralized data marketplace that enables publishers to monetize their data and/or algorithms through <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/">Compute-to-Data</a>, Ocean’s latest privacy-preserving approach.</p><p>Ocean Market allows access to data, algorithms, and compute services via datatokens and offers monetisation opportunities for stakers who provide veOCEAN to promising data assets. Every transaction in Ocean Market and Ocean backend generates transaction fees, some of which go to the community. 50% of the community fees will go to veOCEAN holders; the rest will go to OceanDAO&nbsp;grants.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p><a href="https://www.h2odata.xyz/">H2O</a> is an OCEAN-backed, non-pegged stable asset, aiming to be the de facto medium of exchange within the entire Web3 Data ecosystem and based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, H2O is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and also H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for H2O this has been&nbsp;~$1.60.</p><p>One can get H2O by either (a) locking OCEAN to mint H2O, <a href="https://app.h2odata.xyz/#/">via the H2O dapp</a>, or (b) by buying H2O in an exchange such as the <a href="https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x0642026e7f0b6ccac5925b4e7fa61384250e1701&amp;outputCurrency=ETH&amp;chain=mainnet">Uniswap H2O-WETH&nbsp;pool</a>.</p> How is H2O Used in Ocean&nbsp;Market? <p>A “base token” in Ocean Market is a token that can be used to price data for buying and selling and to stake on data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Prior to this integration, only OCEAN was available as a base token in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>With this update/integration?, Ocean Market has added H2O as a base token. Upon publishing a data asset, the publisher can choose whether to use OCEAN or H2O&nbsp;[1].</p><p>This means that H2O can be used to price data in fixed-rate exchange.</p> What are the benefits? <p>Since data can be priced in H2O, and H2O fluctuates far less than OCEAN, then H2O in Ocean Market mitigates the volatility of the price of the data, since H2O fluctuates far less than&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>First, data sellers get more predictable revenue. Revenue is no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price.</p><p>Second, data buyers have more predictable costs. Costs are no longer dependent on OCEAN&nbsp;price</p> Conclusion <p>H2O, the OCEAN-backed stable asset, is now available in Ocean Market! This means better data pricing stability: data sellers get more predictable revenue, and buyers get more predictable costs.</p> Notes <p>Ocean Protocol backend components allow for any token as a base token, not just OCEAN or H2O. It’s the frontend — Ocean Market — that only explicitly supports the usage of OCEAN or&nbsp;H2O.</p><p>Builders of third-party marketplaces powered by Ocean (e.g. forks of Ocean Market) can readily pick other tokens for their market.

<p>In my last blog,<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title=" vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,"> vLEI 101 – the Verifiable Legal Entity Identifier,</a> I spoke about the potential of the vLEI. In the brief outline of the wider vLEI eco-system we saw that there were a number of types of Verifiable Credential:</p>
 
 LE-vLEI: a credential providing LEI data for the organisation 
 LE-OOR: a credential providing information about an individual holding a specific formal role within the organisation 
 LE-ECR: a credential providing information about an individual who has a ‘user defined’ role in relation to an organisation. 
 
<p>The credentials are issued by a Qualified vLEI Issuer, a QVI, and stored in a wallet. Let’s look at that in a bit more detail to understand what is going on.</p>
 The role of the QVI 
<p>We started off our last blog assuming a basic understanding of the LEI. The LEI is a 20 digit code that identifies a legal entity and can be used to look up data in real time from the GLEIS, a public database managed by the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">GLEIF</a>. The LEI itself is issued by an ‘LEI Issuer’ known as an LOU. LOUs are entities that are accredited by the GLEIF and audited yearly to ensure they are perform inline with the defined frameworks.</p>
<p>It is very similar for vLEIs. vLEIs are issued by a ‘Qualified vLEI Issuer’, known as a QVI. An organisation wishing to become a QVI must define processes and systems that adhere to the vLEI governance framework and pass an initial qualification from the GLEIF, and then undertake yearly audits by the GLEIF.</p>
<p>The QVI has to follow a precise process to issue any of the previously listed credentials, which involve the checking of the LEI, the identity assurance of individuals involved and finally the technical issuance process itself.</p>
<p>The GLEIF is still finalising the process definitions but we expect to see initial QVIs launching within the next 6 months or so.</p>
 What does an issued credential look like? 
<p>As we discussed previously, credentials are designed to be understood by computers. This allows the holder of the credential to present the credential during a transaction to make a statement that can be understood by the ‘computer’ processing the request.</p>
<p>The issued credential is a machine readable format, typically in a json format. They are not meant to be directly read by the holder, instead credentials are accessed, displayed, and ‘used’ by an application, a ‘wallet’.</p>
<p>It should be noted there are a few different formats of credentials which means there are different wallets. On top of this, there are many different ways in which a computer can check the credential and so the wallet must present the credential in the right format for the intended end use, and this can mean a different wallet per use case.</p>
 The credential wallet 
<p>The various credentials, that you might have, are stored in a wallet. This is an application, often residing on your mobile device, that securely holds the credential data, provides a user interface so you can examine the contents of the wallet, and provides functionality for using the credentials stored within.</p>
<p>Wallets on mobile devices are not new, the iPhone provides a wallet for a variety of items, such as payment cards and boarding passes. The idea is the same, but the iPhone wallet is not a Verifiable Credential wallet.</p>
<p>The wallet residing on your mobile device is actually a significant concept. In ‘classical’ identity systems the claims about ‘you’ are held by an Identity Provider, and when someone wants to access one of those claims they contact that (central) identity provider for the details. This means that the identity provider knows who you are sharing claims with, and in many cases the level of data shared is greater than the need of the person asking. The typical example here is sharing your date of birth as proof you are over 18.</p>
<p>The alternative to this centralised identity is a system where you hold all the information about you and get to decide what information to share in response to any given request. This is known as Self Sovereign Identity and is enabled by the credential wallet.</p>
<p>When a service needs to know some information about ‘you’ it will generate something called a Presentation Request. This is often in the form of a QR code that you scan with the wallet app. The App will decide the request, see what claims are being asked for and then present you with that information and let you choose how to respond using the various items of information you have in the wallet. You are now in control of who is being told what, and you are the central store of the claims. Your bank might have generated the credential you will use, but it has no connection to whoever or whatever you are now sharing that information with, so the recipient cannot track your usage of that information.</p>
<p>All of this is well and good, however there is a challenge here. The credentials are all using strong cryptographic techniques to secure and protect the data, and to give service providers confidence that the claims are un-altered and issued by trusted parties. This strong cryptographic protection requires some complex management to take place, and in the wallet system, as described, this also falls to you, the user, as you are managing your attributes. There is a solution to this, the custodial wallet.</p>
 Custodial Wallet 
<p>A custodial wallet is where a third party provides a hosted wallet for you and takes care of the cryptographic management. Of course, this ease of maintenance comes with a slight reduction in overall security – another party is controlling your cryptographic keys, but in many instances that trade off is for the best.</p>
<p>This extra dimension increases the number of wallets available; not only do you have differing credential types, differing verification methods, but now also differing providers of wallets.</p>
 Wallets Everywhere 
<p>In the short term you should expect to see a number of wallets appearing, both on your mobile and through cloud services. Over time, the differences will be incorporated, and wallets will become more general purpose and there will be consolidation.</p>
 Wallets and vLEI 
<p>The vLEI is no different to any other credential and requires a wallet to be issued into. GLEIF are building the wallet capability following the pilot issuance project for the signing of the 2021 accounts. It is likely that the first wallets will be custodial (hosted) and provided by the QVIs to simplify the overall process for the legal entities who are obtaining vLEIs.</p>
<p>In my next blog we will look at how the wider issuance process for the vLEI credentials works. In the meantime, if you would like to know more about the vLEI, about Verified Credentials or about how the world of Verified Credentials interacts with the classical identity world please get in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/contact/" title="contact with us">contact with us</a>.</p>

</p><p>Paper-based IDs have long been a globally accepted standard mode of identity presentation. However, it is vulnerable to high risks of loss and fraud, in addition to being largely irrelevant in digital domains. With the recent digitization of many services, there are increasing number of opportunities for our personal identities to be used online in our daily lives. Personal identities and related information has importance in fintech platforms, healthcare systems, e-commerce, and social networking. To connect digitally, we must provide personal information such as our name, date of birth, address, credit card number, and other details.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there is increasing concern about the privacy implications of using personally identifiable information online. The current digital identification architecture is primarily centralized, meaning identity information is stored on centralized servers owned by specific entities, resulting in an entirely different paradigm of concerns. By doing so, we are trusting external entities to maintain the privacy of our data.</p>



<p>Individuals do not have meaningful ownership of their credentials in the centralized model and have no security of their personal data. Although internet users can be confident that the websites they visit are legitimate, there is no reliable way of determining the identities of individuals, organizations, and other entities that govern those websites or with whom users interact and trade. Despite superior security, the use of centralized servers makes digital identity management systems vulnerable to multiple cyber attacks. Entities may be bound by legal agreements such as data privacy agreements but technically it is still possible for them to misuse information. . Also, there is a big question mark on the privacy of data stored on servers of the platforms. Planform can use this data for monetization by sharing it with others.</p>



<p>When it comes to making digital identities more secure, a global public utility approach is preferred. That's where Decentralize Identity comes into the picture. It is based on the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) means giving complete control to individuals over their identity and credentials without any dependency on the administrative body or third party. The SSI has the concept of verifiable credentials to store and share the identity and other data in which the individual is the ultimate owner of their identity and has complete control over its storage, distribution, and third-party access.&nbsp; SSI is not a new concept however combining it with blockchain brings transparency and trust in data ownership. Above all, the SSID ecosystem eliminates centralized storage, instead relying on Blockchain technology and cryptography to ensure trust, transparency, and integrity of data.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity implementation</p>



<p>There are three entities involved. The Issuer issues the verifiable credentials to the user via its own verification process, the User with an identity stored in the SSI Wallet APP, and the Verifier who verifies the presented credentials by the user. Users can acquire different credentials from different issuers using the keys stored in SSI wallet APP. These credentials can be securely shared while using platforms that trust the issuer. The features like selective disclosure, Zero-knowledge proof gives complete control of privacy to users over their data while sharing it with a verifier.</p>







<p>This solution can be utilized in various domains including Healthcare applications, Fintech, Educational records, Document management, and so on. SPARK has a decentralized identity solution &amp; various pluggable components ready to Whitelabel for businesses. Feel free to comment with your thoughts and reach out to us to know more.

<p>In this Voices of the Data Economy episode, we spoke to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikanth-kaja-6a335789/?originalSubdomain=sg">Srikanth Kaja</a>. He is the General Manager of Emerging Technologies in <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.com.sg/?group=all&amp;subgroup=see-all&amp;view=BODYTYPE">Daimler South East&nbsp;Asia.</a></p><p><a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik </a>is a decentralized data marketplace by Mercedes-Benz, powered by Blockchain Technology. During our conversation, we spoke about how enterprises can use blockchain technology to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner and the road ahead for enterprise adoption of web3. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;episode:</p><p>What is Acentrik? And what problem is it&nbsp;solving?</p><p>Acentrik is a B2B data marketplace powered by blockchain technology, built using the Ocean stack. It has two strong use&nbsp;cases</p>  To enable companies to buy and sell data over the blockchain  To enable companies to monetize data in a privacy-preserving manner.  <p>This is done by enabling data consumers to run algorithms on data behind a firewall without ever revealing the raw&nbsp;data.</p><blockquote>“Data availability and quality is important to scale enterprises, not just within Mercedes-Benz, but also in every enterprise out there. This is why we developed Acentrik, materializing the concept of digital assets representation on the Blockchain. Our aim is to build one horizontal technology across multiple different verticals that maintain data sovereignty. This means that the ownership and storage of the data stays with the data owners and not on the platform. The role of Acentrik, as a marketplace, is to enable the monetization of the data and ensure that data providers are easily connected with consumers in various industries while maintaining data sovereignty.”</blockquote><p>Enterprise data sharing: How can it be optimized?</p><blockquote>“There are multiple reasons and issues that prevent enterprises from sharing data. Enterprises have very different requirements around who should be able to publish, view or buy datasets. They fear the threat of losing control on their data or they chose not to monetise their data because of the value and sensitivity of that data (particularly in the context of GDPR). But these issues can be tackled with the right blockchain solution.”</blockquote><p>For instance, Acentrik veers away from the traditional centralized data management model of enterprises, providing more reasons for them to monetize data as they do not face the threat of losing control of their data. Monetization is now an option for enterprises, as in the past they held data without the consideration of unlocking the value of data in their data. With that, there is a potential loss of revenue for themselves and the industry. Secondly, Acentrik as a data marketplace is domain agnostic, which as part of data monetization, offers a strategic advantage to tap on data across industries, directly to the data&nbsp;sources.</p><blockquote>“Acentrik ensures data sovereignty with the Compute-to-Data feature. Privacy-preserving compute jobs run in the data owners’ premises behind a firewall, without ever revealing the raw data to the consumer. It is a win-win situation, data consumers get insights by running algorithms on the data, building towards a better business case for their enterprise, while data providers monetize their data and stay in control of their&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://acentrik.medium.com/acentriks-enterprise-release-new-features-revealed-20dac67825a">You can read more about Acentrik’s enterprise release and its new features&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>How Ocean Protocol is supporting Acentrik</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol,</a> has joined forces with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a>, on its recently launched Enterprise Release. Acentrik is a fork of Ocean Market and makes use of the OceanONDA V4 smart contracts and libraries. As part of the collaboration, the most important Ocean features have been leveraged and integrated into Acentrik V1.0 and key adaptations for enterprise users.</p><p>Acentrik’s collaboration with Ocean Protocol began in 2020, with a proof of concept exploring decentralized data orchestration for Mercedes-Benz. The pilot project was successful and this led to further collaboration and development of Acentrik Version&nbsp;1.0.</p><p>How to make your blockchain solution enterprise-ready?</p><blockquote>“For enterprises, data often needs to be kept private. The Compute-to-Data feature means that private data isn’t directly shared but rather specific access to it is granted. Algorithms are able to be run on the data behind a firewall without the raw data ever being revealed.”</blockquote><p>By opening up this possibility, private data can now help enterprises in their research, leading to more significant innovation. For example, more data improves the predictive accuracy of modern AI models. Private data is also often considered the most valuable data because it’s so hard to discover, and using it can lead to potentially big&nbsp;payoffs.</p><p>Concepts like Compute-to-data, Asset Management Token and Fine-grained Permissions may appear abstract to enterprises who are new to the Web3 world — but it is important to ensure these concepts are broken down and translatable to applications in the business world. This is seen in use cases for enterprises across industries.</p><p>A case-in-point is a cross-domain use case of harnessing data from the healthcare and insurance industries to shape clinical research and care. Through data points from outpatient medical treatments, paired with algorithms derived from past insurance claims over a period of time, this presents analysis and derivations to precise medical supplies for pharmaceutical companies. This example by itself is achieved by Compute-to-Data, where data is kept on the premise of the hospitals, clinics and insurance companies. Algorithms are brought to the data and compute jobs run on the premise of the data&nbsp;owner.</p><blockquote>“Being enterprise-ready also meant that access and control to multiple users are important factors to actors on Acentrik. Through our tokens like our ERC20 datatoken, which represents the access to a particular asset on the marketplace and ERC721 token which is Acentrik Asset Management Token, representing the control of a specific asset on Acentrik. Fine-grained permissions are live at various levels such as at a role-level of publish and consume, and also at an asset-level of delegating roles such minter, editing, publishing etc. There are simply many combinations that can be configured for enterprises based on their permissions required for individual users”</blockquote><p>A large part of being enterprise-ready is to have the right level of access control and publishing restrictions within Acentrik. Datatokens primarily control access, but enterprises often need more precise ways to specify and manage access, and fine-grained permissions need to be introduced for these use cases. Fine-grained permissions mean that access can be controlled precisely at two levels: Marketplace-level permissions for browsing, consuming, or publishing within a marketplace frontend. This is handled by our role-based access control server. Asset-level permissions on a specific asset is controlled by two credentials, email domain and/or wallet address, to add to allow/deny lists, maintained in the asset’s metadata.</p><blockquote>“Blockchain will likely shift from concept to necessity — which is inevitable for enterprises to embrace this technology for systems and business models. The Web3 world is a community-focused one that enterprises will realize and contribute towards the same in different forms”</blockquote><p>What next?</p><p>Acentrik is now in Enterprise Release! Experience the new line-up of features on the marketplace, which are implemented to answer to pilot customers’ needs. Acentrik is now ready to onboard companies with data products, creating a supply and demand and implementing use cases. While this is being planned, further scaling of the product is ongoing, with plans to deploy to other blockchain networks and stabilize the whole production platform.

Digital ID&nbsp;Wallet<p>So far in the GlobaliD 101 series, we’ve explored:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-how-digital-identity-should-work-fc53ede7b86f">Part 1:</a> What a smart and humanistic approach to digital identity would&nbsp;like  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-101-what-is-the-trust-triangle-260e85e1c640">Part 2:</a> The Trust Triangle — the system of issuers, holders, and verifiers that illustrates how identity works (and how it’s broken,&nbsp;today)  <p>Now, we’re getting to the exciting part. We know identity is broken. We also know what great digital identity that works for you, the individual, looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>But how do we get&nbsp;there?</p><p>The first step is to make digital identity incredibly convenient, fun, and useful for end users. These are the people who will go out and interact with their communities, purchase goods and services, and build businesses.</p><p>In the physical world, we rely on identifying documentation. That might be your driver’s license, your insurance card, or your passport. In our daily lives, we’ll keep the most commonly used forms of ID in our&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In the digital future, things won’t look all that different. You’ll keep digital forms of relevant documents in your digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>It’s easy to understand the benefits of digitization:</p>  It’s convenient. All your relevant documents are in one accessible place. The only thing you’ll need to keep in your actual wallet is cash. As the digital identity ecosystem develops, your interactions and transactions will become seamless.  It’s yours. This is your ID wallet. You own and control your identity and your&nbsp;data.  It’s secure. If you lose your wallet, it’s gone, and your information is out there. That’s not the case with a locked smartphone. Plus, you’ll have a backup. Another aspect is the ability to selectively share only relevant data. If you’re buying a bottle of wine, you don’t need to share your entire driver’s license. You don’t even need to share your actual date of birth. You only need to share the fact that you’re over 21 (for those in the&nbsp;U.S.).  <p>Big Tech companies like Apple are already making progress on this front, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/03/apple-launches-the-first-drivers-license-and-state-id-in-wallet-with-arizona/">piloting a program</a> that allows users to keep their driver’s license in their Apple Wallet. The difference with Apple’s approach, of course, is that their solution isn’t portable or interoperable. In regular person terms, it just means that you’re stuck on Apple’s closed ecosystem — no surprise.</p><p>While progress is being made, these are still early days. Apple’s pilot, for instance, will be rolled out in a limited number of&nbsp;states.</p><p>All of which means that people are still sending photos of their driver’s license to their AirBnb host for identity verification.</p><p>That’s crazy insecure!</p><p>What if instead, you could securely and selectively share your ID with an expiring link? Your name and photo will be visible but other private details will be blurred out. Your Airbnb now believes you are who you say you are because they also trust the issuer of your digital credential. Likewise, you don’t have to worry that a copy of your full license is on a stranger’s phone forever. Everyone rests easy, and you enjoy the heck out of your vacation.</p><p>Need to provide a copy of your ID to an AirBNB host? Just send them a link to your driver’s license which you’ve stored in your ID wallet. You can make your name and photo visible, while everything else is blurred out. That way the host only sees what you want them to. You can also set a time limit for how long your ID is available. That way nobody has a copy of your license indefinitely.</p><p>The same applies across all your online interactions and transactions. No more taking photos of your ID for each new platform or service. No more digging through the safe for your passport. No more calling the customer support because you lost your insurance card.</p><p>Life is just easier with a digital ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> Venture into the digital future confidently <p>What’s even more exciting is where we go from here. With people using a trusted ID wallet, businesses (verifiers) can rethink how they manage identity and trust in the context of their customers, an effort that costs businesses $592 trillion per&nbsp;day.</p><p>The World Wide Web Consortium (w3c) also reached <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/01/w3c_overrules_objections/">a major milestone</a> this month around digital identifier (DID) standards, which will become a formal recommendation despite pushback from Big Tech. Just like the internet, open and interoperable protocols will allow any company or project to easily integrate these digital identity standards, paving the way toward mainstream adoption and far-reaching accessibility.</p><p>Since your digital identity is built on open standards, your identity will also be portable like your mobile phone number is today. Rather than being stuck with a certain provider or platform, you’ll be able to easily transfer your identity from one ID wallet to another. Software developers will compete for your patronage by developing the best possible products.</p><p>Imagine a world where you own your identity and your data rather than corporations or the government. You finally hold the keys to your own destiny. You share only what you need to in a secure and private fashion. Rather than logging onto your Facebook account, you log on as&nbsp;you.</p><p>And unlike your Facebook account, which isn’t all that credible, you’ll be able to do important things with your digital identity, such as remotely opening up a bank account. Since digital formats are far more flexible in the context of expressing trust and reputation, this will have a profound impact on financial inclusion for the billions of people who lack traditional identifying documentation.</p><p>In the future, we’ll see a convergence between our physical and digital identities with everything easily managed in one place. With one identity, you’ll be able to purchase celebratory drinks with your friends or hang out in the Metaverse.</p><p>It all starts with your ID&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/_GlobaliD">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-id-inc?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnMJDT8IXrg4Y5RDP4W0aOw">YouTube</a> to learn more about GlobaliD.
