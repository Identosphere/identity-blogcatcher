<p>I want to introduce you to the second season of my podcast, Making of the SRE Omelette. This season explores achieving our sustainability goals via the practice of Site Reliability Engineering.</p>



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b/31c40cd3?audiogram=true">“Culture is the outcome of what we do. In the context of the chicken or the egg, it is like an omelette.”</a> – Kareem Yusuf, SVP IBM Software</p>



<p>Wondering what does an omelette has to do with SRE? It is based on the analogy from Kareem that culture is the outcome of what we do. So in the context of the chicken or the egg, it is like an omelette, the mixed together, fully cooked product. From this idea, a podcast was born that I called Making of the SRE Omelette.</p>



 Season 1 of Making of the SRE Omelette 



<p>In the first year, this podcast captured insights from industry experts, surfacing practices and perspectives that led them to achieve business and client success outcomes using the practice of Site Reliability Engineering.</p>



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b">Season 1</a> has over 500 minutes of content. It was a hit with our community of listeners in over 21 countries and ranked in the top 20% of most followed podcasts on Spotify.</p>


<a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b/ac35cf55">Listen to the season 2 preview</a>



 Season 2 looks at reliable sustainability 



<p>I’m thrilled to say that Making of the SRE Omelette kicked off its season two on Earth Day with the theme of reliable sustainability. Sustainability is front and center of many conversations today, from boardrooms to living rooms. But does being sustainable simply mean reducing carbon footprint, or does it mean more?</p>



<p>In season 2 of the podcast, I will talk to experts to understand the meaning of sustainability and the outcomes we should be targeting. And of course, I will tie to all back to how the practice of Site Reliability Engineering can help and lead us to achieve those outcomes.</p>



 Released on Earth Day are the following episodes: 



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b/7dd7ff1a">Episode 1: Sustainability Explained</a></p>



<p>Joining us to demystify sustainability and kick off Season 2 is Christina Shim.</p>



<p>Christina explains sustainability as leaving the planet better than we are now—meet today’s needs and also making sure demands of tomorrow can be met as well. She explains the ESG framework and goes to highlight we shouldn’t let the conversation stop at what fits into the bucket of ESG.</p>



<p>Christina has a set of call to actions for all of us to take at the personal, team and organization level to make a difference now. Listen in as we take on the pledge to arrive at a more sustainable future.</p>



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b/2c17b491">Episode 2: Reliable Sustainability</a></p>



<p>Sustainability is no longer just an ambition, over the last few years, we’re starting to see companies actively doing things and changing their behaviors to be more sustainable.</p>



<p>Suzanne Livingston, VP of Development &amp; Reliability Engineering at IBM Sustainability Software, takes the audience through the journey of building a solution that is reliable and sustainable from day one. She also shares insights on why sustainability is the focus of companies today, success stories with customers she has worked with and what IBM is doing to help their customers to achieve sustainability goals.</p>



<p>Lastly, Suzanne gives practical advice on how companies and organization can get started right away and take steps closer to realizing their sustainability goals.</p>



<p><a href="https://listen.casted.us/public/95/Making-of-the-SRE-Omelette-01912a5b/05c2820d">Episode 3: Sustainability by the numbers</a></p>



<p>Rishi Vaish, VP and CTO of IBM Sustainability Software, takes us through sustainability by the numbers to give us context and scope of the impact of climate change and why we need to act now. Rishi also gives concrete examples of what we can do to make a difference.</p>



<p>In addition, he has a call to action for Site Reliability Engineers – from questions to get us to think of sustainability from the start, as well as considerations to be more sustainable from our roles. For example:</p>



 
 What is your take on sustainability as it relates to energy footprint and efficiency? 



 Do you know how many of your development environments are running when no-one is using it? 
 



<p>So join me and my incredible guests as they crack some plant-based eggs, add some ESG and turn sustainability ambitions into reality.</p>

<p>In Texas, 2022 was one of the driest years on record. With failed crops, low yields for farmers and diminished grazing for cattle, the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/03/texas-climate-change-food-insecurity/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_climate202&amp;wpisrc=nl_climate202">Texas Department of Agriculture</a> identified climate change as a potential threat to the state’s food supply.</p>



<p>Smallholder farmers, particularly those in arid and drought-prone regions, struggle to manage their farms because they lack access to guidance on how much water to use for specific crops to ensure a good yield.</p>



<p>“We’re in hills, so some areas need less water, and some areas need more,” said David Chapin, a farmer and IBMer in Lampasas, Texas, that has been helping IBM test water management solutions. “I don’t really know which areas I’m overwatering, and which areas I’m underwatering, so I just take a chance and make adjustments by eye. That’s not always the best way to do it. I need a more scientific approach.”</p>



<p>That’s where digital agriculture comes in.</p>



 Developing a solution for real-world impact 



<p>What if there was a tool that could recommend when and how much farmers should water their crops, resulting in a reduction in input costs, improved yields and a reduction of polluting runoff? With IBM and <a>Texas</a> A&amp;M AgriLife’s partnership through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator,</a> a pro bono social impact program, the development of such a tool is well underway.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator/water">Apply to the 3rd cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator&nbsp;by May 31, 2023</a>



<p>IBM and <a href="https://agrilife.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M AgriLife</a> are working together to help farmers receive insights for water usage, which can further crop yield increases while decreasing economic and environmental costs. Texas A&amp;M AgriLife and IBM will deploy and scale <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/blogs/cfc-2019-internal-finalist-liquid-prep/">Liquid Prep</a>, a tech solution that provides “when to water” decision support to farmers, in arid regions of the United States.</p>



 Using data to inform crop management strategies 



<p>To generate high-quality insights for farmers, it takes huge quantities of data from various sources.</p>



<p>The tool works by placing <a href="https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2023/04/25/texas-am-agrilife-research-ibm-streamline-when-to-water-app-and-sensors-for-producers/">low-cost sensors</a> developed by IBMers into the soil to record moisture and temperature levels, which are then uploaded to the IBM Cloud.</p>



<p>The Liquid Prep app will combine weather forecast data from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite</a>, crop-specific information from the <a href="https://swat.tamu.edu/">Soil &amp; Water Assessment Tool (SWAT</a>) (which is co-managed by Texas A&amp;M AgriLife and the United States Department of Agriculture), and real-time soil moisture data from the new sensors. The app will analyze the combined data using artificial intelligence to provide farmers with recommendations on when and how much to water via a smartphone app.</p>


 


<p>“Different soil has different water retention capacity, crop information and crop demands that differ during the season,” said Gurjinder Baath, Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Research. “We are trying to integrate all these important pieces of information together in this app so a more effective, reliable decision for irrigation can be generated.”</p>



 What’s next for Liquid Prep 



<p>Liquid Prep is currently in the second phase of the 2-year IBM Sustainability Accelerator program, which is centered on the development and implementation of the tool. Within the first phase, a technical roadmap was produced via the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">IBM Garage</a> to guide solution design, development and deployment of the solution. New versions of the app and sensor are currently being tested.</p>



<p>To ensure the tool was adequately meeting farmers’ needs, the researchers also needed to generate feedback from those whom the tool will be targeted to help. Farmers, researchers and water managers in Alabama, Louisiana and Texas tested the previous version of the solution throughout 2022. Over 100 smallholder farmers will be targeted in 2023 to test the solution in Louisiana.</p>



<p>“We are trying to get in touch with as many farming communities as possible, and we are trying to get their feedback, because farmers’ issues are different,” Gurjinder said.</p>



<p>In addition, IBM is bringing in strategic allies to contribute even more value to the project. For example, t<a href="https://www.suagcenter.com/"></a>he team will work with the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute to gather more data to train and fine-tune the machine learning models used to generate recommendations to farmers. Ukraine is known as the “breadbasket of Europe,” so the distinct properties of the region will provide a valuable dataset to help improve the tool.</p>



<p>Through this partnership, the tool will also be given a new use case: to guide recovery and resource management amid the war in Ukraine. With information and farming resources difficult to access, the researchers are working on developing a flood and drought assessment system to identify the most affected regions that need the most resources and support.</p>



 There is power in partnerships 



<p>By uniting experts and technology with the purpose of improving the lives of populations most affected by environmental threats, we have the potential to make lasting, scalable impact on populations in need. IBM’s technology and expertise, combined with the background and resources of Texas A&amp;M AgriLife, has increased Liquid Prep’s potential to help people around the world.</p>

  South Korea approved the first phase of cryptocurrency regulations to provide a clearer framework for users and businesses while addressing concerns related to illicit activities.  Striking a balance between safeguarding market participants’ interests and encouraging innovation will be crucial for fostering wider adoption and long-term growth in South Korea’s crypto&nbsp;sector.  As the digital currency landscape in South Korea continues to develop, open communication and collaboration between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for cultivating a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.  <p>The recent passing of the cryptocurrency bill by South Korea’s National Assembly represents a significant step towards regulating the country’s largely unregulated crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>Now the bill will move to the Legislation and Judiciary Committee must for approval. And if the Committee endorses the bill, it will move to the final approval stage, which is expected to take place later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>South Korea first announced the new cryptocurrency legislation in June 2022, in the aftermath of the Terra ecosystem collapse, which sent shockwaves through the industry. Just this week, South Korean authorities indicted Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine others for illegal&nbsp;trading.</p><p>Now with the bill’s provisions, the authorities aim to create a safer and more secure trading environment for investors while also preventing money laundering and other illicit activities that may have been taking place in the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>One notable provision in the bill is the mandate for crypto service providers to maintain user assets and deposits separately from their own assets, have insurance, hold reserves for contingencies such as system failures or hacks, and record all transactions.</p><blockquote>Any co-mingling of users’ funds with providers’ funds is discouraged by the&nbsp;bill.</blockquote><p>Businesses and individuals participating in the sector will further be required to self-report irregularities to maintain compliance.</p> Serious Consequences of Non-compliance <p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/australias-latest-crypto-bill-explained">crypto bill</a> includes severe consequences for failing to comply with necessary disclosures, engaging in price manipulation, or promoting crypto assets falsely, which is deemed&nbsp;illegal.</p><p>If found guilty, offenders face up to a year in prison or fines up to five times the amount of illegally earned profits. The penalties escalate to five years to life imprisonment for causing losses of over 5 billion Korean won (around US$3.73 million) to consumers.</p> The Impact on Crypto Users &amp; Ecosystem <p>The impact on crypto users and the broader ecosystem will be multifaceted. On the one hand, increased regulation will provide a clearer framework for users and businesses to operate within, instilling confidence and trust in the industry. On the other hand, critics argue that such regulations may stifle innovation and growth, potentially hindering the sector’s progress.</p><p>Moreover, compliance with the new regulations may prove challenging for some crypto businesses, potentially leading to market consolidation as smaller entities struggle to adapt. This, in turn, may alter the competitive landscape and affect the diversity of offerings available to&nbsp;users.</p><p>Ultimately, the effectiveness of these regulations in preventing illicit activities and safeguarding investors’ interests remains to be seen. As South Korea’s crypto market evolves, it is essential for regulators, businesses, and users to work collaboratively in order to strike the right balance between fostering innovation and ensuring a secure, transparent, and stable digital currency ecosystem.</p> Final Note <p>As South Korea’s National Assembly approves the first phase of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">cryptocurrency regulations</a>, the country’s crypto ecosystem is entering a critical transition. These initial regulations allow for better oversight of digital asset businesses and require service providers to report suspicious activities. It’s important for crypto users and businesses to understand and follow these new rules to avoid legal&nbsp;issues.</p><p>While there are concerns about the impact of these regulations on the industry, this first phase also offers more certainty and protection for investors. Finding the right balance between protecting the interests of market participants and encouraging innovation will be crucial for broader adoption and long-term growth in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>However, the effectiveness of this initial phase of regulations remains to be seen, given the fast-paced and ever-changing nature of the cryptocurrency market. As South Korea’s digital currency landscape evolves and more regulatory phases are introduced, open communication between regulators, businesses, and users will be essential for a thriving and secure crypto ecosystem.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  Using a domain as your handle helps with account identity, verification, and portability. Here's how to set your domain as your handle.

<div class='wrap'>


The official account for the AT Protocol with a custom domain.
 What’s a custom domain? 
<p>A custom domain is a unique name that identifies a website on the internet. For example, Bluesky’s domain is <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code>.</p>
<p>Every device that connects to the internet has a unique IP address that identifies it. But it’s much easier to remember <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> instead of a series of numbers. The Domain Name System (DNS) acts like a phonebook for the internet and points a domain like <code>blueskyweb.xyz</code> to its IP address, so we don’t have to remember the numbers ourselves.</p>
<p>Domains can be further divided into subdomains. For example, if your domain was <code>example.com</code> but you had a blog hosted at <code>blog.example.com</code>, then <code>blog</code> is the subdomain.</p>
 Why does Bluesky use domains as handles, and why would I want to use a domain as my handle? 
<p>Technically, it’s the AT Protocol that lets you use domains as handles. Bluesky is a client application built on top of the protocol, so it will also use domains as handles.</p>
<p>The AT Protocol was designed to use domains for multiple reasons:</p>
 
 
<p>Identity: Bluesky is just one application built on top of the AT Protocol. Let’s say you set your handle to <code>example.com</code> on Bluesky. You’ll be able to use that same handle across all applications built on the AT Protocol (and there’s a growing number!). Now, you no longer have to list five different usernames based on what was available at the time you signed up for an app — just use your domain!</p>
 
 
<p>Verification: Websites have a long history of verification already, so using domains borrows their authority. For example, a newsroom like NPR could set their handle to be <code>@npr.org</code>. Then, any journalists that NPR wants to verify could use subdomains to set their handles to be <code>@name.npr.org</code>. Brand accounts could set their handle to be their domain as well, which companies like Vercel and Tailscale have already done.</p>

 
 
<p>Portability: Maybe you want to switch to a different server. Then, there’s no need to switch your handle from something server-specific if you’re using your domain as your handle.</p>
 
 
<p>Read our previously published blog post on domain names as handles <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">here</a> for more information.</p>
 I’m convinced! How do I acquire a custom domain? 
<p>If you don’t have a custom domain already, you can purchase one from any ICANN-accredited domain registrar or reseller. Note that this isn’t required to join Bluesky; you could use our server’s off-the-shelf naming (in the format of <code>@name.bsky.social</code>) if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can use services like Namecheap or Google Domains to register your domain of choice. Domains are unique, so you must choose one that hasn’t already been registered by someone else. During registration, you’ll likely pay an annual fee and provide personal information.</p>
<p>Your personal information is used to populate the WHOIS directory, which is a searchable database that holds information on domain ownership. You might prefer to keep your information private for various reasons — in that case, most domain registrars offer WHOIS privacy protection as a service.</p>
 How do I set this custom domain as my handle? 
<p>Let’s use the Bluesky team’s <code>@atproto.com</code> account as an example. Note that the account uses the handle <code>@atproto.com</code>, which verifies its identity because it owns the website <a href="https://atproto.com/">atproto.com</a>.
</p>
<p>Note: if you change your default Bluesky username (with the <code>.bsky.social</code> suffix) to a custom domain, your old username will be available for someone else to use. However, any tags or mentions with your old handle will still point to your account.</p>
<p>The screenshots below will show you how to set your custom domain as your handle in your mobile app, but similar steps apply to the desktop version.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the left side menu by clicking your profile picture thumbnail. Click “Settings” and scroll down to the “Advanced” section. Click “Change my handle.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>On the “Change my handle” screen, click “I have my own domain.”</p>
  
 
 
<p>Now, you’ll have a screen that looks like this. This includes information that you will need to add to your domain registrar.</p>
  
 
 
<p>Navigate back to your domain registrar, which is the company you bought your domain from (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.). The specific steps here depend on which company you used, but you’ll want to navigate to DNS management for your domain. This might be under an “Advanced DNS” tab.</p>
  
 
 
<p>We want to add a TXT (text) record to your domain. Step 3 above contains all of the information you’ll need to add to your domain. The DID value is public and not sensitive information. (Read more about DIDs <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did-plc">here</a>.)</p>
 
 Set the domain: <code>_atproto</code> 
 Set the type: TXT 
 Set the value field (also sometimes called “data”), except use your own DID value: <code>did=did:plc:[your value here]</code> 
 
 
 
<p>After you add the TXT record, wait a couple of minutes for the change to propagate across the internet. Then, just click “Verify DNS Record.” You’re done! Check your Bluesky profile to see if it has updated. Remember, DNS propagation might take some time.</p>
 
 
<p>Congratulations, you have a custom domain as your handle now!</p>

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, most individuals operate in a digital environment where transactions and communication are made online. As a result, digital identity verification has become a very important aspect of online security and compliance.</p>
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) is one of the most widely used methods for verifying the identities of users and clients. While KYC has been effective in assuring security and regulatory compliance, it has some significant drawbacks. KYC can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult for users, potentially resulting in losing customers and missing business opportunities.</p>
<p>SelfKey addresses this issue by proposing a potential solution to these issues with SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is a revolutionary approach to identity verification that could be faster, more secure, and less costly than traditional KYC methods. It uses the power of blockchain technology and smart contracts to potentially offer a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. This can possibly eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods.</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, users can create a <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/?utm_source=SelfKey&amp;utm_medium=SelfSovereignIdentity&amp;utm_campaign=selfkey_blog&amp;utm_id=selfkey_blog">self sovereign identity</a> that they can control, giving them more privacy and full ownership over their personal data.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the drawbacks of traditional KYC methods. We will also examine the advantages of SelfKey iD, its features and benefits compared to traditional KYC. Additionally, we will explore the potential impact of SelfKey iD on the future of digital identity verification.</p>

 KYC: Potential Issues to Consider 
<p>Even though KYC has become a commonly used procedure in many industries, it has its drawbacks.</p>
<p>Here as some examples:</p>
 
 The collection of personally identifiable information (PII) for KYC purposes comes with legal responsibilities and storage costs, which can take a toll on companies.&nbsp; 
 Users have a tendency to dislike KYC checks, finding them intrusive and time-consuming. This can lead to lower conversion rates and a negative first impression for potential customers.&nbsp; 
 Implementing KYC can be a difficult and expensive process, further adding to its disadvantages.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Perhaps the time to explore alternative ways of verifying customer identities has come. With SelfKey iD, you can explore methods that are less tedious for all parties involved.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD 
<p>As stated above, KYC processes can be inconvenient for both companies and customers alike. However, SelfKey’s <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">Ai-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> method along with SelfKey iD can potentially become a better alternative to KYC.</p>
<p>Here are some of SelfKey.iD’s benefits:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The overall process is easier and less costly, making it more accessible for users.&nbsp; 
 The onboarding process is quick. 
 Ongoing monitoring makes sure that customer data remains accurate. 
 Existing KYC checks are reused, thus the need to collect and store PII repeatedly is no longer an issue. 
 Costs for companies are reduced, but also improves customer privacy and security. 
 It provides powerful compliance tools, ensuring that companies remain in compliance with regulations and laws.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can streamline their KYC processes, reducing costs, enhancing customer privacy, and improving compliance. Ultimately, this results in a better experience for customers and a more efficient and secure system for companies.</p>
<p>Below, we will discuss some of SelfKey iDs benefits more in depth.</p>
 High-Level Flow 
<p>SelfKey iD enables zero-knowledge interactions between individuals, making sure that users' data is kept private and secure. With SelfKey iD, the user's data does not reach your server. This adds to user privacy and prevents potential data breaches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the onboarding process is quick and simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user with a SelfKey iD visits your server, they are checked to determine if they match your filter. If they do, they can be onboarded instantly, simplifying the process and reducing the time and resources required.</p>
<p>By using SelfKey iD, companies can provide a secure and efficient onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security. The zero-knowledge interactions and instant onboarding features make it a better alternative to traditional KYC processes.</p>
 Quick Relying Party Onboarding 
<p>To streamline the onboarding process, the following steps are required:</p>
 
 Sign up at SelfKey iD to create your user filters. 
 Add these filters to your smart contracts. 
 When a user attempts to run your smart contract function, the system will check if they have a SelfKey iD NFT. If they do not have one, they will be prompted to get one. 
 If the issuer has a SelfKey iD NFT, they will then be able to verify whether the user matches the filter that you have set for the transaction. If they do, the user will be granted access to your server. If not, the user will be denied access. 
 
<p>Following these steps, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding process that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system ensures that only authorized users are given access to the company's services. This reduces the risk of relying parties allowing access to unauthorized individuals to their services.</p>
 The Issuance: SelfKey iD NFT User Flow 
<p>The issuance process for SelfKey iD is outlined below:</p>
 
 The user visits your project and is redirected to SelfKey iD, in case they do not already have one. 
 The user pays for the verification check. 
 The user goes through the verification process, and the issuer stores their data. Ongoing monitoring of the account begins. 
 If the user passes the checks, the issuer releases a credential that verifies the user's humanity, uniqueness in the database, and verified data. 
 The user then mints their own SelfKey iD NFT. 
 
<p>By following these steps, users can obtain a SelfKey iD NFT that verifies their identity and potentially provides access to various projects that use the SelfKey iD platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verification process ensures that only authorized users are granted access, providing enhanced security and privacy for both users and companies.</p>
<p>Enhanced security offers several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Anti-bot security. This measure prevents automated attacks by detecting and blocking suspicious or malicious bot traffic. 
 Fraud protection. Bots are often used for fraudulent activities like creating fake accounts or generating false clicks to generate revenue. Implementing anti-bot security measures helps to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities, keeping the business and customers safe. 
 Improved user experience. Bots can significantly hinder the user experience by slowing down websites or making it difficult for users to access information. Anti-bot security measures ensure that legitimate users can access the website or service without interruptions or delays. 
 
 The Verification: SelfKey iD User Onboarding 
<p>The onboarding process for SelfKey.iD is as follows:</p>
 
 A user with a SelfKey iD visits your project. 
 You request that the SelfKey iD issuer checks the user's information. 
 The issuer verifies whether the user's data matches your filters. 
 The issuer sends a signed message confirming the user's status.&nbsp; 
 If the user is verified, they can be onboarded, and the signed message can be used to authorize transactions. 
 The relying party (issuer) is billed for the verification check. 
 
<p>Through this process, companies can implement a more efficient and secure onboarding method that prioritizes user privacy and security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD's NFT-based system makes sure that only authorized users are granted access to the company's services. The use of a signed message adds an extra layer of security, offering further assurance that the user's data has been verified by the relying party.</p>
 Reusable KYC and SelfKey iD 
<p>The benefits of using reusable KYC with SelfKey iD are as follows:</p>
 
 Your project subscribes to SelfKey iD. 
 Your project can be featured on the SelfKey iD website. 
 A user with a SelfKey iD NFT visits the SelfKey iD website. 
 The user scrolls through the list of projects that support SelfKey iD. 
 The user can potentially choose your project from the list. 
 The user quickly onboards to your project using their existing SelfKey iD NFT. 
 Your project profits from the seamless onboarding experience. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's reusable KYC system could provide companies with a more streamlined onboarding experience for users. Users can easily access multiple projects without having to go through the time-consuming and costly process of verifying their identity each time.</p>
<p>Additionally, companies benefit from increased user adoption and loyalty, as the reusable KYC system encourages users to choose projects that support SelfKey iD. Overall, this system offers a win-win situation for both companies and users alike.</p>
 SelfKey iD New Project Setup 
<p>Setting up a new project with SelfKey iD is quite easy. Below, we will detail a few steps which you need to consider.</p>
 The project onboarding process is as follows:&nbsp; 
 
 Go to the SelfKey iD website. 
 Register for a new account. 
 Add your company privacy policy to your account. 
 Choose a subscription pack that suits your needs. 
 Set up filters to verify your users' identity. 
 Your project is now ready to implement the filters into your system. 
 
<p>SelfKey iD's easy-to-use platform could offer companies a quick and efficient way to set up their project's identity verification process. The platform provides a range of subscription plans to choose from, depending on your business's specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ability to customize filters for your users, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, enhancing security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, SelfKey iD's new project setup process offers a simple and effective solution for individuals looking to integrate identity verification into their systems</p>
 The Library Implementation 
<p>To implement SelfKey iD into your project's system, follow these simple steps:</p>
 
 Implement the backend library onto your server. 
 Prepare the front-end to handle calls for authorization. 
 Implement the SelfKey iD smart contract into your own smart contract. 
 Your project is now ready to onboard users. 
 
<p>By following these steps, you can integrate SelfKey iD into your project's system and take advantage of its powerful identity verification capabilities. With the backend library in place, your server will be able to communicate with SelfKey iD to authorize user access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By integrating the smart contract into your own contract, you can ensure that only authorized individuals can access your platform, boosting security and trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, SelfKey iD's library implementation process offers a robust solution for businesses looking to enhance their identity verification capabilities.</p>
 How the Profile Builder Functions: 
<p>SelfKey iD's Profile Builder is a tool that allows you to create customizable filters for your project. These filters could be used to sort and manage users based on specific criteria.</p>
<p>The Profile Builder allows you to create multiple filters, which can be implemented separately on your project. This means that you can have different filters applied to different sections of your app or website, depending on your specific needs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 You could create a filter that accepts citizens of Country A for one section of your app, but another filter for the same project that excludes citizens of Country A from another section.&nbsp; 
 This level of detailed filtering allows you to match regulatory requirements while also boosting the benefits of your app. 
 
<p>To set up the Profile Builder, you would first define the standards you want to filter by, such as citizenship, age, or profession. You can then apply rules and conditions to each filter to create a customized sorting system.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Profile Builder in SelfKey iD could provide a flexible and powerful tool for managing user data and creating a tailored experience for your app's users.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey aims to provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the needs of both businesses and users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of SelfKey iD could include efficient, secure, and cost-effective KYC checks, streamlined onboarding, and better conversion rates. Additionally, SelfKey iD's approach to privacy ensures legal compliance and reduces costs associated with PII storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, with a user-friendly one-time KYC process and access to multiple projects on the website, SelfKey iD offers convenience and ease of use for users. SelfKey iD's project features and powerful user filtering tools could enable businesses to match rules and increase profitability.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary 
<p>Traditional domain names have been in use for decades and are widely recognized. However, they come with certain limitations due to their centralized nature. Organizations that registered these domains are usually the ones who own them, which means that individuals have no control over them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a decentralized alternative to traditional domain names that offers additional functionalities. It represents a significant change in the way we think about and use domain names on the internet. ENS provides users with more control over their domain names, making it a powerful tool for individuals and businesses alike.</p>
<p>Given these options, SelfKey aims to provide subdomains with self-sovereign identity in mind. With SelfKey's ENS subdomains, individuals may enjoy all the benefits of owning a regular ENS domain on the Ethereum Mainnet without the recurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By offering greater control and flexibility, SelfKey’s ENS subdomains may enable users to better manage their digital identities and online presence. And this may make it a valuable tool for anyone looking to build a presence on the internet.</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the benefits of ENS (Ethereum Name Service) over DNS (Domain Name System), as well as the advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomains.&nbsp;</p>

 The Basics of DNS 
<p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">DNS</a> (Domain Name System) is a traditional system that facilitates the translation of human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses. Every device connected to the internet has an IP address, which represents a unique numerical identifier.</p>
<p>This process is necessary because while people can easily remember and recognize domain names, computers and other devices require IP addresses to communicate with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DNS is an essential part of the internet infrastructure and is utilized in a variety of applications, including website hosting, email communication, online gaming, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without DNS, users would have to memorize the IP addresses of every website they wish to visit, which would be highly impractical and inconvenient.</p>
 ENS Unpacked: A Quick Overview 
 A brief description 
<p><a href="https://thedefiant.io/what-is-ens">ENS</a> (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register human-readable domain names, similar to how traditional DNS works, but with added features and benefits.</p>
<p>With ENS, users can register domain names in the form of "name.eth" instead of the traditional "www.example.com" format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting that these domain names are unique, one can use them to identify various Ethereum-based resources, such as wallets, contracts, and decentralized applications.</p>
 ENS and individuals 
<p>One of the main advantages of ENS is that it is decentralized. This means that no single entity or authority owns or controls it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Even more, resistance to censorship is boosted and individuals are allowed to have more control over their online identities and assets by being decentralized.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it is interoperable, meaning it can be used across different applications and services on the Ethereum blockchain. This could help create a more seamless and integrated user experience.</p>
 The Benefits of ENS compared to DNS 
<p>Both ENS and DNS are used for assigning user-friendly names to machine-readable addresses on the internet. However, there are several key differences between them, namely:</p>
 
 Centralization 
 Ownership 
 Security 
 Functionality 
 
<p>Below, we will discuss these important aspects more in depth.</p>
 Centralization 
<p>The traditional DNS system is centralized, with domain names being registered and managed by a single authority, ICANN. On the other hand, ENS is a decentralized system that operates on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>As a decentralized system, ENS is not controlled by a single entity, which gives individuals the freedom to manage their very own domain. This liberty allows users to express themselves and utilize their domains to their personal needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ENS users may stand out more if they are not attached to a centralized giant. And this, in turn, may give them the opportunity to attract and engage with other individuals. All in all, having the freedom to manage their own domain in the online world comes with a large number of chances for users to show off their services or skills.</p>
 Ownership 
<p>Ownership is another key difference between ENS and traditional DNS. With traditional DNS, the organization that register domain names typically own them. ENS allows individuals to own their domain names directly, without intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that individuals can have complete control over their domain names, which can be particularly useful for businesses and individuals who value their online presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owning an ENS domain that matches their business or brand name may help individuals build brand recognition and increase trust among customers.</p>
 Security 
<p>Security is another major advantage of ENS over traditional DNS. Most centralized systems have weak security, which often leads to data breaches. Those whose data was compromised might suffer dire consequences as a result of this.&nbsp;Being a centralized system, DNS might be quite risky in this sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ENS's decentralized architecture makes it highly effective in preventing security threats. It operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the same cryptographic standards as Ethereum, providing an additional layer of protection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature makes it very difficult for bad players to compromise the system or steal user data. It may also make the systems more resilient to hacking or domain hijacking. As a result, ENS offers a much higher level of security.</p>
 Functionality 
<p>ENS provides unique functionality compared to traditional DNS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One such feature is the ability to link multiple addresses, including cryptocurrency wallets, to a single domain name. This capability makes identity management more simple for users and it enables seamless interaction with decentralized applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another positive aspect of ENS is that it allows users to build their online identity and streamline their transactions. On the opposite side, traditional DNS only offers basic domain name resolution. This added functionality is another reason why ENS is becoming a more and more popular choice for those seeking a more flexible and user-friendly domain name resolution system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, ENS and traditional DNS serve the same purpose, but they differ significantly in terms of centralization, ownership, security, and functionality. And all of these aspects are highly important to take into account as society becomes more digitized.</p>
<p>With these possibilities in mind, SelfKey is aiming to create a subdomain that offers the same benefits as the current ENS, along with additional features that may enhance accessibility for individuals.</p>

<p>All in all, SelfKey’s goal is to bring a positive change to the way people operate in the digital world. To make it more secure and accessible for everyone.</p>
 What is SelfKey ENS subdomain 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is an innovative subdomain that aims to provide a more accessible and user-friendly domain name resolution system. Given this, users might not have to pay recurring fees for their subdomain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is likely to be a subdomain of key.eth. This means that users may register their preferred subdomain by adding their name or any other word of their choosing, such as yourname.key.eth. This naming convention is similar to email addresses. And, by providing an easier way to identify and interact with Ethereum addresses, it may bring self-sovereign identity closer to mass adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as DNS made the internet more accessible to the masses by providing a simpler way to access websites than using IP addresses, key.eth may do the same for Ethereum addresses. It replaces long, complex addresses with a human-readable format that is easy to remember and share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may improve the ease of use of the blockchain and help resolve one of the challenges to widespread adoption. Because of this, key.eth may be a step towards a more user-friendly and accessible blockchain ecosystem.</p>
 What are the benefits of SelfKey ENS 
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain is designed to make it easier for individuals to manage their online identities and interact with decentralized applications. By putting user accesibility first, SelfKey is aiming to create a more inclusive domain name resolution system that builds on the strengths of ENS while adding to its advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach might make SelfKey ENS subdomain a compelling choice for anyone who values privacy and security, and wants a more user-friendly way to manage their digital identity.</p>
<p>SelfKey ENS subdomain provides several benefits to its users:</p>
 
 One of the primary advantages of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that every verified SelfKey iD holder may receive a free key.eth subdomain on the Ethereum Mainnet that is longer than seven characters. This free subdomain may allow users to experiment with SelfKey ENS subdomain and explore its features without having to make extra financial commitment. 
 Once users have their free subdomain, they may buy more subdomains using any of the supported tokens. Users may utilize these subdomains for various purposes, such as getting payments or creating aliases for use in games. Users may buy as many subdomains as they like and use them to streamline their online activities. 
 Another significant benefit of SelfKey ENS subdomain is that users may sell their subdomains.&nbsp; Any marketplace that supports ENS trading, such as OpenSea, is a good place to start. This feature may offer users the freedom to experiment with different subdomains. And, if they decide to change their online identity or activities, they may sell them. 
 
<p>Overall, SelfKey ENS subdomain may provide great benefits to its users. It may enable individuals to not only manage and own their domains, but also boost their visibility online. These features might make SelfKey ENS an ideal choice for anyone looking to enhance their online identity and activities.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>It's important to note that people have become increasingly aware of the importance of privacy and ownership of personal data. However, the traditional centralized systems we rely on for managing our digital assets and domains may compromise these rights. This is where the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes in as part of an ideal decentralized future.</p>
<p>ENS allows individuals to own and manage their own domain names on the Ethereum blockchain, which is decentralized and secure. This means that no central authority has control over the domain name. A feature which gives individuals complete ownership and control over their online identity.</p>

 Defining data breaches: Meaning and Overview 
 A brief, but fundamental introduction 
<p>Data breaches are serious security violations where confidential, protected or sensitive data is accessed, stolen or used by an unauthorized person or organization. These devastating incidents are also known as data spills, data leaks, or information disclosures, and they can occur in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>These digital attacks are typically well organized and initiated by malicious players, including organized crime, political activists, and national governments. However, even individuals who accidentally gain unauthorized access to systems with poor security configurations can cause data breaches.</p>
<p>The information that hackers may disclose can range from matters that may compromise national security to information that government officials want to keep hidden. When a person who has access to such information deliberately exposes it, for political reasons, it is usually referred to as a "leak".</p>
 The negative effects of a cyber attack: What happens after? 
<p>Data breaches can have far-reaching consequences, impacting a variety of information types including, but not limited to:</p>
 
 financial data, such as credit card information and bank details. 
 personally identifiable information (PII), such as full name, full address, IDs, birth certificate information, etc. 
 personal health information (PHI), such as full name, home address, or dates related to the health or identity of individuals. 
 trade secrets, and intellectual property.&nbsp; 
 sensitive or valuable information, like photos or videos. 
 
<p>Unstructured data, such as files, documents, and private information, can also become exposed and vulnerable if proper security measures are not in place to protect them.</p>
<p>These cyberattacks aren’t limited to organizations or powerful institutions, though. Anyone could be a victim. And, worst of all, the compromise or theft of the information listed above can lead to anything from:</p>
 
 financial losses 
 identity theft 
 reputational damage 
 legal repercussions 
 
<p>It's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect their sensitive information and implement strong security measures to prevent data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey understands the devastating consequences of data breaches and emphasizes the significance of implementing preventive measures. Responding promptly and adequately in case of such incidents is also highly important.&nbsp;</p>
 Recent Data Breaches: The beginning of 2023 
<p>The frequency of data breaches has increased in recent years. Alarmingly, the past several months have seen a handful of significant incidents.&nbsp;</p>
 
 One such example is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/04/tiktok-fined-uk-data-protection-law-breaches">TikTok’s illegal processing of data</a> belonging to 1.4 million children under 13, who were using its platform without parental consent. This breach highlights the importance of proper data management practices, particularly when dealing with children's information. 
 Another example is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kfc-pizza-hut-owner-discloses-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/">the cyberattack on Yum! Brands</a>, where attackers stole personal information belonging to some individuals, including names, driver's license numbers, and other ID card numbers. This kind of data is particularly sensitive and can be used to commit identity theft, among other crimes. 
 Finally, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kodi-discloses-data-breach-after-forum-database-for-sale-online/">the hacking of The Kodi Foundation</a> resulted in the exposure of personal information and private conversations of over 400,000 users. Such incidents can have long-term consequences for the affected individuals, including reputational damage and financial losses. These breaches emphasize the need for better cybersecurity measures and data protection practices across industries. 
 
 Factors contributing to data breaches: Why, Who, and for What? 
<p>Cyberattacks have become a prevalent threat to our digital lives, and they occur on both personal and larger scales. While most people may assume that only organizations with weak security measures are at risk, individuals are also susceptible to data breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, personal cyberattacks often happen due to a lack of caution when it comes to protecting oneself online.</p>
 Why do data breaches occur? 
<p>One of the most common ways individuals make themselves vulnerable to cyberattacks is by using weak or predictable passwords. This makes it easy for hackers to access their accounts and steal sensitive information. Additionally, using the same password on multiple accounts makes it even easier for hackers to gain access to a person's entire online presence.</p>
<p>Lack of proper security measures is another way individuals put themselves at risk. Failing to have anti-malware protection on their devices can allow malware to infiltrate and infect their system. Similarly, exposing personal information publicly online, such as on social media, can provide hackers with the necessary information to carry out attacks.</p>
<p>Clicking on or accessing suspicious links is another way individuals can become victims of cyberattacks. It is worth mentioning that bad players often use phishing emails to trick people into giving up sensitive information. These emails can appear legitimate, so it's important to be cautious and verify the source before clicking on any links or providing personal information.</p>
 Who is responsible for data breaches? 
<p>Anyone could carry out a cyberattack, if they have the necessary tools, and if that is their intention.</p>
<p>Data breaches are a serious concern for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. These breaches are often the result of bad players with malicious intent. Perpetrators can range from organized crime groups seeking financial gain to political activists looking to disrupt or expose sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some instances, national governments have conducted data breaches for espionage or other motives. Regardless of the motive, it's important for individuals and organizations to take steps to protect themselves from potential breaches and to respond quickly and effectively if one occurs.</p>
 What are the intentions of those who initiate cyberattacks? 
<p>Malicious individuals typically have two main intentions: financial gain or causing damage to institutions for various reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In pursuit of these goals, they may carry out data breaches that can have serious consequences for their victims. These attacks can result in the exposure of personal information and sensitive data, which can lead to identity theft, financial fraud, and other types of harm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, larger feuds between hackers and their targets can result in victims becoming collateral damage and suffering the consequences of attacks that were not specifically directed at them.</p>
 Caught Off Guard: When and Where Data Breaches Strike 
<p>Data breaches can happen every second and anywhere, from major technology companies to large financial institutions, and even in our own homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public places such as cafes or airports, which offer public Wi-Fi, can also provide opportunities for hackers to access personal data.</p>
<p>Recently, incidents involving Yum!Brands and TikTok have highlighted the vulnerability of powerful institutions to cyber attacks. However, individuals are also at risk in their personal lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any given moment, scam messages spread by viruses or hackers can target friends and family members. Weak personal security measures, such as predictable passwords and email addresses, can leave individuals vulnerable to attacks. As a result, the malware can spread to the victim’s circle of friends, family, or acquaintances via personal messages or emails.</p>
<p>One common method used by attackers is phishing emails. They appear to be legitimate messages from a trusted source but actually contain malicious links or attachments. Clicking on these links can result in the installation of malware on a device, allowing attackers to gain access to sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
 Victims of data breaches: Are you safe? 
 Who do bad players target? 
<p>The victims of data breaches can be anyone whose personal data was involved, regardless of age, gender, occupation, or level of power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes children, women, men, students, teachers, and employees who trust their employers with their personal information. It also includes clients, customers, and patients who share their data with businesses and healthcare providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's important to recognize that anyone who uses the internet is at risk of being affected by a data breach, regardless of how small or popular they are. Constantly searching for vulnerabilities and ways to exploit them, bad actors can breach even the most seemingly secure systems.</p>
<p>That's why it's essential to take the right security measures, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and being cautious when sharing personal information online. By being proactive about data security, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves and minimize the potential impact of a breach.</p>

<p>The Normies Project aims to offer individuals an unparalleled experience in the world of digital assets. It consists of two well defined NFT collections, each with its own unique features and offerings:</p>
 
 Base NFTs 
 Wearables 
 
 What are Base NFTs? 
<p>Base NFTs are equipable avatars that can be personalized with wearables to dress up one’s Normies. With Base NFTs, all verified users&nbsp; may have the power to mint their own avatar. As there is no maximum supply, Base NFTs allow for limitless creativity and customization.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, every SelfKey iD owner will receive one free Base NFT, making it accessible to all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may express their individuality by customizing their own avatar with a wide range of wearables. Furthermore, they may use their Normies in virtual spaces, social gatherings, and gaming adventures.</p>
 How to obtain a Base NTF Avatar 
<p>Obtaining a Base NTF Avatar may be an exciting step towards personalizing your virtual identity in the metaverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process is rather simple:</p>
 
 To begin, you'll need to go through a simple <a href="https://selfkey.org/a-guide-to-using-selfkey-id-for-digital-identity-verification/">verification process</a>. 
 Once you're verified, you'll gain access to the standard customizations available for your Base NFT Avatar. This may allow you to create a unique digital representation of yourself. 
 After customizing your Base NFT Avatar, you can mint it for free, making it officially yours in the virtual world.&nbsp; 
 With your Base NFT in hand, you have the option to further enhance your avatar by purchasing wearable packs. Community members may sell these packs, along with individual NFTs, on OpenSea and other popular NFT marketplaces. 
 
<p>These wearables and NFTs may help you express your personality, interests, and style within the metaverse. Likewise, they may add a layer of originality and individuality to your digital presence.</p>
 What are wearables? 
<p>Wearables are an exciting addition to the world of NFTs, offering users the ability to further customize and personalize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
<p>From hairstyles to shirts, hats, and beyond, wearables come in various categories, allowing users to express their individuality and style in the metaverse. By adding wearables to their Base NFTs, users can increase the rarity of their NFTs, making them even more unique.</p>
<p>Obtaining wearables is typically done through NFT packs. These packs may contain a wide selection of digital items that users can add to their avatars. The packs may also allow users to acquire new wearables to enhance their Base NFT avatars. This way, users may feel a thrilling experience of discovery.</p>
<p>With wearables, users have the power to transform their digital personas into something truly one-of-a-kind. This gives users a good opportunity to showcase their creativity and personality in the metaverse. All in all, wearables are a key tool in personalizing Base NFT avatars to make them truly original and special. Customization includes, but is not limited to: trendy hairstyles, stylish shirts, or fashionable hats. All of which may make your NFT reflect your uniqueness.</p>
 NFT Packs and How to Obtain Them 
 Purchasing NFT packs 
<p>Users have the option to purchase NFT packs, which contain a curated selection of wearables to customize their Base NFT avatars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the chosen pack, users may reveal up to 10 different wearables, from hairstyles to shirts, hats, and more. The number of packs users can buy have no limits, which may offer members endless chances to design their NFTs.</p>
<p>Users can buy NFT packs, or redeem NFT packs using SELF tokens, minted by performing tasks that benefit SelfKey DAO. This unique approach allows users to actively participate in the community. Active participants may mint tokens that can be used to obtain NFT packs and further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Alchemy 
<p>Members have the option to use their duplicate wearables for a chance to generate super rare wearables, adding an exciting element of rarity and exclusivity to the customization process. By utilizing duplicates, users can participate in a special feature that regulates the number of wearables in existence. This element may make them even more original.</p>
<p>This feature adds an element of gamification to the NFT experience, allowing users to engage in strategic decision-making to potentially unlock unique and highly coveted wearables.</p>
<p>Such an innovative approach may encourage users to actively manage their collection. Simultaneously, it contribute to the rarity and scarcity of certain wearables, making them highly desirable among collectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be an exciting way for users to participate in the evolution of their NFT ecosystem and potentially obtain one-of-a-kind, super rare wearables to further customize their Base NFT avatars.</p>
 Expansion Packs 
<p>With changing seasons, exclusive and time-limited collectible NFTs may be introduced into the packs. These limited-edition NFTs offer a unique opportunity for users to acquire rare and highly sought-after digital assets that are only available for a limited time.</p>
<p>With each new period or season, the NFT packs may be updated with a fresh batch of exclusive collectibles. This may add excitement and anticipation to the design process. These limited-edition NFTs may feature special designs, themes, or functionalities that are only available for a specific timeframe. This method may create a sense of urgency and exclusivity among collectors.</p>
<p>Users who are eager to expand their collection and obtain unique NFTs may be motivated to keep an eye out for these periodic updates and seize the opportunity to acquire these exclusive assets before they are no longer available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dynamic and ever-changing aspect of the NFT ecosystem adds a layer of excitement and rarity to the customization experience, allowing users to continually enhance and evolve their Base NFT avatars with new and exclusive collectible NFTs.</p>
 NTFs and Web3 
<p>In the future, Normies may play a significant role in Web3 games, granting access to exclusive areas within the games and providing bonuses to the play-to-earn rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These digital assets will serve as keys to unlock special traits, areas, or uses that are otherwise out of reach to regular players. By owning specific NFTs, players may gain entry to exclusive areas of the game world, revealing hidden treasures, unique challenges, or rare resources and bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This integration of NFTs in Web3 games may add a new side of ownership and utility to these digital assets. Furthermore, it may allow players to not only design their Base NFT avatars. At the same time, it may also enhance their gameplay and overall experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It creates a favorable relationship between NFT holding and in-game achievements. This may incentivize players to collect and utilize these digital assets to gain an edge in the virtual world.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>SelfKey iD may offer a diverse range of assets that can be utilized for customization, allowing us to express ourselves freely in the online world while striving to safeguard our private information from prying eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With SelfKey iD, we may confidently navigate both Web2 and Web3 spaces, knowing that our data may remain under our personal control and ownership. However, we can still make ourselves stand out and be recognized by our unique and one-of-a-kind NFTs.</p>
<p>By utilizing SelfKey iD, we may strike a balance between privacy and self-expression, creating a personalized online presence while increasing control over our sensitive information. Overall, it may be an ideal way to operate in the digital world with confidence and freedom.</p>

<p>Ultimately, SelfKey iD may be a win-win for everyone involved.</p>
 Ease of Use 
<p>For identity owners or data subjects, the ease of use when it comes to digital identity schemes primarily depends on how easy it is to enroll and use their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is designed with simplicity in mind, utilizing <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">soulbound tokens</a> so that users may easily produce their credentials using any non-custodial wallet.&nbsp;</p>

 SelfKey iD vs traditional KYC checks 
<p>SelfKey iD may be a better alternative for identity verification, as it may offer a more efficient, secure, and user-friendly approach to KYC.</p>
<p>By using the potential of blockchain technology and smart contracts, SelfKey iD may provide a secure, decentralized, and efficient identity verification process. It may have the potential to eliminate many of the issues associated with traditional KYC methods, possibly making the process more user-friendly and safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, but with SelfKey iD, users may have complete control over their digital identities and they might exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">SSID</a> rights more easily than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 How does SelfKey iD work? 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD is a smooth and hassle-free process that prioritizes user convenience without compromising security and privacy. The streamlined procedure may ensure that users have access to a secure and private digital identity that they can trust.</p>
 The process&nbsp; 
<p>By following the simple steps outlined by the platform, users can obtain a SelfKey iD quickly and with ease. The steps are as follows:</p>
 
  Users must first log in with their wallet and pay an entry fee.&nbsp; 
  The next step would be to undergo a KYC verification process. This method is designed to ensure that the user's identity is authentic and that they meet the necessary eligibility criteria.&nbsp; 
 
<p>The verification process typically consists of:&nbsp;</p>
 
 performing a <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">selfie check</a>. 
 providing personal information, such as name and address. 
 providing government-issued identification documents, such as a passport.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Additionally, users will not be able to create duplicate accounts.</p>
 
  Once the KYC process is complete, legible users are automatically approved. 
  The final step in the process is to mint the soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT. This unique digital asset is generated using blockchain technology and is securely bound to the user's digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It might serve as proof of identity and it may be used to authenticate the user's identity in a variety of settings, such as:</p>
 
 online marketplaces. 
 financial institutions. 
 other digital platforms, such as social media and videogames. 
 
<p>Even more, as the concept of the metaverse gains popularity, the need for secure and reliable digital identities becomes increasingly important. SelfKey iD emphasizes privacy and self-sovereignty. Therefore, it may be the perfect identity credential for the exciting products and services of the future.</p>
 Minting soul-bound SelfKey ID NFT 
 Aggregating Multiple Credentials 
<p>By combining different SBT (soul-bound tokens) and identity credentials, SelfKey iD may provide a higher level of verification for the user's identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials which may be aggregated by a SelfKey iD include, but are not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Metaproof. 
 KYC credentials issued by SelfKey Network issuers. 
 Traditional accounts, such as: Google, Apple, Discord, Github, Twitter, and the likes. 
 Various identity tokens, such as Binance’s BAB token issued in 2022. 
 
<p>This implementation may have significant advantages over individual credentials, as it may increase the reliability and accuracy of identity verification. And, an increase in reliability and accuracy is crucial for online interactions and services that require trust between parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more credentials added to the SelfKey iD container, the more trust may be established, and the more reliable and secure the user's digital identity may become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the integration of multiple SBTs and identity credentials within a SelfKey iD container might provide users with unparalleled flexibility. This may enable them to add as many credentials as they require to establish their identity in a variety of contexts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may enhance the SelfKey platform's versatility and utility. It might make it more appealing to individuals and institutions seeking a reliable and secure digital identity solution.</p>
<p>Essentially, SelfKey's implementation of an aggregated credential system in its platform may be a significant step forward in the development of a strong and reliable self-sovereign identity ecosystem.</p>
 Attaching NFT series to SelfKey iD 
<p>SelfKey continues to prioritize user-friendliness with the introduction of a unique feature that may enable users to attach a distinct NFT series to their SelfKey iD profile picture. This feature may add a touch of personalization and uniqueness to the user's digital identity. Even more, it might reflect the growing trend of NFTs in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may also enhance the user's experience by providing them with more options to personalize and showcase their digital identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the addition of the NFT series feature to the SelfKey iD platform reflects the platform's continued focus on user-friendliness, personalization, and innovation.&nbsp;</p>
 Access to SelfKey DAO 
<p>Obtaining a SelfKey iD may provide users with numerous benefits that enhance their experience on the platform and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These benefits may include:</p>
 
 access to the governance of the SelfKey Protocol. 
 the ability to mint SELF tokens. 
 participating in staking. 
 exclusive access to member-only channels on Discord. 
 obtaining exclusive collectible NFT packs. 
 registering for KEY.ETH ENS domains. 
 enjoying instant login to partner apps. 
 
 Minting SELF tokens 
<p>Having access to the <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> may enable users to mint their own SELF tokens. The token might then be used for various purposes and services on the SelfKey platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature may add value to the user's experience and may provide them with more control over their digital identity.</p>
 Staking 
<p>By staking KEY tokens on their KYC credential, users may mint SELF tokens. Staking on credentials may be a way for individuals to demonstrate confidence in the accuracy of their data. This, in turn, may increase the validity of their credentials. Users may withdraw tokens at any time, although this will result in the termination of SELF token generation.</p>
 Exclusive Discord Channels 
<p>Access to member-only Discord channels may be another perk of having a SelfKey iD. It may provide users with a community to engage with other DAO members through a designated channel. DAO members may also discuss proposals for the governance of the DAO.&nbsp;</p>
 NTF packs 
<p>Exclusive collectible NFT packs may also be available to SelfKey iD holders. This may add a unique and personalized touch to their digital identity. These collectibles are released by the SelfKey DAO, further enhancing their customization and originality.</p>
 KEY.ETH ENS domains and SelfKey iD 
<p>Moreover, SelfKey iD holders may register for KEY.ETH ENS domains. This might enable them to create unique and easily identifiable domains for their online identity.</p>
 Instant login to partner apps 
<p>Instant login to partner apps may be another advantage of having a SelfKey iD. This may provide users with a seamless and secure login process across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the benefits of having a SelfKey iD express the platform's commitment to providing users with a comprehensive, valuable experience. It may enhance their ability to navigate the crypto space with ease and confidence.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>In theory, SelfKey iD may be a strong and reliable form of digital identity that might be used for a broad range of use cases in the crypto world. With its focus on user-friendliness, security, and privacy, the SelfKey iD may be well-suited to the needs of decentralized societies and Web3 applications.</p>
<p>However, SelfKey iD may also be suited for traditional Web2 platforms that want to benefit from security and anti-bot features inherent to the SelfKey iD system.</p>
<p>SelfKey iD may not only empower the governance of the SelfKey DAO but it may also provide a model for other decentralized governance systems. By offering powerful, privacy-preserving identity credentials, the SelfKey iD might enable more fair and democratic governance. This way, users may have greater control over their data and identities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey_dao_incentive_system/">SelfKey DAO</a> aims to provide new forms of decentralized governance, which may allow members to experiment with different approaches and explore the full potential of the SelfKey iD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the crypto world continues to evolve, the SelfKey iD might play an increasingly important role in enabling secure and transparent transactions across a wide range of platforms and applications.</p>

  It is already known how centralized systems work: the majority must follow the rules and authority of the few in order to benefit from necessary tools, applications, and websites.  

Even more, centralized systems do not offer us the means or opportunity to voice our concerns and needs as members of the system.

DAOs, on the other hand, are shaped by the voices of its active members who work togeth

 Summary 
<p>Nowadays, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are becoming more and more popular due to the many benefits they offer. These include creating a safe environment for individuals to interact with one another. as well as equality and transparency among its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the potential of DAOs, however, many struggle with a lack of user participation. Without active engagement from its members, decision-making and growth can be delayed, and the DAO's decentralized structure can decline.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-dao-revolutionizing-web3-interactions/">SelfKey DAO</a> is addressing this issue by developing an engagement system that aims to keep its members active and involved. By motivating participants to regularly engage within the DAO, the DAO itself will become more active and successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will elaborate on the SelfKey DAO engagement system, its benefits, and how members can participate in the DAO in order to mint tokens.</p>

 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>To fully benefit from the platform's incentive system, users need to participate actively in the DAO's general governance and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are specific tasks which participants of a DAO can do in order to mint work tokens and help maintain the DAO.</p>
 How to keep the SelfKey DAO active and mint work tokens 
<p>Member engagement is a key necessity in order to benefit from an active platform. Aside from contributing to the overall well functioning of the SelfKey DAO, active members have the opportunity to mint work tokens by completing certain tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, there are some essential activities that participants can perform to help SelfKey DAO in achieving its goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
 
 Invite Friends. 
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system. 
 Engage with the official Selfkey SM posts. 
 Be active in the official discord channel. 
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system.

 Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions. 
 
 Invite Friends 
<p>Inviting friends to join SelfKey DAO can increase the membership and participation of the platform. This could offer more resources for the system, as friends could potentially bring in new skills and connections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If more people join SelfKey DAO, the network security of the SelfKey ecosystem can grow. The benefit of this is that it can potentially result in greater visibility, influence, and impact within the larger community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, a constant flow of new participants to the DAO can be a valuable strategy for expanding and strengthening it. It can increase its resources and capabilities, and build a more powerful sense of community and collaboration among its members.</p>
 Post social media (SM) messages generated by the system 
<p>It’s highly important for members to actively post SM messages generated by the system in order to boost the visibility of SelfKey DAO and its activities. This way, participants can help expand the SelfKey network by bringing awareness to the platform and its goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using system-generated Social Media messages, SelfKey DAO can make sure that its content is consistent and on-brand. This can help create credibility and build trust among the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another benefit of SM messages generated by the system is that it can be more efficient than manually creating and posting each message. This can save time and resources, allowing members of the DAO to focus on other important activities.</p>
 Engage with official Selfkey SM posts 
<p>Engaging with official SelfKey SM posts could help members stay informed with the latest official news and connect with others participants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It allows members to make informed decisions, increase their visibility, and potentially attract new business opportunities. Participants can also give constructive feedback, which can lead to platform upgrades that could benefit the entire community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, by engaging with official SelfKey SM posts, active members can gain access to exclusive content or benefits that are not available anywhere else.</p>
 Be active in the official Discord channel 
<p>The SelfKey Discord channel is a community hub where users can connect with other members of the SelfKey community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Participants who stay active in the channel can engage with other individuals, share ideas, and collaborate on projects. Even more, active members can quickly get answers to their questions and find solutions to almost any problems they may encounter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Ft2U7DKg4X">official discord channel</a> is often the place where SelfKey DAO announces and hosts various events and activities. Therefore, keeping up with the channel and actively participating in discussions, members can stay up-to-date with important news and information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing initiative and creativity in developing new ideas or solutions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By showing drive and creativity, active members can help develop new ideas and solutions that will help the DAO grow. This can be anything from suggesting new features for the DAO's platform to proposing fresh methods for community governance.</p>
 Stake on own credentials to increase security and reliability of the system 
<p>By certifying that members have a deep-rooted interest in keeping their own credentials safe, the overall security of the system can be enhanced. This can also minimize the risk of credentials being lost or stolen, as well as help keep participants safe from identity theft or other security breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage of staking is that it can increase the credibility of the system by motivating participants to make sure that their credentials are valid and up-to-date. This way, errors or mistakes in the data can be prevented, reducing delays or issues when using the platform.</p>
 Help with developer and designer tickets based on DAO grants 
<p>One of the key benefits of offering a grant within SelfKey DAO is that members can mint tokens for their contributions to building the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping with developer and designer tickets can improve the overall quality of the platform. By addressing technical issues and making improvements to the design, the platform can become more user-friendly, efficient, and effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can aid in attracting new users and retaining existing ones, as well as drive the growth of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way that members can contribute to the DAO is by delivering on development, design, and QA bounties based on grants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bounties encourage members to tackle specific tasks that have to do with the development, design, and testing of the DAO's software. Participants can work together or individually to deliver high-quality work that meets the needs of the DAO and its community.</p>
 The Benefits and Uses of Work Tokens 
<p>As stated previously, SelfKey DAO facilitates benefits for active members, such as being able to mint tokens. We’ve elaborated on the activities active members can perform. Now, let us focus more thoroughly on how participants can make use of the work tokens they mint.</p>
 Work tokens can be exchanged for NFT packs 
<p>SelfKey’s NFTs are called Normies, and they can be customizable to fit the user’s personal preferences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some advantages Normies bring to members:</p>
 
 they allow users to express their unique creativity and personality by creating one-of-a-kind digital assets.&nbsp; 
 they can increase the originality of the asset, as it becomes more exclusive and personalized.&nbsp; 
 they enable members to have greater control over their digital assets. 
 they allow members to modify or add additional content to their NFT. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFT packs that members can obtain by exchanging work tokens can be used in several ways.</p>
 
 To customize Normies around a specific theme or concept, such as a particular genre or event, such as: fandoms, movies, games, music, etc. 
 To customize Normies by choosing the background, outfits, hair styles, skin color and texture, or additional details. 
 To create different levels of rarity among the NFTs contained within them. For example, a pack could contain one or more ultra-rare, limited-edition wearables. 
 To build a collection of related or complementary NFTs. This can motivate members to collect multiple packs in order to complete the entire set. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, SelfKey’s NFT packs can include unlockable content, such as additional media or exclusive access to events.</p>
 Work tokens can be used to participate in DAO Governance 
<p>DAO governance is ideal for members because:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Decisions are made through a decentralized voting system that takes every participant’s opinion into consideration. 
 It represents a more fair and open method of organization that aims to benefit every active member. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>Centralized systems are based on pyramid structures, where the majority have to follow the rules and authority of the few. Typically, in this kind of structure, individuals have no way of voicing their needs, let alone have them met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs, on the other hand, can be shaped by the participants’ direct involvement. This is why it is important to keep DAOs active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey DAO is working on developing the most efficient incentive system to make sure that active members are constantly involved with the development of the DAO. It’s likely to become the ideal space in which individuals can safely engage and have their needs heard and met.&nbsp;</p>

 Online Safety 
 Digital revolution: both a blessing and a curse 
<p>In the past several decades, mankind has shown magnificent progress in computer science. So much so that society quickly became accustomed to using Information and Communication Technologies on a daily basis. Whether it is for recreational purposes, communication, work or education, mundane tasks are made significantly easier with the help of cutting-edge technology and wireless systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is capable of performing convenient assignments, such as reading, generating, integrating, and theorizing information. However, it is also heading dangerously fast towards mimicking a trait which, up until now, has been uniquely human: identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is leaked, AI can potentially make use of that information to steal or forge human identities. Thankfully, the future will also bring ways to prevent that. A Self-Sovereign Identity solution is being developed to protect our data from being stolen and sold.</p>
 How safe is it really out there? 
<p>Using technology and having a digital presence has become so common nowadays that many people don’t think twice about the security of their personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although they are within the safety of their homes, their data is still potentially visible to millions of users online. Among those millions, there are many individuals with bad intentions, who look for ways to use other people’s private data for their own personal benefit.</p>
<p>More often than not, however, it is entities that individuals are supposed to trust who end up selling or divulging their personal information to other parties. And those parties, whether willingly or not, will put that personal information at risk of being unlawfully used by bad players.</p>
<p>At the moment, unfortunately, people have come to depend on centralized systems in order to benefit from online services to perform their daily tasks. Without those online services, it would be impossible for individuals to function in the present day society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is more of an obligation rather than a choice,and it has become so normal that we simply go with the flow. Otherwise, we will not be able to keep up with the fast-paced changes in the way we work, study, and communicate.</p>
 Our digital identities 
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) belonging to individuals, firms or organizations is being stored online in the form of digital data. This collection of digital data is then used to build our digital identity.</p>
<p>A digital identity is used to facilitate access to services that make it easy for computers to efficiently mediate transactions between two or more individuals. The web provides us with a quick way of performing these transactions. However, it is not the safest place to store our private information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">Data breaches</a> happen on a daily basis without our knowledge. Through data breaches, important and valuable information can be stolen and sold, including our very own digital identities.</p>
<p>Ideally, individuals should be able to make use of the advanced, modern day technology without the risk of their private data ending up in the wrong hands. In order for that to happen, individuals need to have more control over how their information is stored and who has access to view or share it, at all times.</p>
 The illusion of choice 
<p>Nowadays, control seems less impactful on our lives, because the deception of freedom is given to us through choices. However, when access to necessary modern applications is being restricted unless personal data is consensually shared, choice becomes an illusion.</p>
<p>With the choice to opt in being enforced, people have grown used to accepting the privacy policies of applications without a second thought. These policies, that we barely even bother to read, do mention how data is shared with third parties. However, we cannot do anything but blindly trust that service providers will not abuse or mishandle our data.</p>
<p>At the moment there is only the illusion of consent, of trust, all in the detriment of the individual. Because of this deceitful way of forcing users to consent to their data being used, trust between individuals is becoming more and more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>SSID aims to dispel these illusions and bring authentic consent and trust to the mainstream.</p>
 Seeking safety in a digital world 
<p>Sadly, Big Tech often profits off of individuals at the expense of the latter’s safety, which may lead up to identity theft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many users are unaware of the unlawful incidents happening underneath the brightly colored backgrounds of websites and applications as they perform their daily online tasks. Living under the impression that, as long as there is no malware alert on their devices, they have nothing to be concerned about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alarming truth, however, is that security violations occur on a daily basis. These cumulative cyber attacks can potentially cause millions of dollars in damages to the individuals whose data was involved.</p>
 How will Self Sovereign Identity improve our online activities? 
<p>Fortunately, a solution to the above-mentioned risks is currently being developed by SelfKey. It will be the sword and shield for individuals to function and perform transactions in the safest way possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self sovereign identity not only gives back the freedom of choice, but it also prevents this kind of disaster from happening. SSID users give access only to individuals that they wish to engage with. During this interaction, only a very limited amount of information is shared.</p>
<p>Therefore, sensitive, protected and important data is less likely to be sold to or shared with harmful individuals and organizations. Self sovereign identity was conceived to prevent data leakage in this sense. It gives users the power not only to manage and control, but also to protect what they deem valuable.&nbsp;</p>
 Self Sovereign Identity 
 A brief introduction 
<p>Self sovereign identity (SSID) is a new way of managing digital identities, which aims to put individuals in control of how their accounts and private information are managed. With SSID, individuals have full ownership over their personal data. They no longer need to rely on centralized systems that might share their data with unknown parties for personal gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can store their private information into their devices and present it for validation when it is specifically needed. This way, the risk of having their data compromised is considerably reduced. Individuals are in complete control over how their information is used and stored, at all times.</p>
 How self sovereign identity is currently being implemented 
<p>Once Self Sovereign Identity users store their private data on their devices, they can quickly take the opportunity to interact with trusted partners. In order to benefit from the services offered by these trusted partners, users need to accept the processing of their information by the partners. This is declared by the relying party once the user attempts to onboard into their services.</p>
 Issues with the current implementation of Self Sovereign Identity 
 Adoption and Convenience 
<p>At the moment, SSID users must store their data on their private device instead of the traditional central database. This method allows the users to have full control of their personal data. On the down side, the flow by which users interact with the system is less convenient than centralized alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Storing data on one private device makes it difficult for it to be accessed by the user’s other devices. Individuals have to manually introduce their information into devices they want to use, which can become time consuming and frustrating.</p>
 Scalability 
<p>Currently, users can only exercise their self sovereign rights with partners within the SSID environment. More so, individuals need to trust that the parties they choose to interact&nbsp; with will handle their personal data with respect to their privacy and store it securely.</p>
 How can the current Self Sovereign Identity implementation be improved and scaled? 
 
 Should we use Centralized Systems for convenience? 
<p>Centrally controlled systems are databases in which an individual’s digital identity is stored in one or more servers belonging to a centralized entity. Once personal data is stored in this type of server, an individual has no way of knowing who has access to it, who it is shared with, or where it ends up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When personal data is being shared with unknown, third parties, there is a high risk of unintentional information disclosure. This can lead to dire consequences like identity theft or secret information being disclosed to the public, stolen or sold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While centralized systems are not necessarily malicious, their security is weak, which leads to data leakage. With AI progressing alarmingly fast, this is a particularly serious concern. As a conclusion, centralized systems can not be used to improve the adoption and scalability of SSID solutions.</p>
 Are Decentralized Systems a better option? 
<p>On the polar opposite of centralized systems are decentralized systems. This type of system stores and verifies information in multiple computers that work together as nodes in a network, popularly known as a blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By transferring the control from a centralized entity to a dispersed group, decentralized systems aim to reach a level of fairness among its users, without one individual having authority over the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way data is stored in a decentralized system makes it very difficult for malicious parties to manipulate it, because it is secured by the blockchain. A decentralized system is perfect for storing public and openly-accessible data, such as a record of transactions.</p>
<p>However, storing personally identifiable information (PII) in a decentralized system is highly unadvised, even if it is encrypted. PII can be anything from full name, phone number, full date of birth, full address, or credit card information.</p>
<p>Once data is made public, it can not be erased or changed, and it is openly accessible to anyone. Therefore, decentralized systems alone are not ideal for storing private information, due to inevitable and permanent loss of privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are part of the solution, though, and we will discuss in the following sections.</p>
 Is there a solution to this dilemma, then? 
<p>At the moment, SelfKey is actively working on and is committed to delivering an ideal solution to increase the adoption of SSID, using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next segments we will thoroughly discuss SelfKey’s proposed solution, which pertains to:</p>
 
 The Trust Triangle 
 The Three Pillars of self sovereign identity 
 Zero Knowledge Proofs 
 
 The Trust Triangle 
<p>Presently, we are accustomed to the traditional “peer-to-peer” interactions between identity owners and verifiers. To better facilitate the goals of SSI, a three-party system is proposed. In this triangle, two individuals that want to interact securely can rely on a third party to issue and to confirm the authenticity of their credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 For example: 
 
 We have individual A and individual B, two entities who are about to make an exchange. B has obtained their verifiable credentials (personal data that can be checked for validity) from C, a third, neutral party. C is legally permitted to vouch for B’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 B wants to make a purchase with A, but the services provided by A are age-restricted. Therefore, A must check with C if B legally qualifies to access that kind of service.&nbsp; 
 In this case, there is only one specific inquiry that must be clarified: whether B is a legal adult. That is the only information that C will validate with A. 
 A does not have access to extra information that would otherwise be physically printed on an ID or a passport. This information can be name, full address, full date of birth, social security number, photos, etc. Basically, any identifier that B does not want to share with A or to divulge to the public. 
 This also eliminates the risk of A, if potentially ill-intended, retaining private information from B. There is no visible data for A to read and memorize. There is only C’s confirmation that B qualifies (or not) to purchase a service from A, without giving out specific details. 
 
<p>This applies to any kind of identifier which is needed to validate interactions between persons or companies. The risk of personal data being visible to individuals outside of the trust triangle is eliminated this way. And even within the trust triangle, only the minimum, relevant information will be shown or confirmed.</p>
 Agents of The Trust Triangle 
<p>The issuer is the entity that releases verifiable credentials after verifying the claims given by the holder.&nbsp;</p>
 
 It is typically an institution, an organization or an individual who possesses the legal authority to verify and to vouch for the holder’s authenticity.&nbsp; 
 Examples of issuers are governmental institutions; universities, departments, companies, agencies, authorities, training institutions, etc.&nbsp; 
 The issuer is a neutral party whose role is only to validate a claim in a holder-verifier transaction. 
 
<p>The holder (data owner) is the individual, a person, a company or an organization who owns unique, personal data.</p>
 
 The holder earns verifiable credentials after providing proof of authenticity to the issuer.&nbsp; 
 The data owner will use those verifiable credentials to prove authenticity before benefiting from various services, making purchases or transactions. 
 
<p>The verifier (relying party) is the entity which verifies a holder’s verifiable credentials.</p>
 
 The relying party will need to verify only a specific piece of information. Only the bare minimum which is relevant to provide a service to the holder. 
 The verifier checks if the holder’s data is issued by a competent and legally authorized issuer. 
 The verifier makes sure that the holder’s data has not been tampered with, forged, expired or revoked.&nbsp; 
 
 Trust in the digital world 
<p>What makes this triangle work is that the three parties are willing to trust one another. The element of trust is important, especially in a time where information forgery and theft happen quite frequently. But within a trust triangle, the user (or holder), has complete control over the management and visibility of their data.</p>
<p>As stated above, digital identities are the counterparts of physical identities that are verified through paper documents. The way trust works digitally is similar to the real, tangible world. However, the consequences of having personal information exposed to the public digitally are much greater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having to trust a centralized database is more or less forced upon individuals. Otherwise they couldn’t benefit from services required to perform daily transactions, either for personal or professional gain. Within a trust triangle, SSID can facilitate these daily transactions without holders having to concede to “blind trust” and risking the safety of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The Three Pillars of Self Sovereign Identity 
<p>Within the trust-triangle framework, there are three main components, or “pillars”, that enable the realization of the ideal solution SSID is aiming to achieve:</p>
 
 Blockchains 
 Decentralized Identifiers 
 Verifiable Credentials 
 
 Blockchains&nbsp; 
<p>A blockchain is a ledger which is shared across thousands of computers around the world. These computers act like nodes within a network, storing and verifying information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to modify or cheat the system.</p>
<p>Within a blockchain, data is saved like a compilation of records, linked to one another. Each user has a copy of this collection, which makes it particularly difficult for hackers to unlawfully modify the information stored within.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, data is protected using complex cryptography which, at the moment, cannot be deciphered by malignant parties. The blockchain will provide the security layer necessary for users and relying parties to interact within the SSID framework.&nbsp;</p>
 Decentralized Identifiers&nbsp; 
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, for short, are the digital counterparts of physical documents, IDs, passports or licenses used to verify one’s identity.</p>
<p>What qualifies as an identifier is any kind of information that proves an individual’s identity and individuality. Traditionally, identifiers are issued and stored by centralized systems, such as governmental institutions and organizations.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers no longer depend on a central system to manage, issue, and store valuable, private information. They ensure that individuals are able to generate their own identifiers with the help of systems that they trust. Individuals can then use cryptographic proof, such as digital signatures, to authenticate their new identifiers as their own.</p>
<p>Decentralized identifiers are unique. They cannot be forged or stolen, because identity itself is unique and pertaining to only one individual. For example, a digital wallet address can be used as a decentralized identifier.</p>
 Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 
<p>Verifiable credentials are digital versions of physical, paper documents used by persons, businesses, and organizations to identify themselves. Individuals can also use them to prove that they are qualified to access a service or perform a transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are, but not limited to: digital birth certificates, digital education certificates, digital licenses, digital employee identification cards.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are issued in a tamper-evident manner that is respectful of the individual’s privacy. Bad players cannot make any unauthorized attempt to modify or forge digital documents without leaving evidence behind. This is something that a relying party will verify at each check.</p>
<p>In the physical world, a tamper-proof document would be sealed within multiple layers that are locked in a specific manner. If anyone attempts to open them, they cannot rearrange the layers in the original way. There is visible evidence that someone has unsealed and tampered with the document.</p>
<p>Using such a tamper-proof document, holders can present them to issuers and be verified immediately. This makes onboarding even more convenient than what centralized services offer nowadays.</p>
<p>But how do individuals make use of these credentials? We believe that the answer to that question lies within Zero Knowledge flows detailed below.</p>
 Zero Knowledge 
<p>In the current context, the concept of zero knowledge simply means that a relying party (verifier) does not need any additional information, other than the necessary minimum, to confirm whether a data owner (holder) qualifies for the service they provide or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the zero-knowledge proof method within a trust triangle, participants will benefit from secure interactions. This is because their full personal information does not need to be revealed in the majority of interactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit our previous example but with ZK in mind:</p>
 
 Holder A wishes to access Verifier B’s services, which are age-restricted. 
 B needs to verify with Issuer C whether A qualifies for said services.&nbsp; 
 C will confirm whether A is of age or not, without revealing the full date of birth, or specific age. Confirmation is expressed in the form of a ZK proof. 
 B will not have access to any kind of additional information, like location, actual date of birth, full name, full address, gender, etc. Likewise, B will not be retaining any data, because there will be no information for B to memorize or share outside of the interaction with A. 
 
 Conclusions 
<p>The quick progress of technology is both thrilling and anxiety-inducing. It can be challenging to adapt to these fast-paced changes. However, there will always be ways to combat the threat of being controlled by an ill-intended higher power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Self Sovereign Identity is keeping pace with this constant technological uprising, making sure to protect its users. It aims to maintain the ideal that there’s a choice that doesn’t trap individuals in exhausting, exploitative loops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its goal is to continuously certify its users to reach their full professional and personal potential. To restore each individual’s ability to be the sole controller of their PII in their digital lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey is restlessly working towards achieving ways for users to be able to safely engage with partners in an environment that is secure and neutral. At the moment, SSID is an ideal, a work in progress. SelfKey has the potential to become the bridge that will take its users towards a much safer and empowering future.&nbsp;</p>

 Artificial Intelligence and Humanity 
 Humans versus technology 
<p>The advancement in technology for the past several decades has stirred a growing debate of humans versus artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, if AI begins to take over tasks which were traditionally associated with people, what are people left with? Their sense of humanity and individual identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digitalization has impacted every aspect of our lives, making it easier for us to perform our daily tasks. Because of this, we have more or less become dependent on technology in order to operate in the online world.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Overall, the topic of AI is quite controversial. Throughout history, humans have been cautious about accepting new technologies since the dawn of the industrial age. While technology has undoubtedly brought significant improvements to our lives, an important question remains:</p>
 
<p>Will AI ultimately be beneficial or detrimental to our well-being in the long run?</p>
 
<p>We will examine the potential advantages and disadvantages of AI in the following sections.</p>
 The benefits of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>Despite the potential risks and challenges posed by AI, there is no denying that it brings many benefits and advantages for humanity.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Technology has filled our lives with entertainment, efficiency, and enhanced accessibility by eliminating frustrating and time-consuming tasks. Not only that, but it has made performing our daily tasks considerably easier and it has opened doors to an incredible library of information.</p>
 
<p>Let’s briefly explore some of AI’s key benefits:</p>
 
 
 
 Automation. Advanced technology can program AI to do tedious, repetitive mundane jobs, so that humans can focus on more complex and creative tasks. 
 
 
 
 
 Efficiency. AI has the capability to analyze a large amount of data and find patterns and trends that might be hard for humans to see. This can help individuals make better decisions. 
 
 
 Accesibility. Thanks to modern technology, individuals can benefit from applications that make working, studying, and communicating remotely much easier.&nbsp; 
 Accuracy. Under careful supervision, AI can perform tasks with high accuracy, reducing the risk of errors and improving performance tremendously. 
 
 
 The dark side of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>With AI progressing at incredible speeds, technology has raised concerns about privacy and security. One of the biggest concerns nowadays is the threat of AI stealing human identities. There has been an increase in data breaches and cyberattacks, which leads to a growing need for stronger security measures to protect our personal data.</p>
 
<p>Like any other innovation, AI undoubtedly has its drawbacks, which are often overshadowed by its benefits. Basically, AI systems are designed to learn and make decisions based on data. Therefore, if the data used to train these systems is biased or incomplete, it can lead to flawed decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>We can understand the dark side of AI once we examine some of its potential risks and negative impacts:</p>
 
 In the wrong hands, AI systems can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks. 
 Because of this, privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to AI. 
 Data breaches could result in divulging sensitive data, leading to significant consequences, like loss of privacy. 
 Hackers can make use of the leaked data to steal or forge individuals’ digital identities. 
 AI can generate fake identities, which can be used to influence the decision-making or output of a system. 
 
 
<p>As AI systems continue to evolve, it becomes more and more difficult to predict their actions. Consequently, we cannot hold them accountable for their faulty behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do, then? 
<p>Artificial intelligence is currently not a sentient being, it cannot make its own decisions.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>It can either be used for good purposes or for malicious purposes, depending on the intentions of the individuals behind it. And, while humans are not equipped with the accuracy and efficiency of state-of-the-art technology, we can use AI to fight against malicious AI.</p>
 
<p>Thankfully, there is a method which can verify an individual’s identity in a secure, efficient and highly accurate manner.&nbsp;</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality 
 What is Proof of Individuality? 
<p>Proof of individuality (POI) is a protocol that supports the statement that every person is a distinct and unique individual. As a matter of fact, individuality is a core aspect of human existence. It refers to the one-of-a-kind set of characteristics, thoughts, emotions and perspectives that make each person different from one another.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>While digital identities can be stolen and sold, individuality is not something which, at the moment, can be duplicated. At this time, it represents our liveliness as real, tangible, mindful beings.</p>
 Identification in modern times 
<p>Identification is an important aspect of our lives. Above all, it is unique to each and every one of us, and it represents our liveliness. Therefore, as technology makes new, magnificent progress every day, AI-Powered proof of individuality has become an essential part of our daily existence. From accessing bank accounts to opening doors, AI-Powered proof of individuality has revolutionized the way we identify ourselves.</p>
 
<p>Some of the most common AI-Powered proof of individuality methods are:</p>
 
 Fingerprints 
 Facial recognition 
 Iris scans 
 
 
<p>These biometric identification methods are highly accurate and reliable, making them the go-to method for identification in many industries.</p>
 How can AI-Powered Proof of Individuality benefit us? 
<p>Overall, AI-Powered proof of individuality has many advantages. Particularly:</p>
 
 Speed 
 Accuracy 
 Remote identification 
 
 Speed 
 
 The traditional methods of identification, such as presenting a physical paper for verification can cause delays. 
 Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are much quicker. For example, using a fingerprint scanner can take only a few seconds. 
 As a result, Ai-Powered proof of individuality methods are efficient in situations where time is of the essence. 
 
 Accuracy 
 
 Biometric methods such as facial recognition and iris scans are highly accurate. 
 In such a case, the chance of false positives or false negatives is minimal. 
 This level of accuracy is ideal for high-security situations, such as airport security or government buildings. 
 
 Remote identification 
 
 AI-Powered proof of individuality made it possible to identify individuals remotely. 
 With the use of online identification tools, individuals can verify the authenticity of each other’s identities. 
 There is no need to meet in person anymore. Therefore, physical distance is no longer an obstacle. 
 
 How does AI-Powered Proof of Individuality work? 
 A brief description 
<p>AI-Powered proof of individuality uses artificial intelligence to verify an individual’s identity based on their biometric features and behavior.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>As mentioned previously, biometric features are fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Some of the behavior patterns this technology analyzes are:</p>
 
 Typing speed and style. How a person types on a keyboard, how long they pause between keystrokes, and how hard they press the keys. 
 Mouse movements. How a person moves the cursor on a screen, the direction and speed of their movements. 
 Voice patterns. The way a person talks, their pitch, tone and accent. 
 Smartphone usage. The way a person holds or uses their smartphone, the angle of how they hold their device, or how they swipe and tap on the screen. 
 
 All in the benefit of the individual 
<p>The idea that our devices check our behavior patterns might be anxiety-inducing. Without a doubt, it can be scary thinking how technology knows us better than we know ourselves. However, in this case, AI is programmed to keep our individuality safe from malicious, bad players.</p>
 
<p>This way, organizations can improve security and prevent identity fraud. Furthermore, AI-Powered proof of individuality is more convenient to access digital services without the need for passwords or tangible identification cards. Passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.</p>
 
<p>Consequently, AI-Powered proof of individuality has the potential to positively transform how we verify our identities in the digital age.</p>
 AI-Powered Proof of Individuality and Selfkey 
<p>Our goal at SelfKey is to offer individuals a secure means of verifying their identity through AI-Powered proof of individuality methods.&nbsp;</p>
 Guidelines for users: 
 
 The user will first have to perform a KYC check.&nbsp; 
 
 
 KYC stands for Know Your Customer, and it is a mandatory process of identifying and verifying an individual’s identity. It is done to ensure that the user is genuinely who they claim to be. 
 
 
 
 The user will then obtain the SelfKey iD SBT.&nbsp; 
 
 
 <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">SBT</a> stands for Soulbound Tokens. They are non-transferrable, verifiable, digital tokens that can show an individual’s accreditations, work experience, work history, and past records. 
 
 
 
 After this, the user onboards to SelfKey DAO. 
 
 
 DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is governed by a community of individuals on a decentralized blockchain network.&nbsp; 
 The rules of a DAO are transparent to all members in order to create equality between users. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>After the user completes all of the steps above, SelfKey will require an AI-Powered selfie check. This modern method of verifying an individual’s identity uses facial recognition technology.</p>
 
<p>For instance, here’s what happens during an AI-Powered selfie check:</p>
 
 The user will take a selfie and submit it to an AI-Powered system. 
 The AI-Powered system will check the photo against a vast collection of pre-verified images. 
 The system will use algorithms to identify unique facial features, like:&nbsp; 
 
 
 distance between the eyes 
 &nbsp;the shape of the jawline 
 &nbsp;the position of the nose 
 
 
 If the user passes the check, they will receive a POI (proof of identity) credential, which they can stake KEY on. 
 If the user does not pass the check, they will not be allowed to continue. 
 In the case of a false negative, the user will have the possibility to contact support. 
 
 
<p>These AI-Powered selfie checks will be made periodically, each time a user performs important actions within SelfKey DAO.</p>
 How does this benefit us? 
<p>This method is widely used by online platforms and organizations that require a high level of trust and security in their user authentication process. Firstly, it is a quick, convenient, and reliable method. Secondly, and most importantly, AI-powered checks will prevent identity fraud in the online world.</p>
 
<p>For instance, AI-Powered proof of individuality will efficiently and accurately check that:</p>
 
 The user’s selfie is not forged by another individual. 
 The user’s selfie is not AI-generated or fake. 
 The user is a real person. 
 The user’s selfie matches the original selfie they submitted during the KYC check. 
 
 Anti-Sybil technology 
<p>Did you know that there is a term for “identity fraud” in the digital world? In the context of online security and identity verification, “Sybil” refers to the act of creating multiple fake identities or accounts.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>A single, malicious individual or a group can do that, with the intention of manipulating or deceiving the system. Alarmingly, it can carry out spam attacks, manipulate voting in online polls for elections, even inflate the popularity of a website or social media.</p>
 
<p>Preventing Sybil attacks is a crucial challenge in the design of many online systems. Thankfully, SelfKey’s AI-Powered proof of individuality methods can fight against that.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Even though technology has posed challenges throughout the decades, it has an immense potential to make society better. AI-Powered Proof of Individuality has become a part of our daily lives, helping us identify ourselves in a quick and efficient manner. The advantages modern identification methods bring are undeniable.&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>In spite of that, having concerns about privacy and security is normal, especially when it comes to our individuality. However, SelfKey is continuously working on developing methods to combat those who use cutting-edge technology for malicious purposes.</p>
 
<p>Finally, as technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more complex methods of identification in the future. But, it is vital to remember that we are supposed to use technology to enhance our lives, our work, rather than replace them. The solution is to find a balance between technology and humanity.</p>
<p>Together with SelfKey we can achieve that balance.&nbsp;</p>

 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>The rise of technology has made a great impact all around the world. It changed the way we communicate, work, and study. With the help of artificial intelligence (AI), most of our daily tasks are made considerably easier, and access to information has never been more effortless. However, in order to benefit from all the wonders of AI, we have to become part of its world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of our private information had to evolve from physical papers to digital identities, which are stored in centralized systems. But while traditional, centralized systems are convenient, they put our private data in danger due to their weak security measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankfully, solutions are being developed to change the way we authenticate ourselves online and the way we perform individuality-based activities on Web3. Technology can help protect our private information, just as much as it can be used to compromise it. The key is to remember that we can use AI for our benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will thoroughly elaborate on DAOs, SelfKey’s DAO (including specific terms like KEY, SELF, and NFTs), and how user engagement in the DAO will be beneficial for individuals in the long run.</p>

 Conclusions 
 
 Humans and Digital Identity 
 How we operate in the online world 
<p>Nowadays, we operate in the online world in many ways. We use various tools and platforms to connect, communicate, and collaborate with one another across the globe. For instance social media, messaging apps, online forums, and video conferencing. The web has opened up endless opportunities for people to share information, ideas, and experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as with any aspect of human behavior, there are also challenges and risks associated with operating in the online world. One of the biggest concerns is the safety of our personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 The risks we take when performing individuality-based activities online 
<p>When we engage in individuality-based activities online that involve sharing personal information, we expose ourselves to a variety of potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, personal information shared online can be accessed either by AI or human identity thieves, putting our privacy and security at risk. Even seemingly small details such as our names, birthdates, or email addresses can be used to compromise our security. This can lead to AI attempting to create fake identities using our leaked personal data.&nbsp;</p>
 What can we do to avoid those risks? 
<p>Being cautious about what we share online and keeping our privacy safe is very important. However, it is equally important to make sure that the individuals we engage with are not fake, AI-generated entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols within a DAO can be the most secure means of verifying that individuals are genuine, real persons. Not only that, but within a DAO, there is no single entity to govern and control our personal data. What a DAO strives to achieve is equality and fairness among its users, as well as maintain the security of their individuality.</p>
 DAOs vs centralized systems 
 A brief description of DAO&nbsp; 
<p>A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that usually operates using blockchain technology. This facilitates decentralized decision-making and transparent governance without the need for a centralized authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAOs are typically run by a group of individuals who hold tokens or cryptocurrency. Individuals can also vote on decisions related to the organization's operations. For instance: funding proposals or changes to the organization's rules.&nbsp;</p>
 How DAOs are revolutionizing individuality-based operations 
<p>DAOs&nbsp; are changing the way individuals operate by innovating the concept of decision-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In traditional organizations, individuals cannot materialize their ideas or concerns, due to the centralized systems based on hierarchies. DAOs, on the other hand, allow members to participate in decision-making processes and contribute to the organization's goals through decentralized governance mechanisms.</p>
<p>By using blockchain technology, DAOs enable trustless collaboration and eliminate the need for intermediaries. This method makes it easier for members to join and participate in collective decision-making. Additionally, it creates a more inclusive and democratic environment where each member can have an equal say and contribute to the organization's success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, DAOs are empowering individuals to come together, build communities, and work towards common goals, without sacrificing their individuality or autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 DAOs and individuals 
 DAOs suffer from lack of user participation 
<p>Despite their potential benefits, DAOs can suffer from a lack of user participation. Because DAOs rely on decentralized decision-making, they require active participation from members to ensure that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner.</p>
 How will user participation help DAOs “stay alive” 
<p>User participation is critical to the success and sustainability of DAOs. Without active participation from members, DAOs may struggle to make decisions, coordinate actions, and achieve their goals. Moreover, low participation can lead to apathy or disengagement. In turn, this can weaken the community and reduce the value of the DAO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, active user participation can help DAOs stay alive by:</p>
 
 Promoting engagement. 
 Building a strong community. 
 Ensuring that decisions are made in a timely and effective manner. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, user participation is essential for DAOs to remain viable and achieve their goals over the long term.</p>
 The benefits of participating in DAOs 
<p>Participating in DAOs offers numerous advantages for individuals looking to collaborate and contribute to a community-driven effort. It provides opportunities for innovation and community building while offering financial incentives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the benefits include:</p>
 
 Democratic decision-making 
 Rewards 
 Increased security 
 Unique contributions 
 Transparency 
 
 SelfKey’s DAO 
<p>After explaining the general concept of DAOs, let's examine SelfKey’s DAO objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Individuality is a vital aspect that the SelfKey DAO is focused on. In SelfKey’s Protocol, every member’s uniqueness is valued in order to help protect their digital identity from theft and forgery. We aim to create a safe environment with the help of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a>, where valued members can operate using trustless and secure methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selkey’s DAO aims to provide secure and private digital identity solutions. With strong credentials in cryptography and blockchain technology, Selkey’s DAO’s goals include protecting users' privacy and giving them control over their data. Credentials are lacking in the crypto industry, and they’re a need in order to keep users’ information safe from being doxxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, SelfKey’s goal is to develop a method for individuals to engage with one another in a decentralized, trustless environment, while their private data and individuality remain safe and secure.</p>
 Important Terminology in SelfKey’s DAO 
 What is KEY? 
<p>The KEY <a href="https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/what-is-a-utility-token/">utility token</a> is the centerpiece of the SelfKey Protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has several uses, such as:</p>
 
 Being a means of payment for services within the SelfKey Protocol. 
 Being used to stake credentials on. 
 Being utilized to govern and empower members of the SelfKey DAO. 
 Providing the necessary tools for users to take control of their digital identity and secure their privacy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As more individuals join the SelfKey Protocol, the potential uses of KEY will only continue to expand, further cementing its importance as a vital component of the decentralized digital identity revolution.</p>
 What is SELF? 
<p>While KEY remains the vital utility token to stake on credentials, SelfKey has proposed SELF tokens in order to help an individual keep track of what they have staked and for what period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of SELF’s attributes:</p>
 
 SELF tokens can be minted by individuals who properly staked on a real identity. 
 Essentially, SELF can be used as a sort of measurement of reputation. 
 SELF tokens have utility as a reputation signal - they should strengthen legitimate credentials and they may help weed out illegitimate credentials. 
 They are issued by users themselves. 
 They do not have any intrinsic value. 
 SELF tokens may also have utility as a governance mechanism. Those who use, accrue reputation, or are acting as a sort of “identity mining” to secure the platform will receive governance influence. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the user will stake on a credential which is valid, the user will accumulate reputation to said credential in the form of tokens.</p>
 SelfKey’s NFTs 
<p>At SelfKey, active members have the opportunity to earn NFTs by participating in the community and contributing to the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the unique features of SelfKey's NFTs is that they are highly customizable. This means that individuals can tailor their NFTs to their specific needs and preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey places a great emphasis on individuality, recognizing that each person has their own unique identity and set of circumstances. It is a platform that truly values individuality, and is dedicated to helping people take control of their own identity and data. This is reflected in the customizability of its tokens and the overall design of the platform.&nbsp;</p>
 How to participate in the SelfKey DAO 
<p>Participating in the SelfKey DAO and earning tokens offers many benefits, such as:</p>
 
 The ability to have a say in the project's direction. 
 Voting rights on proposals. 
 Access to exclusive community events. 
 The opportunity to earn rewards through active participation in the DAO. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO provides a platform for community members to be more engaged and invested in the success of the SelfKey Protocol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
 
 First, a user must perform a KYC check in order to properly authenticate themselves as a real person and the person whom they claim to be. Afterwards, they will join the DAO. 
 The user will then be able to stake KEY tokens on their KYC credentials. Afterwards, they will be able to start accumulating SELF tokens. 
 SELF tokens can be used to purchase NFT packs with particular customizations. 
 Alternatively, the user can mint their SELF tokens and use them for whatever purpose they find useful and fit. 
 Finally, users can contribute to the SelfKey DAO by performing tasks based on grants issued by the ecosystem. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, active participation and engagement in the SelfKey DAO can bring significant benefits to the SelfKey Protocol and its members. By being actively involved in the decision-making process, members can help shape the direction of the project, making sure that it aligns with their interests and needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, engagement can help build a stronger sense of community among SelfKey users, fostering a supportive environment for learning and growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a thriving SelfKey DAO requires active participation from its members, and those who are willing to engage will reap the benefits of a more robust and inclusive ecosystem.</p>
 Conclusions:&nbsp; 
<p>Unfortunately, most people still rely on centralized systems. However, efforts are being made to empower them to take charge of their personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SelfKey DAO aims to assist individuals in gaining full control of their private data, enabling them to safely engage in Web3 transactions based on their individuality. Despite being a small ecosystem at present, it is secure and has the potential to reach new heights with the help of user participation and engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the SelfKey DAO develops, users will derive more benefits from it. Ultimately, it is user contribution that will enable SelfKey to achieve its long-term goals.</p>

<p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert and COO Elina Cadouri joined the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) on April 18-20, 2023 in California. IIW is a community-driven event that brings together a diverse group of individuals interested in <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity?ref=blog.dock.io">digital identity</a>. The event has been held since 2005 and attracts a range of participants including technologists, policy makers, and entrepreneurs. Among over 300 participants, Nick and Elina met with government, company, and research representatives from organizations of all sizes.</p><p>“We enjoy participating in IIW because it’s a great way to get a sense of the key trends happening in the industry and meeting people developing the same kind of technology. It’s been wonderful to take focused time to dive deeper into great discussions including use cases and technology standards,” said Nick. </p><p>IIW is not your typical event. It is an “unconference” where the meetings and event structure is largely driven by the participants rather than the organizers to create a collaborative atmosphere. The focus is not to promote products, but more about sharing and learning.</p>COO Elina Cadouri and CEO Nick Lambert at the Internet Identity Workshop in California. Key IIW Discussions That Emerged <p>Governments’ Digital Identity Strategies</p><p>There was a discussion on the growing number of governments that are developing and implementing digital identity strategies. The trend is particularly progressing in the EU, Estonia, parts of Asia, and British Columbia (Canada). </p><p>In the European Union for example, the European Commission has been producing regulation for European Digital Identity, which aims to provide a secure and user-friendly way for EU citizens to access public and private services online. The proposal includes the development of a digital wallet that will enable users to store and manage their identity documents, such as passports and driving licenses, in a secure and convenient way.</p><p>Estonia has been a pioneer in digital identity, having implemented a national digital identity system in 2002. The system, known as ID-card, enables Estonian citizens to access a range of public and private services online, including voting, banking, and healthcare. The ID-card is widely used in Estonia and has been recognized as a model for digital identity systems around the world.</p><p>Product Market Fit</p><p>There is a growing need and demand for decentralized identity and <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential technology</a> across a variety of industries including supply chain and education.

<p>While many organizations have established environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals and made ESG commitments, driven by purpose and emerging regulatory requirements, they face several challenges when making the transition from ambition to action.</p>



<p>A recent IBM study found that global executives cite <a href="https://ibm.co/esg-ultimatum">inadequate data</a> (41%) as the biggest obstacle to their ESG progress, followed by regulatory barriers (39%), inconsistent standards (37%) and inadequate skills (36%). The impacts of data challenges are becoming visible to company stakeholders, with <a href="https://ibm.co/esg-ultimatum">consumers making purchasing — and even employment — decisions</a> based on a company’s progress toward their ESG goals.</p>



<p>Those who have committed to <a href="https://www.sap.com/documents/2023/04/9268b27e-6e7e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html?Campaigncode=CRM-YI23-IMM-2072538">closing the green gap</a> have embraced sustainability-focused processes and are reaping the benefits. If data is a key barrier to success, then companies should consider implementing an environmental strategy that encompasses an all-in organizational commitment to specific targeted outcomes and leverages technology to accelerate and track progress.</p>



<p>Another recent study from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/erp-sustainability">IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) and SAP</a> surveyed 2,125 senior executives involved in their organizations’ environmental sustainability strategies. The study yielded a surprising result: organizations that outperform their competition in both environmental and financial outcomes also boast the most deeply engaged enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.</p>



<p>ERP is the technology of record, touching virtually every organizational business process. It can connect financial and environmental goals, keeping metrics accountable and accessible. When implemented in conjunction with other systems, ERP enables cost transparency and visibility—allowing environmental, regulatory and business-critical decisions to be made with improved consistency and reliability.&nbsp;</p>



 Uncovering hidden possibilities with ERP 



<p>An organization’s sustainability data can be difficult to attain due to siloed business processes, unreliable data and misaligned business priorities. ERP uncovers real-time material information across business functions and gets necessary data into the hands of corporate decision makers and operators for a streamlined user experience. This newfound access to data gives businesses the capability to record, report and act on enterprise wide ESG commitments and help resolve many of the complex challenges and demands of sustainability. With this visibility, people can see the impact of their decisions and trust the results being reported, which can accelerate the cultural change needed to support and accelerate overall sustainable business transformation.</p>



<p>While moving the needle on making progress toward ESG goals can seem nearly impossible for some, there are organizations that have managed to crack the code to greener success. The IBM and SAP study mentioned above found a group of high achieving business leaders (15%)—the Environmental Sustainability Enabled (Enabled)—that actively prioritize environmental sustainability and implement concrete, well-publicized plans to achieve goals at a far higher rate than their peers. The study found that Enabled organizations place environmental sustainability on par with financial performance because they see sustainability fueling financial results.</p>



<p>The recent study also found that the Enabled rely on ERP data structures to address sustainability goals, among other standout findings, including:</p>



 
 Enabled report 47% of sustainability performance data is collected in their ERP, but they expect that to increase to 55% by 2025—a 17% increase. 



 94% more of Enabled believe ERPs are helping manage manufacturing sustainability goals. And 31% more believe the same as relates to labor management. 



 Enabled report accumulating almost 70% of their carbon capture and energy use metrics in their ERP. 



 Enabled organizations use ERP to establish standard environmental measures across ecosystems 39% more often than Reluctant (organizations that do not view environmental sustainability as important to their success). 



 43% more Enabled versus Reluctant organizations use ERP to established shared environmental targets. 
 



<p>All organizations should take note: in an interwoven economy, ERP can help populate and standardize shared sustainability initiatives.</p>



 The time to act is now 



<p>Sustainability and ERP are team sports acting on actuals, and no one team can achieve success on its own. As strategic partners for <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html">S/4HANA</a> and <a href="https://www.sap.com/sustainability">SAP Sustainability solutions</a>, IBM and SAP bring together technologies and services with enterprise-scale platforms to help companies break down silos and embed solutions across critical business functions and operations. Sustainability continues to be a business imperative and the pressure to change business process will only continue to increase.</p>

SAP and IBM understand how to help companies move the needle on their ESG commitments, without sacrificing their business needs or profitability. </p>

				  The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) has a reputation for bringing the identity community together for passionate discussion. At the most recent meeting, held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA, AI, Governance, and use cases in the public sector took center stage. We offer you the Cliff notes.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Char Howland &amp; Mike Ebert</p>
<p>The biannual Internet Identity Workshop (IIW) holds a unique position in the identity scene as an “unconference,” meaning anyone is able to attend and lead sessions on topics that they would like to share their findings on or wish to learn more about. With a wide range of skill levels, from beginners to technical experts, it is a place for both collaborative learning and for brainstorming solutions to move identity projects toward completion. Here are our personal highlights from the unconference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government Interests</p>
<p>The US government has been taking notice of digital identity efforts and is currently working on specifications for solutions to be put into widespread use. To do this, it needs public feedback and IIW offers a prime spot to speak with people familiar with the space.</p>
<p>One session, humorously titled “What do you want to tell the government?” led to discussion as to how it should adapt to specifications that are already in place, and how it should decide on new specifications that need to be created.</p>
<p>We had an interesting conversation with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on how credentials could be a part of the government’s strategy for managing critical infrastructure, from which we offer two takeaways.</p>
<p>The government is sending people who know what they are talking about and who are extremely interested in implementing these kinds of solutions.</p>
<p>The community needs to be ready to answer these questions and be able to clearly explain both the technology and use cases.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence</p>
<p>With artificial intelligence (AI) in the news, it wasn’t a surprise to see several sessions at IIW, including one which we attended titled “How can we have digital trust in the age of ChatGPT?” The best answer is decentralized identity, but how exactly this will look is still open for discussion. Attendees were very excited about this topic and how AI will drive an even greater need for strong identity systems.</p>
<p>Indicio recently published a position paper that highlights how these two technologies can work together, and how decentralized identity will allow for greater uses of AI. You can read a more indepth look <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">here</a> (requires registration).</p>
<p>Trust as an Alignment of Expectations</p>
<p>Another interesting topic was that people trust systems differently based on their expectations of privacy online. Privacy has different meanings for everyone, including the choice of having privacy, how much control the user has, the right to be left alone, and freedom from intrusion</p>
<p>The presenters of this session found that, very often, a “privacy violation” was actually due to a misalignment of expectations. It was interesting to learn that certain trends appeared along generational lines, with older generations tending to assume that they have privacy in their internet interactions unless otherwise specified and younger generations tending to assume that their actions are public unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>The takeaway was clear: When creating a system, it is important to clearly outline what is trusted, what is private, and what is not, to avoid misunderstandings and unhappy users.</p>
<p>National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute for Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) recently put out its <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which aim to “present the process and technical requirements for meeting the digital identity management assurance levels specified in each volume.”</p>
<p>This document drove many conversations, and one in particular was the need for applicant representatives and trusted referees. What this means is that in a situation where a person needs translation, can’t access a computer, or is in some sort of crisis, there needs to be some way to digitally trust or vouch for that person. It is a requirement to consider and account for the ways in which disadvantaged populations can access the technology.</p>
<p>To learn more about the most recent IIW you can watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OW-Rke9m7VI">daily wrap up series</a> on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’d like to attend the next conference the event details are currently available on the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com">IIW website.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>AUSTIN, TX, 27 April 2023 — BOTLabs GmbH, developer of KILT Protocol, today announced the Frequency blockchain will integrate KILT’s portable, censorship-resistant identity infrastructure for users of decentralized social networks. Appearing onstage at Consensus by CoinDesk, Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica Labs (the team that was the initial technical contributor to Frequency) and Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT shared their vision of how a universal social graph and digital identity innovations will deliver Web3 utility to the everyday Internet&nbsp;user.</p><p>Frequency delivers essential tooling to enable decentralized social networking at massive scale. KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs), or digital fingerprints, a core element of digital identity. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials, like a passport or driver’s license, to the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>Frequency and KILT share a common mission of restoring control of personal data to the individual. Centralized social networking platforms have evolved into identity providers by offering convenient logins across multiple online services, making it difficult for users to understand which personal data was shared between the social network and third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>The advent of Web3 technologies enables people-centric social networking apps that give consumers more control over their data. The Frequency blockchain uses a lightweight “Social Identity” to make it possible for users to be discovered, connect and interact with others on a shared public social network, and a user to leverage their own network of personal connections across&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This Social Identity will be connected to KILT’s Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), a new Web3 authentication framework users can bring the full functionality of KILT’s solution into their decentralized social experience. Users decide which elements of their identity are exposed, to which audience. With KILT the user owns and controls their data; no company or entity can shut off their access or delete their&nbsp;data.</p><p>“For decentralized social to achieve mass adoption, we need new, interoperable social primitives. This work demonstrates how projects can come together to deliver more value to users and fuel a healthier web,” said Harry Evans, CTO of Amplica&nbsp;Labs.</p><p>“Centralized online services and data-hungry social networks have been the only identity providers available to consumers — until now”, said Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs GmbH. “The integration with Frequency will accelerate consumer demand for decentralized identity providers, making KILT’s framework more critical for new verticals within the Polkadot ecosystem and&nbsp;beyond.”</p><p>Frequency and KILT are part of the Polkadot ecosystem, a network of specialized, interoperable blockchains. In a new use case for Polkadot’s innovative Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), authentication with KILT DIDs will be enabled on Frequency via XCM between the parachains.</p><p>This work is currently in development. Once complete, KILT and Frequency will be testing integration and features on Rococo before deployment to the production parachains.</p> About Frequency <p>Frequency is a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for high-volume use cases that makes it possible for builders to deliver decentralized social applications at massive scale. Blockchains typically have volatile, high transaction costs that become prohibitively expensive at the frequency required for social networking. Frequency solves this problem with a revolutionary pricing model in which builders reserve replenishing transaction capacity at a predictable, low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>Frequency is designed to support the scaling of the Social Web, an evolution of the internet in which core social networking functionality is integrated within the web itself. The <a href="https://www.dsnp.org/">Decentralized Social Networking Protocol</a> (DSNP), released by international nonprofit <a href="https://projectliberty.io/">Project Liberty</a> in 2021, is a new open source project that is designed to be a foundational element of the Social Web. By connecting to DSNP over Frequency, applications can cost-effectively deliver Web3 features to large, established user bases while tapping into the compounding network effects of the universal, shared social graph enabled by&nbsp;DSNP.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p>KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world, while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> Press Contacts: <p>For Frequency:<br>media@frequency.xyz</p><p>For KILT Protocol:<br>Christine Mohan<br>christine@kilt.io</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/frequency-integrates-kilt-to-enrich-identities-for-decentralized-social-network-users-1750ab762a59">Frequency Integrates KILT to Enrich Identities for Decentralized Social Network Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>27 April, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.artory.com/">Artory</a>, a world leader in tokenizing fine art and collectibles, has partnered with the leading tokenization platform, <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, to compliantly unlock liquidity in the traditionally illiquid art market through the market tokenization standard ERC3643.</p>
<p>Leveraging their proven track record in art tokenization, Artory plans to tokenize art investments at scale. Artory’s technology captures trusted asset due diligence information from partner institutions to generate a verified asset token with signed certification. With Artory’s fully-auditable, certified asset token, the artworks can be wrapped in digital financial product offerings, such as funds, and participate in digital markets.</p>
<p>Artory has chosen to expand their tokens with the ERC3643 standard to avoid restriction to one local trading platform and take advantage of the standard’s on-chain compliance thanks to its built-in identity system. Financial instruments tokenized with the standard are interoperable with any other trading venue, centralized or decentralized, that uses the same blockchain network.</p>
<p>Artory and Tokeny align in their visions to create an open, compliant, and transparent ecosystem for art investors through this collaboration. Artory’s proficiency in providing auditable certifications and data-driven valuation for artworks, combined with Tokeny’s ready-to-use tokenization engine for using the ERC3643 standard, provides an all-in-one solution for tokenized art investment and liquidity opportunities.</p>
<p>For centuries, art and rare collectibles have been coveted investments, typically reserved for the affluent due to high barriers to entry. Remarkably, art has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 for over 20 years, with fine art values rising more than 71% in the past decade. Furthermore, the Artprice100 index shows that blue-chip art has outpaced the S&amp;P 500 since 2000.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to art’s historically low correlation with traditional markets, investing in art can potentially serve as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. However, art is a complex asset class that requires a comprehensive inspection and appraisal performed by experts before being considered for investment. With Artory’s institutional-grade art tokenization, this asset class now has become increasingly accessible. Artory’s expert certification and data-driven valuation for the underlying artwork assets, together with Tokeny’s compliant infrastructure leveraging the ERC3643 standard , now enable art professionals to seamlessly tokenize trusted physical artworks and access liquidity through the digital ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in 2016 by Nanne Dekking, who has over 25 years of global expertise and influence in the art market, Artory has focused on certifying and tokenizing art and collectibles by obtaining reliable due diligence information from partner institutions like the prestigious art appraisal and advisory firm, Winston Art Group.</p>
<p>Together, Artory and Tokeny have tackled the two biggest obstacles in this industry – inaccessibility and opaque valuation – while ensuring compliance.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    Indisputable reliability of the data recorded about any piece of artwork and the expertise of the specialists recording that information is the prerequisite for unlocking liquidity in the art market and represents the core of Artory’s mission. After 7 years of working in the art tokenization market, we want to make trusted, tokenized art investments accessible across platforms, rather than in siloed private markets. ERC3643 is a game changer in achieving this goal, providing a complete interoperable ecosystem for liquidity. Tokeny provides the best solution using the standard, and we are excited to be collaborating with them to open up art investment and liquidity opportunities. Our combined expertise will bring unprecedented accessibility to the art industry.  Nanne DekkingFounder &amp; CEO of Artory       Artory has been a trailblazer in the art tokenization market since 2016, and we are thrilled to partner with them to bring even more open, compliant and interoperable innovation to this space. We are excited to see the ERC3643 standard gaining traction and its network effect beginning to show. It is an exciting time for the art market, and we are thrilled to be a part of it.  Daniel CoheurChief Commercial Officer at Tokeny

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dilip Ishara and I am from Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am an internet marketing and communications expert. I have more than 5 years of experience working within the marketing field having started my career working in a digital marketing role in 2015. I would now consider myself one of the leading community managers and digital marketing experts in Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p><p>Aside from my day-to-day job, I’m also a crypto enthusiast and a lover of all things blockchain. This is something I have gotten more involved with in recent years. I have worked with several successful initial coin offering (ICO) projects since 2015 and helped them to achieve a strong stance in the market. I also provide consultancy services to ICO projects, working specifically within the area of marketing, PR, and communications.</p><p>In June 2019, I joined Ontology as a regional community manager and since then, I have been able to build a very fast-growing community that includes some of the most talented individuals across Sri&nbsp;Lanka.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>As an Ontology Harbinger, my day-to-day duties include community management, translating content and resources for the Sri Lankan community, and managing events within the community.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out is its high-speed network and low-cost transaction fees. We strive to offer our customers the highest levels of convenience and the lowest transaction cost on the&nbsp;market.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>I think the most exciting thing about the Ontology project is how accessible the platform is for users. Whether you are completely new to crypto trading or a crypto expert, you can stake with Ontology using its user-friendly stalking mechanism.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>Becoming an Ontology harbinger back in 2020 was one of the most important moments in my career, as I was able to join a project that I am very passionate about.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am excited to see how the Ontology ecosystem develops over the next few years. I know that the team has been working continuously on improving and advancing the project, and establishing Ontology as the leading crypto project in the market — so I am looking forward to witnessing this.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I believe that Web3 will become mainstream within the next five years, becoming even more popular than the internet. I also expect that governments across the world will launch their own cryptocurrencies in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This is something that many governments have already placed on their roadmaps.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-dilip-ishara-8b6e906cce3f">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Dilip Ishara</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp;  
 In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.

 What Are the FTC MFA Requirements?&nbsp;  
<p>In October 2021, the FTC announced that it was updating the Safeguards Rule. The Safeguards Rule took effect in 2003 as part of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and aims to protect U.S.-based consumers from data breaches, cyberattacks and their resultant effects, such as fraud and identity theft.</p> 
<p>The update was deemed necessary due to the much-changed security and threat landscape since the start of the century. One of the most significant changes is an expanded definition of a covered financial institution. Entities such as auto dealers are included if they handle financial consumer data. The updated rule also introduces critical new technology requirements, specifically it mandates <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all covered companies, no matter their size.</p> 
 Safeguards Rule Overview  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">updated version of the rule</a> introduces several requirements for relevant firms based around them developing, implementing and maintaining an information security program. The program must contain several administrative, technical and physical safeguards that ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information.</p> 
<p>There are nine specific elements in the updated rule that respond to the new threats facing companies and customer information, including:</p> 
  
  Implementing <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for all users that have access to customer information  
  Conducting risk assessment and data inventories  
  Training staff about threats, responses and security best practices  
  Choosing appropriately skilled service providers  
  Nominating a qualified Individual from among your staff or from a service provider to implement and supervise your company’s information security program  
  Regularly monitoring and testing the effectiveness of these safeguards, such as through performing (at least) annual penetration testing  
  
 When Do the FTC MFA Requirements Take Effect?&nbsp;  
<p>The FTC has recognized the adoption of MFA <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">as a critical security practice</a> as it effectively prevents a single compromised password from opening up a whole system. Though the updated Safeguards Rule was due to come into force in December 2022, parts of the regulation were delayed by six months as the FTC recognized personnel and supply chain issues made it difficult for some firms to achieve compliance. Companies subject to the Safeguard Rule have until <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/11/compliance-deadline-certain-revised-ftc-safeguards-rule-provisions-extended-june-2023">June 9, 2023 to comply</a> with the MFA provision.</p> 
 Who Does the SafeGuards Rule Apply to?  
<p>The rules around customer information protection contained in the updated Safeguards legislation apply to non-banking financial institutions. However, the FTC warns that “financial institutions” covers a broader array of companies in their usage than the common understanding of the term. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-314/section-314.2">These include</a>:</p> 
  
  auto dealers (specifically any that extend credit or lease vehicles)  
  mortgage brokers and lenders  
  payday lenders  
  collection agencies  
  any retailer that extends credit for their products  
  personal or real estate property appraisers  
  check cashers  
  tax preparation firms  
  financial advisors  
  any company that brings together buyers and sellers as a “finder”&nbsp;  
  
<p>The updated FTC MFA requirements and consumer information protection regulations thus affect a wide range of firms, making data protection and information security a major factor in their risk assessments. This means a data breach or poor security practices can result in reputational damage and can open companies to litigation and fines of up to $46,000 per day per breach occurrence.&nbsp;</p> 
 The FTC MFA Requirements: The Details  
<p>As mentioned above, the FTC has stated that MFA is critical for system security and the protection of consumer information. The implementation of the FTC MFA requirements in line with the updated Safeguards rule requires at least two authentication factors from:</p> 
  
  Knowledge factors (i.e., something you know), such as a password or the answer to a secret question  
  Possession factors (i.e., something you have), such as a device or hardware security key.  
  Inherence factors (i.e., something you are), such as a fingerprint, face or retina scan.  
  
<p>The FTC has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2023/02/security-principles-addressing-underlying-causes-risk-complex-systems">expanded further on its proposals</a> for the adoption of MFA, requiring companies to use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant MFA</a> for their employees. It specifically rules out multi-factor solutions that use SMS, push notifications or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">one-time passwords (OTPs)</a>, explaining that "if a user can be tricked into typing in their username and password, they can be tricked into typing a code from their phone."&nbsp;</p> 
<p>They also recommend that companies refrain from offering forms of MFA based on providing telephone numbers that subsequently receive messages or phone calls. As stated explicitly in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Chegg-DecisionandOrder.pdf">their case against Chegg</a>, an educational services company that exposed millions of customer records in four separate breaches, the MFA offered to all employees, contractors and affiliates “should not include telephone or SMS-based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The FTC MFA requirements also suggest that legacy authentication, such as security questions, is inherently unsafe as it gives the attacker data, and much of the data required to get past the challenge is publicly available. Therefore, companies deploying MFA are also advised not to use the data collected for the authentication system anywhere else to increase security and improve consumer trust, knowing that the MFA is not just another data collection exercise.</p> 
 Complying With the FTC MFA Requirements  
<p>The updated FTC Safeguarding rule aims to deliver better security and confidentiality for customer information and protect against threats and unauthorized access. Implementing MFA for anyone who can access customer information is a critical part of this, and, as advised by the FTC, this MFA should be phishing-resistant. This means that any factor or method which can be "phished" or circumvented through social engineering, such as passwords, OTPs or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notifications</a>, should be deprecated.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Systems such as hardware security keys or those which use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric identification</a> built on secure protocols and public key infrastructure, deliver the best security and allow companies to meet the FTC MFA requirements. In particular, FIDO-based authentication is named as the gold standard for phishing-resistant MFA by the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> and other regulatory bodies.&nbsp;</p> 
 Quickly Meet Compliance Deadlines

<p>Gagon said security and ease are always top of mind in any type of payment, and best practice for account-based payments involves “making sure that the person who is connecting the bank account has the authority on that account.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“The trick with having security and preventing fraud is you don’t want to introduce so much friction that it’s not worth it for a consumer or user to use that payment method or to use that tool. It’s about letting the good guys through, with less friction, and minimizing the challenges that they face,” said Gagon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of our continued work at Spruce is to make it easy for developers and the broader Ethereum community to use Sign-In With Ethereum. Sign-In with Ethereum, otherwise known as SIWE or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, describes how Ethereum accounts authenticate with off-chain services by signing a standard message format. It gives users the power to authenticate with their Ethereum keys in a simple workflow: </p><p><br>You may be thinking, “It’s Sign-In with Ethereum, but can it work with Layer 2 solutions and other EVM-compatible chains?”</p><p>If you are a developer, you might want to enable users of your app to:</p>  Sign-In with Polygon  Sign-In with Avalanche  Sign-In with Optimism  Sign-In with Binance Smart Chain  <p>Fortunately, Sign-In with Ethereum isn’t just for Ethereum. It does, in fact, work with L2s and other EVM-compatible chains, and it’s quite easy to set up with the existing SIWE libraries.</p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/layer-2/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Layer 2</a> (L2s) scaling solutions are off-chain scaling networks built on top of the Ethereum blockchain to improve scalability and efficiency and reduce the cost of performing transactions on Ethereum. These networks leverage <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/?ref=blog.spruceid.com#mainnet">Ethereum Mainnet</a>’s security guarantee and technical advancements while affording higher transactional throughput. The L2s are built using various scaling solutions, such as rollups (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ZK-rollups</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">optimistic rollups</a>) and state channels. Some examples of L2s are Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM) is the computational layer that sits on top of the hardware and node network layer for Ethereum. It executes smart contracts and computes the current state of the network, allowing developers to create a wide range of secure and programmable applications. An EVM-compatible chain is a blockchain or a network that has the ability to run and deploy the smart contract code that can be recognized by Ethereum nodes. Some examples of EVM-compatible chains are Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom. EVM networks do also include the previously outlined L2s, such as Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon. </p><p>How can you use SIWE to enable users to sign in with L2s or other EVM-compatible chains?</p><p>SIWE messages have a set of required fields, one of which is “chainID.” chainID is a unique identifier assigned to each blockchain network. This identifier protects from transactions in one chain being accidentally included in another chain. </p><p>This concept was first introduced in <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-155</a> as a means to prevent replay attacks. Replay attacks are exploits in which an attacker intercepts a legitimate transaction and replays it on another network, potentially exploiting a vulnerability or causing damage. There are several ways to prevent replay attacks, such as using a nonce to ensure each transaction is unique or implementing validation checks to verify the legitimacy of the signature and sender’s address. </p><p>A unique chainID assigned to each EVM-compatible chain ensures that transactions created for one chain aren’t replayed on another. </p>A dapp using the Ethereum blockchain, which has a Chain ID of 1.&nbsp;<p>The easiest way to install SIWE (for Ethereum or, as we’ll show here, for L2s or other EVM-compatible chains) into your dapp is with our SSX library. If you’re new to SSX, check out <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">our documentation</a> or our guide on setting up SSX with Next.js: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/tutorial-ssx-and-next-js/">  Tutorial: SSX and Next.js  Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest projects. This guide will show you how to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>Assuming you have an SSX-enabled dapp, let’s get started.</p> Customizing Fields in the SIWE Message <p>First, you can customize fields, such as the chainID, with the <code>siweConfig</code> option.<br>SSX enables developers to configure the fields of their SIWE message using the <code>siweConfig</code> option. This option allows you to overwrite the fields found in the SIWE message: </p> <code>const signIn = async () =&gt; {
	const ssx = new SSX){
    	siweConfig: {
        	chainId: 1, // set the chainid to your preferred chain
        },
    });

<p>Hello folks,</p>



 
 
<p>I am happy to announce the first panel discussion in our series on Digital Wallets –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.meetup.com/digital-identity-from-vienna/events/292993136/">Thinking Locally and Globally for Digital Wallets and Identification</a>. Digital wallets and identification are a critical element of a future digital native world. Around the globe governments are investing and trialing different concepts while defining the public policy around these capabilities.</p>



<p>The ability to shift populations and gain (or force) adoption of new public policy positions is linked to the ability of the public sector form of governance. Over the past 20+ years the potential of truly digital economies and societies have been expounded endlessly but the results have been mixed, with a consistent shortfall in the meeting of expectations. High assurant digital identity appears to provide the final missing element to allow full digitalization of society to take place. </p>



<p>Our panelists are:</p>



 
 Cosanna Preston-Idedia, VP Advisory Services, IDLab Canada 



 Jacques von Benecke, CTO, Druk Holdings &amp; Investments, Bhutan 



 Bjarke Alling, Principal Advisor, D-Seal 
 



<p>I hope you can join us on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Digital+Identity+from+Vienna+%2336&amp;iso=20230502T19">May 2nd at 1900 CET</a> [That’s 6pm UK, 1pm Eastern / 10am Pacific].</p>

<p>IT Managers run into scalability challenges on a regular basis. It is difficult to predict&nbsp;growth rates of applications, storage capacity usage and bandwidth. When a workload reaches capacity limits, how is performance maintained while preserving efficiency to scale?</p>



<p>The ability to use the cloud to scale quickly and handle unexpected rapid growth or seasonal shifts in demand has become a major benefit of public cloud services, but it can also become a liability if not managed properly. Buying access to additional infrastructure within minutes has become quite appealing. However, there are decisions that must be made about what kind of scalability is needed to meet demand and how to accurately track expenditures.</p>



 Scale-up vs. Scale-out 



<p>Infrastructure scalability handles&nbsp;the changing needs of an application&nbsp;by statically adding or removing resources to meet changing application demands, as needed. In most cases, this is handled by scaling up (vertical scaling) and/or scaling out (horizontal scaling). There have been many studies and architecture development around cloud scalability that address many areas of how it works and architecting for emerging <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">native</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native"> applications</a>. In this article, we are going focus first on comparing scale-up vs scale-out.</p>



 What is scale-up (or vertical scaling)? 



<p>Scale-up is done by adding more resources to an existing system to reach a desired state of performance. For example, a database or web server needs additional resources to continue performance at a certain level to meet SLAs. More compute, memory, storage or network can be added to that system to keep the performance at desired levels.</p>



<p>When this is done in the cloud, applications often get moved onto more powerful instances and may even migrate to a different host and retire the server they were on. Of course, this process should be transparent to the customer.</p>



<p>Scaling-up can also be done in software by adding more threads, more connections or, in cases of database applications, increasing cache sizes. These types of scale-up operations have been happening on-premises in data centers for decades. However, the time it takes to procure additional recourses to scale-up a given system could take weeks or months in a traditional on-premises environment, while scaling-up in the cloud can take only minutes.</p>



 What is scale-out (or horizontal scaling)? 



<p>Scale-out is usually associated with distributed architectures. There are two basic forms of scaling out:</p>



 
 Adding additional infrastructure capacity in pre-packaged blocks of infrastructure or nodes (i.e., hyper-converged) 



 Using a distributed service that can retrieve customer information but be independent of applications or services 
 



<p>Both approaches are used in CSPs today, along with vertical scaling for individual components (compute, memory, network, and storage), to drive down costs. Horizontal scaling makes it easy for service providers to offer “pay-as-you-grow” infrastructure and services.</p>



<p>Hyper-converged infrastructure has become increasingly popular for use in private cloud and even tier 2 service providers. This approach is not quite as loosely coupled as other forms of distributed architectures but it does help IT managers that are used to traditional architectures make the transition to horizontal scaling and realize the associated cost benefits.</p>



<p>Loosely coupled distributed architecture allows for the scaling of each part of the architecture independently. This means a group of software products can be created and deployed as independent pieces, even though they work together to manage a complete workflow. Each application is made up of a collection of abstracted services that can function and operate independently. This allows for horizontal scaling at the product level as well as the service level. Even more granular scaling capabilities can be delineated by SLA or customer type (e.g., bronze, silver or gold) or even by API type if there are different levels of demand for certain <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">APIs</a>. This can promote efficient use of scaling within a given infrastructure.</p>



 IBM Turbonomic and the upside of cloud scalability 



<p>The way service providers have designed their infrastructures for maximum performance and efficiency scaling has been and continues to be driven by their customer’s ever-growing and shrinking needs. A good example is AWS auto-scaling. AWS couples scaling with an elastic approach so users can run resources that match what they are actively using and only be charged for that usage. There is a large potential cost savings in this case, but the complex billing makes it hard to tell exactly how much (if anything) is actually saved.</p>



<p>This is where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> can help. It helps you simplify your cloud billing lets you know up front where your expenditures lie and how to make quick educated choices on your scale-up or scale-out decisions to save even more. Turbonomic can also simplify and take the complexity out of how IT management spends their human and capital budgets on on-prem and off-prem infrastructure by providing cost modeling for both environments along with migration plans to ensure all workloads are running where both their performance and efficiency are ensured.</p>



<p>For today’s cloud service providers, loosely coupled distributed architectures are critical to scaling in the cloud, and coupled with cloud automation, this gives customers many options on how to scale vertically or horizontally to best suit their business needs. Turbonomic can help you make sure you’re picking the best options in your cloud journey.</p>

  <p>Jetty is a small, highly-scalable Java-based web server and servlet engine. It supports HTTP/2, WebSockets, and many other protocols. It powers websites and frameworks, both large and small, such as Google AppEngine. Because it is an Eclipse project, its open source project is called Eclipse Jetty. It is standards-compliant and open source, as well as commercially usable. It is the main alternative to Tomcat when hosting Java applications. Like Tomcat, you can use Jetty both embedded and stand-alone.</p>

<p>By default, Spring Boot creates applications with embedded web servers, which means that the server is embedded within the application code itself, so you don’t have to run a separate web server to publish Java web applications. However, with a little configuration, you can also publish a WAR file to a separate Jetty or Tomcat servlet container (old-school application server style). Spring also uses Tomcat by default, but you can easily change this, as you’ll see.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will build a simple web service with Jetty embedded. After that, you will create the same web service in Spring Boot and Jetty. Finally, you’ll add JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization to the web service using method-level security with Okta as the OAuth/OIDC provider.</p>

   <a href="https://adoptium.net/">Java 17</a>: or use <a href="https://sdkman.io/">SDKMAN!</a> to manage and install multiple versions 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/manual/#installation">Okta CLI</a>: the Okta command-line interface 
   <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli#installation">Auth0 CLI</a>: the Auth0 command-line interface 
   <a href="https://httpie.org/doc#installation">HTTPie</a>: a simple tool for making HTTP requests from the command line 
 

<p>You will need a free Okta Developer account if you don’t already have one. But you can wait until later in the tutorial and use the Okta CLI to log in or register for a new account.</p>

<p>Start by cloning <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example">this tutorial’s GitHub repo</a>:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-spring-boot-jetty-example.git
</code>   

<p>The repository has several projects:</p>

 
   <code>maven-jetty</code>: web service using Maven 
   <code>gradle-jetty</code>: web service using Gradle 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Okta 
   <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0</code>: web service using Spring Boot and Maven secured with Auth0 
 

 Build a simple web service with Java and Jetty 

<p>In the first part of this tutorial, you’re going to create a simple web service using Maven and then Gradle. In the second half, you’ll see how to upgrade this to a Spring Boot-based web service, to which you’ll add JWT-based authentication and authorization using Okta and Auth0 as the OAuth 2.0 and OIDC providers.</p>

<p>You should have the files from the GitHub repository. Open the folder <code>maven-jetty</code> in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>First, take a look at the <code>pom.xml</code> file (which is shown below). Notice the Jetty version is set in the properties block. The only project dependency is <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code>. It is scoped as <code>provided</code> because, in deployment, this package will be provided by the server container.</p>

<p>The Servlet API dependency used to be <code>javax-servlet-api</code>, but Java EE is no longer maintained and has been migrated into <code>jakarta.servlet-api</code>. This happened when Java EE moved from Oracle to the Eclipse Foundation and became Jakarta EE. As you’ll see in the servlet code, this package provides the standardized classes and annotations used to build the servlet.</p>

<p>The packaging type for the project is <code>war</code>, not <code>jar</code>, and the Maven War plugin has been included in the build dependencies (<code>maven-war-plugin</code>).</p>

<p>Lastly, the Jetty Maven plugin has also been included. You can peruse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/jetty-11/programming-guide/index.html#jetty-maven-plugin">the docs here</a>. It is designed to make the development and testing of Jetty servlets easy by adding Maven goals to run and test the app.</p>

&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>The next file to look at is the <code>AhoyServlet</code> class.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/AhoyServlet.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

@WebServlet(name = "AhoyServlet", urlPatterns = {"ahoy"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class AhoyServlet extends HttpServlet {

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print("Ahoy!");
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This file is the most basic, bare-bones web service. In the code, you’re using the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation to define a web servlet without having to define it in a <code>web.xml</code> file. You can see <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/4.0/apidocs/javax/servlet/annotation/webservlet">the docs here</a> for the annotation.</p>

<p>Run the service from a Bash shell using the following command (run from the <code>jetty-maven</code> project root directory).</p>

   <code>./mvnw jetty:run
</code>   

<p>You should see some output that looks like the following.</p>

   <code>[INFO] Configuring Jetty for project: demo

<p>Using HTTPie, test the simple service.</p>

Ahoy!
</code>   

<p>That’s the simplest case.</p>

<p>A little side note. The Maven Jetty plugin provides two tasks for running the app without building a WAR: <code>jetty:run</code> and <code>jetty:start</code>. The one you want to use is <code>jetty-run</code>. From the Jetty docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>jetty:run</code> and <code>jetty:start</code> are alike in that they both run an unassembled webapp in Jetty, however <code>jetty:run</code> is designed to be used at the command line, whereas <code>jetty:start</code> is specifically designed to be bound to execution phases in the build lifecycle. <code>jetty:run</code> will pause Maven while Jetty is running, echoing all output to the console, and then stop Maven when Jetty exits. <code>jetty:start</code> will not pause Maven, will write all its output to a file, and will not stop Maven when Jetty exits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now take a look at a more fully-featured web service.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/HikesTodoServlet.java</code></p>
   <code>package com.demo;

import java.io.IOException;

import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@WebServlet(name = "HikesTodoServlet", urlPatterns = {"hikes"}, loadOnStartup = 1)
public class HikesTodoServlet extends HttpServlet {

    // Not synchronized
    private List&lt;String&gt; hikes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

    protected void doDelete(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
        throws IOException {
        String hike = request.getParameter("hike");
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            response.getWriter().print("Param 'hike' cannot be null.");
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            response.getWriter().print(String.join("\n", this.hikes));
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>This is a web app that tracks a list of hikes. It demonstrates how to support POST and DELETE operations, as well as simple GETs and some simple error handling.</p>

<p>If your local Jetty server is still running, you can go ahead and test it. Otherwise, start it again using the <code>./mvnw jetty:run</code> command.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hikes
</code>   
   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
</code>   

<p>POST a new hike:</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>Delete a hike:</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 110
Date: Tue, 25 Apr 2023 15:25:26 GMT
Server: Jetty(11.0.15)

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>Now try to delete a hike that doesn’t exist or send an empty value:</p>

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
...

Param 'hike' cannot be null.
</code>   

<p>That’s how you can create a web service using Maven and Jetty. To deploy this, you would typically build the packaged WAR file using <code>mvn package</code> and deploy the WAR to your Jetty server.</p>

<p>Stop the Jetty server by pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code> in the terminal window where it’s running.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: this is a very naive implementation of a REST service. It uses an in-memory <code>ArrayList</code> as a data source, which is not synchronized (and thus would run into threading problems in a real web servlet). For anything beyond the scope of this tutorial, you’d need to implement a database backend of some kind. For help on how to do this, see the example blog posts listed at the end of the tutorial. You would typically also add a PUT endpoint and assign each item an ID to use as an index so data can be updated, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.</p>
</blockquote>

 Build a web service with Gradle and Jetty 

<p>Next, you’re going to look at how you can accomplish the same thing you did above, but this time with Gradle instead of Maven. Why? Because some people are allergic to XML and love DSLs instead.</p>

<p>The Gradle-based app is located in the <code>gradle-jetty</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html">Gradle</a> is a Groovy-based build system that uses a custom DSL (domain-specific language) for its build files. Because the build script files are essentially Groovy scripts, the build system is incredibly powerful, thus, very flexible.</p>

<p>To run a Jetty server using Gradle, you’ll use <a href="https://github.com/gretty-gradle-plugin/gretty">the Gretty plugin</a>.</p>

<p>From the Gretty docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gretty is a feature-rich Gradle plugin for running web apps on embedded servlet containers. It supports Jetty versions 10, Tomcat versions 10, multiple web apps, and many more. It wraps servlet  container functions as convenient Gradle tasks and configuration DSL</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This project uses Gretty plugin version 4.0.3, which uses Jetty version 11.0.11. Since version 4, Gretty requires <code>jakarta</code> imports over <code>javax</code>. You can use Gretty 3 if you want to support non-Jakarta apps (this is explained on the Gretty GitHub page above).</p>

<p>The two Java servlet classes are the same in both projects. I did find that Gretty and Gradle crashed unless I added an empty <code>src/main/webapp</code> directory (this wasn’t necessary with Maven).</p>

<p>The <code>build.gradle</code> file is analogous to the <code>pom.xml</code> file.</p>

   <code>plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'war'
    id 'org.gretty' version '4.0.3'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    providedCompile 'jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:6.0.0'
}

gretty {
    contextPath = '/'
}
</code>   

<p>This is about as simple as it gets. The same Jakarta-based servlet API is included as a provided dependency, and the Gretty plugin is included in the <code>plugins</code> block.</p>

<p>The context path is configured to be the root path. If you want to see the other configuration properties, take a look at <a href="https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-configuration.html">the Gretty configuration docs</a>.</p>

<p>You can also look at the Gradle tasks that the plugin adds <a href="https://gretty-gradle-plugin.github.io/gretty-doc/Gretty-tasks.html">in the docs</a>.</p>

<p>To run the web app, use the <code>appRun</code> task.</p>

   <code>./gradlew appRun
</code>   

<p>You can test the two endpoints: <code>/hikes</code> and <code>/ahoy</code>.</p>

   <code>$ http :8080/hikes
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge

$ http :8080/ahoy
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Ahoy!
</code>   

<p>You’ve seen how to build a web service using Jetty in both Gradle and Maven. Next, you’ll build one using Spring Boot and Maven.</p>

 Build a web service with Spring Boot and Jetty 

<p>By default, Spring Boot is configured to use an embedded Tomcat server. However, this is easily configurable. The <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.webserver">Spring Boot docs on embedded web servers</a> is a good resource. To switch to Jetty, you need to do two things:</p>

 
   disable the default embedded Tomcat server 
   enable an embedded Jetty server 
 

<p>This is done in the <code>pom.xml</code> file by these two dependency configuration blocks. The first removes the Tomcat dependency from <code>spring-boot-starter-web-no-auth</code>, and the second adds the <code>spring-boot-starter-jetty</code> dependency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency --&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;!-- Use Jetty instead --&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here is the full <code>pom.xml</code>. Notice the Spring Boot version is 3.0.6 and the Jakarta Servlet version is set to 5.0.0. This is because Jetty does not yet support Servlet 6.0.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

    &lt;modelVersion&gt;4.0.0&lt;/modelVersion&gt;
    &lt;parent&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.0.6&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;relativePath/&gt; &lt;!-- lookup parent from repository --&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.demo&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;SpringBootJetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;0.0.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;SpringBootJetty&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Demo project for Spring Boot&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;java.version&gt;17&lt;/java.version&gt;
        &lt;!-- Required since Jetty 11 does not yet support Servlet 6.0 --&gt;
        &lt;jakarta-servlet.version&gt;5.0.0&lt;/jakarta-servlet.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;

    &lt;dependencies&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;exclusions&gt;
                &lt;!-- Exclude the Tomcat dependency --&gt;
                &lt;exclusion&gt;
                    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
                    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-tomcat&lt;/artifactId&gt;
                &lt;/exclusion&gt;
            &lt;/exclusions&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;!-- Use Jetty instead --&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jetty&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
        &lt;dependency&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/dependency&gt;
    &lt;/dependencies&gt;

    &lt;build&gt;
        &lt;plugins&gt;
            &lt;plugin&gt;
                &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
                &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;/plugins&gt;
    &lt;/build&gt;

&lt;/project&gt;
</code>   

<p>In this case, you’re no longer using the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation. Instead, you’re using the Spring MVC API. The web controller is contained in a class named <code>WebController</code>.</p>

</code>   

<p>To run the Spring Boot app, open a Bash shell and navigate to the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-no-auth</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>Run the following.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Wait for it to finish initializing.</p>

</code>   

<p>This web service has the same features as the <code>@WebServlet</code> version: GET, POST, and DELETE, but no PUT.</p>

 Deploy the Spring Boot project 

<p>You now have a Spring Boot application that runs on an embedded Jetty container. To deploy it to a production server, build an executable jar file using <code>./mvnw package</code>, copy this jar file (found in the <code>target</code> directory) to the server, and run it using <code>java -jar &lt;your jar file name&gt;.jar</code>. There’s no need for a separate web server since this jar contains an embedded Jetty web server.</p>

<p>For example, for this project. First, build the JAR.</p>

   <code>./mvnw package -DskipTests
</code>   

<p>Now run the JAR.</p>

   <code>java -jar target/SpringBootJetty-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: For a more old-school deployment to an application server with multiple separate applications on the same server, you need to build a war file. <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto.traditional-deployment">The Spring docs</a> on how to do this are a great resource. Essentially you need to do two things: 1) add the <code>war</code> plugin to the project dependencies, and 2) change the Jetty or Tomcat dependency to <code>providedRuntime</code> so it’s not included in the packaged war. Then you build a war file and deploy it to the servlet web app path on the server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the next section, you will use Spring Security and Okta to protect the POST and DELETE endpoints.</p>

 Use the Okta CLI to create an OIDC application 

<p>The first step to securing the app is configuring an OpenID Connect (OIDC) app on Okta. OpenID Connect is an identity authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0, an authorization protocol. In short, OIDC is how the app verifies who the user is, and OAuth 2.0 is how the app verifies what the user is allowed to do. Spring Security provides the client-side implementation and, in this example, you’ll be using Okta as the cloud provider.</p>

<p>You need to run the following commands from the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code> subdirectory.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug,http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/,http://localhost:8080/</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: You will use the oidcdebugger.com redirect URI to create an access token you can use from the command line with HTTPie. The second URI is the default redirect URI that Spring Security uses for Okta when using its OAuth login feature.</p>
</blockquote>

 Configure the Spring Boot app for Okta 

<p>The project uses <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> to simplify configure Spring Security. Find the following block in the <code>pom.xml</code> file and uncomment it.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Confirm that your issuer URI, client ID, and client secret were added to the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={clientId}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret={clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SpringBootJettyApplication</code> class is where the security is configured. It looks like the following. It enables JWT-based OAuth and OIDC security. However, it explicitly allows any request. You are doing this because you are going to use method-level security.</p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.SecurityFilterChain;

@Configuration
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootJettyApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootJettyApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests((authz) -&gt; {
            authz.anyRequest().permitAll();
        });
        http.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();

        return http.build();
    }

}
</code>   

 Protect the DELETE and POST endpoints 

<p>The <code>@PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")</code> annotation has been added to the <code>indexPost()</code> and <code>indexDelete()</code> methods in the <code>WebController</code> class. This requires that each request to those endpoints be authenticated – that is, a valid user will need to be logged in. Because you are using Okta as your OIDC provider, they will be able to have authenticated with Okta’s servers, typically through a single sign-on.</p>

<p>Update the <code>WebController</code> to the following.</p>

<p><code>src/main/java/com/demo/WebController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.demo;

import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(path = "/hikes")
public class WebController {

    private List&lt;String&gt; hikes = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(Arrays.asList(
        "Wonderland Trail", "South Maroon Peak", "Tour du Mont Blanc",
        "Teton Crest Trail", "Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass", "Kesugi Ridge"
    ));

    @GetMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    public String indexGet() {
        return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
    }

    @PostMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // &lt;- ***ADDED***
    public String indexPost(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else if (this.hikes.contains(hike)) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "The hike '" + hike + "' already exists.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.add(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

    @DeleteMapping("")
    @ResponseBody
    @PreAuthorize("isAuthenticated")  // &lt;- ***ADDED***
    public String indexDelete(@RequestParam String hike, HttpServletResponse response) {
        if (hike == null) {
            response.setStatus(400);
            return "Param 'hike' cannot be null.";
        } else {
            this.hikes.remove(hike);
            return String.join("\n", this.hikes);
        }
    }

}
</code>   

<p>From the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-okta</code> subdirectory, open a shell and start the app.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>From a different shell, try to POST a new hike:</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
...

{
    "error": "Forbidden",
    "path": "/hikes",
    "status": 403,
    "timestamp": "2023-04-25T16:17:37.214+00:00"
}
</code>   

 Generate a JWT using the OIDC Debugger 

<p>To access the protected endpoints, you need to generate an access token JWT. An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. Open the site in a new window or tab. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. Select code for the response type and Use PKCE.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down and click Send Request.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the access token to your clipboard and store it in a shell variable in the shell window you use to make requests.</p>

   <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJIb05xb01mNE9jREltWnBGRnBINjZGTkFOM0J... 
</code>   

<p>Now try and POST a new hike and then remove it.</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

   <code>http DELETE :8080/hikes hike=="South Maroon Peak" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...

Wonderland Trail
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

 Secure the Spring Boot app with Auth0 

<p>You can also use Auth0 to secure the Spring Boot application. Look at the project in the <code>spring-boot-jetty-maven-auth0</code> subdirectory. Similar to the Okta project, this project uses <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot">the Okta Spring Boot Starter</a> to simplify configuring Spring Security. Find the following block in the <code>pom.xml</code> file and uncomment it.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.okta.spring&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;okta-spring-boot-starter&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Support for Auth0 was added in <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-3.0.3">version 3.0.3</a> of the Okta Spring Boot starter.</p>

<p>If you look in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file, you’ll see that there are two properties: the issuer URI and the audience.</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>Install the <a href="https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cli">Auth0 CLI</a> and run <code>auth0 login</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>You need to find your Auth0 domain. One way to do this is to use the following command.</p>

   <code>auth0 tenants list
</code>   

   <code>=== dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com 

  AVAILABLE TENANTS          
  dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com  
</code>   

<p>Take the above domain and replace the placeholder in the <code>okta.oauth2.issuer</code> property in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file. Don’t remove the trailing slash!</p>

   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/
okta.oauth2.audience=https://dev-0rb77jrp.us.auth0.com/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>The app is configured, and you can go ahead and run it.</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>To test the app, you need to open a new Bash shell in the same project subdirectory.</p>

<p>Just like with Okta, you can list the hikes without a JWT.</p>

   <code>http :8080/hikes
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
</code>   

<p>However, if you try and add or delete a hike, you’ll need a token.</p>

<p>Use the Auth0 CLI to create a valid access token for testing.</p>

   <code>auth0 test token -a https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>Select the <code>Default App [Generic]</code> to continue.</p>

<p>Save the token in a shell variable.</p>

 <code>TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZ...
</code> 

<p>Add a new hike using the token.</p>

   <code>http -f POST :8080/hikes hike="Pear Lake" "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
</code>   

   <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Wonderland Trail
South Maroon Peak
Tour du Mont Blanc
Teton Crest Trail
Everest Base Camp via Cho La Pass
Kesugi Ridge
Pear Lake
</code>   

<p>That’s it. Auth0 security is working!</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – April 13, 2023 – <a href="https://getmerit.xyz/?ref=blog.dock.io">Merit Protocol</a>, a platform connecting employers with financial service companies to enable employees to get better access to financial services, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Merit Protocol will enable employers to issue fraud-proof and instantly verifiable employment history and income data. It is anticipated that this will reduce the cost of the application process by up to 10X, all while preserving employees' privacy.</p> Problem: Hard for People to Access Small Loans <p>Merit was built with the mission to make it easier for employees to access good financial products, such as personal loans, based on their work record without compromising their data privacy and security. Right now, it’s hard for tens of millions of people around the world to complete the required documentation to regularly take out personal loans every year to pay for their day-to-day needs, particularly with rising interest rates and higher living costs. </p><p>A major barrier for financial service institutions to provide small loans is not having enough access to quality data on potential borrowers to make a decision on whether or not to provide the loan. It could cost $30 to $60 USD just to get the data from centralized institutions like TransUnion and Equifax and only 40% of signed applications actually lead to the loan getting funded. There are also costs to securing and maintaining the database of personal data.</p><p>So for these institutions, it’s too expensive and high risk to offer small loans up to a few hundred dollars when the costs of getting relevant customer data are so high. In the US, the average small dollar loan is a few hundred dollars, and consumers typically apply for these around eight times a year. These small loans have extremely high fees and interest rates, resulting in borrowers owing two to three times the loan amount. This practice has resulted in a payday loan industry that often takes advantage of these borrowers. </p><p>Many loan applicants also go through a terrible experience filling out long applications and often filling out the same information repeatedly. This adds more stress to an already difficult situation of living paycheck to paycheck.</p> How Dock's Technology Contributes to Merit Protocol’s Employment-Based Lending Solution <p>Companies need quality data, which many employers already have, to decide whether to provide a loan to a customer. Merit Protocol acts as a bridge between financial institutions and companies and their employees, as they provide access to quality employment data in a way that preserves employee privacy by using Verifiable Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Technology. Merit Protocol has integrated Dock’s Verifiable Credential and ZKP technology into their platform and is also preparing to launch a digital identity wallet app using Dock’s white label wallet. </p><p>A Verifiable Credential is a fraud-proof and instantly verifiable digital document that proves something about yourself, like your identity or a qualification you have earned, in a secure and trustworthy way. Verifiable Credentials are usually stored in people’s digital identity wallet apps rather than a centralized storage location and can be used to present only the minimal amount of information needed to do a transaction in order to preserve customer privacy. </p><p>A Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) enables you to prove something without revealing the details that support the proof. For example, with ZKP technology, employees can prove that they meet the minimum salary requirement to qualify for a small loan without revealing the actual salary. </p><p>Alex Lyashok, Co-Founder and CEO of Merit Protocol commented on why he chose Dock among many other providers. “We look for alignment on the mission first and foremost. We want to work with an organization that is also making it their business to enable consumers to take control of their data and to reduce reliance on centralized institutions or institutions that potentially engage in predatory behavior.

<p>Encryption is a crucial part of most security frameworks and a foundational component of data protection across all digital applications. AES encryption, in particular, is a cornerstone of modern data obfuscation.</p>
 What Is AES Encryption? 
<p>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption is an algorithm that was adopted by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 as a replacement for the aging Data Encryption Standard (DES) in use at the time.</p>
<p>AES is a symmetric-key block cipher, which uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It operates on fixed-size data blocks of 128 bits and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, each with increasing complexity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there are three primary types of AES encryption in operation today:</p>
 
 AES-128: This version uses a key size of 128 bits and performs ten rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. This algorithm balances security and performance but may need to be more suitable for more advanced security demands. 
 AES-192: This version uses a key size of 192 bits and performs 12 rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. It offers a higher level of security compared to AES-128, with a slight trade-off in performance. 
 AES-256: This version uses a key size of 256 bits and performs 14 rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. It provides the highest level of security among the three types but trades off performance–that is, it takes significantly longer to encrypt and decrypt the same block of text using AES-256 than the previous two. 
 
<p>As a symmetric encryption method, AES does have significant performance benefits over <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/asymmetric-encryption/">asymmetric encryption</a>, with the drawback that it relies on a single key that must remain secret.</p>
 
What Are the Benefits of Using AES Encryption? 
<p>AES is generally considered a secure encryption algorithm appropriate for high-level protection in industrial and government settings. Its security comes from its large key sizes, the (always-increasing) rounds of encryption performed on data blocks, and resistance to known attacks.<br>
Some of the reasons that AES is considered so secure include:</p>
 
 Large Keys: AES supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. The larger the key, the harder it is to break that key through brute-force attacks (like guessing). For example, AES-256 has 2 to the power of 256, a number that would take modern computers longer than the universe’s age to guess or reverse engineer through <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/brute-force-attack/">brute-force attacks</a>. 
 Multiple Rounds of Encryption: AES performs multiple rounds of processing during encryption and decryption. AES is what is known as a “block cipher,” in which the algorithm performs encryption processes on small chunks, or blocks, of data. Furthermore, stronger forms of AES will encrypt each block several times in what are called “rounds.” Each round includes permutations and mixing of the input data, making it extremely difficult to reverse-engineer the encrypted data or find weaknesses in the encryption process. 
 Resistance to Modern Attacks: AES is a modern standard and has been extensively analyzed by the cryptographic community to resist attacks such as linear and differential cryptanalysis. 
 
<p>However, it’s important to note that the security of AES encryption also depends on factors such as the implementation, key management, and the overall security of the system in which it is used. Secure key generation, storage, and distribution are essential to maintaining the security of any encryption algorithm, including AES.</p>
 How Was AES Developed? 
<p>AES encryption was created to replace DES as a more secure and efficient algorithm. DES had been in operation since the 1970s and started showing vulnerabilities due to advances in computational power and cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>In 1997, NIST initiated a process to develop a new encryption that would provide stronger security for the future. The main objectives were:</p>
 
 Enhanced Security: The new standard needed to offer significantly stronger security than DES and be resistant to known cryptographic attacks. Additionally, it had to support larger key sizes to protect against brute-force attacks that were becoming feasible with increasing computational power. 
 Improved Efficiency: The new encryption algorithm needed to be computationally efficient, allowing for fast encryption and decryption on a wide range of hardware. 
 Provided Flexibility: The new standard had to be adaptable to different security requirements and applications, offering various key sizes and security levels. 
 
<p>AES has since become the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithm worldwide, providing strong security and efficient performance across various applications and industries, from telecommunications and finance to government and military.</p>
 In What Applications Is AES Used? 
<p>AES is widely used in various applications and industries due to its efficiency and strong security. Some common use cases for AES encryption include:</p>
 
 Secure Communications: AES encryption is used in secure communication protocols like SSL/TLS and HTTPS to protect data transmitted over networks, including emails, instant messages, and web browsing activities. 
 File and Disk Encryption: AES is used in file and disk encryption software, such as Microsoft’s BitLocker, Apple’s FileVault, and the open-source VeraCrypt, to protect sensitive data stored on computer systems, external storage devices or in the cloud. 
 Wireless Security: In Wi-Fi networks, AES encryption is utilized in the WPA2 and WPA3 security protocols to protect the confidentiality of data transmitted between devices and access points. 
 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): AES encryption is used in VPNs to secure data transmitted between remote users and a private network, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. 
 Payment Systems: Financial institutions and payment systems, such as credit card processing and online banking, rely on AES encryption to protect sensitive data, including account numbers, transaction details, and personal information. 
 Government and Military: AES encryption is approved for use by the U.S. government to protect classified information, and it is widely used in military communications and secure data storage. 
 Cryptocurrencies: Many cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, use AES encryption to secure wallet data and maintain privacy in the transaction process. 
 
<p>The algorithm’s versatility, efficiency, and robust security make it an essential tool for protecting sensitive data across various industries and use cases.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective — April&nbsp;2023  The DeFi Catch-22: Navigating the Paradox of Innovation and Accountability <p>DeFi, the decentralized finance movement, has experienced exponential growth and is challenging the stronghold of traditional finance with trustless, peer-to-peer activities like lending, borrowing, and trading, bypassing banks and other intermediaries.</p><p>Although the DeFi revolution fosters accessibility, transparency, and decentralization in finance, it has also become a center of attraction for malicious actors who wish to abuse it for illicit activities, leading to heightened money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p><p>This expansion necessitates vigilant regulatory oversight and robust measures to combat potential threats, ensuring a secure, trustworthy, and compliant DeFi ecosystem.</p> The Current Regulatory Landscape for&nbsp;DeFi <p>Although DeFi currently operates with limited regulation, recent developments indicate that regulators are preparing to intervene. However, regulatory bodies encounter numerous challenges as they strive to keep up with the industry’s rapid expansion.</p> Regulatory challenges <p>DeFi, a nascent industry with slow-moving regulators, faces a complex landscape due to varying regional regulatory standards, posing a significant challenge.</p><p>Adding to the complexity, DeFi protocols function in a decentralized, borderless environment, which hinders the ability of regulatory bodies to apply traditional frameworks, as countries may enforce conflicting, lenient, or strict regulations.</p><p>This situation exposes DeFi to a regulatory patchwork across jurisdictions, complicating businesses’ navigation and compliance efforts.</p><p>Regulators also grapple with defining and categorizing DeFi platforms and tokens as they significantly differ from conventional financial product definitions, generating uncertainty and hampering businesses’ understanding and compliance with relevant regulations.</p> Key regulatory bodies and guidelines <p>Some key regulatory bodies relevant to the DeFi industry include the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has shown a serious interest in regulating the DeFi space. The current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has argued that DeFi projects offering digital tokens or incentives to participants could fall under SEC regulation.</p><p>On its part, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates the trading of commodity futures and options, has been trying to understand DeFi implications at the international level.</p><p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), operating on an international level, is developing policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing and is actively monitoring the developments within the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>According to FATF’s 2021 guidance, nearly all DeFi platforms are considered Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). As such, if a DeFi platform has no central entity managing it, FATF suggests that a VASP could be assigned to oversee it to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is another international organization that monitors the global financial system. It is currently investigating whether its proposed policy recommendations for the crypto sector need to be strengthened to account for the unique risks associated with the DeFi&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Besides global regulators, local authorities in various regions also impact DeFi businesses. For instance, within the European Union, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and national securities regulators hold significance, while in Asia, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Financial Services Agency of Japan take precedence.</p><p>This means, DeFi businesses must stay informed about the regulations and guidelines issued by these regulatory bodies to ensure they remain compliant and avoid potential legal&nbsp;issues.</p> Enforcement actions and precedents <p>As DeFi continues gaining traction and adoption, several enforcement actions have&nbsp;emerged.</p><p>One notable example is the SEC’s enforcement action in Sept. 2021 against Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain, over how investors market and use the exchange.</p><p>Another example is the 2018 enforcement action by the SEC against EtherDelta, a decentralized exchange. The platform’s founder, Zachary Coburn, was charged with operating an unregistered securities exchange. The SEC’s action signaled&nbsp;that</p><p>decentralized exchanges would not be exempt from regulatory oversight.</p><p>These precedents suggest that regulators are gradually increasing their oversight and enforcement efforts, even for platforms that were previously thought to be immune to regulations due to their decentralized nature.</p> Best Practices for DeFi Compliance <p>As the DeFi industry continues to evolve and face regulatory challenges, businesses need to adopt best practices for compliance. But what does it&nbsp;mean?</p> Legal and regulatory compliance <p>One of the best practices for DeFi compliance is to ensure that the project is legally and regulatory compliant from the outset. This can involve several steps, including legal entity formation and obtaining the necessary licenses and registrations.</p><p>Legal entity formation establishes the legal structure of a business and can impact factors such as liability, taxation, and ownership. Meanwhile, obtaining the necessary licenses and registrations ensures that a business operates within the parameters of the&nbsp;law.</p><p>Depending on the jurisdiction and the specific services offered, businesses may also need to obtain money transmitter or broker-dealer licenses.</p><p>Navigating the licensing and registration process can be complex, and projects may need to engage with legal experts and regulatory authorities to ensure they are meeting all requirements seamlessly. It’s important to note that failure to obtain the necessary licenses and registrations can result in enforcement actions, fines, and reputational damage.</p><p>With regulators coming onto DeFi from all sides, legal and regulatory compliance is becoming a crucial component for DeFi protocol operations, which means they must take all necessary steps to meet all regulatory requirements.</p> KYC and AML compliance <p>KYC (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">Know Your Customer</a>) and AML (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">Anti-Money Laundering</a>) compliance are other important considerations for DeFi projects. KYC is the process of verifying the identity of customers to prevent fraud, while AML refers to the measures taken to prevent money laundering.</p><p>Implementing KYC and AML, however, is easier said than done due to the anonymity of blockchain transactions. However, compliance with these regulations is necessary for DeFi projects to attract institutional investors and gain mainstream adoption.</p><p>As regulatory scrutiny grows, KYC/AML tools and solutions like Digital ID and KYC-Chain are emerging to help projects achieve compliance. Some DeFi projects have also implemented identity verification measures through government-issued identification cards.</p><p>However, DeFi projects must balance privacy and compliance. Financial privacy is a fundamental right and an important crypto ethos. Protecting user privacy is essential for building a trustworthy and sustainable DeFi ecosystem.</p><p>With the help of innovative KYC/AML solutions, DeFi projects can implement effective measures to prevent fraudulent activities while ensuring user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Taxation and accounting compliance <p>DeFi transactions can have various tax implications for both platforms and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Users who earn interest on their holdings or receive rewards in the form of tokens are required to report such income on their tax&nbsp;returns.</p><p>In the US and some other countries, this income is subject to federal income tax and may also be subject to state and local taxes. Similarly, capital gains taxes may apply when users sell their DeFi tokens or other&nbsp;assets.</p><p>DeFi platforms may also have tax obligations, such as reporting requirements for interest payments or token rewards issued to users. These platforms must comply with tax laws and regulations in their jurisdiction, which can vary widely depending on the location.</p><p>Various tools and solutions, such as Accointing, CoinTracking, and TokenTax, are available for DeFi projects to facilitate tax compliance. These tools can help platforms and users track transactions, calculate tax liabilities, and generate relevant&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Complying with tax regulations in DeFi, however, requires balancing privacy and reporting requirements. Users value their privacy, but tax authorities require certain information to be reported. DeFi projects need to find innovative ways to preserve user privacy while complying with reporting requirements.</p> The Impact of Compliant DeFi on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The potential impact of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/compliant-defi-the-way-out-of-commingling-clean-and-illicit-funds-in-a-decentralized-finance-economy">compliant DeFi</a> on the wider crypto ecosystem is a central theme in the crypto compliance debate. It affects crypto mainstream adoption, improved investor protection, and the emergence of new business opportunities.</p> The ripple effect on other crypto&nbsp;sectors <p>DeFi projects striving to maintain legal and regulatory compliance may spark a domino effect throughout the crypto industry, potentially transforming the operations of exchanges, wallets, and other platforms.</p><p>Users are likely to place greater trust in platforms prioritizing compliance and following regulatory standards, as these platforms foster a secure and transparent environment for crypto transactions. Additionally, by meeting stringent compliance requirements, these platforms may also entice a broader range of institutional investors.</p><p>Such compliant DeFi protocols can significantly impact user behavior and expectations. As more DeFi projects adopt KYC/AML protocols and tax reporting requirements, users may begin viewing these measures as the norm within the DeFi ecosystem. Consequently, the shift could promote more responsible and transparent crypto transactions.</p><p>This shift could create a benchmark for other crypto sectors, including decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and lending platforms. Faced with a growing demand for compliance measures, these platforms might need to adapt to appeal to institutional investors and secure mainstream adoption. Ultimately, this could give rise to a movement toward enhanced compliance across the entire crypto industry.</p> Advantages for the crypto ecosystem <p>Adhering to compliance within DeFi can yield multiple benefits for the entire crypto ecosystem. First and foremost, it bolsters trust and credibility among investors and users. Conforming to regulations and standards signals that DeFi platforms and other crypto entities are dedicated to promoting transparency and accountability, which can attract a diverse range of investors and&nbsp;users.</p><p>Compliant DeFi can also expedite the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by offering a degree of assurance and security often absent in non-compliant crypto platforms. Mainstream acceptance can result in augmented liquidity, trading volumes, and overall value for the crypto&nbsp;market.</p><p>In addition, compliance with regulations and the implementation of risk mitigation strategies to curb fraud can safeguard users. That means reinforcing the reputation and long-term viability of the crypto ecosystem. It can also avert regulatory crackdowns that may adversely affect the industry.</p> Challenges for the crypto ecosystem <p>While compliant DeFi has the potential to bring a range of benefits to the crypto ecosystem, it also poses certain challenges, including balancing innovation and regulation. DeFi has been able to thrive due to its decentralized and permissionless nature, but implementing compliance measures could potentially limit innovation and hinder&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Another challenge is addressing concerns about decentralization and control. DeFi was created to provide a decentralized alternative to traditional finance, but implementing compliance measures could centralize control and undermine the core principles of&nbsp;DeFi.</p><p>There is also the issue of regulatory arbitrage, where DeFi projects can easily move to jurisdictions with more favorable regulatory environments, potentially creating an uneven playing field and hindering global standardization of compliance measures.</p><p>Finding a balance between innovation, decentralization, and compliance is a challenge the crypto ecosystem will need to navigate as DeFi matures and&nbsp;evolves.</p> Navigating the Future of DeFi Regulation <p>Looking into the DeFi compliance climate requires exploring the potential future of regulatory frameworks and how DeFi platforms can prepare themselves.</p> Potential regulatory changes and their implications <p>DeFi protocols operate in a largely unregulated environment, leading to concerns about investor protection and financial stability. As a result, regulators in different jurisdictions are exploring ways to regulate DeFi without stifling innovation.</p><p>The US SEC, for instance, has already started issuing enforcement actions against DeFi projects, a trend likely to continue, with regulators becoming more involved in the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>Besides changes in domestic regulatory policies, we could see an increasing international regulatory coordination.</p><p>DeFi is a global phenomenon, and regulators in different countries may take different approaches to regulation.</p><p>Agencies, too, recognize the growing need for international coordination to avoid regulatory arbitrage and ensure that DeFi platforms cannot evade regulation by operating in jurisdictions with less strict regulations.</p><p>As Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said recently, there’s a greater acceptance among G20 member countries that any new crypto regulations need to be globally coordinated.</p><p>According to her, DeFi being borderless requires “significant international collaboration for any specific legislation on these sectors to be fully effective.”</p><p>Additionally, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) can also play an important role in DeFi. Such organizations have successfully developed and enforced industry-wide standards in other industries, such as finance and securities.</p><p>In DeFi, SROs could play a similar role in developing industry best practices and standards while also helping bridge the gap between regulators and DeFi projects.</p><p>Navigating the future of DeFi regulation will be a complex and challenging task. While regulation is essential to safeguard investors and deter fraud, excessive regulation might hinder innovation and obstruct DeFi from realizing its maximum potential.</p><p>As such, finding the right balance between regulation and innovation will be crucial for the future of&nbsp;DeFi.</p> Preparing for future regulatory challenges <p>With regulatory certainty on the horizon, addressing forthcoming DeFi sector challenges becomes even more crucial for the industry’s long-term success and sustainability.</p><p>This can be achieved by developing agile compliance programs that can adapt to changing regulations and compliance requirements. This includes implementing robust KYC/AML processes, transaction monitoring, and reporting mechanisms.</p><p>DeFi projects can also engage with regulators and industry associations to stay updated on regulatory developments and collaborate on compliance standards. By participating in regulatory discussions, DeFi projects can also influence the regulatory framework and ensure that it is tailored to the needs of the industry.</p><p>By collaborating with legal and compliance experts, DeFi projects can further ensure their operations comply with existing and upcoming regulations. Legal and compliance experts can provide guidance on navigating complex regulatory frameworks and developing compliance programs that meet regulatory requirements.</p> Shyft Network: Answer to Compliant DeFi&nbsp;Woes <p>The DeFi ecosystem currently faces significant hurdles, impacting both major liquidity providers and DeFi platforms.</p><p>Regulatory limitations and unclear rules present considerable obstacles for Major Liquidity Providers (LPs) engaging with DeFi. Meanwhile, DeFi platforms fail to reach their full potential due to a limited scope stemming from regulatory compliance issues.</p><p>Regulators, on their part, are left to navigate the DeFi sector with little guidance. At this point, they have no option but to rely on outdated regulatory frameworks to make sense of this rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>Navigating the complexities of the DeFi ecosystem might seem daunting, but Shyft Network offers a way forward. Through an opt-in framework, Shyft Network provides solutions like identity verification, compliant asset creation, and credit scoring while ensuring secure collection, storage, and sharing of user data when required.</p><p>Moreover, as a trust anchor, Shyft Network bridges the gap between users, DeFi platforms, and centralized organizations, enabling trustless transactions in a decentralized environment while adhering to regulatory compliance.</p><p>By validating personal data and transaction details, and subsequently publishing proof on the blockchain, Shyft simplifies and strengthens interactions within the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Final Note <p>In the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), navigating the complex regulatory landscape has become crucial. As DeFi projects continue to gain traction, they must focus on compliance and foster a secure, transparent, and compliant ecosystem. Achieving this requires a multi-faceted approach, including legal and regulatory compliance, adherence to KYC/AML procedures, and proper taxation and accounting practices.</p><p>Despite the inherent complexities, maintaining compliance is essential for the growth and success of the DeFi industry. This will not only improve trust and credibility among investors and users but also encourage mainstream adoption. However, striking a balance between innovation, decentralization, and compliance remains a challenge, and finding this equilibrium will be essential as the sector&nbsp;matures.</p><p>In light of this, it is worth pondering: What practical steps can DeFi projects, regulators, and industry stakeholders take to collaboratively create a balanced regulatory environment that nurtures innovation and promotes the true ethos of blockchain and&nbsp;DeFi?</p> Catwoman’s Compliant DeFi Adventure <p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) risk management has emerged as a critical aspect of business strategy for companies worldwide.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/R6RO7REX"> A 2023 IBM IBV study</a> showed that organizations that are seen as ESG leaders are 43% more likely to outperform their peers on profitability. However,<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/c-suite-study/ceo"> 57% of CEOs admit that defining and measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) and economic benefits of their sustainability efforts remain a significant challenge</a>. Focusing on ESG Risk Management can help your organization become more profitable, and your organization can start on this journey today.</p>



<p>So how does ESG help the bottom line? Customers have a much greater interest in sustainability and impact then previous generations. 68% of customers say that environmental sustainability is very or extremely important to them, with nearly half paying a premium price for environmentally sustainable or socially responsible products in the last year. IBM has also found that ESG leaders can boost revenue through unexpected channels. An example of this is where IBM worked with a consumer-packaged goods (CPG) brand in Europe to put a QR code on the packaging. The QR code meant that customers could scan the code to learn about the journey of the products, which translated to an 8% rise in sales.</p>



<p>With ESG being so important today, here are some of the best ways of managing your ESG risk and identifying your organization’s gaps:</p>



<p>1. Conduct ESG assessments. Like any risk assessment, this process typically involves a thorough review of the company’s operations and supply chain to identify potential ESG risks and opportunities. It can be conducted with a similar process to a Cyber Security Assessment with a consultant (gathering data, conducting stakeholder interviews, and analyzing existing policies and practices). This process can be accelerated by using technology to analyze benchmark data such as that supplied by <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/">Prevalent</a> (one of IBM’s partners). The resultant assessment should quantify the likelihood of any risk occurring and potential impact of any identified risk.</p>



<p>2. Remediate risks and put together implementation plans. Once an ESG assessment has been completed, the organization should develop and implement strategies to remediate identified ESG risks and opportunities within an agreed upon timeframe. The likelihood of the risk occurring (and the impact should it happen) would inform the prioritization process.</p>



<p>For example, if the assessment identified that environmental risks related to carbon emissions were a priority, the implementation plan might include initiatives to reduce energy consumption, increase renewable energy usage or invest in carbon offset projects.</p>



<p>3. Monitor and track ESG performance. Companies should monitor and track ESG performance, using metrics such as carbon emissions, human rights violations and labor practices. This can involve using technology solutions such as <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/">Prevalent</a> to collect and analyze data, and then engaging with suppliers to improve performance.</p>



<p>4. Collaborate with suppliers.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/R6RO7REX"> The 2023 IBM IBV study</a> found only 20% of organizations are integrating ESG metrics into supply chain operations. Companies should collaborate with their suppliers to improve ESG performance and sustainability by agreeing on clear ESG goals and standards, as well as providing them with the necessary education and support to meet these standards. For example, companies can provide their suppliers with ESG training on how to improve their labor practices, environmental management and governance. Furthermore, companies could incentivize their suppliers by offering long-term contracts or bonuses should they reach a certain ESG standard or score.</p>



<p>In conclusion, managing ESG risk in the supply chain is crucial for businesses to mitigate financial and reputational risks, comply with regulations and drive better financial performance. ESG risk can be managed in a similar way to any other type of risk in the business. Board members are increasingly prioritizing ESG, and adapting existing methods and techniques can ensure that high-quality risk assessments can be conducted.</p>

				<p>We’ve released the latest version of the Trinsic SDK—version 1.11.0. In this release, we’ve made two important product updates that make building with Trinsic easier and more accessible. The updates include:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Deprecating the Account API (potential for breaking changes)  Adding React Native &amp; Flutter support  <p>Below, we’ll dive deeper into these improvements and discuss what it means for you as a product builder.</p>

				<p>This product update is particularly relevant for those who already have integrations with Trinsic. We decided to deprecate the Account API, making it easier for developers to create and interact with wallets. All the capabilities that were found in the Account API can now be found in the Wallet API; however, they are done differently, so updating to the latest SDK may cause breaking changes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, we have prepared a migration guide on <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/resources/migrate-account/">how to migrate from the Account API to the Wallet API</a> in our documentation. Always feel free to reach out to the Trinsic team over <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/trinsiccommunity/shared_invite/zt-pcsdy7kn-h4vtdPEpqQUlmirU8FFzSQ">Slack</a> or <a href="mailto:support@trinsic.id">email</a> if you get stuck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, If you are not wanting to make these changes now and want to keep using the current SDK version, we are continuing to support the backend for it. However, as soon as you do update to the newest SDK, you will need to migrate the methods in the Account API to the Wallet API.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 New Environments Supported: React Native &amp; Flutter 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>We also made the decision to remove the authentication tokens using Oberon. This means developers no longer need to set up the native library linking, which caused a lot of friction when working with certain languages or environments like Go or Android. Now, we use simple bearer tokens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most importantly, this change allows us to provide some additional platform support. We are excited to announce that we support React Native with the <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/web/">Typescript SDK</a>. If you want to build your integrations and your wallet experience in React Native, you can now use the Typescript SDK. See our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/">documentation</a> to learn more. <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/dart/">Flutter (Dart)</a> is also now supported on all major mobile, desktop, and web platforms.</p>

<p>The quantum threat is out there. And it’s not a matter of “if”, but a matter of “when”. While the specific “when” is unknown, it’s generally accepted that in anywhere from 7-10 years a quantum computer will be capable of breaking the traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>While that might seem pretty far out, we do know that the steps to get ready and then ultimately migrate to post quantum (PQ) cryptography will take several years. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">We’re not talking about a crypto refresh cycle here.</a> We’re talking about something an order of magnitude more involved and challenging than anything that’s been done before. That’s why we are of the position that the time to prepare for post quantum is now. And we are not alone in that thinking.</p>
<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, I’m sure you’ve noticed the uptick in government action that’s been taking place around PQ lately. And this has been happening at a global level. What’s nice about some of these directives is that they are providing (or in our case validating) the blueprint for what needs to be done in order to prepare for post quantum.</p>
<p>This past September the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">NSA released the CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a> which advised that algorithms for software and firmware signing, should begin transitioning immediately. The algorithms they recommend implementing are based on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">NIST round 3 finalist algorithms</a>, which were announced last summer. They’re not trying to get ahead of the process by publishing these requirements ahead of the final selections for standardization, but rather hoping that it will generate awareness of what needs to be done and allow time to “plan and budget for the expected transition”.</p>
<p>Last spring and prior to the NSA announcement, the White House had issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/04/national-security-memorandum-on-promoting-united-states-leadership-in-quantum-computing-while-mitigating-risks-to-vulnerable-cryptographic-systems/">“National Security Memorandum on Promoting United States Leadership in Quantum Computing While Mitigating Risks to Vulnerable Cryptographic Systems”.</a> It then followed up with <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">another memo</a> in November 2022 which provided additional direction and some clear actions to federal agencies in preparing for the migration to PQC. The first two steps were:</p>
 
 Designate a lead. The memo stated that within 30 days (which brought us to December 28, 2022), agencies needed to designate a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems. This should be the first step for any organization in order to ensure there is central ownership and oversight over the strategy and transition. 
 Perform a cryptographic inventory. The memo then clearly requires agencies to inventory cryptographic hardware and software systems by May 4, 2023. Whether ensuring you have the right technology in place to support the requirements of PQC, or ensuring visibility into all your cryptographic assets (keys, certificates, etc.), this will likely be one of the more challenging and time consuming tasks. It will also help determine if you’re <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/">crypto agile</a> which will be key when it comes to implementing PQC. 
 
<p>While final implementation direction and migration strategies are still to come, the memo also suggests that agencies should be working with their vendors to identify post quantum cryptography testing opportunities within their networks. This will be critical universally as standards (when they come) are one thing, but approved working deployments are another. And the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7535">“Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act”</a> indicates that agencies will need to quickly migrate to quantum resistant systems once those standards are identified.</p>
<p>So, all eyes will remain on the NIST PQC Competition to see what the final recommendations for standardization are, but in the meantime, there is much to do. And it really is time to get going.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa">RSA Conference</a> is one of the seminal cybersecurity conferences globally, providing a unique opportunity to learn, network, and share ideas with experts and peers in the field. The majority of the event is taken up by the exhibition hall, where vendors from around the world showcase their latest cybersecurity products and services. This is a key event for Entrust and we are always looking for new ways to drive exceptional experiences for our customers that are true to our brand.</p>
<p>We have often, like many other attending organizations, used small gifts or “swag” to thank visitors for coming by our booth. This year Entrust is taking a different approach: We have decided to align more closely to our corporate values and brand by replacing swag with charitable donations. We have a corporate initiative called “Entrust Cares,” which is our global giving and volunteer program where we give back to the community, and we felt this was a great opportunity to further it.</p>
<p>We trialled the “demo for donation” concept at an event in Barcelona at the beginning of 2023 with encouraging feedback from customers, partners, and the community. This year the RSAC 2023 theme, “Stronger Together,” spurred us on to do it again. To borrow from the RSA event messaging: “We are a community of many. No one goes it alone; we build on each other’s diverse knowledge to create the next breakthrough.” We see this initiative as a small way of delivering on that vision.</p>
<p>We have chosen organizations that make an impact by helping the next generation of tech superstars, ensuring they have the resources to reach their full potential, regardless of their gender, race, or economic background. We’ve decided that for every visitor that engages with us at our booth, we will donate $10 to one of these charities.</p>
<p>The charities we have selected for this event are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://everychildonline.co.uk/">Every Child Online</a> – A charity that provides refurbished PCs, laptops, and tablets to underprivileged children for free. The charity’s goal is to help close the digital divide and improve the quality of digital education offered in schools. 
 <a href="https://code.org/">CODE</a> – An education innovation nonprofit dedicated to the vision that every student in every school has the opportunity to learn computer science as part of their core K-12 education. 
 <a href="https://www.technovation.org/about/">Technovation Girls</a>&nbsp;– A global charity that equips young women to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. With the support of volunteer mentors and parents, girls work in teams to code mobile apps that address real-world problems. 
 
<p>As well as feeling good about helping support one of these fantastic charities, visitors will receive a unique thank you card that includes details of the chosen charity and website.</p>
<p>Be sure to visit us at RSAC April 24-26 at booth #6445 North to support one of these great causes.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>

<p>Coinfirm is proud to announce its support for a new stablecoin, the EUR CoinVertible (EURCV), launched by Societe Generale-FORGE, a fully integrated and regulated subsidiary of Societe Generale group dedicated to digital assets. This innovative stablecoin is designed to maintain a stable value and is deployed in Euro denomination on the Ethereum public<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain.</a></p>



<p>The EUR CoinVertible is an<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/erc-20/"> ERC-20 </a>based institutional euro stablecoin, with a maximum total supply of 10,000,000 EURCV. As a stablecoin, it is designed to maintain a stable value against the Euro, with its market capitalization also equaling 10,000,000 Euro. This project is a pioneering effort by Societe Generale, a major European bank, which demonstrates the growing importance and acceptance of digital assets in the financial sector.</p>



<p>This stablecoin aims to provide a robust settlement asset for on-chain transactions, innovative solutions for corporate treasury, cash management and cash pooling activities, on-chain liquidity funding and refinancing solutions, and a solution for intra-day liquidity needs, such as margin calls. EUR CoinVertible is backed by stringent collateral eligibility criteria, ensuring the complete segregation of the collateral assets held to back the value of the stablecoins from the issuer.</p>



<p>The launch of the EUR CoinVertible by Societe Generale-FORGE signifies the increasing adoption of digital assets by traditional financial institutions, bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and the digital assets ecosystem. </p>



<p>Coinfirm, as a blockchain analytics platform, supports and covers the stablecoin by providing analytics and insights from a security and compliance perspective.</p>



<p>The inclusion of the EUR CoinVertible on Coinfirm’s platform is an important development as it helps to enhance the stablecoin’s transparency, security, and adherence to relevant regulations. Coinfirm’s expertise in blockchain analytics plays a vital role in monitoring and analyzing the stablecoin’s activities, further bolstering investor confidence in this innovative<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/digital-asset/"> digital asset.</a></p>

			<p>We are excited to unveil our latest&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;solution for the subscription module. It enables tokenization of open-ended investments by allowing issuers to dynamically update the valuation of tokenized securities for their offerings.</p>
 What is the&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;solution? 
<p>The&nbsp;Open-Ended Subscription&nbsp;is a primary market solution tailored for securities that are continuously available for investors to acquire. These securities are subject to periodic fluctuations in share prices, typically on a daily basis for UCITS or REITs, thereby enabling investors to redeem their shares directly from the issuer upon exiting.</p>
<p>The solution provides issuers with the ability to update prices for tokenized shares using our compliant, blockchain-based infrastructure. As a result, open-ended financial instruments can offer investors an e-commerce-like experience.</p>
<p>We have listed a few benefits below:</p>
 
 Direct Distribution:&nbsp;Investors can directly visit the investment offering website, complete qualification, and place orders. This reduces distribution fees by avoiding intermediaries between the issuer and the end distributor. 
 24/7 Subscriptions:&nbsp;Investors can seamlessly invest in tokenized securities whenever they please on the platform. 
 Digital Experience:&nbsp;The subscription process is fully digital, encompassing document signing and payment processing. Back-office automation facilitates seamless management of subscriptions for thousands of investors, eliminating operational hassles. 
 Real-time Allocation:&nbsp;Once the new valuation is set, investors receive their tokenized securities directly minted into their wallets. 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 What are the use cases and ultimate benefits? 
<p>This solution is ideally suited for open-ended investment offerings, such as UCITS, REITs, mutual funds, hedge funds, and ETFs. In most instances, these open-ended funds require updating the NAVs of shares to accurately represent the value of the fund’s underlying securities at the close of each trading day.</p>
<p>The new solution empowers fund managers to execute NAV updates directly on their tokenization platform. While the traditional financial industry has already well-established processes for NAV updates,&nbsp;the true advantage resides in the digital, transparent, and real-time experience provided to investors throughout the subscription process. Furthermore, the advantages extend post issuance, allowing investors not only to use these tokenized assets in DeFi as collateral for borrowing, but also to deposit them in a liquidity pool for earning extra yield.</p>
<p>Moreover, this solution serves as a crucial facilitator for tokenizing open-ended funds or other assets that necessitate frequent NAV updates during primary offerings. In doing so, it enables access to global investors, reduces costs, and enhances liquidity.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently released <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov230424_progress.en.pdf">the third progress report</a> on the digital euro, presenting design and distribution options endorsed by the Governing Council, and a study detailing the views of people on the features of a potential digital wallet. In this blog post, we’ll discuss the key findings of both publications and their implications for the digital euro project.</p>



 Key Insights: 



  Digital euro accessibility: Initially, the digital euro would be available to euro area residents, merchants, and governments, with potential cross-currency functionalities with other central bank digital currencies outside the euro area. The report states that “non-resident euro area citizens might also have access, provided that they held an account with a euro area-based payment services provider (PSP).” 



 Distribution via PSPs: The Governing Council proposes that the digital euro could be distributed via PSPs, as defined in the Payment Services Directive (PSD2). It could be made available to euro area residents via existing banking apps or via an app provided by the Eurosystem offering a harmonized entry point for basic payment functionalities provided by PSPs. 



 Core and additional services: Supervised intermediaries (e.g., banks distributing digital euro) would be required to provide a set of mandatory core services to end-users and could offer additional services, such as conditional payments or splitting person-to-person payments among multiple parties. 



 Digital wallet features: The study commissioned by the ECB found that most participants were interested in trying some of the digital wallet features presented. The concrete findings are relevant to the design features of a possible digital euro. 
 <blockquote>
<p></p>
Executive Board member Fabio Panetta said, “We value the views and needs of our fellow Europeans very highly. We listen to them. The digital euro project is for the people of Europe.”</blockquote>

 Key Findings from the Study: 



  Person-to-person transfers: The study shows that person-to-person money transfers across the euro area are considered an essential feature for a digital wallet. 



 Offline payments: Participants valued offline payments, which are currently not widely available, as a useful feature when, for example, someone has limited connectivity. 



 Budget management tools and conditional payments: Participants also valued budget management tools and conditional payments, including payment on delivery and pay-per-use. 
  Next Steps:  



<p>In autumn 2023, the Governing Council will review the outcome of the investigation phase and decide whether to move on to a subsequent project phase, in which the necessary technical solutions and business arrangements to provide a digital euro could be developed and tested. The decision on the possible issuance of a digital euro will depend on legislative developments with regard to a regulation to establish and govern essential aspects of the digital euro, which would be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, following a proposal by the European Commission. The ECB will accommodate any necessary adjustments that may emerge from legislative deliberations in the design of the digital euro.</p>

 Introducing Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) — The Revolutionary Layer 0/1 Protocol Launches its Most Anticipated Mainnet&nbsp;Upgrade  After years of hard work and dedication, on the fifth anniversary, the worldwide Verus community is excited to announce the launch of the highly anticipated mainnet upgrade on May 21. The Public Blockchains as a Service release marks a major milestone for Verus and the entire cryptocurrency industry.  ⏱️ PBaaS activation: block height 2,546,600 (Sunday 21 May&nbsp;2023) <p>Upgrade to this release or a later version v1.0.0-x, before MAY 21, 2023 to stay reliably connected to mainnet. <a href="http://www.verus.io/wallet">Download here</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Testnet release will allow you to connect to the new testnet, which we see as a core development platform and staging area for the Verus PBaaS network and have no plans to reset in any foreseeable future.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p> Turning the Crypto Industry on its&nbsp;Head <p>The wide cryptocurrency industry will see how much better Verus PBaaS is as a solution for true decentralization in cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, anti-MEV, scale, or just about any of the challenges people have on crypto platforms today. In fact, as we prepare for activation of this protocol that enables so many new use cases for crypto, not to mention easy onboarding when entrepreneurs discover how to really leverage VerusIDs, PBaaS is so far beyond what people are experiencing on any crypto platform today that it has been easy to dismiss our community as describing the impossible.</p><p>Once PBaaS is live on mainnet and people can actually use all of this themselves, along with every project, chain and currency on the PBaaS network and EVERY ERC20 or ERC721 on Ethereum or even bridged to Ethereum, the truth of Verus will be self-evident, and those who build on Verus will more easily build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs that do not need business deals, permission, or any centralized infrastructure to connect services and users, enabling everyone to communicate in provable, private, or public ways that always include bidirectional, secure commerce of all&nbsp;kinds.</p> Core Capabilities <p>The core capabilities of this release include (lots to learn to understand it all, but here’s a partial&nbsp;list):</p> Verus Intersystem Protocol (VIP) — Layer 0 Multichain and Inter-chain Protocol <p>To our knowledge, the VIP protocol is the only fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology available on any network that is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state. From what we’ve been able to learn about LayerZero, Cosmos, Polkadot, Thorchain or others, VIP is different from (though closest in some ways to LayerZero), superior to, and more decentralized than all other cross-chain protocols we have seen. We can of course get into any level of discussion on the topic, but expect more descriptions and educational material to follow, now that the protocol was originally conceived of 5 years ago, and has been developed and tested/hardened for&nbsp;years.</p> VerusID Content Multimaps — Unlimited Provable Data for Every&nbsp;VerusID <p>Of course this upgrade retains all of the groundbreaking capabilities already available with VerusID, including multisig options, separate revocation and recovery authorities for maximum security to prevent theft of identity or funds, and the ability to timelock your ID, enabling you to even thwart attempts to access your funds after someone compromised your secret&nbsp;keys.</p><p>With the PBaaS upgrade, VerusIDs also gain a powerful new capability that amounts to an unlimited, rent-free indexed database for every VerusID on every blockchain of the PBaaS network. This data can be encrypted or published in the clear and used for any purpose or application, whether social networking, voting, oracles, publishing any information, various forms of provable attestations, ratings, and much, much more. With the scalability of PBaaS and VerusID content multimaps together, the Verus PBaaS network becomes the most scalable, permissionless, provable source of human data from which AIs can learn about humanity in the world. We don’t believe anything else even comes close, and with the recent rise of AI, it feels great to have this come together as a core original goal at a very appropriate and important time in&nbsp;history.</p> Permissionless Chain, Token, and Liquidity Basket Currency&nbsp;Launches <p>Whether you are looking to crowdfund an effort in a manner much like Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, sell identities to which you expect to add value or that are sub-IDs of a very cool root ID, or launch an entirely new blockchain economy and blockchain that starts with all of the Verus technology and a bridge to Verus and Ethereum from day 1, Verus is probably the best platform for you. In fact, as we were planning for the next testnet and wanted to have our own version of DAI to use in the bridge, since we want only decentralized currencies in the live mainnet bridge, we used a command to launch a token on the old testnet, exported it and all its supply to Ethereum’s Goerli on the existing bridge, and that will be the DAI proxy/simulant that we will use on the new testnet. It saved us all some time, proving that Verus PBaaS will also be the easiest, most efficient way to launch even an Ethereum ERC20, whether that ERC20 represents a token, DeFi basket, or even another PBaaS blockchain</p><p>Verus enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched&nbsp;it.</p><p>All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus&nbsp;network.</p><p>Verus also enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.</p> Decentralized Ethereum&nbsp;Bridge <p>Shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, the Ethereum bridge will launch as a decentralized gateway and 1:1 provably mapped currency called “vETH” on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. The Ethereum bridge will also include a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have the following functions:</p>  Auto conversion of fees from Verus &lt;-&gt; Ethereum when sending cross chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity basket  Permissionless ability to register *.vETH IDs, which in addition to the normal sub-ID capability of creating a single token that has control over the ID and can be exported to Ethereum as an automatic ERC721 NFT, can alternately be used to create a “mapped currency”, which can be provably mapped 1:1 to any ERC20 currency on the Ethereum network by exporting it to the vETH bridge. Only Verus root IDs, and IDs of a gateway can create mapped currencies to a&nbsp;gateway.  Decentralized, fair bridge launch. The vETH bridge will launch as other currencies, chains, and gateways can launch, including the bridge converter. When the bridge launches, the contracts will have a surplus of Verus that comes from the fees paid to launch the gateway. In the protocol, that surplus is first used to solve the chicken and egg problem of none of one currency on the other chain. The contracts will cover the Verus fees for all sends from Ethereum before the Bridge converter launches, the liquidity basket becomes active, and the bridge recognizes that launch. Once that happens, the remainder of ½ the fees (5000 VRSC) that are left over from the launch and did not go to miners and stakers or pay Verus fees for people sending from Ethereum.   The Verus Fee Pool and&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another technology and solution unique to Verus, the Verus Fee Pool technology goes live with PBaaS. What this means is that as people use the cross-chain, DeFi, or purchase/register IDs on the network, the miner or staker will put all fees into the on-chain “fee pool”, and then take 1/100th of the pool in addition to the block reward. This gives everyone incentive to still prioritize transactions based on fees, while preventing validators from gaming the fee system by washing fees-in vs. fees-out or working to reorg/rewind to capture a particularly juicy block reward. Instead, this technology aligns all validator incentives with the health/proper operation of the network and creates a circular on-chain economy that can last well beyond block&nbsp;rewards.</p> To know more about Verus PBaaS capabilities <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-announces-new-multicurrency-multichain-defi-protocols-and-immediate-public-availability-of-f1868f259ce5">read this article</a>&nbsp;🔗  A Historic Move&nbsp;Forward <p>For those who actually understand the challenges actual users have in crypto today, this release represents a historic move forward in public cryptographic networks and credibly and actually neutral infrastructure for society-wide human and AI collaboration and learning. As a community, this version really does realize the vision laid out in the original <a href="https://verus.io/papers/VerusVision.pdf">Verus Vision Paper</a>, and at the same time provides much more than was described there. We are a community of individuals, and it is only because that is what we are that we have all arrived here together. The rest of the world is stuck on their Munchausen’s protocols, trying to figure out how to share the front-running and back-running spoils taken from users, but Verus activation gives them a better path&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As a community, we do not promise, we describe a shared vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases described in the first vision paper together, it is time for each of us to also consider what we might personally want to build or be part of building over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much&nbsp;better.</p><p>Read the release notes on GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CLI</a> 🔗 and <a href="https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GUI</a>&nbsp;🔗</p><p>Thanks to the incredible combined efforts of so many people in the community ranging from development, companies and projects joining and their open contributions (<a href="https://www.valu.earth">Valu/Arkeytyp</a>, <a href="https://chips.cash">CHIPS</a>, vDEX, <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert</a>, <a href="https://cragslist.hopto.org">cragslist</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joefromthehills/status/1635769270708649988?s=20">Electricty Supply Board of Ireland</a> and more) to community members supporting users to helping educate others who can contribute as well, we have run these protocols now for years as we’ve improved them, and all of these capabilities will go live on the Verus mainnet May 21, 2023, with the activation expected targeting block 2,546,600.</p> Join the community.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — April 17th to April&nbsp;23rd <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, where we spotlight key regulatory shifts and their potential influence on the digital world. This week, we examine the UK’s plan to introduce specific crypto regulations within the next year, the EU’s approval of the MiCA legislation, Abu Dhabi seeks feedback on their proposed DLT structure, and the implementation of anti-money laundering guidelines for Indian crypto exchanges.</p><p>Dive in with us as we explore these vital developments shaping the future of the crypto landscape.</p> UK to Introduce Crypto Regulations Within a&nbsp;Year <p>The UK government plans to introduce specific cryptocurrency regulations within the next year, according to Andrew Griffith, economic secretary to the UK Treasury.</p><p>The consultation period for proposed regulations ends on 30&nbsp;April.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1648380373632532493?s=20">Image Source</a><p>Griffith said the UK could use existing regulations and new ones to regulate crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>“Wherever possible, we want to see the same asset, the same transaction regulated in the same way. But there are some additional opportunities in the crypto asset or distributed ledger space, and we want to take advantage of that,” said Griffith.</p><p>The aim is to position the UK as a crypto-friendly location for firms to set up&nbsp;shop.</p><p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill is currently passing through Parliament and includes provisions for asset-backed stablecoins.</p> EU Approves&nbsp;MiCA <p>The European Parliament has approved the Market in Crypto-assets (MiCA), a regulatory framework that seeks to establish clear standards for the cryptocurrency industry.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1649018863298703361?s=20">Image Source</a><p>The new crypto licensing policy got approved with a vote of 517–38 in&nbsp;favor.</p><p>Legislators insist that MiCA will prevent incidents like the collapse of FTX and other scandals that plagued the industry last&nbsp;year.</p><p>The legislation on stablecoins will reportedly come into effect in July 2024, while the broader rules on crypto providers will come live in January&nbsp;2025.</p> Abu Dhabi Seeks Feedback on Proposed DLT Framework <p>The ADGM Registration Authority is currently seeking input on its proposed legislative framework that focuses on disclosures, liquidation, and governance structures for distributed ledger technology (DLT).</p><p>The consultation paper, titled “DLT Foundations Regulations 2023,” aims to create a tailored legislative framework that considers the features that might be attractive to developers of DLT projects, including DAOs.</p><p>The proposed regulations are focused on service type and governance matters and include provisions for reporting, disclosure, publication, insolvency, and liquidation measures. Comments on the proposed framework must be submitted by May&nbsp;12.</p><p>The UAE has been working on establishing regulations to attract blockchain and crypto firms to the region, with Dubai enacting a crypto regulatory framework earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Just last week, the UAE introduced federal licensing requirements for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Anti-Money Laundering Rules For Indian Crypto Exchanges <p>India’s financial sector watchdog, the Financial Intelligence Unit, has shared a set of suggested rules with Indian crypto exchanges to tighten controls over crypto&nbsp;trading.</p><p>The rules are likely to be formalized by April 21 and cover proper KYC checks for customers, transaction monitoring, staff training on money laundering prevention, and risk review of products.</p><p>They also require compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule and cover storage of crypto assets in cold wallets and donations made to non-governmental organizations using digital tokens.

<p>Jabil isn’t just a manufacturer, they are experts on global supply chain, logistics, automation, product design and engineering solutions. They are also interested and involved in the holistic application of emerging technologies like additive manufacturing, autonomous technologies, and artificial intelligence. They are a technologically motivated enterprise, so it’s no surprise that they would apply this forward-thinking view to their finance reporting as well.</p>



<p>Jabil is a sizable operation with over 260,000 employees across 100 locations in 30 countries. The world’s leading brands rely on Jabil’s unmatched breadth and depth of end-market experience, technical and design capabilities, manufacturing know-how, supply chain insights and global product management expertise. When you add to that the diverse needs of their clients and partners in healthcare, aerospace, telecommunications, and consumer industries, you can see why they would be interested in continuing to enhance financial reporting.</p>



 Efficient management of an incredibly complex supply chain 



<p>Jabil is a longtime partner and IBM Business Analytics (BA) portfolio user. The portfolio contributes to the efficient management of their incredibly complex supply chain.</p>



<p>Switching to IBM Business Analytics gave Jabil the ability to gather and structure data in a centralized approach for management. The integrated solution plays a role in reporting, analysis, planning and forecasting.</p>



<p>IBM Cognos Controller offers Jabil a simplified automated consolidation process that management can use to steer business performance. The solution shifts time spent away from gathering data and report creation and allows for increased focus on understanding insights and acting on them.</p>



<p>Using IBM’s Business Analytics portfolio, Jabil was able to streamline the financial reporting process. With the ability to “steer the ship” in real time, Jabil can easily bring in new business. Since the solutions are scalable, new customers are efficiently onboarded and integrated into Jabil’s finance reporting.</p>



<p>All of this provides leadership with the ability to see trends across their customer base and physical plants. Leaders can develop effective best practices, working practices and drill down on data to respond effectively, providing Jabil with total business analytics throughout their organization.</p>



 Keeping it small, keeping it connected 



<p>The first tools Jabil implemented were Cognos Controller and TM1 (now rebranded as Planning Analytics with Watson) as part of an overall finance transformation. They were interested in powerful tools that could handle a variety of use cases outside of management reporting, like tax provisioning, treasury cash forecasting, reporting, and modeling for finance. Cognos Controller and Planning Analytics proved to be durable, scalable, and sufficiently powerful.</p>



<p>In most organizations when an IT team finishes a project, they move on to another project and a support team takes over the finished project. At Jabil, the developers that build a project own it for the duration. From a skills point of view, developers are the ideal support staff to keep applications up and running.</p>



<p>“We can bring in more investments and the IT team can handle it. We’re working in a weeks and months timeframe where others are taking months and years. We can’t even see where the bar used to be.” —Patrick Patterson, Senior Director Finance Digital Transformation, Jabil</p>



 Knowledgeable partners drive success 



<p>For 15 years, IBM and Jabil have been integrating successful solutions with Cognos. No tool is perfect, and the leaders at Jabil understood that they would need a dedicated partner for the duration. A partner ready to invest in the tool and help with solutions and troubleshooting. IBM has been that partner.</p>



<p>“Data security, accuracy and the ability to adapt to change with speed, puts Cognos Analytics and Planning Analytics ahead of many other solutions.” —Patrick Patterson, Senior Director Finance Digital Transformation, Jabil</p>

   You know a data warehouse is essential. Let’s look at why warehouse optimization is key in a data lakehouse strategy, and why it matters for your business.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/challenges-of-todays-monolithic-data-architecture">prior blog</a>, we pointed out that warehouses, known for high-performance data processing for business intelligence, can quickly become expensive for new data and evolving workloads. We also made the case that query and reporting, provided by big data engines such as Presto, need to work with the Spark infrastructure framework to support advanced analytics and complex enterprise data decision-making. To do so, Presto and Spark need to readily work with existing and modern data warehouse infrastructures. Now, let’s chat about why data warehouse optimization is a key value of a data lakehouse strategy.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-resolve-todays-data-challenges-with-a-lakehouse-architecture">Read our blog on solving today’s challenges with a lakehouse architecture</a>



 Value of data warehouse optimization 



<p>Since its introduction over a century ago, the gasoline-powered engine has remained largely unchanged. It’s simply been adapted over time to accommodate modern demands such as pollution controls, air conditioning and power steering.</p>



<p>Similarly, the relational database has been the foundation for data warehousing for as long as data warehousing has been around. Relational databases were adapted to accommodate the demands of new workloads, such as the data engineering tasks associated with structured and semi-structured data, and for building machine learning models.</p>



<p>Returning to the analogy, there have been significant changes to how we power cars. We now have gasoline-powered engines, battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and hybrid vehicles. An <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brookecrothers/2021/08/15/study-confirms-this-upside-for-tesla-evs-over-gas-cars/?sh=649348696048">August 2021 Forbes article</a> referenced a 2021 Department of Energy Argonne National Laboratory publication indicating, “Hybrid electric vehicles (think: Prius) had the lowest total 15-year per-mile cost of driving in the Small SUV category beating BEVs”.</p>



<p>Just as hybrid vehicles help their owners balance the initial purchase price and cost over time, enterprises are attempting to find a balance between high performance and cost-effectiveness for their data and analytics ecosystem. Essentially, they want to run the right workloads in the right environment without having to copy datasets excessively.</p>



 Optimizing your data lakehouse architecture 



<p>Fortunately, the IT landscape is changing thanks to a mix of cloud platforms, open source and traditional software vendors. The rise of cloud object storage has driven the cost of data storage down. Open-data file formats have evolved to support data sharing across multiple data engines, like Presto, Spark and others. Intelligent data caching is improving the performance of data lakehouse infrastructures.</p>



<p>All these innovations are being adapted by software vendors and accepted by their customers. So, what does this mean from a practical perspective? What can enterprises do different from what they are already doing today? Some use case examples will help. To effectively use raw data, it often needs to be curated within a data warehouse. Semi-structured data needs to be reformatted and transformed to be loaded into tables. And ML processes consume an abundance of capacity to build models.</p>



<p>Organizations running these workloads in their data warehouse environment today are paying a high run rate for engineering tasks that add no additional value or insight. Only the outputs from these data-driven models allow an organization to derive additional value. If organizations could execute these engineering tasks at a lower run rate in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Enu-EH7RHHM">data lakehouse</a> while making the transformed data available to both the lakehouse and warehouse via open formats, they could deliver the same output value with low-cost processing.</p>



 Benefits of optimizing across your data warehouse and data lakehouse 



<p>Optimizing workloads across a data warehouse and a data lakehouse by sharing data using open formats can reduce costs and complexity. This helps organizations drive a better return on their data strategy and analytics investments while also helping to deliver better data governance and security.</p>



<p>And just as a hybrid car allows car owners to get greater value from their car investment, optimizing workloads across a data warehouse and data lakehouse will allow organizations to get greater value from their data analytics ecosystem.</p>



<p>Discover how you can optimize your data warehouse to scale analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads with a data lakehouse strategy.</p>

<p>The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) reached a provisional political agreement in June 2022, signaling it will take effect in January 2024 for all relevant companies. This move aims to achieve more complete and transparent sustainability reporting across the region. The new EU legislation is poised to impact approximately 50,000 companies, an indicator of the speed at which increased sustainability reporting requirements and standards are sweeping across all sectors.</p>



<p>Key points:</p>



 
 The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) strengthens and extends the scope of the existing EU reporting requirements. 



 CSRD values sustainability metrics alongside environmental performance, paying particular attention to the “S” in ESG, such as employee health, human rights, bribery, anti-corruption and diversity. 



 There are several data-intensive disclosures within the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) covering greenhouse gas emissions, energy, waste, water, recycling and social metrics. 



 CSRD will be mandatory for all large European companies and companies listed on the EU regulated markets, including EU subsidiaries of non-EU parent companies. 



 Companies that are already subject to the NFRD will need to report on 2024 data (reporting year 2025). 



 CSRD requires a third-party assurance and external auditing, whereas it was optional for most businesses under NFRD. 



 CSRD on track to enter into force in 2024. 
 



<p>Organizations impacted by the EU’s CSRD announcement should not just take note but action—and start building their data foundations in anticipation of upcoming reporting and disclosure requirements. In this article, we explore the reporting requirements of the CSRD and how organizations can harness existing solutions to prepare their sustainability data for CSRD reporting obligations.</p>



 What is the EU CSRD? 



<p>The EU CSRD prescribes rules for organizations to report sustainability disclosures across several topics pertaining to environmental and social issues. Organizations will be required to detail how their business strategy will mitigate the risks associated with these environmental and social issues and publish these disclosures publicly.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time a framework such as CSRD has existed in the region. In fact, the CSRD aims to strengthen and extend the scope of the existing EU reporting requirements from its predecessor, the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). It values sustainability metrics alongside environmental performance, paying particular attention to the “S” in ESG by looking at matters such as employee health, human rights, bribery, anti-corruption and diversity across management.</p>



<p>Not only do these disclosures need to be made publicly available and easily accessible, but the CSRD now also mandates independent auditing. This shift towards independent auditing of sustainability data also seen in other ESG and sustainability reporting frameworks sends a strong signal to organizations that claims relating to ESG metrics and sustainability initiatives must be backed by the data to match.</p>



 NFRD vs. CSRD: Key differences explained 



<p>The EU CSRD builds on the existing NFRD to make reporting more thorough and relevant. The key differences are that CSRD:</p>



 
 applies to over 49,000 organizations, compared to 11,700 reporting on NFRD 



 is a requirement for all publicly-listed companies and those with greater than 250 employees, EUR 40 million+ turnover, or EUR 20 million+ total assets (two of three criteria met), NFRD applies to large public interest entities with over 500 employees 



 requires a third-party assurance and external auditing, while it was optional for most businesses under NFRD 



 is included in a management report, while NFRD was part of an annual report 



 requires a broader scope of reporting, including targets, risk and opportunity management, with a focus on forward planning 
 



<p>For more information on the exact CSRD reporting requirements and changes to the current draft, visit <a href="https://www.efrag.org/">EFRAG.</a></p>



 Why was CSRD introduced? 



<p>NFRD, which CSRD replaced, applied to a smaller number of organizations in comparison to CSRD, which has a much larger criteria for inclusion. CSRD addresses a number of known shortcomings of NFRD, such as the vagueness of reporting requirements, resulting in inconsistent data, absence of climate disclosures, non-compliance and a general lack of transparency.</p>



<p>On a larger scale, this facilitates a more equitable EU financial system as stakeholders will be able to make more informed decisions based on easily accessible and standardized sustainability data.</p>



<p>Longer term, the intended outcomes of CSRD will contribute to Europe’s 2050 climate-neutrality target, and European Green Deal objectives, such as providing a “globally competitive and resilient industry, renovated energy efficient buildings and cleaner energy and cutting-edge clean technological innovation.”</p>



<p>The EU has long been a proponent of progressive sustainability and climate policies, with the CSRD accelerating this further within the ecosystem of existing policies, frameworks and directives.</p>



 Who needs to report on CSRD? 



<p>CSRD is mandatory for all large European companies and those listed on the EU-regulated markets, including EU subsidiaries of non-EU parent companies. This directive includes listed SMEs, however “micro” companies—companies with less than 10 employees or below EUR 20 million in turnover—are currently excluded from the mandatory sustainability reporting.</p>



<p>Specifically, CSRD applies to organizations with over EUR 20 million in total assets, a net turnover of EUR 40 million and/or 250+ employees. These entities are referred to as ‘large undertakings’ within the CSRD and include both EU companies and EU subsidiaries of non-EU companies.</p>



<p>Sustainability reporting will also be required of non-European companies that generate an annual net turnover of EUR 150 million in the EU and that have at least one subsidiary or branch in the EU. Non-EU companies will have to comply from 2028.</p>



<p>This means that approximately 49,000 organizations are expected to participate in CSRD’s reporting requirements once it is completely rolled out.</p>



 CSRD reporting requirements 



<p>In 2022, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) released its long-awaited draft of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which will fall under the CSRD.</p>



<p>The 13 ESRS are a key element to achieving the CSRD’s goal of improved sustainability reporting across the region.</p>



<p>These 13 draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards outline requirements across four broad categories as outlined below:</p>



 
 Cross-cutting: General principles, general, strategy, governance and materiality assessment 



 Environment: Climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity, resource use and circular economy 



 Social: Own workforce, workers in the value chain, affected communities, consumers and end-users 



 Governance: Governance, risk management, internal control and business conduct 
 



<p>Of the many requirements outlined in the standard, the ESRS requires organizations to digitally tag reported information, so that it is machine-readable, easily searched and comparable.</p>



<p>In mid-2022, IBM Envizi reported on the growing rise of AI-driven data scraping by ESG ratings tools used to evaluate an organization’s ESG performance. The practice is on an upward trend and is now tangibly reflected in the new ESRS as a reporting requirement. This tagging approach is one of the ways organizations can adopt specific approaches to regain control of their data from automated ESG valuations undertaken by agencies, with alternate options outlined in this guide.</p>



<p>Some reporting standards will be required of all organizations, while others will be sector-specific standards. Organizations are also subject to reporting on double materiality, ensuring disclosures are made about both issues that impact the wider community and issues that are financially relevant to the company itself. These categories and the reporting approach reflects a move towards more holistic sustainability reporting, looking at factors beyond traditional environmental metrics, to include social performance indicators.</p>



 CSRD key dates for organizations 



<p>It’s critical to note that while key dates are a few years away for some, organizations subject to the new directives must start preparing their data foundation and sustainability reporting processes now to avoid any risk of non-compliance.</p>



 
 By June 30, 2023: EU Commission to adopt the first set of reporting standards 



 From 2024: Requirements will be phased in after EU law is implemented into the national law of EU member states 



 January 1, 2024: Effective date for law that will require companies that are already subject to the NFRD to report on 2024 data (reporting year 2025) 



 January 1, 2025: Effective date for law that will require other large companies not previously subject to the NFRD to start reporting 



 January 1, 2026: Effective date for law that will require SMEs to commence their reporting 



 January 1, 2028: Effective date for law when CSRD will apply for third-country companies 
 



<p>The CSRD contains a number of data-intensive disclosures. Without a solid data foundation, managing and reporting such data can be challenging. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/envizi">IBM Envizi ESG Suite</a>&nbsp;can support an organization’s CSRD reporting requirements by providing finance-grade data within an auditable system.

<p><a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer">Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide</a>, and the use of chemotherapy drugs is a critical component of cancer treatment. Unfortunately, in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs), the availability of high-quality, effective chemotherapy medicine is limited due to the prevalence of substandard or falsified drugs. These drugs not only fail to treat cancer effectively but can also cause severe side effects, leading to patient harm and loss of life.</p>
 The high cost of fake cancer drugs&nbsp; 
<p>The problem of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs in LMICs is multi-faceted, with many underlying causes. One of the primary reasons for the problem is in many cases the limited capacity within regulatory agencies to detect and remove these drugs from circulation. This is changing as more resources are directed to the issue, which ARTiFACTS is proud to support (more on that below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the problem is the cost of legitimate chemotherapy drugs. Many of the most effective chemotherapy drugs are developed and manufactured by large pharmaceutical companies, and the high prices associated with these drugs mean that they are often out of reach for patients in LMICs. This creates a market for counterfeiters to produce cheaper, but ineffective and potentially harmful substandard or falsified alternative medicines.</p>
<p>The consequences of using substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs can be devastating. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7113131/">These drugs often do not contain the active pharmaceutical ingredients</a> required to treat cancer effectively, meaning that patients do not receive the intended therapeutic benefit. In some cases, the drugs may contain harmful impurities or contaminants that can cause severe side effects and even death. Additionally, patients may experience a delay in receiving appropriate treatment as a result of using ineffective drugs, leading to disease progression and poorer health outcomes.</p>
 A broad but targeted approach&nbsp; 
<p>Addressing the problem of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs in LMICs requires a multi-pronged approach:&nbsp;</p>
 
 A global effort between government regulatory bodies, pharma, and tech partners to increase the availability of high-quality chemotherapy drugs in LMICs. This could involve working with pharmaceutical companies to reduce the cost of drugs or encouraging the development of cheaper, but still effective, generic alternatives. Additionally, there could be an emphasis on increasing local manufacturing capacity to reduce reliance on imported drugs. 
 An increased focus on patient awareness and education. Patients should be empowered to take an active role in their treatment and be aware of the signs of counterfeit drugs, such as changes in packaging or labeling. 
 A concerted effort to strengthen regulatory frameworks and increase the capacity of regulatory agencies to track, trace, detect and remove counterfeit drugs from circulation. This could involve working with international organizations and governments to provide training and technical support to regulatory agencies in LMICs.&nbsp; 
 
 Expanding Verify for the specialised needs of chemotherapy drugs 
<p>As we’ve said before, chemotherapy drugs are particularly vulnerable to substandard or falsified medicines entering the supply chain due to their higher value. ARTiFACTS Verify is being deployed by the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame in their critical research into the prevalence of substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs and the impact on patients and healthcare systems in Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our role in supporting the Lieberman Lab and its network of healthcare providers in Africa is designed to fill a critical gap in conventional track and trace solutions for chemo drugs. Capturing new data fields and automating the workflow makes identification of samples easier and more reliable, without requiring special training for hospital staff or lab technicians. You can find full details of how Verify works <a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Funded by a grant from the <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institute of Health</a>, this project to track and trace potential substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs will initially include Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi.&nbsp;</p>
 Working together to track and trace substandard or falsified chemotherapy drugs&nbsp; 
<p>In conclusion, the problem of falsified and substandard chemotherapy drugs in LMICs is a complex issue with many underlying causes. However, with concerted efforts across governments, pharmaceutical companies and technology solutions to strengthen regulatory frameworks, increase the availability of high-quality drugs, and improve patient education and awareness, progress can be made towards addressing this critical public health issue.</p>

  <p>Integrating with an API lets you power up your code by knowing what the API knows and doing what the API can do. The catch is that most APIs can’t and shouldn’t let just anybody access your important resources. Just as humans log in to access resources, programs accessing APIs must obtain proper authorization.</p>

<p>Your application can use two types of authorization mechanisms when calling Okta APIs from your Okta integration, each with its pros and cons:</p>
 
   API Tokens 
   OAuth 2.0 
 

<p>Let’s better understand the two types, how they work, and when to use them.</p>

<p>Table of Contents</p>
 
   <a>API Tokens</a> 
   <a>OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials</a> 
   <a>Decide which API authorization mechanism to use</a> 
   <a>Learn more about connecting to Okta APIs using OAuth Client Credentials</a> 
 

 API Tokens 

<p>If you’ve connected with APIs before, you’ve probably copied a token and pasted it into the Authorization header of your HTTP request. Token authorization has several notable drawbacks, including when connecting to Okta APIs.</p>

<p>You can create API tokens from the Okta Admin Console. The Admin Console only shows you the token value upon creation, so you’ll need to capture the value and securely persist it in a credentials manager. When you use the API token, you’ll add it to the Authorization header of the call using the proprietary <code>SSWS</code> scheme.</p>

   <code>GET /api/v1/groups?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: SSWS api_token
Accept: application/json
Host: dev-1234567.okta.com
</code>   

<p>When an Okta user creates an API token, it has all of the user’s permissions, which are rarely the best choice for an automated workflow. The user represented by the token becomes a single point of failure:</p>
 
   The automation may break if their permissions are reduced, or the user leaves the organization. 
   If the user’s permissions are increased, the automation may silently gain the ability to cause unexpected problems if it has a bug. 
 

<p>All Okta API tokens automatically expire after being unused for 30 days to mitigate the security risks of old tokens falling into the wrong hands. A user can revoke tokens anytime from the Admin Console, and deleting no longer needed tokens is a good idea.</p>

<p>Considerations for using API tokens</p>

<p>It can be tempting to create a service account in Okta and use an API token from the service account, but this approach only moves the underlying problem rather than solving it. Managing access to the service account is complex, and mistakes can cause problems wherever the service account has access. Additionally, if the service account’s token accidentally becomes publicized, anyone who gets the token can impersonate the service account.</p>

<p>When to use API tokens</p>

<p>Due to these constraints, API tokens are never the preferred authorization method for Okta’s APIs. If you’re ever in a situation where you “have to” use API tokens in production because OAuth or a service integration won’t work, we’d love to hear about it! Let us know in the comments below, or discuss the challenges with your Okta representative.</p>

 OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials 

<p>OAuth has a standard flow for machine-to-machine communication called Client Credentials, the preferred way for processes without user input to communicate to Okta APIs. Using OAuth mechanisms enables you to use a well-known standardized format with fantastic support in libraries, frameworks, and languages of your choice. You can create an API Services application in the Okta Admin Console or use the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>.</p>

<p>If you haven’t used OAuth Client Credentials before, a quick overview is as follows:</p>
 
   You’ll create the Okta API Services application and configure the Okta API Scopes you want this application to have. When you make the Okta application, you’ll receive a Client ID and a Client Secret to add to your Okta configuration in your program. 
   Your program calls the authorization server’s token endpoint to exchange the Client ID and Client Secret for an access token. The access token contains the Okta API Scopes allowed. There may be <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/">Okta SDKs</a> that help support this token call for you, depending on your language and framework.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Note
If you have a custom authorization server, such as when using a Okta Developer Edition org, you’ll have to use signed JSON Web Token (JWT) using a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS). Read more about how to do this on the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta-serviceapp/main/">Implement OAuth for Okta</a> developer documentation.</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   When you use the access token to call Okta APIs, you’ll add the token to the Authorization header using the <code>Bearer</code> scheme. 
 

   <code>GET /api/v1/groups?limit=10 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer access_token
Accept: application/json
Host: dev-1234567.okta.com
</code>   

<p>Considerations with using OAuth</p>

<p>The preferred method is using OAuth to call Okta APIs. It’s more secure, and using widely available standards makes the calling process require less manual code. You’ll configure the scopes you want the process to access, which aren’t tied to a specific user. But you’ll need to get the access token before making the API call.</p>

<p>When to use OAuth authorization</p>

<p>You should use OAuth as the preferred authorization mechanism for communication with Okta APIs, including machine-to-machine communications. A widely accepted industry standard like OAuth affords the most security and scope flexibility.</p>

<p>But, if you create an API Service application in Okta to share it outside of your organization, you delegate the scope configuration to the customer as part of their process of setting up an API Service application. There’s a temptation for potential customers to either allow too much access or, conversely, limit access, causing frustrations that your integration needs fixes to work as intended.</p>

<p>Use API Service Integrations</p>

<p>API Service Integrations powers up your API integration applications using OAuth! Your API Integration becomes more discoverable to potential customers with improved handling for scopes. You can submit your integration to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/okta-integration-network/">Okta Integration Network (OIN)</a>, which makes your integration available in the OIN catalog. Potential customers can find your integration to add to their Okta org. Plus, as part of the submission process, you define the scopes your integration needs beforehand. Customers can see those scopes in the OIN catalog. Transparency in the required resources will help them feel more comfortable using your integration.</p>

<p>When creating integrations listed in the OIN, you can test your integration as part of the submission process. The OIN Manager provides a mechanism to create a local service app instance in your org to test your integration before you finalize the submission.</p>

 Decide which API authorization mechanism to use 

<p>When calling Okta APIs, we recommend using OAuth 2.0, and API Service Integrations if you create an API integration for the OIN. If you have limitations using OAuth 2.0 for your use case, use API Tokens.</p>

<p></p>

 Learn more about connecting to Okta APIs using OAuth Client Credentials 

<p>API tokens are the simplest, but this simplicity makes them too limited for production applications’ security and reliability needs. OAuth client credentials require more understanding to set up but scale indefinitely for internal use. And for code intended for use by your customers to access their Okta tenant, API Service Integrations built on top of OAuth maximize flexibility and control.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>At the most recent CA/Browser Forum (CABF) meeting in late February, Google announced its <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a>Moving Forward, Together direction. This initiative includes a proposal to reduce the maximum TLS certificate validity and domain validation reuse period from the current 398 days to 90 days, which will impact many certificate subscribers. Google’s justification states:</p>
<p>“Reducing certificate lifetime encourages automation and the adoption of practices that will drive the ecosystem away from baroque, time-consuming, and error-prone issuance processes. These changes will allow for faster adoption of emerging security capabilities and best practices, and promote the agility required to transition the ecosystem to quantum-resistant algorithms quickly. Decreasing certificate lifetime will also reduce ecosystem reliance on “broken” revocation checking solutions that&nbsp;cannot fail-closed&nbsp;and, in turn, offer incomplete protection.”</p>
<p>The 90-day certificate validity does not appear to be the goal, but it’s used to encourage automation to enable faster replacement of certificates. Entrust also encourages this type of direction, as we have seen some of the certificate subscriber’s biggest issues are certificate expiry and inability to replace mis-issued certificates at a rapid pace. Automation would help to mitigate these issues.</p>
<p>To date, the CABF has had no discussions, proposals, or ballots on changing TLS certificate maximum validity period lifetimes to 90 days. We expect that any ballot to shorten the certificate validity period would take six months to a year to conclude. Also, the <a href="https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/6-CABF-F2F-58-Chrome-Browser-Update-PUBLIC.pdf">results of a Google survey</a> presented to the CABF indicates that Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8555">RFC 8555</a>) is not yet ubiquitous and 58.3% of CA owners included in the Chrome Root Store do not offer ACME services. As such, we believe there will be a substantial grace period to not only allow CAs to implement ACME, but also to allow subscribers and service providers such as platform/software as a service (PaaS/SaaS) and content delivery networks (CDNs) to deploy ACME on their servers or platforms in a way that gives the subscriber the ability to decide which CA or type of certificate (OV/EV/QWAC) they would like to request and provision.</p>
<p>Even if CAs and other browsers don’t share Google’s objectives, there is a chance that Google could unilaterally make this change in its root program and force the entire industry in this direction in a time of their choosing. We hope that browsers will not make this decision unilaterally, but instead allow the decision to be made with broad industry and website owner consensus.</p>
<p>Another issue is that Google has presented no public research or factual data showing that such a change to the ecosystem is necessary or useful in many use cases. We believe there will be much discussion before a 90-day ballot will pass at the CABF as several CAs have indicated that a requirement for 90-day certificates might have far-reaching implications. There have also been several EU governmental bodies concerned over the market and competitive implications of Google’s proposal and the impact on eIDAS Qualified Website Authentication Certificate objectives, which are now being reasserted in the EU’s update of its eIDAS legislation.</p>
<p>Entrust does not believe that a maximum 90-day limit for TLS certificate lifetimes is the only method to drive automation and the deployment of ACME. Additionally, Entrust doesn’t believe that ACME is the only method for automation, or that it would be accepted by some of the most complex subscriber secure server deployments. Rather, we believe subscribers should be encouraged to deploy automation, but do not need to be discouraged by the cost and complexity of certificates with 90-day maximum validity.</p>
<p>While Entrust is not currently in favor of a mandatory 90-day certificate limit, we have no objection to 90-day certificates if that is what a website wants to use. We are always working to improve or extend its validation, issuance, and management processes, including greater use of automation through integrations with certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solutions such as Entrust Certificate Hub, AppViewX, Venafi, and ServiceNow, as well as automation through ACME v2, CMP, SCEP, and other new methods.</p>
<p>We understand that this Google proposal may be causing our customers considerable concern. In accordance with Google’s instructions on its <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/">Chrome Root Program Policy</a>, we encourage customers to direct any questions or input regarding the Google proposal to <a href="mailto:chrome-root-program@google.com">chrome-root-program@google.com</a>; please feel free to share a copy with us at <a href="mailto:ecs.feedback@entrust.com">ecs.feedback@entrust.com</a>.</p>
<p>We are closely monitoring this situation and we will keep you posted as new information becomes available.</p>

 American Banker makes the case for smarter innovation through collaboration 



<p></p>



<p>Mastercard is extending its services and technology reach, including deals with JPMorgan Chase, LSEG/Giact, Stax’s CardX and Jack Henry &amp; Associates, enabling Mastercard partners to connect merchants to payments, improve authentication and streamline transaction processing.</p>



<blockquote><p>“For the partners, the networks like Mastercard bring their technology and processing capabilities, but I think even more crucially they bring that brand and extremely high levels of trust,”&nbsp;said Gilles Ubaghs, strategic advisor for commercial banking and payments at <a href="https://aite-novarica.com">Aite-Novarica Group</a>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Mastercard’s multi-rail payments approach gives consumers more choice. Digital first and open banking offer an expansion of that choice, while ensuring transactions are easy and safe. </p>

<p>Unexpected situations like the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing macroeconomic atmosphere are wake-up calls for companies worldwide to exponentially accelerate digital transformation. During the pandemic, when lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions transformed business operations, it quickly became apparent that digital innovation was vital to the survival of any organization. </p>



<p>The dependence on remote internet access for business, personal, and educational use elevated the data demand and boosted global data consumption. Additionally, the increase in online transactions and web traffic generated mountains of data. Enter the modernization of data warehousing solutions.</p>



<p>Companies realized that their legacy or enterprise data warehousing solutions could not manage the huge workload. Innovative organizations sought modern solutions to manage larger data capacities and attain secure storage solutions, helping them meet consumer demands. One of these advances included the accelerated adoption of modernized data warehousing technologies. Business success and the ability to remain competitive depended on it.</p>



 Why data warehousing is critical to a company’s success 



<p>Data warehousing is the secure electronic information storage by a company or organization. It creates a trove of historical data that can be retrieved, analyzed, and reported to provide insight or predictive analysis into an organization’s performance and operations.</p>



<p>Data warehousing solutions drive business efficiency, build future analysis and predictions, enhance productivity, and improve business success. These solutions categorize and convert data into readable dashboards that anyone in a company can analyze. Data is reported from one central repository, enabling management to draw more meaningful business insights and make faster, better decisions. </p>



<p>By running reports on historical data, a data warehouse can clarify what systems and processes are working and what methods need improvement. Data warehouse is the base architecture for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) solutions as well.</p>



 Benefits of new data warehousing technology 



<p>Everything is data, regardless of whether it’s structured, semi-structured, or unstructured. Most of the enterprise or legacy data warehousing will support only structured data through relational database management system (RDBMS) databases. Companies require additional resources and people to process enterprise data. It is nearly impossible to achieve business efficiency and agility with legacy tools that create inefficiency and elevate costs.</p>



<p>Managing, storing, and processing data is critical to business efficiency and success. Modern data warehousing technology can handle all data forms. Significant developments in big data, cloud computing, and advanced analytics created the demand for the modern data warehouse.</p>



<p>Today’s data warehouses are different from antiquated single-stack warehouses. Instead of focusing primarily on data processing, as legacy or enterprise data warehouses did, the modern version is designed to store tremendous amounts of data from multiple sources in various formats and produce analysis to drive business decisions.</p>



 Data warehousing solutions 



<p>A superior solution for companies is the integration of existing on-premises data warehousing with data lakehouse solutions using data fabric and data mesh technology. Doing so creates a modern data warehousing solution for the long term.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-lake">data lakehouse</a> contains an organization’s data in a unstructured, structured, semi-structured form, which can be stored indefinitely for immediate or future use. This data is used by data scientists and engineers who study data to gain business insights. Data lake or data lakehouse storage costs are less expensive than a enterprise data warehouse. Further, data lakes and data lakehouse are less time-consuming to manage, which reduces operational costs. IBM has a next-generation data lakehouse solution to achieve these business situations.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-fabric">Data fabric</a> is the next-generation data analytics platform that solves advanced data security challenges through decentralized ownership. Typically, organizations have multiple data sources from different business lines that must be integrated for analytics. A data fabric architecture effectively unites disparate data sources and links them through centrally managed data sharing and governance guidelines.</p>



<p>Many enterprises seek a flexible, hybrid, and multi-cloud solution based on cloud providers. The data mesh solution pushes down the structured query language (SQL) queries to the related RDBMS or data lakehouse by managing the data catalog, giving users virtualized tables and data. In data mesh principles, it never stores business data locally, which is an advantage for a business. A successful data mesh solution will reduce a company’s capital and operational expenses. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a> is an excellent example of a data fabric and data mesh solution for analytics. Cloud technology has emerged as the preferred platform for artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, intelligent edge services, and advanced wireless connectivity and etc. Many companies will leverage a hybrid, multi-cloud strategy to improve business performance and success and thrive in the business world.&nbsp;</p>



 Best practices for adopting data warehousing technology 



<p>Data warehouse modernization includes extending the infrastructure without compromising security. This allows companies to reap the advantages of new technologies, inducing speed and agility in data processes, meeting changing business requirements, and staying relevant in this age of big data. The growing variety and volume of current data make it essential for businesses to modernize their data warehouses to remain competitive in today’s market. Businesses need valuable insights and reports in real-time and enterprise or legacy data warehouses cannot keep pace with modern data demands.</p>



<p>Data warehouses are at an exciting point of evolution. With the global data warehousing market size <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/data-warehousing-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20warehousing%20market,10.7%25%20from%202020%20to%202028.">estimated to grow</a> at a compound grow over 250% in next 5 years, companies will rely on new data warehouse solutions and tools that make them easier to use than ever before.</p>



 Cutting-edge technology to keep up with constant changes 



<p>AI and other breakthrough technologies will propel organizations into the next decade. Data consumption and load will continue to grow and provoke companies to discover new ways to implement state-of-the-art data warehousing solutions. The prevalence of digital technologies and connected devices will help organizations remain afloat, an unimaginable feat 20 years ago.</p>



<p>Essential lessons arise from an organization’s efforts to optimize its enterprise or legacy data warehousing technology. One vital lesson is the importance of making specific changes to modernize technology, processes, and organizational operations to evolve. As the rate of change will only continue to increase, this knowledge—and the capability to accelerate modernization—will be critical going forward.</p>



<p>No matter where you are at data warehouse modernization today, IBM experts are here to help modernize the right approach to fit your needs. It’s time to get started with your data warehouse modernization journey.</p>

<p>In today’s interconnected world, supply chains and global trade are complex. With multiple entities involved in each transaction, it can be difficult to track and verify the parties involved. Yet trust, transparency and accountability are essential as we implement interoperable systems across both Government and Industry.</p>
<p>At this month’s International Chambers of Commerce (ICC) Digital Trade Conference in London, the subject of how to prepare the markets to go digital was a hot topic. Over three days, experts from the public and private sector met to discuss best practices and practical solutions to managing risk as trade and supply chains go digital.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Joining a panel were experts from the GLEIF, ICC, Citi Bank, MonetaGo, and the IATBA. Unsurprisingly, the subject of a standardised, global organisation identity, specifically Legal Entity Identifiers, formed a core part of the conversation.</p>
<p>You can see the recorded panel below, or at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVEAs9qDVWg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVEAs9qDVWg</a>.</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<blockquote><p>“If we want a transparent system where we know who owns the goods, where the goods are coming from, who the parties are, where the finance is coming from, then obviously identity is absolutely crucial. It’s in many ways a more foundational priority than other parts of the digitalisation agenda, and that’s one of the reasons why we are putting such a priority on this whole area of digital identities.”<br>
Chris Southworth, Secretary General of the ICC UK</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s step back and see where Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) come in. The LEI is the only standardised, regulated and global method to identify verified organisations. Each LEI code is unique, verifiable and provides several benefits in supply chains and global trade. Here’s a closer look at each of these benefits:</p>
<p>Efficiency: LEIs increase efficiency in supply chains and reduce costs of cross-border payments by streamlining Customer Due Diligence (CDD) processes and reducing costs associated with manual data entry and verification. By providing a standardised way to identify legal entities, LEIs make it easier to enjoy paperless trade, uninterrupted trading and transaction tracking between partners.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We have partnered with Ubisecure, and we are now a Validation Agent able to provide LEI to our clients, and it just made the process so much quicker and easier. And the feedback that we are receiving from onboarding is that clients are really grateful to have the service… And what benefit I can see from a client’s perspective is – they are going to have to go and get an LEI, but they also have to go through all of our onboarding KYC, sending us a lot of documentation. Who wants to do that twice? We can now get the LEI for them. So, it’s a win-win.”<br>
Deborah Hardy, SVP Citi Bank</p></blockquote>
<p>Compliance: Many regulatory bodies require organisations to have an LEI to participate in regulated financial transactions. There are currently over <a href="https://rapidlei.com/lei-regulation/">300 regulations</a> requiring or recommending the use of LEIs. LEIs are key to ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, such as Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Supplier, and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. LEIs put transparency into financial transactions to help regulators identify potential risk, such as identifying the transacting organisations and understanding the group structure of parent and children companies acting as counterparties.</p>
<p>Risk Management: LEIs help manage risk in supply chains by providing transparency and visibility into the ownership structure of organisations. Potential risks, including conflicts of interest, fraud such as vendor impersonation, or corruption, can be better identified. The LEI is standardised, following a globally implemented data structure, meaning that LEIs can also help reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in data entry.</p>
<p>Transparency: LEIs increase transparency in supply chains by providing a unique identifier for each entity involved in a transaction. The open global standard for financial information (ISO 20022) sees the LEI mandatory in SWIFT transactions and is now in go-live status. This helps ensure that all parties have access to accurate and up-to-date information about the entities they are doing business with. By providing transparency, LEIs promote financial inclusion by helping build trust among partners and suppliers, creating a level playing field for smaller or non-domestic companies to compete. Organisations that commit to obtaining and maintaining an LEI demonstrate credibility within a crowded market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In terms of digital trade, we know that there’s a widening gap in finance. So, I think there are some strong links to having an LEI in terms of a digital readiness indicator and also a digital inclusion in digital trade.”<br>
Lisa Short, Co-Chair Digital Credentials Task Force at the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications</p></blockquote>
<p>Standardisation: For years, organisations have needed to deal with different regional, vertical and proprietary organisation identifiers. LEIs provide an interoperable, standardised, globally implemented, way to identify legal entities across different jurisdictions and industries. This makes it easier to compare and analyse data across different organisations and sectors. By promoting standardisation, LEIs can help reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies in data entry. Such standardisation also supports sustainability initiatives by providing a way to track environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data across the supply chain. This can help organisations identify areas for improvement and make more informed decisions about their supply chain practices.</p>
<p>Data Quality: LEIs improve the quality of legal entity identification and reference data in supply chains by reducing errors and inconsistencies in data entry. This can help organisations make more informed decisions and improve the accuracy of their reporting.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If I could go back in time, one of the key things I would have done is look at whichever use case you’re struggling with when it comes to legal entity, where LEI can actually add value. For me, it would have been cheaper to actually fund an LEI for every single one of my suppliers than continue to have really expensive people clean data.”<br>
Oswald Kuyler – Head of Strategy at MonetaGo Europe</p></blockquote>
<p>Integration: LEIs can be integrated with trade, onboarding and entity data management systems to improve supply chain visibility and streamline processes. New technologies broaden the reach of LEIs; for example, LEIs can be incorporated into Verifiable Credentials (see <a href="https://rapidlei.com/vlei/">vLEI</a>) and linked to blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent supply chain ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The vLEI has the potential to become one of the most valuable digital credentials in the world because it is the hallmark of authenticity for a legal entity of any kind.”<br>
Drummond Reed, Steering Committee Member, Trust-over-IP-Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>As innovators like Ubisecure drive innovative applications for LEIs, particularly to banks and business registries, it’s worth us remembering that even today LEIs are a core tool as trade and the supply chain go digital. In many ways, the journey of the LEI has only just begun.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, sustainability pledges have emerged from nearly every major company. IBM® has had a bit of a head start: we’ve been focused on environmental conservation and sustainability for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/about/environment">more than 50 years</a>, operating our business pursuant to environmental leadership and minimizing our impact on the planet’s precious ecosystems.</p>



<p>As we celebrate Earth Day this month, we are reminded that addressing climate change will take more than any one organization; it will require companies, governments, nongovernmental organizations and communities, all working together, and with the aid of technology, to improve the efficiencies of our activities and operations and to reduce costs, waste and emissions.</p>



<p>To illustrate this need, this month, IBM released two Institute for Business Value (IBV) reports. First, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/esg-ultimatum">The ESG conundrum</a> reveals that while an increased focus on environmental sustainability remains a top priority for participating consumers and business executives, inadequate data is a key challenge for both groups when it comes to achieving personal and corporate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals. And second, in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/sustainable-operations-consumer-products">Redesigning brand values: Purpose and profit converge in core operations</a>, authored by IBM and The Consumer Goods Forum, surveyed consumer goods leaders share that they estimate technology budgets will grow by 34% over the next three years.</p>



<p>To that end, IBM has been building out an ecosystem of technologies and partnerships to help clients optimize their core operations across assets, infrastructure and supply chains.</p>



 A clearer picture for environmental sustainability 



<p>No matter where organizations are on their sustainability journeys, they face questions like: “How do these goals tie to our business? How do we achieve them?” and “How can I measure, report and adapt our sustainability goals?” In other words, “How can I balance revenue and risk and drive shareholder returns while still reducing my company’s waste and emissions?”</p>



<p>Simply put, data is key for environmental action: without detailed insights into your environmental impact, it’s difficult to take systematic steps to reduce it.&nbsp;Without data, sustainability is not visible, it’s not actionable, and it’s not operational.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why IBM offers clients a comprehensive portfolio of technology and consulting expertise to help organizations operationalize their sustainability goals. Our practical approach embeds sustainability decision-making directly into daily business operations so organizations can better translate their sustainability ambitions into actionable results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And as our clients’ needs continue to evolve, so do our capabilities. In fact, we recently <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/how-digital-technologies-may-help-operationalize-sustainability-for-the-cio">announced</a> that we are helping Chief Information Officers (CIOs) operationalize sustainability via a new software integration between the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/envizi">IBM Envizi™ ESG Suite</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic®</a>. CIOs are positioned to drive lasting impact in support of sustainability and can use tools like this new IBM integrated solution designed to help reduce data center energy consumption and carbon impact. The solution provides organizations with near-real-time visibility of data center energy demand and emissions impact at an application level to support the optimization of data center resources and workload placement.</p>



 From insights to action 



<p>IBM also has a growing roster of customers across a range of industries that are taking steps toward their corporate sustainability goals with our products. For example, the <a href="https://www.downergroup.com/">Downer Group</a>, an integrated services company in Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/downer">has worked with IBM Consulting™ to use the IBM Maximo® Application Suite</a> to power its TrainDNA platform, which provides a holistic view into its more than 200 trains across Australia. This view includes train location, timetable and status information and predictive maintenance insights, supporting the company’s commitment to provide timely service to passengers, and getting them where they need to go. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/downer-ibm-envizi-esg-suite">Downer also relies on IBM Envizi ESG Suite</a> to capture and manage data that help them more effectively meet their sustainability goals, including data on energy consumption, waste generation and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/blueit">BlueIT</a>, which provides direct IT outsourcing for clients. In addition to helping their customers improve their tech performance, BlueIT also strives to support their sustainability initiatives. To do so, BlueIT has been employing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/turbonomic">IBM Turbonomic</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana™ Observability</a> solutions to get a better picture of their clients’ IT environments so they can help them reduce waste. Since implementing Turbonomic and Instana, BlueIT has been executing resourcing decisions quickly, which has translated to a measurable reduction in its clients’ CPU and memory usage.</p>



<p>To demonstrate the transformative power of these data and AI-driven solutions, IBM has integrated many of these solutions into our own operations to help improve efficiency and reduce our environmental impact—beginning with our facilities. As highlighted in a recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-gre">IBM case study</a>, IBM operates more than 50 million square feet of real estate across some 800 locations in 100 countries, and we’re committed to making these spaces as efficient as possible.</p>



<p>IBM Global Real Estate (GRE) has been using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/tririga">IBM TRIRIGA® Application Suite</a> and the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo Application Suite</a> to manage its facilities and assets, creating an IT foundation for sustainability decisions. GRE is also using the IBM Envizi ESG Suite to integrate data that supports sustainability reporting, including key elements from TRIRIGA and Maximo, creating a streamlined, auditable system of record. By replacing multiple tools with a single automated platform, GRE has reduced its spend on data reporting software by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/ibm-gre">30%</a> while achieving greater operational efficiency.</p>



 It takes all of us 



<p>Staving off climate change and protecting our natural resources is a mission that can’t succeed without all stakeholders doing their part. Our innovations and sustainability software solutions are just a start, and we look forward to continuing to apply them to causes that support the well-being of our planet.</p>



<p>As we celebrate Earth Day 2023 and begin writing the next chapter of IBM’s long history of innovation, we’re proud to be doing our part in helping to preserve our planet for future generations to come—and we’re hoping you’ll join us.</p>

Blockchain for Europe’s Robert Kopitsch, for example, believes the nonfungible tokens (NFTs) section is overly complicated, resulting in varying interpretations.</p><p>Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, Binance’s founder and CEO, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/14/binance-ceo-zhao-says-eus-proposed-crypto-rules-are-fantastic-but-strict/">commented that MiCA is slightly strict on stablecoins</a>, particularly as the drafts do not accommodate USD-based stablecoins, which hold a significant market&nbsp;share.</p><p>Despite this, Zhao praised MiCA as a “fantastic” regulation at Binance Blockchain Week Paris 2022. He believes it is likely to become the global standard that other jurisdictions emulate.</p> MiCA’s Impact <p>The implementation of the MiCA carries significant implications for both crypto users and the broader ecosystem. And as the legislation is put into motion, understanding its impact on various aspects of the industry is essential.</p> User Experience and Access to&nbsp;Services <p>MiCA aims to bring regulatory clarity and consistency to crypto-asset service providers. but This also means that businesses will need to adapt to the new regulatory framework.</p><p>Users may experience some growing pains during the transition, as crypto platforms might need to modify their services to remain compliant.</p><p>In the long run, however, the uniformity provided by MiCA aims to provide a seamless and secure user experience across the European&nbsp;Union.</p> Innovation and Investment <p>While the primary goal of MiCA is to mitigate risks and ensure investor protection, the impact of the regulation on innovation within the crypto ecosystem is yet to be fully understood.</p><p>As such, the legislation could attract more institutional investors to the space, contributing to the overall growth and maturity of the industry. On the other hand, strict compliance requirements might stifle smaller startups or projects, potentially hindering innovation at the grassroots level.</p> Cross-Border Collaboration <p>One of the key benefits of MiCA is the harmonization of regulations across EU member states. This legislative alignment will likely facilitate increased cross-border collaboration and the development of pan-European blockchain initiatives.</p><p>By reducing regulatory barriers and fostering a more unified market, the act could stimulate the growth and integration of the European crypto ecosystem on a larger&nbsp;scale.</p> Privacy and&nbsp;Security <p>MiCA’s focus on transparency and consumer protection may lead to enhanced security measures across the industry.</p><p>Users can expect more rigorous <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">identity verification processes</a> and stronger anti-money laundering (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a>) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) policies. While these steps contribute to a safer environment for crypto users, privacy concerns may arise due to the increased collection of personal information.</p><p>In summary, MiCA has the potential to reshape the crypto landscape in Europe, influencing user experience, innovation, cross-border collaboration, and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As the industry adapts to the new regulatory environment, the balance between fostering growth and ensuring consumer protection will be of paramount importance.</p> Final Note <p>With EI giving a go to MiCA, the crypto landscape is about to face a significant transformation.</p><p>Although most industry stakeholders embrace the clarity and harmonization MiCA aims at, it is equally crucial to address the concerns of industry stakeholders regarding its impact on crypto&nbsp;users.</p><p>The importance of striking the right balance between regulatory oversight and nurturing innovation cannot be overstated, especially at a moment when the European Council is about to assess the go-forward of&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>With the legislation taking shape, MiCA’s eventual impact on digital asset innovation and growth will be under close scrutiny within Europe and around the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>The AT Protocol already has a growing developer ecosystem. Although some protocol components are still under development, we’ve made it a priority to simplify the complexity of building on top of it. This effort extends to not only new clients, but also new experiences, such as <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">algorithmic choice</a> and <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/4-13-2023-moderation">composable moderation</a>.</p>
<p>Today we’re shipping <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem/blob/main/app-passwords.md">app passwords</a>, a short-term solution for authentication that will let users experiment with new clients without having to fully trust them with their passwords. In the long term, we plan to implement SSO (Single Sign-On) with scoped permissions.</p>
<p>We published an <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem">atproto ecosystem overview</a> on GitHub awhile ago, but did not widely publicize it until we had an auth solution that didn’t put user credentials at risk. With the release of app passwords today, we’re ready to share it! There are AT Protocol implementations in 6 languages, and 13 clients across web, iOS, and Android: <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem">https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-ecosystem</a></p>
<p>There are also many projects building on the “firehose” of Bluesky app data. Some highlights include a VR experience with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luLwADw37MM">a feed you can spatially explore</a> and an avatar that summarizes recent activity in the network for you, and a <a href="https://github.com/aliceisjustplaying/bluesky-heatmap">heatmap generator</a> that plots a user’s posts like a GitHub commit graph.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luLwADw37MM"></a></p>
Created by @antpb.xyz
<p>This is only the beginning. If you’d like to explore more, here’s a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OBvKfGsIpZGP6mwAatqVMXI8tsyWlfwMdGnuZprlx68/edit#gid=0">longer list of projects</a> in the atproto ecosystem so far.</p>
<p>A big part of our development philosophy has been to build on existing software stacks that make interoperability simple. For example:</p>
 
 All the data in the atproto ecosystem is valid <a href="https://ipld.io">IPLD</a> and can be manipulated and explored through <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs">existing IPFS dev tooling</a> 
 Our top level handles are simple DNS text records 
 We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID specification</a> for our identity layer 
 Our API is well specified and is simply JSON over HTTP 
 
<p>The Bluesky app demonstrates how a microblogging client can be built on the AT Protocol with an intuitive user experience. However, there is still much more to be done to fully explore the potential of this architecture.</p>
<p>Our core dev team is currently focused on finishing the AT Protocol. Our near-term priorities are open federation with account portability and shipping moderation tooling, as described in our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/3-2-2023-bluesky-beta-app">March update</a>. If you’d like to join the conversation, feel free to join our <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#bluesky-dev:matrix.org">Matrix dev chat</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for following atproto’s progress! We’re excited to share more with you soon.</p>

<p>Toronto, ON – April 20, 2023 – Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. (CSE: LQID) (the “Company” or “Liquid Avatar”) announces that it will not be in a position to file its audited consolidated annual financial statements, management’s discussion and analysis and related CEO and CFO certifications for the year ended December 31, 2022 and accompanying management discussion and analysis (the “Annual Financial Filings”) <a>by the filing deadline of May 1, 2023 due to the lack of necessary funds to timely commence the</a> audit process as part of the Annual Financial Filings of the Company.&nbsp; The Company has access to sufficient funds now and expects that the AnnualFinancialFilings will be filed prior to June 30, 2023.</p>



<p>As a result of the delay in filing, the Company has requested that the Ontario Securities Commission and other Canadian securities regulatory authorities issue a temporary management cease trade order (“MCTO”) that prohibits certain officers of the Company from trading in securities of the Company for so long as the AnnualFinancialFilings are not filed. The issuance of such MCTO would generally not affect the ability of persons who have not been directors or officers of the Company to trade in their securities.&nbsp; However, in its discretion, the Ontario Securities Commission may determine that it would be appropriate to issue an issuer cease trade order affecting all of the Company’s securities.</p>



<p>The Company intends to provide information in accordance with National Policy 12-203 – Cease Trade Orders for Continuous Disclosure Defaults with respect to further developments in respect of this matter promptly following their occurrence, including the issuance of bi-weekly status update reports for so long as the AnnualFinancialFilings are not filed. The Company has not taken any steps towards any insolvency proceeding and the Company has no material information to release to the public. The Company has made the foregoing representations in accordance with the requirements of applicable securities laws.</p>

<p>Fission is roadmapping in public with Starmap, a tool for cross-team planning.</p> What is Starmap? <p><a href="https://starmap.site/">Starmap</a> is an adaptive and flexible tool developed by <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> that renders GitHub issues as a roadmap. It removes the need to make duplicate tasks in a Gantt chart or Excel spreadsheet to track progress.</p><p>Starmap was created with the needs of the Protocol Labs Network in mind. The PLN contains hundreds of companies of varying sizes and project types, and roadmaps can take many forms. Instead of creating a one-size-fits-all tool, the developers intentionally made it adaptable using containers.</p><p>You can create any number of containers you want to fit your specific needs. If you want to work in Epics and user stories, you can. If you’re only using Low-level GitHub issues? No problem. Milestones and low-level issues? Got you covered. All you need to do is create a GitHub issue to use as a container, name it the way you want, and add child issues and an ETA. You’re all set! </p> How to Build a Starmap <p>As shown in the following screenshots, the project architecture at Fission is the following from top to bottom:</p>  Project issue  Milestones  Low-level issues, which are the actual tasks that need to be completed  <p>If you don’t have a roadmap yet, the easiest way to start is by reviewing your spec. </p><p>Identify the features or improvements you'll need to make to ship your MVP or upgrade, and set clear milestones. Then identify the tasks that need to be checked off to hit those milestones.</p><p>During this process, it's important to consider your internal and external dependencies. Do you need to wait for a specific tech update to be released to be able to progress on your milestone? Which of your task needs to be done before the other?</p><p>Estimate your issues, prioritize them, and add the GitHub issue's URL in the body of their respective milestone issue. Add each milestone issue URL in the body of the project issue.</p><p>Finally, paste the project issue (or root node) URL into Starmap, which will render for you immediately.</p> Collaboration is Key <p>At Fission, the process of roadmapping is collaborative and user-driven. Fission's Project Manager, Bastien Dehaynin, knows he cannot build a Starmap alone - he needs to work with the project developers who completely understand the tech. </p><p>Together Bastien and the developers create user stories. &nbsp;They describe the features from the user's perspective and clearly share their needs and expectations, as well as why those features are important to them in the first place. &nbsp;</p><p>Then they break the user stories themselves down into small chunks of work that a single developer can feasibly complete (the low-level GitHub issues). The tasks are then prioritized and organized into milestones. Together they estimate how long each milestone will take to complete and distribute them over a timeline. Then Bastien translates all of this into GitHub and a Starmap.</p> To Infinity and Beyond <p>Fission currently has Starmaps for <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/2?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">WNFS</a>, <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/15?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">Go CAR Mirror</a>, and <a href="https://starmap.site/roadmap/github.com/fission-codes/Fission-Starmap/issues/8?crumbs=%5B%5B%22fission-codes%2FFission-Starmap%231%22%2C%22Fission+Projects+%22%5D%5D#simple">IPVM</a>. We are in the process of adding the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/fission-server">Fission Server</a> Rust rewrite project and <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">RhizomeDB</a> as well.</p><p>Fission is also spearheading an effort to increase Starmap adoption across the PLN. Starmap allows all teams involved in a project to add their issues to the same roadmap. Therefore, the more teams build out Starmaps, the greater our awareness of other projects' needs and how we can work together.</p><p>For example, if one team is working on a decentralized app and needs an authorization solution, they might look at the roadmaps of other projects and see that they've used UCANs. Or if one project is working on one half of a problem and another is working on the other, they can team up and ship protocols and an MVP. </p><p>It's also easier to recognize potential bumps in the road and mitigate them. For example, if one of your roadmapped dependencies depends on another tool that is not being actively maintained, that might be something to watch.</p><p>If we all work together, we have the ability to work together to surface hidden needs and opportunities so we can all reach our goals faster. </p> <p>Here's a Starmap demo led by Bastien. </p><p>Bastien is presenting Starmap at May's PLN Lab Day and IPFS Thing 2023. Both will be recorded, and we'll update the blog post with the links when we receive the videos.</p><p>Want to learn how you can get started with Starmap? Visit the <a href="https://starmap.site/">documentation site</a> or reach out to Bastien on <a href="http://fission.codes/discord">Fission's Discord</a>. He's happy to work with you! </p>

							<p>Most of us have grown up with the warning not to trust strangers. We would never share personal details without verifying an identity or hand over $100 from our wallet to a stranger. But what happens when someone shows up in our home, asking for all of this and more?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our current age of technology and social media, the prevalence of <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/online-dating-romance-scams-how-to-protect-yourself/">online romance scams</a> has become a growing concern. As people get more comfortable navigating dating apps and social media, scammers have found new ways to exploit people who are just hoping to find love, friendship, or companionship. These crimes occur on our computers and phones, right in the safety of our homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the last few years, romance scams have become a widespread issue. In 2022 alone, they affected <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/02/romance-scammers-favorite-lies-exposed#ft2">at least 70,000 people</a> – and those are only the ones that reported their concerns. The losses stemming from romance scams in a single year topped $1.3 billion, with most people losing almost $4,500 per incident.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tactics used by scammers are becoming more sophisticated, making it difficult for even the most tech-savvy individuals to detect them. These scams are riskiest for <a href="https://www.ice.gov/features/LoveOnline">seniors aged 55 to 64</a>, but anyone can be targeted, regardless of age, gender, or sexual orientation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we’ll explore why romance scams have become so prevalent in 2023 and show how you can take steps to avoid becoming a target.</p>						 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
			 Three Factors Driving the Growth of Romance Scams  		 
				 
					 
		 
							 
		 
				 
						 
					 
			 
								 
				 
							<p>While romance scams have been gaining in popularity for years, the circumstances that began developing in 2020 accelerated this trend. &nbsp;Three critical factors have been identified by experts as essential to the explosion of romance scams that have increased over the past three years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Pandemic-era isolation  Our growing comfort with online dating  The rise of cryptocurrency  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The combination of these factors has been called a “<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/06/reports-show-scammers-cashing-crypto-craze">combustible combination for fraud</a>” by data researchers at the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Pandemic-era Isolation <p>&nbsp;</p><p>When so many of us started isolating and socially distancing in early 2020, it began to create a deep sense of uncertainty and insecurity. Humans are social creatures and are designed to exist in groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When people were forced to stay indoors and limit their social interactions, many of us turned to online dating, social media, or other networking sites to find love and companionship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This gave scammers the perfect opportunity to prey on people’s vulnerability and loneliness. Fewer face-to-face interactions made it harder to detect red flags, such as inconsistencies in the scammer’s story or suspicious requests for money. It also separated people from their social safety nets, making them more likely to reach out to strangers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the pandemic greatly heightened many people’s emotional distress, making them more likely to fall for romantic or even platonic overtures from scammers who used flattery, affection, and the promise of a better future to cajole their victims into doing what they wanted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Growing Comfort with Online Dating <p>&nbsp;</p><p>While the percentage of the American population that has used dating sites or apps has remained consistent since 2019, what’s growing is our acceptance of these tools. There are now more choices than ever before, specifically targeted to different age ranges, demographics, and interests. People have started using them not only for romance but also to <a href="https://bumble.com/en-us/the-buzz/what-exactly-is-bumble-bff">make friends</a> or find <a href="https://blackplatinumgold.com/looking-for-a-travel-buddy-here-are-the-5-best-platforms-that-will-help-you-instantly/">travel companions</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As more people turn to online dating and social networks to find love and connections, scammers have also found a lucrative opportunity to prey on individuals’ emotions and financial resources.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These apps and sites provide scammers with a large pool of potential victims, making it easier for them to create fake profiles and lure unsuspecting individuals into relationships. From there, scammers have proven time and time again that they’re happy to play the long game – often talking to their targets for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/romance-scams-booming-billions-facebook-instagram-pandemic-isolation-online-dating-2023-3">up to six months</a> before they ask for money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> The Rise of Cryptocurrency <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third factor that has combined to make romance scams so prevalent – and damaging – in 2023 is the proliferation of cryptocurrency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ten years ago, crypto was solely a niche industry, but now it’s gone mainstream. Bitcoin alone has jumped in price by <a href="https://youngandtheinvested.com/cryptocurrency-statistics/">311,000%</a> since it was launched on Coinbase in 2012, sparking much broader interest from the public along the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This interest can be harmful since it offers scammers the illusion of doing something innovative and potentially lucrative when they brag about “investing in crypto” to their unsuspecting targets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike gift cards or traditional currency, cryptocurrency provides scammers with an anonymous and decentralized means of receiving payments, making it easier for them to avoid detection. Romance scammers often use cryptocurrency to accept payments from their victims, since it is difficult to trace and recover once the funds are transferred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> Avoiding Romance Scams with Free Identity Verification Services <p>&nbsp;</p><p>The ongoing isolation of the past few years, coupled with growing societal acceptance of both online dating and cryptocurrency, has made it easier than ever for scammers to find new targets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to avoid these scams is to ensure you know and <a href="https://blog.dentity.com/free-id-verification-for-craigslist-and-online-dating/">can verify the identity of anyone you trust online</a>. Using a free identity check tool like Dentity makes it easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://oidc.dentity.com/oidc/interaction/sign-up">Dentity</a> is simple, easy, and risk-free. The first step is to sign up and verify your identity.&nbsp; From there, you keep your identity information in a private, portable, safe and secure online wallet. Whenever you’re talking to a new person online – romantic or otherwise – you can request their verified information so they can prove that they are who they say they are. No more uncertainty, stress, or heartache.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://oidc.dentity.com/oidc/interaction/sign-up">Sign up today</a> to see for yourself.</p>

  Congress is divided on stablecoin regulation, with differing opinions on access to Federal Reserve banking services and the necessity of stablecoins.  The draft bill proposes stricter stablecoin regulations and explores the feasibility of a digital&nbsp;dollar.  As stablecoins gain momentum, governments are increasingly turning their attention to CBDCs, highlighting their key distinctions in governance, backing, and trade implications when compared to their stablecoin counterparts.  <p>As political parties divide over potential congressional action on stablecoin regulations, the future of digital assets in the United States hangs in the&nbsp;balance.</p><p>During a House hearing on Wednesday, April 19, Republicans advocated for the revival of a bipartisan bill designed to regulate stablecoin issuers and grant them access to Federal Reserve banking services.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats expressed reservations about fostering a tighter bond between the cryptocurrency and traditional banking&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>Although stablecoin regulation advocates argue that digital assets extend beyond crypto speculation, enticing developers to relocate to countries with clear regulatory frameworks, critics are apprehensive about the implications of integrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional banking system without proper scrutiny.</p><p>Instead, they demand a complete bill overhaul, emphasizing that it must address recent crypto market disruptions, such as the collapse of FTX, and scrutinize the necessity of stablecoins.</p><p>A draft bill released on April 15 by the House Financial Services Committee proposes empowering the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors to oversee nonbank entities and digital asset firms aiming to issue stablecoins.</p><p>The bill delineates stricter regulations for dollar-pegged digital assets at federal and state levels while establishing interoperability, reporting, and enforcement requirements.</p><p>Furthermore, it imposes a two-year moratorium on the creation and issuance of algorithmic stablecoins and those backed by other cryptocurrencies, alongside requesting a U.S. Treasury study on the feasibility and impact of a digital dollar <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/cbdcs-101-understanding-the-basics-of-central-bank-digital-currencies">central bank digital currency</a>&nbsp;(CBDC).</p> The Possible Impact of Draft Stablecoin Rules <p>As the United States Congress wrestles with the future of stablecoin regulation, crypto enthusiasts and stakeholders keenly observe the potential repercussions of the draft stablecoin rules.</p><p>After all, the proposed legislation aims to reshape the digital currency landscape, impacting both crypto users and the ecosystem in myriad&nbsp;ways.</p><p>While the benefits of a well-regulated stablecoin market are indisputable, the draft rules’ ramifications warrant a thorough exploration. One notable advantage of the proposed regulatory framework is the bolstered trust and security it would&nbsp;offer.</p><p>By requiring stablecoin issuers to adhere to stringent guidelines, including holding sufficient reserves and undergoing regular audits, the risk of abrupt devaluations or collapses, such as the TerraUSD fiasco, diminishes.</p><p>This enhanced stability is likely to instill confidence in users, encouraging the adoption of stablecoins for everyday transactions. Moreover, consumer protection would receive a significant boost from the draft&nbsp;rules.</p><p>As stablecoin issuers comply with transparency and disclosure requirements, the likelihood of fraud or market manipulation dwindles. In turn, crypto users would enjoy a more secure environment, fostering mainstream adoption and spurring businesses to integrate stablecoins into their financial operations.</p><p>However, despite these positive implications, concerns remain regarding the draft rules’ potential drawbacks.</p><p>The increased compliance costs, for instance, may impede the growth of the stablecoin market. Operational expenses could rise for stablecoin issuers, leading to higher transaction fees or diminished services, ultimately passed on to end-users.</p><p>Additionally, the stringent regulatory environment might stifle innovation within the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/gibraltar-based-xapo-bank-to-enable-usdc-services-amidst-banking-crisis">stablecoin</a> ecosystem.</p><p>As such, emerging projects that drive novel solutions could find themselves burdened by the need to adhere to strict guidelines, hindering their ability to experiment and innovate. This could curtail the development of groundbreaking technologies in the stablecoin arena.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant concern arises from the draft rules’ potential to concentrate power among a select&nbsp;few.</p><p>By vesting authority over stablecoin issuers in the Federal Reserve and emphasizing federal and state-level regulations, the decentralized ethos that underpins the cryptocurrency ecosystem could be&nbsp;eroded.</p><p>This might lead to a less competitive market, dominated by a handful of major players and depriving the sector of the diverse perspectives that spur ingenuity.</p><p>Overall, the draft stablecoin rules represent a double-edged sword, poised to redefine the crypto landscape.</p><p>Trust, security, and consumer protection are set to improve under a regulated stablecoin market.</p><p>Nonetheless, the potential costs and constraints on innovation must not be overlooked. Striking a delicate balance between fostering stability and preserving the decentralized, pioneering spirit of cryptocurrencies will be crucial as the future of digital assets&nbsp;unfolds.</p> Stablecoins vs. CBDCs: What Should You&nbsp;Know? <p>As the world witnesses a surge in stablecoin adoption, governments face an intricate dance — confronting the implications for their financial systems while simultaneously steering toward central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as a credible contender in the digital&nbsp;realm.</p><p>Amid this complex dynamic, understanding the stark contrasts between stablecoins and CBDCs becomes crucial, as it illuminates their individual roles in the rapidly transforming digital currency ecosystem.</p> What Role Do Stablecoins Play? <p>With digital currencies continuing to gain prominence in the financial world, stablecoins have emerged as a viable solution for addressing the challenges associated with traditional banking systems and crypto’s inherent volatility.</p><p>Designed to complement the fast-paced, increasingly global economy, stablecoins provide a more efficient and cost-effective means of exchanging money across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>After all, with stablecoins, users no longer require multiple international bank accounts to transact with individuals in other countries. Instead, a single crypto wallet is all that’s needed to facilitate seamless, peer-to-peer digital transfers.</p><p>This innovative approach not only reduces transaction fees and processing times but also offers a higher degree of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The decentralized, peer-to-peer nature of stablecoins also results in significant cost savings by eliminating the need for third-party intermediaries to facilitate transactions.</p><p>As a result, stablecoins have the potential to revolutionize the way individuals and businesses interact with the global financial system, providing a more accessible, efficient, and private alternative to conventional banking practices.</p> Final Note <p>With stablecoins gaining traction, the future of digital assets in the United States remains uncertain as Congress faces a sharp divide over their regulation.</p><p>The draft bill strives to strike a balance by tightening rules on stablecoins and evaluating the viability of a digital dollar CBDC. Yet, the dynamic interplay between stablecoins and CBDCs, each with their unique governance structures, backing mechanisms, and trade implications, fuels a complex debate that will ultimately shape the future of financial systems worldwide.</p><p>This high-stakes confrontation will determine which of the two digital assets — <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">versatile stablecoins or government-backed CBDCs</a> — will triumph and redefine global transactions in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Next.js has emerged as a trailblazing framework for building decentralized applications, owing to its robust architecture and versatile features. Next.js provides developers with the right tools to create their latest project, and it can be very simple to install Sign-In with Ethereum in your Next.js app by using SSX. </p><p>This guide will show you how to set it up in just a few steps:</p>  Creating your Next.js project - you can skip this step if you already have one  Adding SSX dependencies - how to install the dependencies on your project  Setting up the Backend - how to configure your backend  Setting up the Frontend - how to configure your frontend  <p>So, let’s dive in.</p> 1) Creating a Next.js project <p>Note: if you already have a Next app, you can skip to the next section.</p><p>First, create a new Next app by running this command:</p> <code>npx create-next-app@latest
</code> <p>In this tutorial, we are using a project with the following configuration:</p> <code>✔ What is your project named? … my-ssx-dapp
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … No
✔ What import alias would you like configured? … @/*</code>  2) Adding SSX dependencies <p>To use the SSX library, you must install the <code>@spruceid/ssx</code> dependency for the frontend, and <code>@spruceid/ssx-server</code> for the backend. To add it, navigate to your app’s directory and use the following command like so:</p> <code>cd my-ssx-dapp
npm install @spruceid/ssx @spruceid/ssx-server
</code>  <br>3) Setting up the Backend <p>Let's start by adding a helper file on our code so that we don't have to instantiate a new SSX Server object directly every time. Create the file <code>pages/api/_ssx.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { SSXServer } from "@spruceid/ssx-server";

const ssx = new SSXServer();

export default ssx;
</code> <p>For more information about configuring SSX Server, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Second, create an API route for generating a random nonce. This is used to identify the session and prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack?ref=blog.spruceid.com">replay attacks</a>. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-nonce.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  const nonce = ssx.generateNonce();
  req.cookies.nonce = nonce;
  res.status(200).send(nonce);
}
</code> <p>Third, add a sign-in API route. This route will do all necessary checks in the SIWE message, ensuring it's valid. All checks occur inside the <code>ssx.login()</code> function. Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-login.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json(
    await ssx.login(
      req.body.siwe,

</code> <p>Finally, create the sign-out API route. &nbsp;Create the file <code>pages/api/ssx-logout.ts</code> and add the following:</p> <code>import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import ssx from "./_ssx";

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    success: await ssx.logout() ?? true
  });
}</code> <p><br>You can find more information about <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.generatenonce?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.generateNonce</a>, <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.login?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.login</a>, and <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx-server/ssx-server.ssxserver/ssx-server.ssxserver.logout?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx.logout</a> in the SSX documentation.</p> 4) Setting up the Frontend <p>First, we will create a new SSXComponent to wrap the sign-in/out logic. Create a new folder called <code>components</code> in the root directory, create the file <code>components/SSXComponent.tsx</code>, and add the following to it:</p> <code>import { SSX } from "@spruceid/ssx";
import { useState } from "react";

const SSXComponent = () =&gt; {

    const [ssxProvider, setSSX] = useState&lt;SSX | null&gt;(null);

    const ssxHandler = async () =&gt; {
        const ssx = new SSX({
            providers: {
                server: {
                    host: "http://localhost:3000/api"
                }
            },
        });
        await ssx.signIn();
        setSSX(ssx);
    };

    const ssxLogoutHandler = async () =&gt; {
        ssxProvider?.signOut();
        setSSX(null);
    };

    const address = ssxProvider?.address() || '';

    return (
        &lt;div className="App"&gt;
            &lt;div className="App-header"&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;&amp;nbsp;SSX Example dapp&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            {
                ssxProvider ?
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Account Info
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;div&gt;
                            {
                                address &amp;&amp;
                                &lt;p&gt;
                                    &lt;b&gt;Address:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;{address}&lt;/code&gt;
                                &lt;/p&gt;
                            }
                        &lt;/div&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxLogoutHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-Out
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt; :
                    &lt;div className="App-content"&gt;
                        &lt;h2&gt;
                            Connect and Sign-In with your Ethereum account.
                        &lt;/h2&gt;
                        &lt;button onClick={ssxHandler}&gt;
                            Sign-In with Ethereum
                        &lt;/button&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
            }
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
};

export default SSXComponent;
</code> <p>This SSX configuration assumes you are running the Next.js dapp using the default port (3000). If you are running in a different port, change the <code>providers.server.host</code> in the SSX config. For more information about SSX client configuration, you can check out our <a href="https://docs.ssx.id/reference/ssx/ssx.ssxclientconfig?ref=blog.spruceid.com">documentation</a>.</p><p>Finally, let’s update the <code>pages/index.tsx</code> file with the following code. Add the additional imports specified, and if you generated your app using the create-next-app tool, replace the existing <code>export default function Home() {}</code> with the following:</p> <code>import SSXComponent from '@/components/SSXComponent';
import type { NextPage } from 'next'
import Head from 'next/head'


const Home: NextPage = () =&gt; {

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      &lt;Head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;SSX Next Dapp&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /&gt;
      &lt;/Head&gt;
      &lt;SSXComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  )
}

export default Home;
</code> <p>That's it! Now you can run the dapp by using <code>yarn dev</code> or <code>npm run dev</code>. </p><p>If you want to add some style to your new dapp, add the following to your <code>styles/globals.css</code>, but this step is completely optional:</p> <code>body {
  margin: 0;

This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

<p>The increasing prevalence of financial crimes, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud, has led to stringent regulatory measures designed to protect consumers. These include using enhanced due diligence to verify user identities and manage risk potential.</p>
 What Is Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)? 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is a rigorous and comprehensive customer identification, verification, and risk assessment process that goes above and beyond standard due diligence procedures. EDD is typical in economic contexts, applied to high-risk customers or business relationships to mitigate potential financial, and legal risks associated with illicit activities.</p>
<p>EDD is a core part of most financial regulations, including <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/kyc-software/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements in the U.S.</p>
 How Does Enhanced Due Diligence Work? 
<p>EDD typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 Identifying High-Risk Customers: Institutions assess the risk level of their customers based on factors such as occupation, location, transaction type, and associations. High-risk customers may include politically exposed persons (PEPs), individuals from high-risk jurisdictions, or those engaged in industries with higher incidences of money laundering or fraud. 
 Collecting Additional Information: EDD requires gathering more detailed information about the customer than typical due diligence. This information includes sources of wealth, sources of funds, business affiliations, transaction patterns, and intended use of the products or services. 
 Enhanced, Ongoing Monitoring: High-risk customers and transactions are subject to more frequent and thorough monitoring to detect unusual or suspicious activity, including reviews of transactions. 
 Escalating Suspicious Activities: If suspicious activity is detected during the EDD process, organizations must report it to the relevant authorities, such as the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) or other regulatory bodies. 
 Documentation: Institutions must maintain detailed records of their EDD efforts, including the information gathered, risk assessments conducted, and any actions to respond to suspicious activities. 
 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is crucial to an effective AML and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) program. By conducting EDD, organizations can better manage and mitigate the risks associated with high-risk customers and transactions, ultimately protecting their business and contributing to the global fight against financial crime.</p>
 What Are Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations, and How Does EDD Fit Into Them? 
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-kyc/">KYC regulations</a> are a set of guidelines and procedures that financial institutions and other regulated entities must follow to verify the identity and assess the risk profile of their customers. The primary objective of KYC is to prevent fraud and money laundering used in organized crime and terrorism by ensuring that organizations have a thorough understanding of their customers and their transactions.</p>
<p>KYC typically involves the following steps:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/kyc-cip/">Customer Identification</a>: Collecting and verifying the customer’s personal information through personal and official <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/online-document-verification/">document verification</a>. 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Assessing the customer’s risk profile based on common threat factors around industry, nationality, etc. 
 Ongoing Monitoring: Regularly reviewing customer accounts and transactions to detect suspicious activity and ensure the customer’s information remains up-to-date. 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: When the customer rates higher risk requirements, then additional steps are taken to ensure identity and monitor activity. 
 
<p>By adhering to KYC and EDD regulations, organizations can protect their business, maintain regulatory compliance, and contribute to the global effort against financial crime.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between Customer and Enhanced Due Diligence? 
<p>Customer Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence are both part of the broader KYC framework, but they differ in their scope, depth, and application. Here is a summary of the key differences between CDD and EDD:</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence: CDD is the basic level of due diligence that applies to all customers. It involves collecting and verifying the customer’s identity, understanding the nature of their business or activities, and assessing their risk profile based on geographical location, occupation, and transaction types. CDD is a standard requirement for all customers, regardless of their risk profile. 
 Enhanced Due Diligence: EDD is a more rigorous and comprehensive form of due diligence that applies to high-risk customers, transactions, or business relationships. For example, where CDD might call for official government documents verification, EDD might include videoconference or in-person interviews, identity verification, and more extensive background checks. 
 
 When Is Enhanced Due Diligence Called For? 
<p>Enhanced Due Diligence is required when a financial institution or other regulated entity identifies a high-risk customer, transaction, or business relationship. The need for EDD can arise from various factors or red flags indicating a higher potential for money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or other illicit activities.</p>
<p>Situations that may trigger the need for EDD include:</p>
 
 Politically Exposed Persons: PEPs are individuals who hold or have held prominent public positions, as well as their close family members and associates. These individuals are considered at higher risk for both corruption and blackmail. 
 High-Risk Jurisdictions: Countries with weaker AML or KYC laws might be prime targets for corrupted individuals that can sneak through CDD, and thus EDD may be called for. 
 High-Risk Industries: Some industries or business activities have a higher risk of money laundering or fraud. These include gaming and gambling, arms trading, government work, or esoteric and high-value art or real estate markets. 
 Unusual Transactions: Transactions unusually large, complex, outside typical jurisdictions, or without purpose are all red flags for EDD. 
 Regulations: Regulatory bodies may issue specific guidance or directives requiring EDD in certain circumstances or for particular categories of customers or transactions. 
 Reputation: Popular coverage of an individual, including any news of financial crimes or impropriety, can be grounds to enact EDD.

<p>In a scene from the 1980s hit movie Back to the Future, Marty (played by Michael J. Fox) does a rock guitar rendition at his parents 1950s high school dance. Leaving the crowd puzzled, he closes by saying, “you might not be ready for this yet, but your kids are going to love it.” As we look back at the evolution of hardware security modules (HSMs), innovative features have come as a result of changing security needs, and some have taken time to be widely adopted. Since their inception, HSMs have underpinned many of the technologies we now take for granted, and as they continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly play a key role in protecting the new technologies that we will depend on in the future.</p>
<p>This blog post examines how processing speed, robust security, the ability to securely run applications, deployment options, and support for strong quantum-resistant algorithms will continue to make on-premises and cloud-based HSMs indispensable components of enterprise cybersecurity strategies for generations to come.</p>
<p>A look back</p>
<p>On-premises HSMs have been around for decades, providing a root of trust to protect and manage underpinning cryptographic keys used for encryption and signing processes. They have often been perceived as mysterious devices sitting in back offices and data centers, working behind the scenes to protect everything from sensitive data to software downloads. HSMs have evolved over the years to meet the changing needs of the security landscape; most notably their design has addressed scalability, tamper protection, and ease of use and integration with the applications they support. Tamper-proofing has enabled HSMs to detect attempts to physically access or modify them, making it virtually impossible for attackers to get to the sensitive keys they store. Other aspects of their evolution have included performance improvements and support for new symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to stay up to the latest standards.</p>
<p>As the need for stronger cryptographic security grew, HSMs became more sophisticated, adding feature capabilities such as on-board secure execution that enabled complete sensitive applications to run inside their protected certified boundary. With the recent migration to cloud-based deployments, the traditional on-premises HSM model has also been transformed. Cloud-based HSM-as-a-service models are now available, offering enterprise customers the ability to consume cryptographic services without having to own and maintain the physical HSMs.</p>
<p>Today’s environment</p>
<p>A fast-paced digital environment requires organizations to process data quickly and securely. High-performance, crypto-agile HSMs provide rapid processing speeds and support for multiple hashing mechanisms and encryption algorithms. Today’s HSMs can also be configured to support custom algorithms, making them versatile for enterprises that require high levels of security and flexibility. As the need for data security continues to grow, the importance of high performance and cryptographic agility will continue to increase, making HSMs a valuable investment for enterprises that need to keep up with the latest security standards.</p>
<p>Modern HSMs also increasingly find themselves in use cases beyond traditional cryptography. These include securing more advanced applications such as blockchain, secure storage for sensitive data in cloud computing environments, and 5G cellular communications where security has been stepped up due to known vulnerabilities and potential man-in-the-middle attacks. With the rollout of 5G networks, hybrid symmetric/asymmetric algorithms, designed to validate user identity and to protect against unauthorized access, authenticate exponentially growing number of subscribers and devices. Running these algorithms within the tamper-resistant environment of an HSM has become critical for the security of these rollouts. Typically offered as certified devices, HSMs have also evolved to meet the changing needs for compliance to regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The quantum threat</p>
<p>The increasing prevalence of quantum computing poses a new threat to the security provided by HSMs. Quantum computers have the potential to break many of the cryptographic algorithms (specifically asymmetric algorithms including elliptic curves) that are commonly used to secure data today. Because quantum computers can solve problems that had been considered intractable for classical computers, such as factoring large integers and solving discrete logarithm problems, the need to ensure that HSMs are ready for a post-quantum world is increasingly top of mind for many organizations.</p>
<p>To address this threat, new algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers are <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">already in development</a> under the leadership of the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
<p>Way forward</p>
<p>In Back to the Future, the crowd at the dance was not yet ready for the future, but Marty was already ahead of the times. Having a unique perspective can make all the difference when it comes to preparing for evolving challenges. Today, organizations need to make the most of new revolutionary technologies such as cloud, blockchain, and others, while ensuring that their sensitive data stays safe and secure.</p>
<p>With the right security strategy and solutions, organizations can chart a secure future that addresses the performance, certifications, and cryptographic agility needs for today and tomorrow. The newly launched Entrust nShield 5 builds on the proven nShield HSM capabilities to provide enhanced performance, compliance with the latest Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-3, certification expected Summer 2023) cryptographic robustness requirements, secure execution, and support for the new NIST-shortlisted quantum-resistant algorithms.</p>

 Here’s what crypto asset service providers need to know about the newly ratified MICA crypto regulatory framework. 



 



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">MiCA</a>) regulation, which received a majority 517 votes from European Parliament lawmakers in favor of the crypto licensing regime in April 2023, aims to protect investors and preserve financial stability, while allowing for greater innovation in the crypto asset sector. MiCA is also likely to attract operators and users to the market, as it is the first regulatory framework for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) at EU level. &nbsp;</p>



 What is the meaning of MiCA?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA is a regulatory framework for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/crypto-currency/">crypto assets</a> traded on digital platforms. It covers three types of crypto assets: Utility tokens, which provide access to goods or services;- payment tokens, which are used as a means of payment or can be traded for other MiCA-regulated tokens; and e-money tokens, which are backed by fiat currencies and used to make electronic payments.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the main objectives of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has established rules for the issuance, admission to trading, and operation of crypto assets, as well as requirements for the providers of crypto asset services. The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) has been set up to specifically promote cooperation between member states on blockchain technology.</p>



  Provide legal certainty for crypto assets that are not covered by current European financial regulation;  



  Bring all crypto-asset issuers and crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under one regulatory&nbsp;licensing&nbsp;framework;  



  Replace current national regulation for crypto-assets&nbsp;that are&nbsp;not covered by European regulation;  



  Create a specific regulatory framework for stable coins.  



<blockquote><p>Regulations will still need to be enforced&nbsp;by competent authorities designated by each member state,&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;overseen by&nbsp;both the&nbsp;European Securities and Markets Authority&nbsp;and the European Banking Authority. MiCA and TRF will add greater transparency to the crypto space, and the aim is to reduce risks the market, the overall economy, and future investments.</p>Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of MiCA?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA has a number of benefits, including better regulatory clarity for CASPs in the EU, improved investor protection, enhanced financial stability, and the promotion of innovation. MiCA will also make it easier for member states to cooperate on blockchain technology, as the EBP will provide a forum for discussion and exchange of best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MiCA will impact all CASPs offering services to clients in the EU. This includes exchanges, custodian wallet providers, issuers of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and other CASPs. MiCA will not apply to persons who buy or sell crypto assets for their own account.</p>



 What does this mean for non-European crypto service providers?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will not apply to non-European crypto service providers unless they target EU investors or offer their services in the EU. However, national competent authorities in the EU may require non-European crypto service providers to obtain a MiCA authorization if they provide cross-border services into the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses.</p>



 



 

 



 



 How will MiCA play into AML regulation?&nbsp; 



<p>MiCA will complement the EU’s existing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD)</a> by providing a specific regulatory framework for crypto-assets. MiCA will require CASPs to put in place <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML measures</a>, such as Customer Due Diligence and reporting of suspicious transactions. MiCA will also allow national competent authorities to exchange information on suspected money laundering or terrorist financing activities involving crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MiCA regulation is a welcome development for the crypto industry as it brings more clarity to the regulatory landscape and protects investors from financial losses. However, CASPs will need to ensure that they comply with MiCA’s rules and requirements when they come into effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Commission also needs to implement further acts to specify certain technical requirements for MiCA-regulated activities. It was ratified by the European Parliament in April 2023, and is expected to come into effect by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CASPs are recommended to stay up to date with MiCA, and consult with a legal advisor to ensure they remain compliant.</p>

<p>Learn how we set out to build a plugin for musicians and ended up creating a progressive file system that grows with the user's needs.</p> Ditto <p>Our Fissioneers love pushing the boundaries of the <a href="https://odd.dev/">Webnative SDK</a> to unlock new features and use cases. Recently, engineers Brian and Andy did just that with Ditto. </p><p><a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/ditto">Ditto</a> is a VST delay plugin. Users can create their own delay presets in the app and use the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion</a> web app to share and collect Ditto presets.</p> Elementary <p>Ditto uses <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/">Elementary</a>, a JavaScript framework and high-performance audio engine that makes developing audio plugins using web technologies easier. </p><p>Ditto uses the <a href="https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/plugin-renderer"><code>@elemaudio/plugin-renderer</code></a>, which runs a web app in WebView inside of a VST binary. The WebView gives us a browser environment where we can run Webnative. This makes development much more accessible because you don't need to know C++ - only JavaScript.</p><p>Here is the Ditto plugin loaded into Bitwig Studio:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/6/6f3036f4dd375f4551bc0fad11ec0a7dc8975c66.jpeg"></a> Preset Manager <p>Audio plugins typically have a system for saving presets, which captures plugin state and metadata about the preset. We implemented presets in Ditto that store plugin state, notes, tags, and favorite status:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/750a2700e7adda90112770ccfc621218141bf319.jpeg"></a><p>The presets interface is organized by categories, including All, Favorites, and categories automatically generated from preset tags.</p> Progressive File System Enhancement <p>Plugin users expect plugins to store presets without signing into an account. To match those expectations, our first experiment with Ditto was to implement a local-only file system that does not require sign-in and an optional synced file system that requires an account. When a user decides to create an account, their presets are copied from the local-only file system to a file system associated with a username and persisted to Fission IPFS nodes.</p><p>Each file system is associated with an app namespace to keep them separate in browser storage. We determine which file system to use by checking whether the user has created an account.</p><p>In application programming, we're often trained to think about how we will serve users now and how we want to serve them down the line. We build the infrastructure to allow us to introduce new planned features without creating more work for us later on. </p><p>This is sensible, but what if, as a developer, you want to ship your minimum viable product now, gather feedback, and then add syncing and sharing later? &nbsp;</p><p>Users are also tired of signing up for endless platforms, not knowing if it will be the right tool for them. Why not give them the option to get hands-on with the tool first, and if/when they decide to access more features, you ask them to make an account (a password-less one, of course!)?</p><p>Building using a progressive file system not only reduces the scope of an MVP, it also removes a common barrier to adoption!</p> Connecting to Ditto Companion <p>When the user is ready to go beyond the local-only file system, they can create an account and connect to the <a href="https://long-round-glass-crow.fission.app/">Ditto Companion app</a>.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/adcd97c9b813df99d7764181ee528fd76c187b82.png"></a><p>First, they create a username and select "connect." Then they are given a QR code and a connection link. </p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/e/eade68717a724783a861afe9a16929749f5d6ca1.png"></a><p>The QR Code and connection link open Ditto Companion and use the AWAKE protocol to begin device-linking.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/a/a3593ae2830f971552ba340092d99d3ee60f0908.jpeg"></a><p>The user enters the code shown in Ditto Companion into Ditto:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/4/4e1c83397d3afb9650b15807a2363befcbef6e71.png"></a><p>After entering the code, Ditto shows the user a message confirming they have connected with Ditto Companion:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/5/55ea0bcdd6e46b7c6917cdddf0b6e922d893cb6a.png"></a><p>The user can connect again later if they would like to connect to another browser or device.</p> Namespaces <p>The Ditto plugin and Ditto Companion use distinct app namespaces. However, by using UCAN authorization and transmitting the user's WNFS encryption key, the Ditto Companion app shares the synced file system with the Ditto plugin.</p><p>Having multiple namespaces also makes it possible for users to work on several apps locally. It used to be that you could only work on one app at a time on <code>localhost:8080</code> for example, but namespacing puts them each in their own box, so to speak, and you can switch from one app to another without thinking about it.</p> Sharing and Collecting Presets <p>As mentioned earlier, Ditto Companion is a web app for sharing and collecting presets.</p><p>We started Ditto Companion from the <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Webnative App Template</a>. Our connect flow is simplified compared to the complete feature set provided in the template - we only link from the plugin to the companion app. This simple model meant we could remove quite a bit from the template for our use case.</p><p>Our second experiment was to implement a lightweight share and collect system in the companion app. Shared presets are stored in the public WNFS tree. Presets that are not shared are in the private tree. Users share presets in the companion app:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/c/c3a03525569c3c68a608cf2fb3671291cbac2ce7.png"></a><p>They can also collect shared presets from other users. After selecting the plus button, they enter the username they want to collect from:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/7/7886e573933b43872414af9ef280fbc27fa30653.jpeg"></a><p>Ditto Companion then checks whether a file system exists for the user. If a file system exists, we get a link for the public tree and check for a presets directory.</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1488b82f4087b4e340dab4bdca22161489701740.jpeg"></a><p>If presets are found, we add them to the Collect tab:</p><a href="https://talk.fission.codes/uploads/default/original/2X/1/1367134c2e5dcb7e7ab91dcedc93ba475254f38f.png"></a><p>Users collect presets by checking the Collect checkbox for the preset. Collected presets are copied into the user’s file system, and the user can load them in the plugin after a refresh.</p><p>This sharing mechanism is very exciting because it searches for and scans public IPFS data and saves it to the user's file system, adding a level of interactivity to non-blockchain-based decentralized web apps. And because users can move their data to any Webnative-enabled app, there are many opportunities for collaboration and remixing of data.</p> <p>Here is a full walkthrough of Ditto and Ditto Companion:</p><p>What do you think of Ditto? Are you building an app that would benefit from a progressive file system?

				<p>This post is a technical guide on how to connect a database to a W3C verifiable credential issuance workflow with the Trinsic SDK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many existing companies who build IDtech products look for a way to get user data from a database into a verifiable credential format. Since we’re still early in verifiable credential adoption, tactics like issuing credentials from a database are great for kickstarting an ecosystem and giving users valuable credentials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll outline six steps below (including relevant JavaScript code snippets) for how you can export data from a database and issue it to a user as a verifiable credential.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 6 Steps for Issuing Verifiable Credentials From a Database 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				 
 	 Identify your data source 
 	 Create a credential template in the Trinsic dashboard 
 	 Set up the Trinsic SDK 
 	 Query the data from the database 
 	 Transform the data into a JSON that maps to the credential template 
 	 Issue and send credentials to the user wallets 
 					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Identify Your Data Source 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In this scenario, imagine you have a small group who have signed up for an event, and you’d like to issue them a verifiable credential to use as their event ticket. We have a very simple database with five users, each with four attributes that looks something like what is shown below. You’ll need to be able to query this database.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 
		 
			
				   Email      Name      Age      Allergies

			 Create a Credential Template 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the <a href="https://dashboard.trinsic.id/ecosystem/templates">Trinsic Dashboard</a>, you can create a simple <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/learn/concepts/templates/">template</a> that includes:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Name  Email  Age  Allergies  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make sure the credential template fields map to the information that is in your database. Once your credential template is created, you’ll need to refer to the <code>templateId</code> in a future step.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Set Up the Trinsic SDK 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Call the Trinsic service so you can seamlessly sign and issue credentials once you’ve exported and formatted the data. In this scenario, you will be using the issuer auth token.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Query the Data From the SQLite Database 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>You’ll write a short script that queries your database. In our example we’re using a SQLite database and have written some JavaScript shown below:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Transform the Data Into a JSON That Maps to the Credential Template  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Then we loop over each row of user information, storing each property in &nbsp;<code>credentialValues</code>&nbsp; that corresponds with the credential template we previously defined. In the next step this JSON blob will be signed and become a verifiable credential.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Issue and Send Credentials to the User Wallets  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Once &nbsp;<code>credentialValues </code> is set, we call &nbsp;<code>issueFromTemplate</code>,&nbsp; referencing the&nbsp; <code>templateId</code>. This call returns a signed credential.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The signed credential can now be sent to a user’s wallet. Even if a user doesn’t have an existing wallet, you can send it to their email, allowing them to access a credential without needing to download a new app or create a new username and password.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 				<code>
					
				</code>
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Conclusion 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As you can imagine, there are many edge cases that may complicate this process. In future walkthroughs we could explore issuing credentials from a CSV file, or issuing credentials to identifiers other than emails, or any other situations that you would find valuable.

<p>Why it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity.</p>
<p>The most common MFA authenticators are vulnerable because they do not have a proximity-based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p>The cybercrime marketplace of offering stolen credentials to enable access-as-a-service attacks continues to dominate the <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/sale-of-stolen-credentials-and-initial-access-dominate-dark-web-markets">market with a 6 fold increase in number of credentials stolen by malware</a>.</p>
<p>Passwords as the single factor of authentication has become a thing of the past and many security conscious organizations have now adopted multi-factor authentication (MFA) as the standard. MFA incorporates the use of multiple factors when authenticating a user, such as knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has).</p>
<p>However, as the threat landscape grows we have seen from <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/uber-breach-external-contractor-mfa-bombing-attack">recent cyber-attacks</a> in the news that MFA is no longer enough to prevent breaches from account takeover (ATO) attacks. In addition to username passwords, attackers are also gathering contextual information such as browser version and geographical information to enable MFA bypass attacks. Some common MFA-based attacks are the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_swap_scam">SIM swap attack</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2022/09/vulnerable-mfa-mfa-prompt-bombing/">MFA prompt bombing</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-aitm-phishing-attack/">Adversary in The Middle</a>&nbsp;(AiTM). These attacks are getting more sophisticated and successful at breaching an organization’s defense.</p>
<p>Why physical proximity should be a required MFA factor</p>
<p>As seen in most of the attacks that overcome MFA, these attacks are launched remotely and are able to bypass MFA controls in place. Having a requirement of physical proximity as a required factor for MFA, in addition to the other factors of knowledge (something a user knows), inference (something a user is), and possession (something a user has) helps protect against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>If we look at some of the most common MFA authenticators, we can see that most of these are vulnerable as they do not have a proximity based factor as a requirement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, high assurance PKI-based mobile smart credential login, FIDO2 keys and passkeys (FIDO2 multi-device credentials) all require physical proximity as a requirement to authenticate a user. In addition, these authenticators eliminate the use of passwords, instead using the concept of cryptographic key pairs to authenticate a user.</p>
<p>Consider PKI based mobile smart credential and passkeys below:</p>
<p>PKI based mobile smart credentials – This high assurance <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passwordless&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhEQAU">passwordless authentication</a> works by installing a digital smart credential on a user’s smartphone transforming their smartphone into a trusted device. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udGrvxPWW4k">When a user wants to authenticate to a device</a> such as a laptop, desktop or other workstation and are in close physical proximity to this device, they are prompted to authenticate themselves using biometrics on their smartphone, with the mobile smart credential. Once authenticated with biometrics, they gain access to the laptop or desktop and can also gain access to all apps and accounts using single sign-on capabilities. When they walk away from their laptop or desktop, they are automatically logged off. The process of triggering authentication on the user’s smartphone happens via Bluetooth, ensuring the user in close physical proximity to the device they are logging on to, protecting against remote based ATO attacks.</p>
<p>Passkeys – <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passkeys?utm_source=CSO-Online&amp;utm_medium=ext-site&amp;utm_campaign=Mar23-IAM-Passwordless-CSO-Blog-Link&amp;utm_content=Passkeys&amp;edc_sfid=7015Y0000044VhFQAU">Passkeys</a> let you sign in or log on to applications and services without passwords or even usernames if configured that way. They are digital credentials in the form of cryptographic key pairs, with the public key stored on the application server and a private key stored on your device that can be accessed via biometrics authentication on your device. Using passkeys to log in to applications and services make it seamless and easy to use, just like you would unlock your phone with Face ID or other biometrics. When a user tries to log in to an application, the application issues a security challenge to the user’s registered device via Bluetooth. The user is then prompted to authenticate via biometrics to accept the sign-in request, which is signed with the private key on the user’s registered device and sent back to the application to be verified with the corresponding public key, after which the user is signed in if successful.</p>
<p>The above high assurance authenticators combine the best of both worlds – MFA and passwordless and utilizes cryptographic key pairs and proximity factor to ensure a phishing resistant and seamless user experience for users to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve moved on from plain passwords to MFA and the bad actors have also caught up to finding ways to beat the traditional MFA configurations, it’s time to move to high assurance passwordless MFA with physical proximity as a required factor.</p>

<p>In this latest episode within the Identity Story Series, Ann Cavoukian, creator of Privacy by Design and Katryna Dow, CEO at Meeco, join Oscar to explore the road to becoming ISO 31700 for Privacy by Design. They discuss the importance of Privacy by Design and how it can help organisations protect their customers’ personal data and comply with data protection regulations and the impact of Privacy by Design becoming an ISO Standard.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy.” ~ Ann Cavoukian</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Ann Cavoukian is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts. Dr Cavoukian served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada. There she created Privacy by Design, a framework that seeks to proactively embed privacy into the design specifications of information technologies, networked infrastructure and business practices, thereby achieving the strongest protection possible. In 2010, International Privacy Regulators unanimously passed a Resolution recognising Privacy by Design as an International Standard. Since then, PbD has been translated into 40 languages! In 2018, PbD was included in a sweeping new law in the EU: the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Dr Cavoukian is now the Executive Director of the Global Privacy &amp; Security by Design Centre. She is also a Senior Fellow of the Ted Rogers Leadership Centre at Ryerson University, and a Faculty Fellow of the Centre for Law, Science &amp; Innovation at the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.</p>

<blockquote><p>“One of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards.” ~ Katryna Dow</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Katryna Dow&nbsp;is the founder and CEO of&nbsp;Meeco; a personal data &amp; distributed ledger platform that enables people to securely exchange data via the API-of-Me with the people and organisations they trust. Katryna has been pioneering personal data rights since 2002, when she envisioned a time when personal sovereignty, identity and contextual privacy would be as important as being connected. Now within the context of GDPR and Open Banking, distributed ledger, cloud, AI and IoT have converged to make&nbsp;Meeco&nbsp;both possible and necessary.</p>

<p>For the past three years, Katryna has been named as one of the Top 100 Identity Influencers. She is the co-author of the blockchain identity paper ‘Immutable Me’ and co-author/co-architect of Meeco’s distributed ledger solution and technical White Paper on Zero Knowledge Proofs for Access, Control, Delegation and Consent of Identity and Personal Data.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Today we’re happy to bring you a new episode of our Identity Stories Series. Privacy by Design has just become an ISO standard, which we want to celebrate, so let’s go back in time and hear moments of this journey.</p>
<p>Let’s first hear from Privacy by Design’s creator herself, Dr Ann Cavoukian. She is recognised as one of the world’s leading privacy experts and she served an unprecedented three terms as the Information &amp; Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Dr Ann Cavoukian welcome back to Let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Ann Cavoukian: Thank you so much Oscar. It’s a pleasure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Use a time machine and bring us to the moment in which you started writing Privacy by Design.</p>
<p>Ann: We’ll have to go back to the nineties. So, I was first appointed Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, and I think ‘97. And when I was appointed commissioner, I joined the office, which consisted of brilliant lawyers, and they took, of course, a legal approach to protecting privacy, applying the law after a privacy harm had arisen.</p>
<p>But you see, I’m not a lawyer. I’m a psychologist. I took a very different view of how we should protect privacy in addition to legal means. I wanted something that would prevent the privacy harms from arising. I wanted to have a model of prevention that was proactive, baked into the code, baked into your operations, so that ideally, we can have fewer privacy infractions and data breaches.</p>
<p>And this is a very different approach to the legal one. So literally at my kitchen table over three nights, I created Privacy by Design, and then I took it in, and I sold it to my lawyers. And it didn’t take long, but it was a different approach. And I said, look, this will complement regulatory compliance, which is after the fact, applying a privacy law, after a privacy harm has arisen.</p>
<p>That’s very, very valuable. But I want ideally to minimise the number of privacy harms that arise. And that’s what Privacy by Design is all about. So, they got that. It was a win-win and they liked it. And away we went. And Privacy by Design has grown dramatically since then. It’s been translated into 40 languages. We’ve had great success with it.</p>
<p>Oscar: How was the whole journey since that time until now, 2023? Has the road to becoming an ISO standard been a bumpy road?</p>
<p>Ann: It’s always a bumpy road, there’s no question. But I had great fortune. I was very lucky in 2010. Privacy by Design was unanimously passed as an international standard by the International Assembly of Privacy Commissioners and Data Protection authorities in Brussels. So immediately in the privacy community, it grew enormously. And then when, the new law in the European Union, the General Data Protection regulation, was introduced or came into effect in 2018.</p>
<p>My Privacy by Design was included in the GDPR as well as privacy as the default, which is the second of seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design. This was huge. It being recognised like that was just such a huge development and it took hold globally because everyone around the world wants to do business with Europe and engage in business and trade with the European Union.</p>
<p>So, lots of countries started doing Privacy by Design. And whenever there was a new law that was developed, a privacy law like Brazil last year, they included Privacy by Design in it. So, it really took off. So, when ISO started considering including it as an international standard, that took years in the making. I mean, it just came into effect this year.</p>
<p>But my colleague Michelle Chibba, who’s amazing, I mean, she’s been sitting on committee meetings for the past, I don’t know, three, four or five years with ISO in, in an effort to make Privacy by Design an ISO standard. But we succeeded and that’s the whole thing. It is now an international standard, ISO 31700. And it’s all over the world.</p>
<p>It’s already becoming embraced by countries who recognise the value of ISO standards. So literally, I’m delighted by this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. I can hear your, your voice of success when you are sharing this journey. And congratulations for that, of course.</p>
<p>Ann: Thank you.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: If you were wondering what are these ‘7 principles’, let’s hear now Dr Ann Cavoukian explaining the 7 foundational principles of Privacy by Design.&nbsp;Starting with Principle #1 Proactive not Reactive.</p>
 
<p>Ann: The first one ‘prevent the harms. You want to be proactive so that you could prevent the harms from arising. It’s very, very clear.</p>
<p>The second one is privacy as the default setting. And that’s– I talked about that quite a bit. It’s absolutely critical, in fact, it’s considered to be so important. When they enacted the GDPR in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation, they included not only my Privacy by Design, but specifically privacy as the default setting as well. So that’s very important.</p>
<p>The third one embedded in design is absolutely critical. If it’s not baked into the code into your operations, it’s going to be overlooked.</p>
<p>The fourth one you have to have, what I always say full functionality. Get rid of the zero-sum mindset of privacy versus security, or privacy versus data utility. It can’t be either, or, win, lose. It has to be win-win, privacy and data utility. You make a positive sum, and you get multiple positive gains, privacy and security always intertwined.</p>
<p>And the next one talking about security. While the term privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections and security alone, in this day and age of daily hacking and phishing, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end, with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, start with a solid foundation of security throughout your entire organisation.</p>
<p>Give individuals access to their own data. I always say to companies and governments, you may have custody and control of someone’s data, but it doesn’t belong to you, it belongs to the data subject. So, give them the right of access that they have, allow them to gain access to personal information you have on them. And companies actually have come back to me, companies that are certified for Privacy by Design, and they say, “We love this. We love this principle. Because once we give customers access to their own data, they come back to us and say – No, no, that’s no longer the case. That was true about me two years ago, here’s what’s going on now.” So, they correct the information. They increase the accuracy of the information we hold. And it increases the quality of the data we have. So, they love it.</p>
<p>And the last principle, keep it user centric. When you keep it focused on the user, all of this flows out. Because it should all be around the individual, when it’s personal information you’re dealing with. Because personal information is about identifiable individuals. So, you have to keep it focused on the user, and what they permit, what they don’t permit, things of that nature. So that’s it. Seven foundational principles by design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Despite all the recognition that Privacy by Design has received for two decades, and the influence it has had in regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, we saw that the vast majority of Internet products and services still didn’t use the seven foundational principles. An urgent push was necessary. What would help us make waves of such magnitude? Nothing better than a global standard published by the International Organisation for Standardisation, the ISO.</p>
<p>ISO standards are recognised by governments, regulatory bodies, and industry associations around the world, so becoming an ISO standard would increase the adoption of Privacy by Design and it would be recognised globally. It is not easy to become an ISO standard, with thorough review processes including, expert opinions, public consultation, and a vote by ISO members.</p>
<p>On 2018, a technical committee called ISO/PC 317 Consumer protection: Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services was created. Four more years, and all the efforts of this group of motivated and brilliant minds from all over the world came to fruition. On February 8th, 2023, the standard was published with the name “ISO 31700-1:2023 Consumer protection — Privacy by Design for consumer goods and services”.</p>
<p>Let’s now hear from another guest a perspective of a tech entrepreneur who has been incorporating Privacy by Design in their products.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: We are welcoming back Katryna Dow, who is CEO and founder at Meeco. Hello, Katryna.</p>
<p>Katryna Dow: Hello. It’s nice to be back. Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Katryna, how has Privacy by Design influenced you?</p>
<p>Katryna: Well, I’m very privileged. If I think back to when Ann Cavoukian and the Canadian government were at the forefront of bringing the concept of Privacy by Design into the world. I was the recipient of an early Privacy by Design Ambassador Award and I think that was twofold.</p>
<p>One, because after reading about the principles of Privacy by Design, we immediately decided to bake those things into the development of Meeco as a product. So architecturally, to adopt them. And secondly, we were invited, around 2016, to submit a consultation to the Canadian government in support of Privacy by Design, and really in support of why it was important from a technology design perspective and actually how it could make a difference.</p>
<p>We all remember, a lot of this thinking was pre GDPR. This was kind of at the forefront of the concept of considering for citizens. Initially, Canadians and now all around the world, this idea of taking a principle of privacy and considering it in every aspect of the design of a product or service.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. And on your opinion, how has Privacy by Design influenced digital identity as an industry?</p>
<p>Katryna: So, I think it’s an interesting question about digital identity. Optimistically, I guess what we’ve seen with the advent and the evolution and the maturing of Self-Sovereign identity. At the heart of that are principles around human centred design and control. So, I think there are great parallels with Privacy by Design. However, if we step back and look at the whole digital identity landscape, I’m not sure that it has had a wide enough impact in the design of systems.</p>
<p>Certainly, large tech platforms or even some governments have not really thought about that human centred Privacy by Design, progressive disclosure, anchoring core part. And as a result of that, I think in the digital identity landscape, we have lots of really great systems and solutions, but they’re not always designed from a human centric or Privacy by Design point of view.</p>
<p>And I guess one topical example of that recently with the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk and then opening up Twitter blue for everyone and not having a proper process in place for verification or identity protection in any way. We all saw that. That was a very short-lived example of what happens if you don’t understand some of the foundation principles of identity privacy, and if you don’t design from that perspective of understanding, you want to in one way protect the individual, but another way to be able to open up that identity for authentication, authorisation or access to trusted parties in a progressive way.</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes that balance, we don’t see enough in the design of digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: If you have some final idea, you would like to share about Privacy by design?</p>
<p>Katryna: I think one of the things that we’ve noticed just recently, being involved in a community project, where privacy and security were acknowledged to be important, but not enough to slow down architecture and design. So, the desire was to be able to build something really quickly and get it out into the community.</p>
<p>And one of the really challenging things about privacy and security is if you don’t bake it in at the lower layers, if you don’t build that foundation, it’s really hard to go back and put it into a product or service afterwards. I sometimes think about building a house. You imagine if you, if you didn’t put down a strong foundation and you were building on sand and then you went back later and you wanted to try and reinforce that structure, it’s not impossible, but it’s costly.</p>
<p>It takes time and it creates all sorts of adjacent problems, particularly if you’re building a digital system. So, I think I would encourage people to think it may slow down architecture, it may slow down consensus, it may slow down the beginning of a project, but it means you can go much, much faster once you’re up and running. And it also means that you’ve not created technical debt, policy, debt, compliance, debt that you will have to circle back and address later on.</p>
<p>So, it’s definitely worth investing that time upfront and building on a strong foundation.</p>
<p>Oscar: I couldn’t agree more. There was an excellent analogy in the very visual analogy that help us understand the importance of Privacy by Design.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: The stories that Katryna Dow just shared with us might sound like we’re still in a sombre passage of this journey. But it shouldn’t surprise us. Designing Internet services is only getting more complex: tight deadlines, limited budgets, scarcity of technical experts, all this determines and shapes the outcome. And those new applications are built to help the lives of millions of citizens, students, patients, and people of all ages.</p>
<p>At this crossroads, how can we make sure that this ISO standard builds the required momentum so what we’ll see in the next years is an avalanche of services that really protect our privacy?</p>
 
<p>Oscar: So now that it has become an ISO standard, what is the impact of having Privacy by design an ISO standard?</p>
<p>Ann: I think the impact will be significant because you see we’re struggling right now at a time where surveillance is mounting steadily mounting on a daily basis. We need massive intervention to put the brakes on it. And with Privacy by Design, being recognised as an ISO standard, that will draw so much more attention to privacy, embedding it proactively into the design of your operations. Into AI, artificial intelligence. We have to embed privacy into this from the beginning in order for it to take.</p>
<p>And that’s why I’m so excited about the timing of this, because it will attract a lot of attention to privacy, and privacy forms the foundation of our freedom. If you want free and open societies, you have to have freedom. And this will help to preserve freedom. So, ISO standards, marrying with Privacy by Design. The sky’s the limit – privacy and freedom. </p>
<p>And also, privacy and security go hand in hand. While privacy subsumes a much broader set of protections than security alone in this day and age of massive phishing and ransomware attacks, and all this, if you don’t have a strong foundation of security from end to end with full lifecycle protection, you’re not going to have any privacy. So, you have to have privacy and security by design.</p>
<p>Oscar: No doubt. Is there something else you would like to tell or share?</p>
<p>Ann: And what I want to remind people is please don’t be alarmed by the odds. Meaning people say to me, you know, I tweet every morning, I have a large Twitter following and I tweet about the latest stories of the day. And someone invariably will come back to me and say, Lady, give it up. That ship has had sailed.</p>
<p>Privacy is dead. And I go back again. Another friggin ship. You don’t give up on privacy. You don’t give up on freedom just because the odds are small. They’re getting bigger. But you look at what is important to preserve. Freedom is the most important thing to me to preserve. I’m Armenian. I come from a background, in 1915, 1.5 million Armenians were killed.</p>
<p>It’s you don’t give up. You know, that’s the whole point. You always come back. You never give up on freedom. And so, I just urge people don’t be alarmed at the odds that it seems to be overwhelming that we can’t do this. Yes, you can. We can do this. We have to do this. We want to preserve freedom for ourselves, for our children, for the future. We must do this. So please stay with me and embed privacy into your operations.</p>
<p>And one last thing. If you do shopping, either online or in real stores physically, if you express an interest in privacy, you will get so much more protection. You can imagine I always ask what they’re going to do with my information. I’m at a store, they’re asking for my postal code or this or that, and I say, “Oh, and how will you be protecting my privacy?” The guy I’m dealing with doesn’t know, but he’ll go get the manager, and the manager will say, “Oh, you care about privacy. Here’s what we can do. Boom, boom, boom.” And immediately the protections go up.</p>
<p>So just express your interest in privacy and see how much more protection it will lead to. It’s a win-win.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Privacy is not only an Internet issue, a technology issue, it follows us everywhere we go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a kitchen table to an ISO standard, the world just saw how Privacy by Design arrived to this elusive, but crucial destination.</p>
<p>What’s our next milestone on this journey? The road that will come can be long and bumpy but as Dr Ann Cavoukian said, it’s never time to give up.</p>

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we are exploring the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. As always, we would welcome your comments and feedback so please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 2 (of 4): Zooming out: thinking about the transition constraints and responses in the context of the wider political economy <p>“If I were given one hour to save the planet, I would spend 59 minutes defining the problem and one minute resolving it.” — Einstein</p><p>In the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">first blog</a> of this series, we explored how using different filters can help us to identify the constraints (and related opportunities) that exist in relation to a just transition. In this next reflection we would like to shift our attention, to consider the wider socio-economic context in which the built environment is&nbsp;nested.</p><p>As we zoom out to the broader context, what does this signify for the dominant trends? What happens when we combine a requirement (or even desire) for using less energy with a financial system that is tethered to that same resource? How realistic is dematerialisation as a response to increasing resource pressures, when this kind of strategy flies in the face of the prevailing economic logic? Improving resource use efficiency in manufacturing processes might align with reducing costs, but simply leaving minerals in the ground and thus forgoing or delaying profits does not. However much we disagree with this worldview, economic value is a reality that we must explain and understand if we want to build effective strategies. It is easy to shrug our shoulders and make comments like ‘it’s just the way it is’ or ‘capitalism is the problem’, but what exactly do we mean when we make such statements? What are the dominant forces or dynamics that are holding this kind of logic in&nbsp;place?</p><p>In our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">previous blog</a> we highlighted a concern about excluding an inequality filter from our constraints analysis. We would therefore like to pick this up here, by exploring some system dynamics that are fundamental to holding the current imagined order¹ and crippling levels of inequality in place. When we use the term system dynamics, we are referring to patterns and forces that play out across multiple areas of the systems that we interact with (e.g., political, ecological, cultural, physical).</p> Two examples of powerful system dynamics that are driving increasing levels of inequality and volatility <p>There are many excellent resources that consider these types of dynamics in depth (we can recommend some focused texts if you would like to look into anything mentioned in more detail), but the following examples highlight some key drivers and practical illustrations of how they manifest in the built environment.</p>  The finance / power / inequality dynamic  <p>‘It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.’ — Henry&nbsp;Ford</p><p>The fact that most of the money used in our economy is essentially created out of thin air, by bankers tapping digital numbers into existence, has been well documented². Less well publicised however, is the link between the seemingly benign mechanism of money creation and rising housing inequality. A good example of how this occurs is the practice of quantitative easing (QE) that began in Japan and has been used extensively by the Bank of England, the ECB and the American Federal Reserve. QE involves a Central Bank creating new digital money and using it to buy back government and corporate bonds (IOUs). The idea behind this process is to reboot a sluggish economy by reducing interest rates and making it easier for people to take out loans. Irrespective of whether this actually works, the process also results in the value of bonds rising (as the supply of bonds decreases the value of those that remain goes up). It also causes a general inflation of asset prices, as investments in the stock and property markets are closely linked to the bond markets. In short, those who are already wealthy and own assets benefit from QE, whilst those that don’t fall further behind. For&nbsp;example:</p>  In the 12 years since the financial crisis where QE has been liberally deployed, UK house price increases have far outstripped the growth in wages, with the UK first time buyer house price to earnings ratio rising from 4.3 to 5.6 in the past&nbsp;decade³.  In August 2020 at the height of the first Covid lockdown, western economies slumped to levels beyond the crash of 1929, whilst the FTSE100 and S&amp;P500 rose dramatically. On the face of it this made no sense — how could share prices be rising when the entire global economy had been put into standby? The answer was that the newly created credit was predominantly lent to large corporations, who as they didn’t need the money, used it to buy back their own shares. These buy-backs inflated both the company share prices and the management bonuses that were linked to them⁴. Many of those bonuses were used to buy additional properties, thus creating further upward pressure on house prices and compounding existing housing inequalities.  <p>In both of the above examples, the prioritisation of investors and asset prices over businesses and livelihoods was not a decision taken by citizens on behalf of society. It was a judgement made by bankers on behalf of existing asset holders, that dramatically increased both social and housing inequalities across the continent.</p><p>2. The energy / debt / growth&nbsp;dynamic</p><p>In our view this is one of the most important drivers in our current global economic and ecological situation, with severe consequences for the just element of Europe’s decarbonisation challenges. We see this as a chain of interlinked factors that will ultimately lead to increased economic volatility, with potentially devastating consequences for the most vulnerable members of&nbsp;society:</p>  Firstly, GDP (a proxy for the sum of everything that is bought and sold in the economy) is currently 99% correlated to energy consumption, whilst the relationship to material use is more like 100%. This means that at current economic forecasts of 2–3% GDP growth per year, we will double our energy and material use every 25 years. It is important to note that many prominent economists such as Dianne Coyle⁵ and Thomas Piketty⁶ have provided robust challenges to GDP being used as a measure of societal progress at all. However, as GDP growth is currently still the dominant measure of economic success globally, its correlation to resource use remains a central consideration.  To date, absolute decoupling of GDP from energy on a global scale has not been achieved, despite dramatic technological and efficiency gains⁷. This is largely driven by a rebound effect (often referred to as Jevron’s Paradox), whereby improvements in technological efficiency result in increased demand and greater resource consumption overall⁸. A good example of this can be seen in improved refrigeration technologies, because as the price of fridges has decreased our overall use of them has escalated (the average garage now offers more refrigerated goods than a supermarket would have stocked in the&nbsp;1970s).  <p>The Jevons paradox for energy consumption in the EU-27, 1995–2019</p>European Environment Agency&nbsp;[<a href="http://Figure%201.%20The%20Jevons%20paradox%20for%20energy%20consumption%20in%20the%20EU-27,%201995-2019">EEA</a>]  An additional issue is the impact of new debt which creates a future claim on energy, as its creation is currently entirely decoupled from our physical reality. To clarify, the creation of new debt does not automatically lead to growth; without the accompanying strategies proposed by MMT proponents such as <a href="https://stephaniekelton.com/">Stephanie Kelton</a>, the creation of new money would simply result in inflation. Instead, the availability of credit (and its associated interest) creates a future need to generate income by producing a good or service. This in turn equates to a forward claim on the energy that will be required to bring it into being. Thus, despite finance itself being a system without biophysical boundaries, the physical claims coded into its creation are essentially a contract with the future of the&nbsp;Earth⁹.  The levels of debt relative to GDP have steadily increased globally over the last decade (debt is doubling c.8.5 years compared to 25 years for GDP), showing that we are already struggling to service existing debt with current economic activities. As energy and resource costs rise and the quality of energy available decreases this issue will be magnified, fundamentally threatening the legitimacy of the global financial system.  <p>What happens when the music stops and we can’t make good on those embedded energy claims? Who will be the losers? After the 2008 crisis it was the lower income mortgage holders and general taxpayers who took the hit. As energy becomes scarce and expensive how will the risks be allocated? If we fail to address people’s needs at a rapid and inclusive scale (for example by implementing a continent-wide equitable repurposing of vacant space) it will be the poorest citizens of Europe who suffer the most. Unless we can fundamentally shift the relationship between how we finance real estate and its intrinsic value to society, initiatives aimed at repurposing space and retrofitting existing homes will remain as marginal interventions.</p> Introducing the economic matrix framework <p>“Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own.” ― Donella Meadows, Thinking in&nbsp;Systems</p><p>Thinking about these kinds of dynamics in addition to the constraint filters, whilst trying to make anything happen day to day, can leave our heads spinning. It feels impossible to know where to begin or which thread to pull at first. For us at least it doesn’t feel humanly possible, so we have tried to create a framework to pull everything together. By doing so, we have of course been forced to simplify and use reductionist assumptions. We are aware of the irony of trying to illustrate complex systems by putting things into conceptual boxes. We would ask you to hold it lightly, taking what’s useful and leaving what’s&nbsp;not.</p><p>In designing this model we have drawn on extraordinary thinkers from diverse disciplines. If you are interested in exploring this work in more depth, then we wholeheartedly recommend the following: Professor Beinhocker’s <a href="https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk/files/Beinhocker-2020-Ontological-Frmwrk.pdf">Ontological stack</a>, Marvin Harris’s <a href="https://anthropology.ua.edu/theory/cultural-materialism/">Cultural Materialism</a>, <a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/media/">Daniel Schutemberger’s</a> analysis of our political economy, the International Futures Forum’s <a href="https://medium.com/activate-the-future/the-three-horizons-of-innovation-and-culture-change-d9681b0e0b0f">3 Horizons model</a> and of course Donella Meadows’ <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">Points to Intervene in a&nbsp;system</a>.</p><p>Part 1: framing our responses</p><p>The following 3 by 3 grid provides some prompts to think through how we can design responses to the different constraints, in the context of the systems we are working&nbsp;within.</p><p>On the vertical axis we have the different domains (or levels) of the system. We have summarised these into three umbrella domains to make it easier to visualise:</p>  The cultural suprastructure: this relates to the values, wisdom, spirituality, ways of being and ways of knowing that are dominant in our culture. This domain results in the collective sense-making of what it means to live a good life and it is this value system that then shapes the political and economic structures below.  Political &amp; economic domains (governance &amp; jurisprudence, finance &amp; investment, market logic and ownership patterns): these are the institutions and processes that determine how we organise society. They provide the system’s overall goals, rules, decision making structures, patterns of behaviour and information flows.  Physical domains (resource &amp; land use): The physical domains represent the material and ecological economies and ground the socio-economic and ontological domains in the systems’ biophysical reality.  <p>Across the horizontal axis we can start to think about specific constraints and responses:</p>  Constraints: these blocks can be viewed as physical (e.g. biodiversity, energy, labour, materials), structural (e.g. money creation, embedded inequality, private property rights) or psychological (e.g. failure of the imagination).  Systemic capabilities: to unlock and repattern the structural blocks, we will need to create new capabilities in the system. Examples could include democratising money creation, embedding beyond GDP metrics in national policy, creating a new material economy or reimagining land as a common&nbsp;asset.  Pathways: these are the practical tools and pathways that can be used to start building towards the systemic capabilities.  <p>Once we have identified a constraint, we can use the matrix to think more granularly about the implications for a just transition. To bring this idea to life we have worked through two potential strategies that were highlighted in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/laudes-x-dark-matter-labs-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-e76be0a9dfa5">Blog 1</a> of this series, to give examples at each intersection of the&nbsp;matrix:</p><p>(A) Consider a no (or low) build future: If we can’t build the required volume of low carbon homes, how can we intensify our use of existing&nbsp;ones?</p><p>This strategy suggestion was driven primarily by physical constraints; i.e. intensifying pressures on energy and material resources. It was also however in consideration of inflated land and asset prices, which are excluding increasing numbers of people from home ownership.</p><p>(B) Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we cannot feasibly mine or recycle the materials needed, how can we radically adapt the way that we use&nbsp;them?</p><p>Reducing our material throughput cannot be left to individual choice alone as people still have to live and operate in the existing system. Instead, we need to recognise the main factors that are holding a linear material economy in place, so that we can think practically about how they can be&nbsp;shifted.</p><p>Part 2: visualising the response pathways over different time&nbsp;horizons</p><p>A second step that we find helpful in looking for response pathways is to think about the desired capabilities over different timeframes. Some issues are immediately threatening and require rapid mitigation responses, whilst others will play out over the longer-term and invite us to think more tactically. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.internationalfuturesforum.com/three-horizons">IFF’s 3-Horizon model</a>, we have begun to think about these time-bound responses in three tranches, that intersect vertically through the system domains as shown in the following matrix:</p><p>Taking the example above of dematerialisation we can break the potential response pathways down by timeframe. For example, if we take the pathway of citizen engagement:</p>  A mitigation response to the cost of living and energy crisis might be to ask citizens to temporarily reduce their electricity consumption;  A more transitional approach may be to introduce wide scale citizen assemblies, to debate how to live better with&nbsp;less;  A transformational pathway could be to work towards a new form of democracy, where citizens’ views on limited resource use are continuously consulted using digital technologies.  <p>Or, if we are thinking about promoting a circular&nbsp;economy:</p>  An immediate response could be to provide easily accessible recycling facilities for household devices;  An example of a transitional initiative can be seen in France where they have introduced an obsolescence law, which requires manufacturers to comply with a repairability index¹⁰;  In terms of a transformational strategy, we could start thinking about a planetary level governance mechanism for total material use, to bring it back inside the earth’s carrying capacity.  Combing the the 3*3 grids to illustrate the full response&nbsp;matrix<p>We do not believe that each type of response will intersect with every level of the system. In some triage situations for example, the appropriate response may be limited to an immediate governmental intervention, such as imposing lockdowns during the Covid crisis. Furthermore, in categorising the pathways, we are not attempting to create a hierarchy of responses, or to prioritise transformational pathways over mitigation tools. In our view, we will need to think and act over multiple timeframes using diverse system leverage points. Our goal with this framework is to probe the problem space, to try and make different elements of the system easier to visualise and thus to interact with. We hope that by doing this we can begin to identify gaps in the existing response landscape, thus promoting flexible precision in the response pathways we choose to pursue. As always we would welcome your feedback and suggestions so that we can modify and improve this conceptual tool.</p><p>In our next Blog (3 of 4) we will introduce an emerging community of just transition practitioners, that we have had the privilege of engaging with during this project. This has been both a challenging and exciting journey, where we have embraced the idea of working out loud, using the framework introduced above to guide our work. We will endeavour to share what we have learned so far, together with areas of our analysis that require strengthening and developing.</p><p>The Dark Matter project team who co-authored this blog are Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs), Aleksander Nowak (Aleks@darkmatterlabs), Vlad Afanasiev (vlad@darkmatterlabs) and Indy Johar (indy@darkmatterlabs).</p><p>References:</p><p>(1) The ‘imagined order’ is a term used by the Oxford economist <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/events/new-economic-and-moral-foundations-for-the-anthropocene-with-prof-eric-beinhocker/">Eric Beinhocker</a> to describe a series of stories told by the elite to justify their position in&nbsp;society</p><p>(2) <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction">https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction</a></p><p>(3) <a href="https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region">https://www.nationwidehousepriceindex.co.uk/resources/ftb-hper-by-region</a></p><p>(4) <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?dfMaqQ">The future of the Left in Europe with Yanis Varoufakis | Ep.33’.

  What are the practical applications of DIDs?

 <p></p><p>You may know what a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">decentralized identifier (DID)</a> is or even how to generate one, but you may be wondering: what’s the point of yet ANOTHER way to identify myself? To get a better sense of the why behind decentralized identifiers, we’ll discuss the real problems society faces today when it comes to identity, and why DIDs are an enormous practical solution to a pervasive set of problems.</p> Identity<a title="Direct link to Identity">​</a> <p>Whether or not you consider yourself an “online” person, there are a million ways we currently identify ourselves. Do you have an email address? That’s an identity. A driver’s license? Another one there. A Twitter handle? An Instagram account? A phone number? Check, check, check. There are a seemingly incalculable number of ways we can be identified and reached in today’s day and age.</p><p>Today, however, our identities are deeply entangled with services and the companies that own them. Your Twitter handle, for example, is exclusive to Twitter - good luck trying to get the same username on Instagram. Want to view your text messages alongside your Facebook messages with a person? Not happening. Lastly, good luck trying to recover your data if your service of choice suddenly were to shut down. To put it even more simply, Bob may be able to say “hi my name is Bob” on one social network A, but the name “Bob” may be reserved on social network B, preventing him from claiming the same name or handle over there. Moreover, if Bob has been a long time user of music app A and decides one day to migrate to music app B, he’ll need to go through the painful process of migrating all his playlists and songs over to the new service.</p> The Data Problem and Solution<a title="Direct link to The Data Problem and Solution">​</a> <p>
So what’s the fundamental issue DIDs are trying to solve? Simply put, users don’t own their data - services do - and their identity is fragmented across a host of handles, cards, and more. Ideally, we’d have a single form of identification with strong authentication and deep ties to data ownership, rather than scattered identities, lost passwords, and data owned by someone else. All of these concerns are valid and, it’s important to note, not simply hype around a shiny new toy.</p><p>DIDs solve these problems by coming alongside something called a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Node (DWN)</a>. Think of DIDs as the identifiers that will allow you to have a truly universal single sign-on experience, while DWNs are a form of data storage that will permit you to own your data while simultaneously being able to use and enjoy all the same kinds of services you currently do.</p><p>DIDs are, as the name suggests, decentralized - so they’re inherently not controlled, operated, or regulated by a centralized authority like our current identifiers are. You can have as many DIDs as you’d like, but you can also have a main DID act as a controller for your other DIDs to help consolidate or partition data when needed, as well as enforce limitations when appropriate. The implications of both decentralization and a controller paradigm are enormous for a vast number of use cases.</p> Life, Decentralized<a title="Direct link to Life, Decentralized">​</a> <p>Consider this: Bob has a single DID that acts as his main identifier, but he wants to detangle his work and personal identities to avoid having everything come into the same inbox on weekends. He creates two new DIDs that are controlled by his main identity, and labels them as “personal” and “work.” All of his work emails, calls, texts, and notifications are connected to his work DID, and he can easily silence that noise come Friday night. He can still authenticate to all of those services and own all of that data through his primary DID since it’s the controller, but can also easily filter through his data since he’s filed his work things under a separate DID. On the personal side of things, Bob can sign up for new services every day without worrying about migration because he owns all of his data: the second he signs up for a new service, like a social network, he can grant that app access to the media stored on his DWN and that service can act as a presentation layer for his data. Even better, his employer can also act as a controller on his work DID, allowing them to enforce enterprise requirements while keeping completely siloed from his personal data.</p><p>In this paradigm, Bob doesn’t worry about remembering a million passwords or losing his data to a service. The new “password” for Bob’s life is access to his main DID, which is protected by his private keys that can be stored in a number of secure ways, including on a physical drive or in a secure digital wallet. Just as significantly, Bob can keep his personal and work lives separate while allowing there to be appropriate separations of authority over his different data silos.</p> Identity Reinvented<a title="Direct link to Identity Reinvented">​</a> <p>So why do you want a DID? Really, the question is, why do you want to shift to a Web5 paradigm? Because identity portability and data ownership are massive yet silent problems we deal with every day. And how will this shift happen? Through the proliferation and adoption of DIDs, the popularization of DID controller paradigms and DWNs, and the availability of mass-appeal wallets to enable secure usage of DIDs. The general public wouldn’t ever be expected to have a technical understanding of these concepts, but their proliferation will depend on new and existing apps integrating this tech and presenting it to consumers in an easily-digestable way. We don’t just have to limit ourselves to imagining using this design to separate personal and work life - we can use it to allow for advanced parental controls, role access, and more.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

<p>Authentication is a crucial part of any web application, as it verifies the identity of the user and controls access to protected resources. One popular authentication method is JSON Web Token (JWT), which allows for secure and scalable identity verification via stateless authentication.</p>
 What Is JSON Web Token Authentication? 
<p>JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is a stateless method of securely transmitting information between parties as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. It is often used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications and APIs.</p>
<p>In the authentication world, “stateless” means a mechanism in which the server does not maintain any session state between requests. In a stateless authentication system, each request is self-contained and includes all the necessary information to authenticate and authorize the user or entity. In the case of JWT authentication, this comes in the form of a token.<br>
A JSON token consists of three parts:</p>
 
 A Header containing information about the type of token and algorithms used to generate the signature. 
 A Payload containing the “claims” (ID and authentication verifications) made by the user that can include a User ID, the user’s name, an email address, and metainformation about the operation of the token. 
 A Signature, or cryptographic mechanism, is used to verify the token’s integrity. 
 
<p>Together, the header, payload, and signature make up the JSON Web Token, typically passed between the client and the server in the HTTP Authorization header or in the body of an HTTP request or response. The server can then verify the signature to ensure that the token is valid and has not been modified and use the information in the payload to authenticate the user.</p>
<p>Here’s how JWT authentication works:</p>
 
 User Login: The user provides their credentials (such as a username and password) to the web application or system for verification, which is transmitted to the authentication server. 
 Token Generation: Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JSON token containing critical information about the user and the authentication session. The server sends the token to the client for verification. 
 Token Storage: The client stores the token, usually in a cookie or purpose-marked local storage, and includes it in subsequent requests to the server. 
 User Verification: When the client sends a request to the application server, it verifies the signature in the token and checks the claims in the payload to ensure that the user can access the requested resource. 
 Server Response: If the JWT is valid and the user can access the requested resource. 
 Token Expiration: When the JWT expires, the client must obtain a new JWT by logging in again. 
 
<p>JWT authentication provides several advantages over traditional session-based authentication, including improved scalability and reduced server-side storage requirements. However, it is important to properly secure and manage JWTs to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
 What Are the Best Practices for Using JWT Authentication? 
<p>Generally speaking, there are best practices for when and when not to use JWT Authentication:</p>
 
 When to Use: JWT authentication can be useful in scenarios where the server needs to handle many requests and sessions or in stateless APIs. JWTs can simplify authentication by reducing the number of database calls required for session management and can be passed between microservices to maintain stateless communication. 
 When Not to Use: JWT authentication may not be suitable for applications where the payload contains sensitive information, such as payment details, that must be protected against unauthorized access. JWTs can also pose a security risk if not properly secured, as anyone with access to a valid token can access protected resources. In these scenarios, a session-based authentication mechanism may be more appropriate. 
 
<p>Additionally, there are always implementation best practices when you’ve decided to use the technology, including:</p>
 
 Use Strong Encryption: Choose a strong cryptographic signing algorithm, such as, RS256, to sign JWTs. Avoid using insecure algorithms or plaintext. 
 Keep Sensitive Data on the Server: Not include sensitive information in the token payload, such as passwords or credit card numbers. Instead, store this information server-side and retrieve it as needed. 
 Use Short Expiration: Set a short expiration time (around 15-30 minutes) for tokens to reduce the risk of a stolen token being used maliciously.. 
 Use Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTPS): Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. 
 Implement Token Revocation: Consider implementing token revocation to invalidate tokens that have been compromised or are no longer needed. 
 
 What Are Some Challenges to Avoid When Implementing JWT Authentication? 
<p>While there are some significant benefits in implementing JWT authentication, there are always assumptions and pitfalls to avoid. These include:</p>
 
 Storing Private Data in the Token: Even with encryption, passing sensitive data across authentication requests is not good practice and can result in compromised accounts. 
 Encryption Failures: Weak algorithms can open the JWT to attacks, such as signature forgery or token tampering. It’s best to use strong cryptographic signing algorithms, such as RS256. 
 Not Validating Tokens: Failing to validate token signatures or expiration times can allow attackers to use stolen or expired tokens to access protected resources. 
 Using Long or No Expiration: While it may be tempting to set long expiration times to reduce the frequency of logins and “improve” user experience, doing so can increase the risk of a stolen token being used maliciously.

<p>How can we overcome existing structural challenges to reach investment readiness for the long-term stewardship of Nature-based Solutions in&nbsp;cities?</p><p>During the past two years, TreesAI — an initiative of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and <a href="https://lucidminds.ai/">Lucidminds</a> — have been running a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a number of public and private stakeholders to collectively raise capital for delivering Nature-based Solutions in the city. This is our interim learning&nbsp;report.</p><p>How can public organisations and private companies co-invest in urban Nature-based Solutions? During the past two years, we have been developing a pilot alongside Glasgow City Council and a range of public and private actors (Scottish Water, FloodRe, Nationwide, Clyde Climate Forest, Scottish Flood Forum and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) to design and develop innovative processes and mechanisms to collectively channel capital for the delivery and long-term maintenance of urban Nature-based Solutions (NbS) — that reduce flood-related risks and generate environmental benefits in the Glasgow&nbsp;region.</p><p>Our pilot tests the hypothesis that public and private entities can co-invest in Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that strategically provide Natural Flood Management (NFM) and Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), enhancing the performance of grey infrastructure. Using NbS for flood management is essential in the context of the UK, with w<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-64866058">arming temperatures raising UK flood damages by 20%</a> and with <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/292928/geho0609bqds-e-e.pdf">1 in 6 properties in England being at risk of flooding</a> today. Beyond increased flood resilience, NbS can help cities and organisations adapt to various other climate-related risks (such as heatwaves) while hitting net zero and nature-positive targets while improving the health and well-being of both human and non-human dwellers.</p><p>Throughout the development of this work, we have observed that public and private organisations are aware and keen to explore possibilities for investing in NbS to tackle climate-related risks in cities. For example, water utilities are interested in using NbS to reduce risks in internal property sewer flooding; the (re)insurance sector is interested in reducing flood risk in properties and, lenders are interested in lowering long-term physical flood risks, which can cause property devaluation — while increasing investments in resilient and low carbon infrastructure assets that add to climate transition investment portfolios.</p><p>However, when it comes to execution, the reality of co-investing is more complicated. The challenges to funding adaptation are numerous: slow procurement and legal agreement processes to carry out transactions, a lack of technical skills and location-specific datasets to prove impact, along with a <a href="http://climatereadyclyde.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/10-Annex-3-Resource-Mobilisation-Plan.pdf">mismatch between capital expenditures and return</a>. In this interim report, we discuss the challenges, findings and learnings that we have come across during the development of the pilot and offer possible solution pathways that could allow similar pilots to scale across Scotland and the UK, creating a market for urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>In this first series of learning reports, we set out three macro-challenges &amp; learnings (i.e. the strategic issues in reaching co-investment). These are not comprehensive but are those that we have felt most keenly throughout the&nbsp;pilot.</p>  We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions.  We need novel public sector organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature.  We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature.  <p>In the following paragraphs, we outline the details of the above three learning outcomes.</p>Who could benefit from Nature-based Solutions (e.g. street trees, sustainable urban drainage systems) that provide Natural Flood Management? 1 | We need to develop new forms of financing practices and the supporting tech infrastructure to scale investments in Nature-based Solutions. <p>The capital gap required to tackle cities’ adaptation needs is huge — accounting for about £10 billion per year in the UK and approximately <a href="https://www.sniffer.org.uk/blog/closing-the-adaptation-finance-gap-in-scotland">£184 million a year in the Glasgow City Region alone.</a> However, the possible financial risks associated with not addressing this gap, and the subsequent negative feedback loops, dwarf this figure — for example as warned by Moody, cities’ <a href="https://impactalpha.com/bond-investors-are-getting-smarter-about-flood-risks-9af06bf7089a/">“credit rating will directly be tied to their flood prevention policies</a>”.</p><p>From innovative grants like the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/irns">Investment Ready Nature Scotland (IRNS</a>) and the <a href="https://www.nature.scot/funding-and-projects/firns-facility-investment-ready-nature-scotland">Facility for Investment ready Nature in Scotland (FIRNS)</a> grant schemes focused on supporting innovation and pilots, to institutions to support with first loss capital to support in taking on the risk of demonstrating the soundness of emerging business models. The UK Infrastructure Bank set out in this<a href="https://www.ukib.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-11/Natural-capital-discussion-paper.pdf"> discussion paper</a> its role across three target markets (of which water is one) and has recently committed <a href="https://highgrowth.scot/uk-infrastructure-bank-announces-first-natural-capital-transaction/">£12M to Highland Rewilding</a>, and natural capital was underscored in the <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/">Scottish National Investment Bank (SNIB)</a> <a href="https://www.thebank.scot/sites/default/files/2022-10/snib003-mission-report-2022-final-010422.pdf">mission&nbsp;report.</a></p><p>Getting NbS projects off the ground is as challenging as ensuring these thrive over their lifetime (i.e. avoiding greenwashing and over-crediting). If we want to ensure these interventions lead to a real impact, we need to provide financial contributions across the lifespan of projects. In the pilot, time and time again partners have stressed the importance of early-stage studies to find the most suitable intervention sites. This requires a level of analysis at the catchment level and is the only way to proceed with detailed planning on the local scale. Beyond this we hear time and again that, with budgets being cut, maintenance is one of the first types of funding that gets cut for the council — and so there is a reticence to invest in such visible&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Hence we need to be thinking about funding streams for various stages of the development of NbS: from strategic analysis, concept and detailed design, construction, maintenance &amp; monitoring of projects. For some of these stages, and especially in these early days of market development, foundational capital is&nbsp;key.</p>The figure above lays out the preliminary business model for TreesAI Glasgow&nbsp;Pilot<p>NbS are a different sort of asset class where returns will not be immediately, or comprehensively monetisable hence why a new Monitoring, Reporting &amp; Verification (MRV) strategy is so important.</p><p>Across the Pilot in Glasgow, we have run into some of the challenges underpinning our risk, forecasting and impact verification capacities. Currently, each organisation has their own modelling approach, which has been designed for specific purposes and is often built on proprietary software that is rarely interoperable. As levels of scale, granularity and calibration are dependent on uses, data can often not be extrapolated for shared endeavours like co-investing. These risk models are often black boxes that cannot be broken down to understand incremental improvements (for example outputs are risk ratings for properties) — whereas investing in nature requires an acceptance of a degree of uncertainty.</p><p>Beyond this, the lack of confidence in the ability of nature to provide ecosystem services often means that modelling consultants will (to be confident in their estimations) reduce the real impact potential — modelling trees as permeable surfaces rather than including their stormwater retention capacity from evapotranspiration. We need a modelling infrastructure to support common decision-making through open and Interoperable tools &amp; processes.</p><p>Over the past two years, we have been developing the tools and approaches to support the planning of NbS projects. Our team from Lucidminds have developed an open-source framework called <a href="https://greenurbanscenarios.com/">Green Urban Scenarios</a>, which uses agent-based modelling to assess potential impact across different scenarios — for more information see this <a href="https://lucidmindsai.medium.com/green-urban-scenarios-298d75b100b4">blog serie</a>s. We have recently kicked off a partnership with <a href="https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/digital-innovation/hartree-national-centre-for-digital-innovation/">HNCDI</a> to integrate these models through their geospatial discovery programme. Beyond this, we have also adopted the <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/guidances/impact-and-vulnerability-analysis-of-vital-infrastructures-and-built-up-areas">IVAVIA methodology</a> to develop a GIS-based tool to provide projects with a location-specific score based on the location’s risk profile. These have been built as a modular cloud-based platform that is intended to be plugged into a variety of organisations and contexts.</p><p>Modelling on its own, however, will not prove sufficient for investment to happen. As we have seen in the recent carbon credits scandals, natural capital markets require transparent monitoring &amp; verification processes — less we risk overselling them. This is a real problem expressed by public and private stakeholders: the lack of evidence &amp; processes to prove the performance of NbS. A stark reality is that a number of NbS projects have been built in Glasgow, none of which have received enough funding to be monitored in a detailed manner to understand their performance over time. From the design stage, we need discussions around intended benefits and methods and metrics to measure them, along with baseline monitoring to ensure they are accurately captured. However, there is a lack of standards &amp; monitoring methodologies, data-sharing practices and protocols, along with a lack of funding earmarked for post-construction activities (see above). We hope to continue co-building an MRV strategy and to start monitoring a number of sites to build evidence datasets to help decision-makers.</p><p>But to achieve this, we need to create the structures for collaboration across organisations…</p>Screenshot of TreesAI platform interface powered by Green Urban Scenarios and Location Based&nbsp;Scoring |2| We need novel organisational structures which enable innovative processes and methodologies to invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>Overcoming challenges in investing in urban NbS requires more than financial resources and technological solutions. The benefits of nature are many, and so too are the beneficiaries. Growing this nascent field requires a whole new set of skillsets within organisations, an overcoming of inter-organisational silos and partnership working between stakeholders.</p><p>Green finance for NbS is a nascent field, and stakeholders are only now starting to grasp how this could work. In order to participate in NbS (from design to implementation), stakeholders require specific technical expertise — for example, we found a need for hydrological modelling which is costly and time intensive. On top of technical skills, investing in NbS for stormwater management requires financial and operational competencies. For example, whereas implementing a piece of tried and tested grey infrastructure enables them to use known project management (for instance, with contractors they’ve already worked with), there is a lack of understanding around the costs and risks of delivering NbS. But it is not just in project delivery that skills are needed, organisations require an in-house understanding of cutting-edge technologies, financial instruments and constantly shifting policy contexts to accelerate their ability for delivering NbS. We support the proposal, within the Climate Ready Clyde Adaptation Strategy and Action Plan for a regional Adaptation Finance Lab — which is still at the concept stage — to support the development of many of the required&nbsp;skills.</p><p>There is a lot of learning that needs to be developed, and possibly integrating individuals with the right skills and background in public organisations could be of benefit, training existing employees or improving our collective capacity through partnership working.</p><p>Throughout our pilot major barriers to innovation have been 1) the misalignment, overlap and lack of implementation clarity between multiple formal and informal planning guidance being developed by different city departments or organisations (e.g. the Forest and Woodland Strategy developed by the planning department and a more informal tree development directive developed by the Parks and Gardens Department); 2) the lack of council leadership especially when it comes to treasury functions (e.g. such as the capacity to underwrite private capital investments and deploy existing budgets in innovative ways); and 3) the significant lack of decision-making capacity. In the public sector, hierarchical structures and lack of resources have meant that there are not enough decision-makers in the room and individuals lack the bandwidth to focus on making the transition possible to scale urban&nbsp;NbS.</p><p>The pilot in Glasgow is a stark reminder that co-investing in NbS requires dedicated capacities and clear decision-making lines in the governmental sectors to ensure policy alignment inter and intra-organisationally. We hope that local authorities can step up in creating the proper political structures to take decisions on green economy matters across relevant departments since they need a structure and relevant posts to make decision-making possible. The city of Edinburgh, for example, has changed its structure in order to bring a more efficient decision-making process around NbS and could be a potential example of integrating green economy matters across councils. At the same time, we are hoping to follow closely and work alongside the development of the new NPF4 and related workgroups that we hope will help unlock capacity and align existing plans across the region and where necessary co-develop novel local plans in a truly collaborative manner across organisations.</p><p>The Glasgow Metropolitan Strategic Drainage Partnership (MGSDP) is perhaps one of the many examples of place-based institutions that have struggled to achieve transformative results — for more information see the <a href="https://www.crew.ac.uk/publication/taking-collaborative-approach-water-sector-review-metropolitan-glasgow-strategic">CREW review</a>. While it has delivered a multitude of impactful projects across Glasgow, just a small number of NbS projects have been delivered through co-investment ( e.g. ERDF, Water Environment Fund, Nature Restoration Fund, Sustrans), but none have yet attracted private investment. In fact, the spatial scale of NFM is such that interventions need to be truly aligned at a sub-basin level to be successful (e.g. we have encountered examples where upriver flooding will have an impact on the flood zone regardless of the NFM intervention). Barriers include the misalignment of liabilities, incentives and timeframes of multiple stakeholders in the partnership, for example between the national water utility company and the local authority.</p><p>But it is not just public-private partnerships that are needed when intervening in the urban built environment, communities as those who live closest to the problem and solution must be involved from the outset. Benefits of doing so range from the importance of incorporating local needs, increasing social capital and stewardship, with trees lasting much longer when involving communities in their maintenance (which has been shown to reduce the mortality rate from 30% to 5%). However, partners who are co-designing and delivering projects on the ground have encountered the challenge of raising awareness of the benefits of such schemes, for example when a swale in a local park will take away a ‘neat-looking lawn’ or when a woodland preservation scheme was understood to worsen flooding ‘as that’s where the water was seen to be coming from’. However, this is only part of the story with the recently launched <a href="https://peoplesplanfornature.org/">People’s plan for Nature</a>, created by a citizens’ assembly, includes recommendations for national legislation concerning the “right to equitable access to nature” and for local government and NGOs to act on this by bringing more nature into urban&nbsp;areas.</p><p>Our pilot has tried to highlight and work across some of these challenges by building a new partnership that can test new modalities to collaborate across sub-basins (other similar examples are the <a href="https://missionpossiblepartnership.org/">mission possible partnership</a> or the <a href="https://www.common-wealth.co.uk/publications/public-common-partnerships-building-new-circuits-of-collective-ownership">Public-Common Partnerships</a>). We will continue to develop this new model, working hard to ensure the private sector is looped into the conversation and that local public institutions have the capacity to engage with&nbsp;them.</p><p>But without the enabling environment, these partnerships will not grow in hostile&nbsp;ground…</p>Governance structure of the TreesAI Glasgow Pilot Partnership |3| We need to build better market incentives, contracting &amp; regulatory frameworks for organisations to gain the practices, confidence and trust to co-invest in&nbsp;nature. <p>While there is increasing hype around investments in nature, private capital is still slow. This is in part due to the nascent nature of many of net-zero and nature-positive requirements facing the private sector with corporate boards only just beginning to integrate concepts like carbon accounting or consider biodiversity investment strategies (specifically in England &amp; Wales due to the legally mandated Biodiversity Net Gain, <a href="https://www.theplanner.co.uk/2022/04/10/biodiversity-enhancement-scotland-different-approach#:~:text=Unlike%20England%2C%20Scotland%20has%20not,national%20planning%20framework%20(NPF).">a version of which</a> Scotland will begin to consider). Beyond carbon and biodiversity, investing in nature with specific flood management outcomes is an even more nascent market. This is apparent through our pilot in Glasgow where public and private stakeholders are aware they should be making the transition to investing in NbS for flood mitigation, but current regulation does not address retrofitting through NbS to tackle flood risk and to justify investments through a clear business incentive. In this section, we set out three interventions we believe could support the development of this&nbsp;market.</p><p>Carbon and biodiversity are just two ecosystem services that require investment if we want to scale the transition and reverse losses to our natural environment. If we want to capture other vital ecosystem services (such as flood management &amp; temperature regulation) we need firstly standards specific to those services and secondly agreed to approaches for the stacking and bundling of multiple benefits to allow different sectors and industries to structure shared investments. This would support the generation of viable business models based on the parcelling out of the different benefits related to different beneficiaries.</p><p>We positively welcome Defra’s recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147397/nature-markets.pdf">Nature Markets Framework</a>, which starts to set out the much-needed principles, rules and requirements needed for market alignment across standards and ecosystem services — and includes the next steps to support BSI to develop standards for a range of ecosystem services.</p><p>While still in its infancy, we do see innovative first movers who are on a journey to understand how Natural Capital markets could enable flood risk to be recognised and mitigated and we aim to work alongside some of these. For example, the River Trust is developing ‘Replenish credits’ as a mechanism to finance natural solutions to improve water quality and reduce flood risk and the Forestry Commission is planning to develop a Woodland Water Code by 2025, to provide a standard for water-related benefits of woodland creation (from pollution mitigation to flood risk mitigation). We are also looking to work with other approaches to mainstream private finance into nature for example the <a href="https://www.naturanceproject.eu/">Horizon 2020 funded Naturance project</a> aims to explore over the next 3.5 years the technical, financial and operational feasibility and performance of solutions that integrate NbS into disaster risk financing — using investments in nature as ‘natural hedging’.</p><p>Currently, only some public organisations bear the risk of flooding in Glasgow, yet many players would benefit from flood risk alleviation. As private actors in the Glasgow partnership do not legally bear the risk there is no explicit incentive for investment in NbS and NFM especially at the individual organisation level. Even within the public sector, the distribution of liabilities across actors is a barrier to co-investment. For example, Glasgow City Council (GCC) are liable for surface water flooding whereas Scottish Water (SW) is liable for chronic sewer flooding — on top of this they each are concerned with different types of flood events. This makes it difficult to bundle risks and agree on a common&nbsp;pathway.</p><p>We need to standardise risk measurements and requirements across organisations in order to induce co-investments. A regulatory framework is required to crystallise shared risks and incentivise investments, both for the public and private sectors. Regulation around disclosure aligned to <a href="https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/">TCFD</a> are positive first steps which are not yet filtering into investment decisions and are only tangentially relevant to the conversations we are having with stakeholders.</p><p>Beyond this, we also need to translate those risks into clear targets that incorporate the multiple benefits of nature's positive risk mitigation strategies. In Glasgow for example we have seen how clearly defined targets related to active travel (for example reducing no. of car journeys) and carbon mitigation (net zero by 2030) provide a clear motivation for aligned planning and resourcing decisions. Whereas the lack of clearly articulated national and local targets for nature-based solutions and blue-green infrastructure means that what gets built is dictated by cost-benefit analyses, which rarely capture comprehensively the long-term and complex benefits delivered by&nbsp;nature.</p><p>In Scotland, we are looking to emerging policy windows that could offer opportunities to place Scotland at the cutting edge of regulatory innovation in this space. Over the next few months our partner Scottish Flood Forum will be involved in the consultations for the national <a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2022/09/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-2022-23/documents/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223/govscot%3Adocument/stronger-more-resilient-scotland-programme-government-202223.pdf">Flooding Strategy</a> — stay tuned for the development of community engagement guidelines in the delivery of privately financed urban NFM so that the voice of nature and local residents can be embedded at the core of the project. We also are looking hopefully at the next Statutory Climate Adaptation programme — which will be published next year — where we expect to see more emphasis on clearer targets and monitoring/evaluation approaches, as advised by <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/is-scotland-climate-ready-2022-report-to-scottish-parliament/">the Climate Change Committee</a>. Another opportunity we see is the potential revision to Scottish Water’s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/principles-of-charging-2021-2027/">charging principles</a> which could offer an opportunity to incentivise the private sector to invest in BGI by potentially offering them a cost-saving on future water/drainage bills.</p><p>Beyond Scotland, we are pleased that the recently published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147377/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-finance-strategy.pdf">UK Green Finance Strategy</a> provides a framework for scaling nature-based investment markets; putting adaptation higher on the political agenda and setting commitments towards the much-needed capacity building, training, skills, and wider net zero infrastructure (see C.1). However we are also aware that the outcomes of the Brexit Freedoms Bill, which will see the reform or removal of 570 environmental EU laws, might <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">negatively reduce existing standards</a> (e.g. water quality) as well as <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2364782-brexit-law-change-could-restrict-access-to-uk-river-pollution-data/">restricting legal rights to access environmental information</a>, increasing burden on civil servants and uncertainty across businesses that will have to operate knowing that the “<a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/news/uk-setting-bonfire-of-environmental-regulations-alight-with-new-bill/">rules and regulations… could change dramatically within the next 14&nbsp;months</a>”.</p><p>While this level of regulatory reform is beyond the scope of the pilot, it provides the context for which the pilot will either thrive or&nbsp;fail.</p><p>A template contract for co-investments in NbS would allow the development of legal commercial agreements and necessary MoUs between stakeholders. In the absence of market standards, the ability to strike (and contract on) a deal is hindered by the lack of consistency in documentation, meaning actors need (with every new deal) to spend time and resources on drafting these. The template agreements shared by the<a href="https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.co.uk/gfihive/toolkit/establishing-legal-contracts-and-closing/wyre-river-natural-flood-management-project/"> Wyre River investment project</a> have proved a helpful starting point and — as per lessons learned from the Wyre River project — we are going to be working towards the negotiation of non-binding MoUs between all the pilot partners that will ultimately require them to contract with each other to co-invest and deliver urban NbS. This iterative process will allow us to surface the technical, legal and financial requirements of different partners.</p><p>Through the pilot, we are hoping to develop these contracts as multi-stakeholder value agreements (across multiple actors, roles, values and assets) which exploit interdependencies to unlock multiple shared values. This builds off work as part of <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/BeyondtheRules">Beyond the Rules</a>, where we are developing standardised many-to-many agreements, organising and governance that aim to help fragmented actors to cross-boundary, systemic organising and governance.</p>Image from report Nature markets: A framework for scaling up private investment in nature recovery and sustainable farming, March&nbsp;2023 Call to&nbsp;action TreesAI team in&nbsp;Glasgow<p>The Glasgow pilot for co-investments in urban Nature-based Solutions is surfacing a number of structural learnings. The aforementioned challenges and suggested solution pathways are a call to action required at multiple levels and by different market stakeholders.</p><p>First of all, national governments need to develop clearer targets, regulations and standards to help organise &amp; transition public institutions, as well as implicating the private sector into environmental targets, to collectively address climate risks in&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Secondly, local governments and city councils should champion and lead cross-council institutions, building the necessary political momentum for scaling NbS. Cities need to work towards the politics of change required to build the ability for decision-making and collaboration with private actors operating in the&nbsp;city.</p><p>Lastly, public organisations and private companies with urban climate-related risks, should co-construct collaboration opportunities to understand and co-create processes and tools for co-investing in NbS and their multiple benefits.</p> Next steps <p>Our goal for the pilot in the next months is for public and private organisations to co-develop and sign a comprehensive MoU, with defined roles and responsibilities of each partner, as well as an expressed intent to explore further the possibility of investing in NbS in and beyond Glasgow to the wider region. We hope for this MoU to be one of a series of templates that can help the industry boost the development of similar initiatives.</p><p>We will also soon start a new round of fundraising to develop the next phases of the pilot, from portfolio development, to deal structuring, to implementation and monitoring.</p><p>Beyond the pilot, TreesAI is pursuing various relationships. From South Korea to Sierra Leone, from Canada to Italy, we are in conversation with innovative players in the system looking to test some of our existing models and processes or spearhead new components of the TreesAI family of solutions.

 After numerous delays, the much-anticipated government review and update of the Gambling Act 2005 has finally arrived. 



 



<p>It’s safe to say that the UK’s gambling industry has been in a state of turmoil for a few years now. In 2020, Boris Johnson launched a review of the Gambling Act 2005, raising concerns that the document might need to be updated to apply to the digital age. Indeed, it absolutely did, as at the time the 2005 Act was created, almost all gambling took place in brick and mortar betting shops, casinos and racetracks. Now, the industry makes more than 65% of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/26/gambling-uk-white-paper-online-casinos">£11 billion annual revenue</a> from online gambling.</p>



<p>The review was expected to lead to a white paper outlining modifications to the act. Three years later, and the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1153228/1286-HH-E02769112-Gambling_White_Paper_Book_Accessible1.pdf">UK gambling white paper</a> (High Stakes: Gambling Reform for the Digital Age) is finally here.</p>



<p>Now that the white paper has been released, it will likely have long-term implications for the sector. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the potential consequences for players and operators.</p>



 What is the UK gambling white paper? 



<p>The Gambling Act Review White Paper is an official publication that sets forth its approach to regulating the online gaming industry in the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The document covers current policies, regulations, and changes for gambling services in the UK. Such gambling regulations and policies include ensuring the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">protection of consumers</a>, mitigating problem gambling, preventing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a>, and making the enforcement of payment regulations easier.</p>



<p>The official document aims to provide an environment where players can safely partake in various forms of mainstream gambling, such as casino games, slots, lotteries, and sports betting. Gambling operators can continue providing the same products, but all games have to be within the regulatory limits.</p>



<p>Overall, the ultimate goal of this white paper is to promote transparency, fairness, and safety within all aspects of UK-based gambling activities.</p>



<blockquote><p>“[We’re] bringing our pre-smartphone regulations into the present day with a gambling white paper for the digital age.”</p>Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer at the House of Commons</blockquote>



 Why was the white paper delayed? 



<p>Speculated by industry insiders to be the greatest reform in nearly two decades, the UK’s new gambling framework has introduced proposals for various significant changes. However, the nearly three-year delay in reform has resulted in frustration and even inactivity in the gambling sector.</p>



<p>Initiated in December 2020, the review was supervised by no less than four culture secretaries, six gambling ministers, and three prime ministers. Little wonder, then that its official release was stalled four times throughout government turmoil and the pandemic. </p>



<p>In February, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak revealed plans for a newly-formed DSIT (Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology) and a new “refocused” Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sunak’s recent cabinet shuffle has caused further frustration, especially since Paul Scully, who received praise from those within the gambling industry for listening to both sides of the argument as demonstrated by his views on <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/retail/2023/01/27/paul-scully-white-paper-will-see-finance-risk-checks-not-affordability-checks/">affordability checks</a>, was then appointed to another post. On February 7th, Scully took up his new position as Minister for Tech and the Digital Economy.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that in the last few years, a cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine, and rising energy prices have also been pressing concerns for the current government, which perhaps explains why the review into the Gambling Act being was so low down on the priority list.</p>



<p>The amount of negotiation that goes into such a paper must also be considered. Stakeholders within the gambling industry realize the devastating consequences these reported new initiatives could have, so they are still fighting for the best potential outcome for the health of the gambling industry.</p>

 Why is the UK gambling white paper important? 



<p>Overall, the UK gambling white paper is important in terms of providing much-needed regulatory clarity, and helping establish the social and legal framework of the gambling sector in the UK. By suggesting various measures to ensure consumer protection standards and mitigate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a> and cybercrime, the document offers guidance and direction on how operators should facilitate fair, transparent, and safe services. According to Frazer, the white paper also aims to protect individuals that are vulnerable to addiction and harm without affecting the overall experience of the majority. As other regulators often look to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">United Kingdom Gambling Commission</a> to see where gambling regulation is headed, the UK gambling white paper is likely to affect many global markets, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/dutch-online-gambling-2022/">Netherlands</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/igaming-ontario-market-european-operators/">Ontario</a>.</p>



<p>In establishing a transparent legal framework and providing support services wherever necessary, the white paper will have a sweeping impact on operators and gamblers alike. Now that the document has been released, operators are advised to implement the necessary changes to their services and operations, from more active measures in managing problem gambling behavior, to increased minimum standards for protection and safety for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implications for gamblers include more comprehensive access to information regarding their gambling activities, improved customer support processes, new limits on stake levels, more straightforward registration processes, and more robust consumer protection standards.</p>



<p>However, despite the apparent need to help tackle issues surrounding problem gambling, people within the industry argue that some of the UK gambling white paper’s proposals, including intrusive affordability checks and betting limits, could unfairly impact the enjoyment of your everyday punter.</p>



 What are the UK gambing white paper’s main proposals for change? 



<p>The UK gambling white paper includes proposals and updates to the Gambling Act 2005, which featured rules for the industry before the proliferation of smartphones and online gambling.&nbsp;The UK government has pledged to work with the Gambling Commission to implement changes as soon as possible. All measures are expected to be in force by summer 2024.</p>



 Promotion of responsible gambling 



  More prescriptive rules on when operators must check for ‘harmful’ customer losses.<br>  



  Stake limit for online slots games, bringing them in line with land-based sector. (e.g. between £2-15 per spin.)<br>  



  Greater protection for 18-24 year olds, which could be a £2 limit per stake or an approach based on individual risk.<br>  



 Gaming experience 



  Making the ‘design’ of online games safer, by reviewing game speeds and features that exacerbate risks.  



  Ensuring incentives like bonuses and free bets are constructed in a ‘social responsible manner’.<br>  Subject to trials, data sharing between online operators and high risk customers mandatory for ‘collaborative harm prevention’.<br>  Consultation on whether to make player-centric tools like ‘online deposit limits’ mandatory or opt-out rater than opt-in.<br>  



 Support services<br> 



  Strengthen informational messaging including on the risks associated with gambling.  



  Premier League to end ‘front-of-shirt’ sponsorships by gambling firms.<br>  Review Gaming Commission fees to ensure enough resources are available to implement changes.  



  Introduce a statutory levy paid by operators to Gambling Commission to fund research, education, and treatment of gambling harms.<br>  Creation of new ombudsman role to deal with disputes and provide appropriate redress when a customer suffers losses due to a failure in an operator’s social responsibility policy.  



<p></p>



 The demand for more regulations. 



<p>Britain has the world’s largest iGaming market, not to mention one of the most liberal. In the past, UK-based regulatory authorities primarily outsourced consumer protection to problem gamblers, who were expected to “self-exclude” from gambling platforms should they suspect problem gambling patterns in their own behavior. They can do so through a platform established and funded by the gambling industry in 2018: Gamstop. That said, anti-gambling lobbyists argue that it is unreasonable to expect addicts to make sound decisions for themselves, and it should be accepted that they require guidance. Many addiction clinics in the UK have reported an upsurge in gamblers seeking treatment for deterioration in <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2022/11/nhs-opens-two-new-gambling-addition-clinics-amid-record-referrals/">mental health</a>.</p>



<p>The horse racing industry in the UK has also suffered partly due to the delay in the white paper’s release. In December 2022, representatives of the British racing industry met with gambling officials outlining their concerns affordability checks will have on the industry.&nbsp;While the sport has always been popular in the country, it has lost at least <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/features/series/the-40-million-blow-how-affordability-checks-are-already-hitting-horseracing-aqfKc4Z8eMEU/">£40 million in revenue</a>. The UK Gambling Commission has also increased restrictions, causing shifts in betting sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, prominent operator Entain <a href="https://www.racingpost.com/news/business/affordability-checks-hit-entain-revenues-by-100-million-as-annual-results-released-av3z35a3pdzd/">reported a loss</a> of £100 million due to a significant drop in gambling activity led on by the UK Gambling Commission’s restrictions and the rumor of affordability checks in the white paper. According to the operator, the drop is because more players are headed toward platforms that do not enforce as much oversight.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">Betting and Gaming Council</a>, 250,000 bettors visited <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">black market betting sites in December </a>(during the World Cup 2022), up from 80,000 during the same month in 2021. Betting fraud affects all countries regardless of their legal stance on gambling.</p>



 How to prepare for the white paper. 



<p>The UK has become the world’s most prominent regulated iGaming market. Despite its impact on society – both positives and negatives – it is still held back by restrictions that the white paper’s release could correct.</p>



<p>Now that the white paper has released, one thing’s for sure – gambling platforms have a duty to ensure they’re protecting their users, especially those problem gamblers. Having a&nbsp;KYC process in place to verify who they are, and the age they are, has never been more important.</p>

<p><br>
Northern Block and Canadian Bank Note enthusiastic about delivering a more convenient and intuitive solution for Canadian citizens, by unifying mDLs and Verifiable Credentials&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">Northern Block Inc</a>. and<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/"> Canadian Bank Note Ltd. (CBN)</a> are working together to create a more convenient and user-friendly solution for Canadians by combining different types of digital credentials, such as Mobile Driving Licences (mDLs), AnonCreds and JSON-LD Verifiable Credentials (VCs), using Hyperledger Aries technology. They plan to first focus on integrating mDLs and JSON-LD VCs into Hyperledger Aries wallets, and then work on offline verification using NFC and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transfer.</p>
<p>Both companies recognize that different credential technologies are suitable for different use cases and have varying levels of adoption in the industry. Therefore, to make it easier for citizens and ensure interoperability, a consistent approach across all technologies is essential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using Hyperledger Aries and various verifiable credential formats, such as AnonCreds and JSON-LD VC, is a great choice for government programs that aim to provide citizens with privacy-preserving high-assurance personal identity credentials. Aries is a technology that is well-suited for digital interactions where citizens want to build different types of relationships with their peers. Citizens can use the same set of VCs for various purposes, and these VCs may need to support privacy preservation or not, depending on the type of relationship they want to build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mobile Driver’s Licences (mDLs) are gaining widespread acceptance and becoming more practical due to their standardization under ISO/IEC 18013-5 and the forthcoming 18013-7, which establish a unified framework for their development, issuance, and verification. As a focused use case, mDLs are specifically designed to address the unique requirements of driver’s licence management, including distinct data attributes, security features, and regulatory compliance needs. Consequently, they are better equipped to tackle the specific challenges and requirements of this application, offering increased utility in this context.</p>
<p>Northern Block actively engages in open source, standards, and conformance criteria communities, participating in organizations such as the Hyperledger Foundation, Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), the Digital Identity and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC – PCTF), and the Digital Governance Standards Institute. Northern Block recently showcased multi-VC format issuance and presentation flows, using AnonCreds and W3C JSON-LD credentials, as part of their commitment to interoperability, supported by funding from the Ontario Government. Northern Block is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario (<a href="http://www.northernblock.io/">www.northernblock.io</a>).</p>
<p>CBN, a security solutions provider to over 40 jurisdictions operating in the passport, driver’s licence, and identity market, deployed the world’s first mDL for live transactions and was awarded the contract to supply an mDL to the Commonwealth of Virginia. CBN is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada (<a href="http://www.cbnco.com/">www.cbnco.com</a>).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marina Iantorno</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) is an essential component of IT security today, enabling organizations to control access to their systems and data by managing user identities, access entitlements and authentication. The importance of IAM continues to grow as cyber threats continue to evolve and data privacy regulations become more stringent.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey conducted by KuppingerCole Analysts, nearly 95% of organizations have an IAM solution in place. Most medium-sized to large organizations, factually, have multiples different IAM solutions in place for providing different IAM capabilities. This clearly shows the increasing importance of IAM in today's IT security.</p>
 Trends, facts and figures 
<p>The shift to cloud-based IAM solutions, also commonly referred to as IDaaS (Identity as a Service), which offer greater scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness than traditional on-premises solutions, is one of the key trends driving the growth of the IAM market. As more organizations adopt cloud computing, IDaaS is gaining popularity. Moreover, integration of IAM with additional security solutions, such as Endpoint Protection, Detection and Response (EPDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, is a trend. This integration enables organizations to adopt a more holistic security strategy by monitoring user activity across all systems and applications and detecting and responding to threats in real time. This demonstrates the importance of IAM within cybersecurity strategies.</p>
<p>The IAM market is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace, driven by factors such as those mentioned above, but also others. Regulations require a strong Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) posture. Cybersecurity and Zero Trust initiatives drive the demand for advanced authentication mechanisms&nbsp;such as passwordless authentication and adaptive access controls. KuppingerCole Analysts predicts that the IAM market volume will reach 35.58 billion USD by 2025, representing a CAGR of 16.8%, which is a clear indicator of this strong market growth.</p>
<p>IAM solutions are relevant across the globe. The largest revenue share comes from North America and EMEA, which approximately have a similar share of the global market across the various IAM subsegments. A smaller portion comes from APAC and LATAM, which have lower adoption rates, but we expect to see significant growth in these regions in the coming years.</p>
 A closer look into IAM subsegments 
<p>IGA is a core component of IAM, focused on managing users and their access to systems and data in accordance with policies and regulations. This market is expected to expand in the coming years as organizations seek to streamline identity management processes and ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. In addition, IGA solutions have begun to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate identity-related tasks and increase productivity. It is possible to learn more about this market segment in the Leadership Compass published by KuppingerCole (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81107/identity-governance-and-administration-2022">Identity Governance and Administration 2022 | KuppingerCole</a>).</p>
<p>Biometrics and adaptive access control is another growing area. The goal is to provide enhanced security and user experience over traditional password-based authentication. Their importance continues to grow in the context of Zero Trust initiative and for better protecting against cyberattacks targeting users, their digital identities, and credentials such as passwords.</p>
<p>Finally, Zero Trust security models are driving IAM adoption, requiring strong and continual authentication and authorization for verifying users and their devices. We also expect to see an increase in the adoption of decentralized identity solutions that allow users to reuse identities and associated identity proofs across multiple organizations, systems and applications. Warwick Ashford explained about the future using decentralized identity in his blog post (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/blog/future-with-decentralized-identity">Gear Up for the Future with Decentralized Identity (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>We expect continued growth in all IAM subsegments. While some are expected to show a good and stable CAGR around 10% others are expected to grow significantly faster. At the upcoming EIC (European Identity Conference), which will take place in Berlin in mid-May, we have several tracks where we will discuss topics such as trends in IGA, maturity levels of Identity Fabrics and the challenges of moving to passwordless authentication. As every year, there will be plenty interesting sessions at EIC. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023/agenda">Agenda | EIC 2023 (kuppingercole.com)</a>.</p>

<p>Investment confirms approximate value of Aftermath Islands at $53 Million CDN </p>



<p>April 17, 2023 –Toronto, Canada / Bridgetown, Barbados –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) confirms receipt of a share purchase agreement for its lead investor in its private Series A round financing, at approximately $4.50 CDN per ordinary share.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lead investor is the principal of a Family Office and group of privately held funds in the UK and EU and includes an option to increase their position based on the Company reaching certain milestones, which the Company is well underway to achieving, but cannot be guaranteed.&nbsp; The purchase agreement values Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited currently at approximately $53,000,000 CDN.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited is continuing to work with additional VCs, Family Office, and High Net Worth Individuals to support the raise in its Series A round of up to $6,000,000 USD in aggregate, with approval to increase to a maximum of $7,500,000 USD and will provide further updates as they become available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the current Series A financing terms, Oasis Digital Studios Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. will not be diluted in its equity position in Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited in the Series A round of funding, retaining 50% of the ordinary, or common shares, with Aftermath Islands remaining a controlled subsidiary of Liquid Avatar.</p>



<p>Since its inception, Aftermath Islands has taken its own, unique path to providing a Web3 experience by developing and incorporating leading technologies that have created an open world platform that confirms, through its partnership with Liquid Avatar, that everyone on the platform can control and manage their digital footprint using biometrics with no username or password for signing into the platform.&nbsp; The Liquid Avatar Mobile App, available in over 100 countries and regions globally via the Apple Store and Google play, provides a Proof of Humanity process, the Meta Park Pass TM, which creates a high level of assurance that all players are individual, real people, reducing fraud, fake and duplicate accounts, and bots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands has generated over $2 million in retail sales, over 7,800 platform purchases, and provided high-fidelity gaming graphics for a real-world virtual experience with no download, making it accessible by a wide variety mobile, tablets and computers.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands has successfully launched its first servers and has incorporated Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT3 to enable Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to engage with players as subject matter experts.&nbsp; The platform also allows instant connections to legacy Web2 websites, eCommerce platforms, search engines, ticketing systems, gaming platforms, educational institutions, social media and more to create a holistic 360-degree experience for consumers and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In late October 2022, Aftermath Islands launched its first Play to Earn (P2E) game, Lost Kingdom of T’Sara, (“LKoT”) allowing players to collect resources and exchange them for Resource Pack NFTs that can be used inside the open world platform to create value.&nbsp; To date, users have collected over 3.9 billion resources, successfully created over 4.7 million Resource Pack NFTs and user engagement is upwards of 70 minutes per day, with outliers spending several hours a day playing LKoT.</p>



<p>“The investment in Aftermath Islands open world concept with high fidelity graphics, no download and proven revenues supports our ability to move forward expeditiously and continues to gain momentum and traction in market,” commented David Lucatch, CEO of Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. and Managing Director of Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited. “As a Web3 pioneer and supporter of legacy Web2 platforms, Aftermath Islands has created a unique environment that provides users with a high-fidelity graphics experience with no download, creating a platform similar to the major streaming services but with multi-player usability.&nbsp; We believe that this approach is the launch point to integrating the future of online technologies, engagement, and commerce, while respecting and including today’s vast network of online properties.”</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 10th April to 16th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap that focuses on some crucial regulatory developments and their potential effect on the ecosystem. This week, we cover the US setting its regulatory crosshairs on stablecoins, the IMF renewing calls for regulating crypto by citing the FTX collapse and turmoil in the banking sector, an SEC Commissioner blasting the agency’s heavy-handed approach toward the crypto industry, and India’s Finance Minister calling for globally coordinated crypto regulation at G20 meetings.</p> The US has set its Regulatory Crosshairs on its Next Target: Stablecoins <p>Since the FTX debacle, the United States has gone into an overdrive mode to regulate cryptocurrencies, with industry stakeholders raising the alarm and terming the government’s action “Operation Chokehold 2.0.” And now, its focus is on stablecoins.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1635964585621745665?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>A recent regulatory draft proposal detailed provisions stating that insured depository institutions issuing stablecoins would be subject to oversight by corresponding regulatory authorities. The hearing on the proposed stablecoin bill is scheduled for 19&nbsp;April.</p><p>If approved, non-bank institutions would come under Federal Reserve scrutiny, and foreign issuers would need to register to conduct business within the&nbsp;US.</p><p>However, approval of stablecoin issuance would depend on several factors, such as maintaining adequate reserves, including USD or Treasury&nbsp;bills.</p><p>The possible impact of this proposed regulation on the crypto ecosystem and users could be both positive and negative.</p><p>On the positive side, the increased transparency and oversight may foster trust and confidence in stablecoins, leading to broader adoption and utilization in various use cases, such as cross-border transactions and a store of&nbsp;value.</p><p>It could also help prevent fraudulent activities, protect investors, and contribute to a more stable financial system by reducing the likelihood of market manipulation and “black swan”&nbsp;events.</p><p>Conversely, the proposed regulations could have negative consequences, too, for crypto users and the ecosystem at&nbsp;large.</p><p>For instance, the stringent regulatory framework might push some companies to seek friendlier jurisdictions, leading to market fragmentation and creating challenges for global cooperation.</p><p>The regulations might even impose limitations on the privacy and autonomy of users, as increased monitoring and reporting requirements could affect the decentralization aspect that attracts many to cryptocurrencies in the first&nbsp;place.</p> IMF Renews Calls for Regulating Crypto Citing FTX Collapse &amp; Turmoil in Banking&nbsp;Sector <p>The International Monetary Fund called for regulating digital assets and strict prudential requirements for stablecoin issuers in its “Global Financial Stability Report.”</p><p>The IMF believes there should be comprehensive and consistent regulation and supervision in the crypto-asset ecosystem.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ilker_zorlu_/status/1646517523372982277?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The report emphasizes the failures of FTX and crypto-friendly banks, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank, as reasons to stress the need for adequate supervision and regulation.</p><p>However, these claims are unsubstantiated, as cryptocurrencies did not play a role in the banks’ failures. In fact, the true causes for these failures lie elsewhere, which calls into question the rationale for increasing supervision and regulation specifically targeting the crypto industry, citing recent bank failures.</p> SEC Commissioner Blasts Agency’s Heavy-Handed Approach Toward Crypto&nbsp;Industry <p>Hester Peirce, the Commissioner of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), criticized the agency for being too rigid in regulating new technologies and punishing entrepreneurs who try to innovate, including those in the crypto industry.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/remer_eth/status/1647283342491123715?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>“Today’s Commission tells entrepreneurs trying to do new things in our markets to come in and register. When entrepreneurs find they cannot, the Commission dismisses the possibility of making practical adjustments to our registration framework to help entrepreneurs register and instead rewards their good faith with an enforcement action. Today’s Commission treats the notice-and-comment rulemaking process not as a conversation, but as a threat,” said&nbsp;Peirce.</p><p>She argued for the need to balance fostering innovation and protecting investors. Her comments come amid criticism of the SEC’s slow guidance and enforcement actions regarding cryptocurrencies and related activities.</p> India’s Finance Minister Calls for Globally Coordinated Crypto Regulation at G20&nbsp;Meetings <p>India’s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, attended G20 meetings in the US and urged for a globally coordinated approach to regulate crypto assets due to their potential to cause macroeconomic instability.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1647606092745023490?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>G20 members agree on the need for globally coordinated regulation of crypto assets to deal with related challenges, according to Sitharaman.</p><p>She added that under India’s G20 presidency, a “synthesis paper” will be prepared on crypto assets following discussions between finance ministers and central bank governors from member countries.</p> Introducing Veriscope’s New Feature: Bloom Filter for Deposit Addresses <p>We’re excited to unveil our latest feature: the Veriscope Bloom Filter for deposit addresses.</p><p>This Redis Bloom-based innovation streamlines deposit address management and attestation events for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), enhancing their experience and simplifying their workflow.</p><p>By using the Veriscope Bloom Filter, VASPs can easily upload their deposit addresses, which narrows NEW_ATTESTATION events to only those specific addresses.</p><p>This means less manual work and a more efficient way to identify and respond to relevant attestations.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-veriscope-releases-bloom-filters-a-game-changer-for-vasps-to-identify-address-relevant-attestations">Visit our blog post</a> to discover more about the Veriscope Bloom Filter and how it can transform your VASP experience.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1645955195837267974?s=20">Japan is taking major steps to boost its crypto&nbsp;industry</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1646189406217285632?s=20">France is considering extending proposed crypto laws to include&nbsp;DeFi</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p></p><p>It has been a very long time since the last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-0-is-here/">Dev Pulse</a> — almost three months, in fact! And you know what? It’s kind of been a good thing! In keeping with our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-released/#what-does-app-stability-mean-for-devs">promise</a>, the last four releases of Holochain 0.1 have had few breaking changes for hApp developers and users, so the changelogs haven’t had much to report on. [Editor: 0.1.4 has had some breaking changes that you should know about; read the release notes below.] This has meant that devs can keep focusing on the thing that matters most to them — their app — rather than worrying about how we’re changing things on them yet again this week.</p><p>And things won’t be changing much even in Holochain 0.2. There are very few breaking changes, and almost none of them will be in your hApp code. With that said, the most significant breaking change is the replacement of QUIC transport with WebRTC — but remember that, true to our six-month promise, we’ll still keep running our QUIC proxy relay server for Holochain 0.1 until July 15th, and our bootstrap server now supports both QUIC and WebRTC.</p><p>Holochain 0.2.0’s <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.0?ref=blog.holochain.org">first release candidate</a> was published on 16th March, the full-feature release candidate <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases/tag/holochain-0.2.0-beta-rc.4?ref=blog.holochain.org">0.2.0-beta-rc.4</a> was published on 13 April, and the final release will be published on 27 April. I’ll share all the release notes on that date.</p><p>With that, let’s see what’s happened since 0.1.0 was released!</p> Holochain 0.1.1 to 0.1.4: Bug fixes and backports <p>Edit: After publishing some small breaking changes in 0.1.4, we received reports that it unexpectedly introduced issues in scaffolding and deployment. This happened because some structs were moved from <code>holochain_integrity_types</code> to <code>hdi</code>, which caused crate dependency resolution issues that bubbled up into our development environment build process. For now, we recommend that you do not upgrade your hApps or development environment to 0.1.4, and wait for the upcoming 0.1.5 release instead.</p><p>Rather than report on each release individually, I’ll just give you the full list of changes for all four releases. Although we’re still on the 0.1.x series, we did introduce two very minor breaking changes which should take mere moments of code refactoring.</p>  Breaking (hApp manifests): The <code>version</code> field of a DNA section in a hApp manifest has been renamed to <code>installed_hash</code> and is now a single optional hash rather than an optional list of hashes. This field can be used to verify the integrity of a DNA at hApp install time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2157?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2157</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2180?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2180</a>)  Bugfix, breaking (HDI, host API): Validation of DHT operations for private entries would <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1861?ref=blog.holochain.org">fail</a> for the <code>StoreEntry</code> op which would put the entry in the author’s own store. This has now been fixed. As the changelog says, this is a ‘slightly’ breaking change because <code>FlatOp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">previously</a> <code>OpType</code>, see below) has some new enum variants that your validation code may need to match against. The compiler will tell you if your code needs to be refactored! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1910?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1910</a>)  New: <code>OpType</code> is renamed to <a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.3.0-beta-rc.3/hdi/flat_op/enum.FlatOp.html?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>FlatOp</code></a>, and the <code>Op::to_type()</code> helper is renamed to <code>Op::flattened()</code>. This enum is used in validation callback to simplify otherwise complex <code>switch</code> code paths. The old names still exist as aliases to the new ones, so this isn’t a breaking change yet. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1909?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1909</a>)  New: Certain conductor API methods that can return <code>CellMissing</code> errors now return <code>CellDisabled</code> when the cell is present but disabled. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2092?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2092</a>)  New: Enabling or disabling a clone cell is now idempotent — if you try to enable an already enabled clone or disable an already disabled one, it’ll return a successful result rather than an error. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2093?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2093</a>)  New: The conductor can now be compiled to support tx5, the new WebRTC-based transport protocol to be used in 0.2.x. Note: This doesn’t mean that 0.1.x conductors can talk with 0.2.x, and is mostly for development purposes. Please don’t use this if you’re compiling your own conductor! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1741?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1741</a>)  Performance: When the last instance of a hApp is removed from a conductor, the shared DHT data is deleted to clear storage space. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Performance: Performance of zome calls, particularly remote ones, has improved dramatically due to optimisation of capability lookups. Previously, mere hundreds of calls would show a noticeable slowdown as more commits were made to the source chain; now thousands of commits only affect zome call time by about a millisecond. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2097?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2097</a>)  Bugfix: When uninstalling the last instance of a hApp, locally stored DHT data is now cleaned up. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1805?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1805</a>)  Bugfix: Attempts to create duplicate clone cells (that is, clones of a DNA within one hApp with identical DNA hashes) are now rejected. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1997?ref=blog.holochain.org">#1997</a>)  Bugfix: The <code>name</code> field in a DNA manifest or definition incorrectly affected the DNA hash; this has now been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2099?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2099</a>)  Bugfix: The network seed was ignored for DNA roles whose provisioning was set to <code>None</code> in the hApp manifest at install time; this bug has been fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/2102?ref=blog.holochain.org">#2102</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.1/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20230203200648">full changelog</a> for the 0.1 series.</p> JavaScript client 0.12.1 to 0.12.5   Update: Changes to the admin API’s <code>NetworkInfo</code> endpoint have been integrated, making JS client 0.12.1 the first release fully compatible with Holochain 0.1. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/172?ref=blog.holochain.org">#172</a>)  Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to a Nix flake; if you’re contributing to client development, you can now use <code>nix develop</code> in the root of the repo. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/175?ref=blog.holochain.org">#175</a>)  Improvement: When a websocket closes, reject pending API requests. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/178?ref=blog.holochain.org">#178</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/179?ref=blog.holochain.org">#179</a>)  Bugfix: Attempting to call a zome function by role name when giving a provenance now fails with an error. (Note: this change may be reverted in a future release.) (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/pull/176?ref=blog.holochain.org">#176</a>)   Rust client 0.3.1   Development: The development environment for working on the repo has changed from nix-shell to Nix flakes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/pull/12?ref=blog.holochain.org">#12</a>)   Tryorama 0.11.1 and 0.11.2   Development: Similar to the client repos, the development environment for working on this repo has changed to a Nix flake. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/166?ref=blog.holochain.org">#166</a>)  Improvement: Conductor logging now outputs at the <code>info</code> log level. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/commit/96bd726944da2f573943eaebe9f838a62adef496?ref=blog.holochain.org">96bd726</a>)   Launcher 0.9.1 to 0.9.3 <p>These releases bring all sorts of UX improvements:</p>  Improvement: The Launcher can now auto-update to the newest version.  Improvement: Windows <code>.msi</code> installer files are now code-signed.  Improvement: A 404 page is now shown for an improperly formed UI (that is, one without an <code>index.html</code> file).  Improvement: Support for multiple languages has been added, with German as the first alternative to English.  Improvement: The cell info card now shows the network seed.  Improvement: The arrival of new data in the app library is more obvious.  Bugfix: A bug on macOS has been fixed where Holochain processes would keep running after the Launcher was quit.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a> for full changelogs and known existing issues.</p> Around the community <p>Folks, the thing I’m most excited about right now is not beta releases — it’s the ways in which the developer ecosystem is growing and blooming (I guess I’ve got springtime on my mind <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-developer-ecosystem-in-full-bloom/">again</a>).</p><p>Developers are busy learning how to build hApps — the Holochain Foundation, in collaboration with our education partner Mythosthesia, ran an <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-training-recap/">online course</a> last month, and the quality of commitment among participants was encouraging.

<p>On July 27th, 2021, the cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, announced the creation of the FTX Climate Program. Showing its commitment to fight climate change with a nicely designed website, presenting a well-thought out and wide list of strategies and projects.</p>
<p>However, in November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy after the world discovered massive wrongdoings – a fraud only comparable to Bernie Madoff’s multi-billion-dollar Ponzi scheme that hit Wall Street fifteen years ago. After the collapse, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried admitted that the FTX Climate Program was just a façade. A scam to attract environmentally conscious people.</p>
 Sustainability requires trust 
<p>With sustainability scams like this, how can you as an individual or a business leader spend any money on sustainability?</p>
<p>Personally, I have offset flights when I couldn’t avoid flying, and supported reforestation projects at other times. I did this because I believe we must do something now to avoid a climate disaster. But at the precise time I was typing my credit card details, did I know if those euros would reach the correct destination to have a positive impact? I had no choice but to simply trust that they would.</p>
<p>If you offset a flight, you trust in the airline. But does the airline really know if those carbon credits you bought will lead to a real offset? Do they know the whole supply chain of actors (companies, auditors, projects, field operators) for those carbon credits?</p>
<p>The harsh answer is No. Today hardly anybody can say for sure where the money will end up.</p>
 Transparency in the voluntary carbon market 
<p>Today, both individuals and companies that wish to reduce the devastating effect of the climate crisis can buy different types of carbon credits (e.g. offset a flight) to reduce their carbon footprint. All these transactions are made in the voluntary carbon market, so called because the purchases are made without any obligation, such as a government mandate.</p>
<p>At this point, hundreds of innovative companies have appeared with the promise of using the best of today’s technology to catalyse the voluntary carbon markets. Bringing transparency is a promise these ventures overwhelmingly have in common. Such services are tackling this problem through different fronts, for example:</p>
 
 A carbon accounting SaaS application that helps a company measure, report, and reduce carbon impact from a single web user interface. Such an application would help a company with their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting. 
 A platform that “tokenises” carbon assets, so carbon credits are listed on blockchains. 
 A game-like app that makes it very easy to buy carbon credits, paying with either fiat or cryptocurrencies. 
 
<p>In these cases, the services rely on several 3rd party actors (partners), for instance: reforestation projects, carbon removal companies, laboratories, marketplaces, auditors, and more. These partners have to be vetted and onboarded. If—as the end buyer—I see a list of some of these partners, can I really know who I’m transacting with? No. Do I know how their identity is being verified? No. Even though these services claim to be using the latest technology, the identity verification doesn’t seem to be based on digital identity’s latest standards.</p>
 Environmental, social, and governance 
<p>Where ESG (environmental, social, and governance) is concerned, as GLEIF’s Clare Rowley said in our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/history-of-lei/" title="History of LEIs Podcast Episode">History of LEIs Podcast Episode</a>, “data is core to addressing the question of sustainability and the current climate crisis.” Publicly traded companies are already publishing these ESG reports, which are read by different regulators, existing and potential investors, the media, and consumers. Such reports include traditional financial information on their investments, but the missing piece is that they should also include a verified profile of the company and their partners. Otherwise, we don’t know whom we’re doing business with, and the data is indeed insufficient. Also, in the same interview, Clare shared that, “As the world around sustainability reporting becomes more standardised, we expect the LEI there growing as a tool to connect.”</p>
 How verified digital identities can help 
<p>Verified digital identities are a crucial element to solve this problem, which, strictly speaking, has two main elements:</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must verify the real identity of every organisation globally. Regardless of whether it’s a startup, listed company, non-profit, educational institution, or alternative. Every time you interact or do business with a company, even on the other side of the globe, you must be 100% sure it’s a real company. If real, you must then be sure that the person you are talking with has the right to legally represent that company, and that you can know who the owners of that company are. The LEI (<a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">Legal Entity Identifier</a>) is the only technology that can make this happen and must be incorporated in every sustainability solution.</p>
<p>The second part of the solution is verifying the real identity of the person behind every transaction, as that builds trust. In the Nordics, bank authentication is widely available and popular. Other countries have similarly highly assured identification methods. The European Union’s eIDAS 2.0 will come soon to fill this gap at a European level, and we must embrace similar initiatives globally.</p>
 Bringing together sustainability and transparency 
<p>We need verification of both companies’ and individuals’ identities, for the whole supply chain, of every carbon credit. This is the only way to add real transparency and build the trust that we need for both businesses and individuals to embrace sustainability.</p>
<p>Using the word transparency in a company’s motto or putting it in bold fonts on a flashy website, is not enough. Sometimes I feel that companies trying to build sustainability solutions and talking about transparency provide the argument that “we are a web3 solution, therefore trust us.” Instead, trust is built on concrete actions, not with ethereal visions. The good news is that today we have the right tools at our disposal.</p>
<p>Without verified digital identities, sustainability will lose its battle. And this battle must be won, and we all must help to win it.</p>

  The G7 countries under Japan’s presidency, are emphasizing tighter cryptocurrency regulations to address digital technology challenges and protect the global crypto community.  One of its key objectives is to help developing nations adopt CBDCs, as the G7 members believe it could foster financial inclusivity.  At the same time, increasing political resistance and privacy concerns around CBDCs highlight the need for preserving privacy, which is a strong point of cryptocurrencies.  <p>As Japan takes on the presidency of the G7 this year, the Group of Seven countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K., and the U.S., along with the European Union — are set to address the challenges posed by fast-moving digital technology.</p><p>Japan’s Vice Minister of Finance for International Affairs, Masato Kanda, emphasized the need for tighter cryptocurrency regulations in light of last year’s collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, which reportedly served as a “serious wake-up call” for policymakers worldwide.</p><p>With varying viewpoints on cryptocurrency assets among nations, the G7 seeks to cultivate international agreement on the importance of more robust regulatory frameworks.</p><p>The group believes that implementing these enhanced regulations will safeguard the global crypto community from market instability and cybersecurity risks while reducing the potential for misinformation and minimizing social and political rifts stemming from digital advancements.</p><p>More on the topice: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-sneak-peek-into-japans-cbdc-program">A Sneak Peak Into Japan’s CBDC&nbsp;Program</a></p> CBDC: A Magical Pill to Empower Developing Nations? <p>Seeing CBDCs as a superior alternative to cryptocurrencies in terms of fostering financial inclusivity, the G7 plans to assist developing nations in adopting CBDCs consistent with international standards.</p><p>And how would they do so? By addressing potential risks associated with CBDC development through G7’s public policy principles for retail CBDCs, such as transparency and sound governance.</p> Political Resistance and Privacy Concerns Around&nbsp;CBDCs <p>While many governments and financial institutions worldwide are exploring the potential of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), not all politicians are on board with this innovation.</p><p>For instance, in the United States, a group of Republican Representatives, led by majority whip Tom Emmer, introduced the <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives">CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act</a> in February this year. This legislation aims to halt the efforts of the Federal Reserve in developing a CBDC that could potentially strip Americans of their financial privacy.</p><p>These politicians argue that a CBDC would create significant privacy concerns, as the government could potentially use this digital currency to monitor citizens’ transactions. They believe that, if implemented, a CBDC could lead to greater government surveillance and control over individuals’ finances, following in the footsteps of authoritarian regimes like China and&nbsp;Russia.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/624159">a petition against introducing a “programmable” CBDC</a> has garnered attention in the United Kingdom. Opponents believe such a currency would grant the issuer excessive control over how individuals use their&nbsp;money.</p><p>In response, the UK government clarified that it has no plans to program any future CBDC or restrict how the currency is&nbsp;spent.</p><p>These political debates and public concerns around CBDCs underscore the delicate balance that must be struck between innovation and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>As G7 nations strive to support developing countries in implementing CBDCs, they must also address these privacy concerns and work towards building a financial landscape that ensures both innovation and individual sovereignty.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/cbdcs-101-understanding-the-basics-of-central-bank-digital-currencies">CBDCs 101 — Understanding the Basics of Central Bank Digital Currencies</a></p> CBDCs vs. Cryptocurrencies: What You Should&nbsp;Know? <p>While both Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and cryptocurrencies leverage the power of blockchain technology, there are some key differences that set them&nbsp;apart.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies emphasize decentralization, providing users with anonymity, and can serve as both an investment vehicle and transferring value. On the other hand, CBDCs, being government-backed digital money, prioritize centralization and are mostly focused on transferring value.</p><p>CBDCs are also more likely to utilize private, permissioned blockchain networks, whereas cryptocurrencies are most likely to operate on permissionless, open networks. Additionally, CBDC transactions are tied to users’ bank accounts and personal information, unlike the anonymous transactions typical of cryptocurrencies.</p> Impact scenarios <p>As the G7 addresses the challenges posed by cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), both positive and negative consequences emerge for crypto users and the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Enhanced regulations offer stability, user protection, and financial inclusivity through CBDC implementation in developing nations, while adherence to international standards fosters responsible, transparent digital asset governance. However, concerns around privacy, government surveillance, and potential abuse of power cannot be overlooked.</p><p>With the G7 striving to foster innovation and collaboration, finding a balance between the regulations and protecting individual freedoms remains critical. As such, the G7’s actions should prioritize the needs of citizens, ensuring that the development of a digital financial landscape respects privacy rights and empowers users in the rapidly changing world of cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;CBDCs.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption-617c544a9e9b">G7’s Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC Adoption</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Learn how Fission is making it possible to query decentralized data with RhizomeDB.</p> What is RhizomeDB? <p>RhizomeDB is a protocol that executes a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data. It extends our <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative">Webnative SDK</a> with support for concurrent access to structured and unstructured data distributed in content-addressable networks and enables the creation of decentralized, collaborative applications 🤯. </p> How Does RhizomeDB Work? <p>RhizomeDB is built from the ground up for interoperability between applications, with a focus on real-time collaboration. One way of looking at Rhizome is a framework for CRDTs powered by a database engine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">CRDTs</a>, or Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types, offer eventual consistency without coordination between replicas, algorithmically resolve any inconsistencies, and guarantee that any replicas with different states will eventually converge into the same state. </p><p>RhizomeDB is also a tuple store. There are many <a href="https://www.upgrad.com/blog/list-vs-tuple/">benefits to using tuples</a>, one of which is immutability. Every entry in the system must be entered in a consistent format, thereby vastly decreasing the number of mistakes that can be made that would interfere with the schema-building and querying process. It also makes it very easy to change how you view the data at read-time and even view your data as tables, graphs, columns, time series, etc. </p><p>In addition to the typical entity-attribute-value tuple of many stores, Rhizome includes a "causal" link that points to the data that the entry depends on. Most data don't directly depend on each other, but some, like the output of an analysis that uses other data, do. This causal link has a couple of advantages, including making the structure BFT, or Byzantine Fault Tolerant. It's a way of "showing your work" so to speak, so that if some nodes go down or malicious actors attempt to input false information, the system won't collapse. </p><p>The causal link also allows RhizomeDB to express Operations-based CRDTs, or CmRDTs, which can change operations that don't affect the end result. An added benefit is it can reduce the amount of necessary compute power.</p> What Makes RhizomeDB Special? <p>As far as we're aware, RhizomeDB is the first system that will combine encryption, CRDTs, and local-first database functionality (we're still building out the encryption part). Another way to look at is that RhizomeDB is a CRDT framework built on top of well-understood database tech. This means we can apply lots of optimizations over time, such as incremental view maintenance, precomputing strategies, distributed indexing, and more.</p><p>For developers, RhizomeDB means they no longer need to worry about consistency, synchronization, and data privacy when building apps with decentralized data - a huge win! &nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, developers can interpret data according to their own needs. For example, say you wanted to build your own decentralized social network. RhizomeDB, in a sense, enables a BYOA (Bring Your Own Algorithm) approach to this type of project because it is customizable and prioritizes local-first data. If you wanted your social network to be a community solely focused on 1970s disaster films, you could input the relevant data and use tailored variables to query it. Then as mentioned previously, the CRDTs will use their built-in algorithm to do the rest of the heavy lifting and guarantee consistency. You can also remix and evolve your data over time.</p> RhizomeDB To-Do List Demo <p>Here is a proof-of-concept demo that Applied Researcher Quinn Wilton created.</p><p>Other potential use cases are a CRM, a shared media library...there are so many possibilities! </p> What is RhizomeDB's Current Status? <p>RhizomeDB is still in its early days and is a work in progress. However, it can already do impressive things like query and compute over multiple sources and users in a content-addressed store. It doesn't (directly) help you find the data you're looking for, but you could build an indexer out of RhizomeDB and <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM</a> to accomplish that.</p> Open-Sourcing RhizomeDB  <p>At Fission, we believe working in public is the quickest way to test, iterate, and build a successful protocol. Therefore, today we are officially open-sourcing RhizomeDB under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache license</a>! If you'd like to explore the code, head to the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">GitHub repo</a> and wade in! Please be advised that there is currently no documentation, the codebase is unfinished, and it is not yet production-ready. All of this will come as soon as it's ready, but if you're intrepid and want to dive right in, have at it!</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Quinn will present at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> in the Interplanetary Databases track and at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/quinn-wilton">Causal Islands</a>. Here is the talk abstract:</p><p>Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems with Quinn Wilton</p><p>Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.</p><p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on RhizomeDB! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. </p> What's Next for RhizomeDB <p>Building and documentation will be our focus going into the coming months. We also have plans to make RhizomeDB real-time and encrypted!</p><p>You can follow our progress by reading <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/weekly-notes-quinn/3873/4">Quinn's weekly notes</a> and visiting the <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB/rs-rhizome">repo</a>.</p>

Predict NFT floor prices using machine learning to win&nbsp;prizes!<p>Are you ready to forecast NFT prices &amp; win? We’re announcing our <a href="http://bit.ly/3UweuZd">NFT Price Analysis</a> data challenge due this April 30th, 2023 at 11:59 PM UTC! Contestants are asked to submit data analytics reports and machine learning models to analyze the floor prices of&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Accurate predictions of NFT prices are crucial for investment decisions and estimating risk for NFT financial products. In this challenge, participants not only estimate NFT floor prices, but also showcase their AI skills. Contestants must perform an exploratory analysis on provided or participant-found data and building a machine-learning model that predicts the floor price of an&nbsp;NFT.</p> Ocean Protocol’s NFT Price Analysis&nbsp;Prizes <p>The prize pool for this competition is $5,000 USD payable in OCEAN, with the top three participants receiving cash prizes as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1st place:&nbsp;$2,500</p><p>2nd place:&nbsp;$1,500</p><p>3rd place:&nbsp;$1,000</p> NFT Price Analytics Hackathon <p>All the requirements for this challenge can be found on the NFT Floor Price Prediction Challenge <a href="http://bit.ly/3UweuZd">page</a>. Participants can use any data they wish — static data or streams, free or priced, raw data or feature vectors, published on Ocean Market or not. There are also links to some data feeds and AI modeling approaches that may be helpful in the challenge’s <a href="http://bit.ly/3UweuZd">description</a>.</p><p>We are providing a dataset from <a href="https://www.transpose.io/">Transpose</a> data that shows all of the transactions for the NFT collections Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, Azuki, Moonbirds, and Otherdeed. Participants should pick two NFT collections to&nbsp;analyze.</p><p>The submission deadline for the reporting part of the competition is April 30th, 2023, at 23:59 UTC. Participants must submit their reports by the deadline to be eligible.</p> Evaluation Criteria <p>The winner of the data report competition will be judged based on the following criteria:</p> Data Analysis (50&nbsp;points) <p>Select five questions below to answer as part of your analysis. Your answer should include quantitative and qualitative elements.</p> Choose 2 NFT collections to&nbsp;evaluate   Analyze how the number of daily transactions for the collections has changed over&nbsp;time.  Provide a visual overview of the NFT collections of your choice and its characteristics (e.g. size, type of NFTs, date&nbsp;range)?  Can you identify any clusters or groups of NFTs within the collection based on their attributes or characteristics? If so, what are the key features of these&nbsp;groups?  How does the price of NFTs with similar levels of rarity compare across different NFT collections?  Can you identify any correlations between the characteristics of the NFTs within the collection and their prices? If so, what are the most important factors influencing the&nbsp;prices?  Have any traits increased in value over time, and if so, which&nbsp;ones?  Which NFTs in a collection were most profitable when they were flipped (bought and sold&nbsp;quickly)  Determine the correlation between the number of transactions in a collection and its floor&nbsp;price  Determine the correlation between the number of transactions in a collection and the price of&nbsp;ETH  What are the most liquid traits (those with the most sales) for each collection?   Report (25&nbsp;points): <p>Submit a report describing the above findings. Make sure to include qualitative insights in addition to quantitative ones. Reports will be evaluated on presentation structure, approach, content, and completeness.</p> Predict Model (25&nbsp;points) <p>Use your findings above to develop a machine learning model that can be used to determine the current floor price of the rarest NFT in your chosen collection. Based on your model, is the NFT underpriced or overpriced? You will be judged on your choice of features and&nbsp;model.</p> Bonus (10&nbsp;points) <p>Source your own dataset to create an additional lens to analyze the NFT collections. This could include datasets about the top wallet holders, Twitter sentiment, etc.</p> Description of the Transpose NFT Dataset Provided:   indexer_id: Unique identifier for the NFT sale or collection.  __confirmed: Flag indicating whether the transfer has been confirmed.  __block_number: The block number at which the NFT sale occurred.  block_number: The block number at which the NFT sale occurred.  log_index: The log index at which the NFT sale occurred.  transaction_hash: The transaction hash at which the NFT sale occurred.  timestamp: The timestamp of the NFT sale (in ISO-8601&nbsp;format).  exchange_name: The name of the exchange that hosted the NFT&nbsp;sale.  contract_version: The version of the exchange contract that hosted the NFT sale (e.g. wyvern or seaport for OpenSea).  aggregator_name: The name of the aggregator used in the NFT sale (null if no aggregator was&nbsp;used).  contract_address: The contract address of the NFT that was sold or the collection.  token_id: The token ID of the NFT that was sold or the&nbsp;NFT.  is_multi_token_sale: Whether the sale is a multi-token sale, including more than one unique NFT for the given&nbsp;payment.  multi_token_sale_index: The index of the sale within the multi-token sale (will be 0 if not a multi-token sale).  price: The total value of this sale in the payment token (in&nbsp;Wei).  usd_price: The total value of this sale in&nbsp;USD.  eth_price: The total value of this sale in&nbsp;ETH.  native_price: The total value of this sale in the native token&nbsp;(ETH).  payment_token_address: The address of the token used to pay for this sale (null if the native token,&nbsp;ETH).  quantity: The quantity of tokens sold (will only be greater than 1 for ERC-1155&nbsp;NFTs).  seller_address: The address of the account that sold the&nbsp;NFT.  buyer_address: The address of the account that bought the&nbsp;NFT.  royalty_fee: The decimal-adjusted royalty fee paid to the creator of the&nbsp;NFT.  platform_fee: The decimal-adjusted platform fee paid to the exchange that facilitated the NFT&nbsp;sale.  minted_timestamp: The NFT’s mint timestamp (in ISO-8601 format) or the collection’s timestamp of creation.  supply: The NFT’s supply (0 if NFT has been&nbsp;burned)  name: The NFT’s&nbsp;name.  description: The NFT’s description or the collection’s description.  image_url: The NFT’s image URL or the collection’s image URL in the Transpose CDN.  external_url: The NFT’s website URL or the collection’s website&nbsp;URL.  media_url: The NFT’s additional media&nbsp;URL.  properties: The NFT’s properties (also referred to as attributes or traits) or flattened properties of a collection.  metadata_url: The NFT’s metadata&nbsp;URL.  last_refreshed: The timestamp at which the collection or NFT was last refreshed by the Transpose backend (in ISO-8601&nbsp;format).  flattened_properties: Flattened properties of a collection.  __updated_block_number: The block number at which the collection was last&nbsp;updated.  collection.name: The name of the collection.

 Introduction <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py">ocean.py</a> is a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ocean-lib/">Python library</a> to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume data, using <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-1-introduction-installation-530295c3d3b4">Part 1</a> of this series introduced ocean.py, and described how to install it. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-2-set-up-locally-e232dc8d8182">Part 2</a> described how to set up for local testing, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/getting-started-with-ocean-py-part-3-set-up-remotely-a3cfec47a3fa">part 3</a> for&nbsp;remote.</p><p>This post is a fun one! We pick up where part 2 &amp; 3 left off, and walk you through the main&nbsp;flow:</p><p>In this post, you’ll publish a data asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it. We’ll closely follow ocean.py’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md">main-flow.md</a>.</p> Background: Ocean&nbsp;Basics <p>This post assumes a basic understanding of Ocean data NFTs and datatokens. If you don’t yet know about these, we recommend learning about those first, by text or&nbsp;video.</p>  To learn by text: start with the simple description at <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/data-nfts-and-data-tokens">oceanprotocol.com main site</a>. If you want to dive deeper yet, then check out Ocean docs on <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/architecture">architecture</a> and <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/datanft-and-datatoken">Data NFTs &amp; datatokens</a>.  Or, check out the video version&nbsp;👇.   Main Flow:&nbsp;Video <p>Here’s a video version this post 👇. Or, jump straight into the text content&nbsp;below.</p> Main Flow:&nbsp;Text <p>Steps in the&nbsp;flow:</p>  Alice publishes dataset  Bob gets access to the dataset (faucet, priced,&nbsp;etc)  Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset  <p>Let’s go!</p><p>(Note: this blog post is up-to-date as of Apr 2023, but if 2+ months have passed, we recommend using the READMEs directly for up-to-date instructions. )</p> 1. Alice publishes dataset <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4pp3qyq5tc&amp;ab_channel=Smokie-Topic">Alice! Alice! Who the f*** is&nbsp;Alice?</a></p><p>Well, for the steps below, you are Alice!&nbsp;<a href="https://emojipedia.org/girl/">👧</a></p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #data info<br>name = "Branin dataset"<br>url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentmc/branin/main/branin.arff"<br><br>#create data asset<br>(data_nft, datatoken, ddo) = ocean.assets.create_url_asset(name, url, {"from": alice})<br><br>#print<br>print("Just published asset:")<br>print(f"  data_nft: symbol={data_nft.symbol}, address={data_nft.address}")<br>print(f"  datatoken: symbol={datatoken.symbol}, address={datatoken.address}")<br>print(f"  did={ddo.did}") <p>You’ve now published an Ocean&nbsp;asset!</p>  data_nft is the base (base&nbsp;IP)  datatoken for access by others (licensing)  ddo holding&nbsp;metadata  <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-publish-details">Appendix: Publish Details</a>.)</p> 2. Bob gets access to the&nbsp;dataset <p>If you’ve ever spent time in the world of crypto, or cryptography:</p><blockquote>Wherever there’s a Bob, there’s always an&nbsp;Alice</blockquote><p>OK, OK. So yes, there’s a Bob. He wants to consume the dataset that Alice just published. The first step is for Bob to get 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Below, we show four possible approaches:</p>  A &amp; B are when Alice is in contact with Bob. She can mint directly to him, or mint to herself and transfer to&nbsp;him.  C is when Alice wants to share access for free, to&nbsp;anyone  D is when Alice wants to sell&nbsp;access  <p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei<br><br>#Approach A: Alice mints datatokens to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach B: Alice mints for herself, and transfers to Bob<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.transfer(bob, to_wei(1), {"from": alice})<br><br>#Approach C: Alice posts for free, via a dispenser / faucet; Bob requests &amp; gets<br>datatoken.create_dispenser({"from": alice})<br>datatoken.dispense(to_wei(1), {"from": bob})<br><br>#Approach D: Alice posts for sale; Bob buys<br># D.1 Alice creates exchange<br>price = to_wei(100)<br>exchange = datatoken.create_exchange({"from": alice}, price, ocean.OCEAN_address)<br><br># D.2 Alice makes 100 datatokens available on the exchange<br>datatoken.mint(alice, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br>datatoken.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(100), {"from": alice})<br><br># D.3 Bob lets exchange pull the OCEAN needed<br>OCEAN_needed = exchange.BT_needed(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0)<br>ocean.OCEAN_token.approve(exchange.address, OCEAN_needed, {"from":bob})<br><br># D.4 Bob buys datatoken<br>exchange.buy_DT(to_wei(1), consume_market_fee=0, tx_dict={"from": bob}) <p>You may not realize it, but you just covered a crazy amount of ground!! You just went through four different ways to share data! Minting, transferring, faucets, and&nbsp;selling!</p><p>What made this possible is that the access control to the data is tokenized, via datatokens. Then you were basically using the tools of crypto to move those datatokens around.</p><p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-faucet-details">Appendix: Dispenser / Faucet Details</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-exchange-details">Exchange Details</a>.)</p> 3. Bob consumes the&nbsp;dataset <p>Bob now has the datatoken for the dataset! Time to download the dataset and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Bob sends a datatoken to the service to get access<br>order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(ddo, {"from": bob})<br><br># Bob downloads the file. If the connection breaks, Bob can try again<br>asset_dir = ocean.assets.download_asset(ddo, bob, './', order_tx_id)<br>import os<br>file_name = os.path.join(asset_dir, "file0") <p>Let’s check that the file is downloaded. In a new&nbsp;console:</p> cd my_project/datafile.did:op:*<br>cat file0 <p>The beginning of the file should contain the following contents:</p> % 1. Title: Branin Function<br>% 3. Number of instances: 225<br>% 6. Number of attributes: 2<br>@relation branin<br>@attribute 'x0' numeric<br>@attribute 'x1' numeric<br>@attribute 'y' numeric<br>@data<br>-5.0000,0.0000,308.1291<br>-3.9286,0.0000,206.1783<br>... <p>(For more info, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/main-flow.md#appendix-consume-details">Appendix: Consume Details</a>.)</p> Conclusion / Next&nbsp;Step <p>You’ve now done a walk-through of the main flow, congrats! As Alice, you published a data asset, posted for free / for sale, and had that Bob guy dispense it / buy it and consume&nbsp;it.</p><p>Have questions? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/720631837122363412">Here’s</a> the Ocean Protocol #dev-support channel on&nbsp;Discord.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Identity, however, is at the core of most of our interactions in daily life, both physically and digitally, with ever-increasing dependency on digital interactions. </p><p>However, since the internet was built without an identity layer natively baked in, significant coordination and collaboration efforts are required to ensure what is built and adopted can serve use cases across the internet, spanning various industries across the public and private sectors.</p><p>Spruce participates in various working groups of global standards bodies and foundations to champion open-source, interoperable solutions that help create a more privacy-forward, user-centric internet. We have also implemented and architected multiple global emerging identity standards, such as W3C Verifiable Credentials, Sign-In with Ethereum, and more.</p><p>Here are non-exhaustive highlights from our participation in the first quarter of 2023:</p> Global Working Groups: <p>W3C Working Groups: We continued participating as co-editor in the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group to work on the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Credentials Data Model (VCDM) v2.0 standard</a> where we are also leading the holder binding discussion that will contribute to more secure digital credentials for pure online use cases and interactions with digital identity documents. Additionally, we are actively contributing to the definition of the formal semantics for the new RDF 1.2 quoted triples in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/08/rdf-star-wg-charter/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">W3C RDF-star Working Group</a>.</p><p>ISO Working Groups: We continued our participation in <a href="https://www.iso.org/committee/45144.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 Cards and security devices for personal identification</a> in WG4 and WG10 as delegated experts to work on ISO 18013-7, a specification to securely exchange mobile Driver’s License (mDL) online, and on ISO 23220 which is a series of specifications for building blocks for mobile identity documents (mdoc).</p><p>OpenID Foundation Working Groups: We continued our participation in the OpenID Foundation AB/C Working Group as co-editor and contributors. We helped to publish the second implementer’s draft of <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OpenID4VP)</a> and contributed to <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">OpenID for Credential Issuance (OpenID4CI)</a> to get it closer to the first implementer’s draft.</p><p>Additional Working Groups: We joined the <a href="https://openwallet.foundation/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Open Wallet Foundation (OWF)</a>, a project of the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member and are working to stand up its first Technical Advisory Committee with some of the world’s largest digital identity technology and solutions providers. You can learn more about the OWF here: </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">  Spruce Joins the OpenWallet Foundation  We’re pleased to announce that Spruce has joined the Open Wallet Foundation, a new open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation Europe, as a founding member.  SpruceSpruce    </a> Ethereum Standards: <p>At the end of 2022, Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE), or <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-4361</a>, moved from “Draft” to “Review” and we are currently incorporating feedback from the community to improve the specification. We are actively working on advancing the specification to the next stage.</p><p>After we authored and published a draft for Sign-In with Ethereum Capabilities, or ReCaps (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EIP-5573</a>), we received significant interest from the Ethereum Magicians and Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA) communities. As one of the outcomes, we updated the specification to align it more closely with the User Controlled Authorization Network (UCAN) Specification for interoperability and composability reasons.</p> Authorship and Events: <p>In February, we finalized and published our <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot11-the-hague/blob/master/final-documents/identifier-binding.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Rebooting the Web of Trust (RWOT) whitepaper</a> on holder binding from RWOT XI: The Hague, which is co-authored by people from the Federal Printing House of Germany, TNO, Danube Tech, and other leaders in the identity standards community.</p><p>Across the world, there are various digital credential and digital identity guidelines currently being considered for various purposes, like official government-issued documentation, learning and employment records, and more. As contributors to many of the standards paving the way for global adoption, we are thoughtful in reviewing and submitting comments to improve specifications where feedback or formal comments are requested. </p><p>We recently submitted comments for the <a href="https://www.scc.ca/en/news-events/news/2021/national-technical-specification-for-digital-credentials-provide-greater-privacy-and-security-for?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Canadian National Technical Specification for Digital Credentials and Digital Trust Services</a>. We also intend to provide comments for the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">NIST SP 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, which had its latest major revision in 2017 to accelerate the adoption of the work that is happening across the other various working groups, such as ISO and W3C, that we participate in.</p><p>And last, but certainly not least, next week, we will have a live demonstration of interoperability with Microsoft and Ping Identity at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Internet Identity Workshop (IIW)</a> in Mountain View, California. This quarter, we continued our engagement in the DIF JWT Interoperability Presentation Profile Initiative, and at IIW, we will demonstrate interoperability based on the OpenID for Verifiable Credentials specifications. We look forward to meeting you there!</p><p>We fundamentally believe this work to champion global standards is core to the success of further adoption of digital identity, allowing for more secure and privacy-preserving, yet seamless interactions that build digital trust across the web. </p><p>If you're interested in discussing or contributing to any of our work outlined above, please contact our team. </p> <p>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>There are several ways that hackers can steal passwords, and even encrypted credentials might be vulnerable to attacks.</p>
 What Is a Rainbow Table Attack? 
<p>A rainbow table attack is a type of attack used to crack password hashes through the use of a table of common passwords, hashed, allowing an attacker to discover the original password. Password databases typically “hash,” or irreversibly encrypt, passwords so that they cannot be used to sign into user accounts if that database is stolen. Rainbow table attacks rely on precomputed tables called rainbow tables containing these hashes. By using these tables, an attacker can reverse a hashed password back to its plaintext form more efficiently than by using brute-force methods or simple lookup tables.</p>
<p>A rainbow table is a precomputed set of hash values used to crack password databases that do not store their information as plaintext. These tables allow attackers to access secure systems without guessing a password.</p>
<p>The attacker first creates a “chain” of hash values to generate a rainbow table. This is done by starting with a known value and applying the hash function to get the corresponding hash value. The attacker then compares hashed values from the table against hashed values from a database to look for a matching hash value. When a matching hash value is found, the attacker can use the corresponding password to log in to the target system or access the user’s sensitive information.</p>
<p>Rainbow tables are practical because they can be pre-computed for a specific hash function and password length and reused across multiple targets using the same hash function. This means the attacker doesn’t need to generate new Rainbow Tables for each target, making the attack more efficient.</p>
 What Are Some Real-World Examples of Rainbow Table Attacks? 
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack">LinkedIn</a>: In 2012, hackers accessed a database containing over 6.5 million hashed passwords from the social networking site LinkedIn. They then used rainbow tables to crack the passwords and leaked them online, exposing millions of user accounts. 
 <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/adobe-online-attack-was-bigger-than-previously-thought/">Adobe Systems</a>: In 2013, hackers accessed a database containing over 150 million encrypted passwords from Adobe Systems. The passwords were encrypted using a weak hashing algorithm, making them easy to crack using Rainbow Tables. 
 <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/07/ubuntu-forums-hacked-2-million-usernames-stolen">Ubuntu Forums</a>: In 2013, the Ubuntu Forums website was hacked, and the attackers obtained a database containing over 1.8 million usernames and hashed passwords. They used brute force and Rainbow Tables to crack the passwords and gain access to the user accounts. 
 
 How Can I Protect Against Rainbow Table Attacks? 
<p>There are several ways to protect against Rainbow Table attacks:</p>
 
 Use Good Password Hygiene: The strength of a password is crucial in protecting against Rainbow Table attacks. The longer and more complex a password is, the more difficult it will be for attackers to guess or crack it. It’s also important to use a different password for each account so that the others will still be secure if one password is compromised. 
 Use Hash Salting: A salted hash is a password combined with a random value before being hashed. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to use precomputed Rainbow Tables to crack passwords because the salt value will differ for each password, even if the passwords are identical. 
 Use a Strong Encryption Method: When storing passwords or other sensitive information, use a robust encryption method to protect it. Algorithms like AES or RSA can provide strong protection against unauthorized access and should be used in conjunction with other security measures. 
 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication: Two-factor authentication adds extra security to the authentication process by requiring users to provide a second piece of information in addition to their password, such as a one-time code generated by a smartphone app or sent via SMS. 
 Update Database and Encryption Software: Attackers can exploit software vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. It’s important to keep all software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent Rainbow Table attacks and other types of cyber attacks. 
 
 How Do Rainbow Table Attacks Differ From Other Forms of Cracking? 
<p>Rainbow tables, brute force, and dictionary attacks are methods used by attackers to crack passwords, but they differ in their approach and effectiveness.</p>
 
 A brute force attack works by trying all possible combinations of characters in a password until the correct password is found. This method is very time consuming, as it can take a very long time to try all possible combinations. However, it can still be effective against weak passwords. 
 A dictionary attack, on the other hand, works by trying a list of commonly used passwords, dictionary words, or variations of these words. This method is faster than a brute force attack because it only tries some possible combinations, but it’s less effective against complex or unique passwords. 
 
<p>As we can see, the rainbow table doesn’t rely on “guessing” in the same way as brute force or dictionary attacks. Also, rainbow tables, unlike the other two options, can potentially break through protective cryptography.</p>

<p><br>
At Northern Block, our primary goal is to facilitate the orchestration of trust tasks as seamlessly as possible. We aim to make it easier for our partners, customers, and the entire world to engage in digital interactions with trust embedded into the fabric.</p>
<p>The concept of a “trust task” was first introduced to me in the Trust over IP Foundation’s Technical Architecture Specification, but the term was originally coined by Daniel Hardman, who describes it very nicely in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1V3v3-g6pAR8oMhk0Az-pheFM7PRCxJO9OsonH7STi5I/edit#slide=id.g2082f750436_0_349">recent presentation of his</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trust tasks differ from applications in important ways: they are multi-party, and they should be composable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I really liked how Daniel displayed trust tasks within the ToIP hourglass model, as it really showcases its composable nature. I’ve taken the liberty of adapting his slide in the context of Northern Block to showcase where we are focused within the large spectrum of digital trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>You’ll observe that there is a trust task called “ask trust registry.” To support this task, we have been dedicating efforts into developing the necessary supporting systems to ensure its smooth operation.</p>
<p><br>
What is a Trust Registry?<br>
</p>
 
 A trust registry essentially serves as a source of truth and authoritative information. The governance framework behind a trust registry is what makes it authoritative for its trust ecosystem. If there is confidence in the governance framework, it naturally leads to confidence in the authority imposed by the governance body within the trust registry or source of truth. 
 It’s crucial to recognize that a verifiable data registry (such as a blockchain or DLT) doesn’t always provide a source of truth. These registries can serve as storage for information related to a public entity’s decentralized identifiers, DID documents, schemas, credential definitions, and more. Although they offer immutable data storage with resolution and discovery capabilities, they may not always deliver authoritative information. 
 This is where the trust registry comes into play. By providing authoritative information backed by a strong governance framework, trust registries support the attainment of digital trust and ensures that the entities participating in an ecosystem are reliable and credible. If you’d like to learn more about the role of governance, I highly recommend listening to the insightful <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast conversation I had with Scott Perry</a>, a colleague in the digital trust space. Scott chairs the Governance Stack Working Group at the Trust over IP (ToIP) Foundation, and our discussion delves into this important topic. 
 
<p>​​Within a typical credential acceptance trust task within <a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a>, several sub-trust tasks may need to be orchestrated in order for a party to accept a credential offer. These may include peer connections, secure messaging, negotiations, and the consultation of external supporting systems such as trust registries.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>The holder receiving a credential offer may want to invoke other trust tasks to assist them in making the decision to accept the credential offer.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Northern Block has been collaborating closely with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacqueslatour/">Jacques Latour</a>, Chief Technology &amp; Security Officer at the <a href="https://www.cira.ca/">Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA)</a>, which manages over three million .ca domains as the .ca top-level domain (TLD) registry. Together, we’ve been exploring how the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure can enable digital trust, particularly in the context of trust registries and their role in maintaining authoritative records for .ca domain owners. We recently co-published an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-latour-dns-and-digital-trust/">IETF Working Draft</a> of our work if you wish to have more information.</p>
<p>When an entity is presented with a verifiable claim, there are three things they will want to ensure:</p>
 
 That a claim hasn’t been altered/falsified at any point in time (cryptographic verifiability, verifiable data registries) ✅ 
 That a claim has accurate representation (DID authentication, accurate representation) 🤨 
 That a claim has authority (authorization, authority) 🤨 
 
<p>While cryptographic verifiability is a fundamental aspect of verifiable credential exchange protocols, it doesn’t necessarily guarantee the accurate representation or authority of a specific public key or decentralized identifier (DID).</p>
<p>To address this human trust issue, we’ve utilized the decentralized DNS infrastructure to create a flexible linkage between issuing bodies’ domain names and their DIDs, which doesn’t impose a specific DID method. By enabling issuers to edit their DID documents with pointers to their DNS records, our approach allows for various DID methods to leverage the DNS infrastructure for added assurance.</p>
<p><br>
Why DNS?</p>
 
 The Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure is considered global, unique, resilient, and highly secure, particularly when the Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are utilized. As a global system, DNS operates across the internet, mostly known for ensuring that domain names are translated into IP addresses, making it easier for users to access websites and online services. The uniqueness of the DNS lies in the fact that each domain name corresponds to a unique label such as trustregistry.nborbit.io, avoiding any confusion or conflicts. The DNS infrastructure is resilient, as it relies on a distributed hierarchical structure, which minimizes the risk of a single point of failure. Finally, the security of the DNS is significantly enhanced by the implementation of DNSSEC, which provides cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data within the DNS, preventing attacks such as DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. 
 The exclusive write access granted to domain name owners for their DNS records, coupled with the proper implementation of DNSSEC, enhances the records’ authoritative nature, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the information they provide. This write access is cryptographically verifiable through a chain of trust that, in the Canadian context, flows from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to the Canadian Internet Registration Authority (CIRA), and then further down to the .ca domain owners. 
 Beyond the cryptographic trust, CIRA has established processes and agreements with domain name registrars to ensure that .ca domain names meet specific criteria, such as having a Canadian presence. The registry operated by CIRA can be considered sources of truth because they are authoritative in the context of .ca domain names and are connected to existing governance mechanisms managed by CIRA (more details on CIRA governance <a href="https://www.cira.ca/about-cira/board-and-governance">here</a>). This governance structure further reinforces the trustworthiness of the registries, making them reliable sources of information for .ca domain names and their associated entities. 
 
<p><br>
We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A credential issuer can ensure that certain information is synced up with their DNS records.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two things that this implementation facilitates for parties are:</p>
 
 To authenticate the DID against a second source, to achieve greater assurance that the DID owner is indeed the same party that owns the domain. This added layer of trust strengthens the overall reliability and security of the system. 
 To get information related to trust registries that the DID claims to be listed in. This enables the discoverability of trust registries that may have been unknown prior. 
 
<p>Orbit Enterprise users can utilize the Trust Decision Helper to assist with the aforementioned points. In the screenshot below, you can observe how a holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
<p></p>
 <p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records using the Trust Decision Helper. They are offered with information that can be used as inputs to inform their trust decision.</p> 
<p><br>
With hundreds or thousands of trust registries in existence, it becomes virtually impossible for a central entity to manage their locations and purposes. Furthermore, having a central entity overseeing all global trust registries is not ideal for promoting privacy and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Currently, there are numerous identity systems functioning within specific ecosystems, each serving as a source of truth within their respective contexts. Centralizing the management of these systems is not practical. The challenge lies in discovering the presence of trust registries and understanding their associated governance frameworks. This is where DNS comes in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we trust that an entity is accurately represented by their DID, they should be able to guide us towards sources of truth or trust registries in which they are listed. This decentralized and privacy-preserving approach enables direct interaction with the entity, instead of relying on a central authority. By leveraging the widespread adoption and trust established within the DNS infrastructure, we can discover relevant trust registries and gather inputs to inform our trust decisions.</p>
 <p>The holder was able to validate that the issuer who offered them a credential has authority to offer said credential within a specific trust registry.</p> 
<p><br>
In the final screen which completes the flow, a few key points are evident. Firstly, additional assurance is achieved by validating the match between the DID written in the DNS system and the one presented, enabling cross-verification through two distinct trust systems. Secondly, verification is conducted within a trust registry that the issuer directed the holder to. A third check is performed against the same DID presented in the document, which is also listed in both the DNS records and the specific trust registry. The holder is also given the confidence that, based on this trust registry, the issuer possesses the authority to issue the credential they initially offered.</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: we could have presented the holder with the trust registry’s referenced governance framework as well. Something to add in future iterations of the Trust Decision Helper.</p></blockquote>
<p>With these additional inputs, the holder can exit the Trust Decision Helper flow and return to their credential negotiation workflow. They may choose to engage in further trust tasks, such as sending secure messages to the issuing body if they have questions, concerns, or wish to negotiate further. Alternatively, they may be satisfied with the inputs received and feel comfortable making their trust decision and accepting the credential offer.</p>
<p>By incorporating the DNS and trust registry functionality into Orbit Enterprise, we aim to facilitate the scaling of trust registries while enhancing their discovery and usage. The joint presentations between CIRA and Northern Block at IdentityNorth and ICANN have garnered positive feedback, and we continue to actively participate in the Trust Over IP Foundation’s Trust Registry Task Force as well as the Identity Lab of Canada’s Trust Registry Community of Practice. </p>
<p>We will be presenting this work at the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> next week, and look forward to engaging in interesting conversations and further advancing what we think to be an important initiative.&nbsp;</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">Leveraging DNS in Digital Trust: Credential Exchanges and Trust Registries</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Just recently, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>, a new security offering based on a combination of the GPT-4 language model, the well-known technology provided by OpenAI that also powers ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft’s own technology, data, knowledge, and security-specific model from their ongoing global threat intelligence.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, the new solution, which is not publicly available yet, is positioned as a “copilot” augmenting the security analysts in SOCs (Security Operations Centers) / CDCs (Cyber Defense Centers) and empowering them.</p>
<p>A use-case specific application of GPT-4</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot resembles ChatGPT to a certain extent, but also vastly differs from it. The users can prompt the solution and receive answers. These answers are not just text, but also contain flowcharts/visuals that detail the anatomy of the incident that is researched. All or selected parts of the analysis can be stored in a pinboard that summarizes an investigation and that can be shared with others.</p>
<p>The solution also comes with predefined promptbooks. Promptbooks are pre-engineered collections of prompts for various use cases such as malware analysis. Thus, the user must not think about the right questions (or prompts) but can rely on preconfigured analytical steps. Microsoft provides promptbooks, but users can add their own ones and share them.</p>
<p>Log analysis, context, and resolutions</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot analyzes log files and uses the data from Microsoft’s global threat intelligence. It helps in identifying affected systems and accounts and reengineering attacks so that the accounts that had been compromised first can be identified. It currently works closely with Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender, with other integrations to be added. With the multitude of security tools many organizations have deployed, openness for integration to other vendor’s solutions would be something I’d like to see in the future.</p>
<p>All that is done in a way that still requires some level of security skills, but way less than a manual analysis would require. While being somewhat skilled in security, I wouldn’t claim to be capable of doing threat analysis and investigation myself. However, in the demo I received from Microsoft, there was nothing in any of the responses I did not understand. In other words: The Security Copilot would have turned me into a security analyst, by augmenting me.</p>
<p>The tool can even create a PowerPoint file with the condensed results of an investigation, for instance, for reporting to the management. As mentioned, the solution will become integrated with all major Microsoft security services but remain a separate offering.</p>
<p>Augmenting Intelligence</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Copilot, even while being just announced and, as of now, being integrated with only some of the Microsoft security products, is an impressive showcase for the benefit and business value AI can deliver. It can help in closing the skills gap in security and speeding up security analysis. This is done by using a specific model and a vast amount of global data and applying them to the concrete log information of a customer. The customer data is not shared and is not used for machine learning purposes. However, users can rate the quality of responses.</p>
<p>I must admit that I’m impressed by what I have seen so far: A solution delivering tangible benefits and empowering and augmenting human analysts instead of threatening to replace them. This is exactly what we should expect from emerging AI applications, in cybersecurity and in general.</p>

<p>There’s been some movement in state and federal data privacy laws in the United States. Here are three things to know about the regulatory landscape in 2023:</p>



 1. More states are introducing data privacy laws 



<p>The International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">says</a>&nbsp;state-level momentum for comprehensive privacy bills is at an all-time high.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">California Privacy Rights Act</a>&nbsp;(CPRA) became fully effective on January 1, 2023. This Act is an amendment of the pioneering California Consumer Privacy Act which has been around since 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also on January 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>&nbsp;came into effect, while the<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb21-190">&nbsp;Colorado Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB00006&amp;which_year=2022">Connecticut Personal Data Privacy and Online Monitoring Act</a>&nbsp;both take effect on July 1 this year.</p>



<p>Utah will join the states leading the way on data privacy when the&nbsp;<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/static/SB0227.html">Utah Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;takes effect on December 31, 2023.</p>



<p>Follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">tracker</a>&nbsp;for a clear picture of the current state of play:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>We believe one reason for increased state momentum is probably the stalling on a federal data privacy law (see point 3). Some states have no doubt realized that their citizens can’t wait any longer. And that leads us to point 2 …</p>



 2. Protecting privacy through law is a growing priority for Americans 



<p>We’ll let the IAPP’s infographic speak for itself:</p>



Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-state-privacy-legislation-tracker/">IAPP</a>



<p>Consumers globally have been growing louder in their demands for data privacy for some time.</p>



<p>In 2020 we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">reported</a>:</p>



 
 High profile, significant, and regular&nbsp;<a href="https://www.purdueglobal.edu/blog/information-technology/worst-data-breaches-infographic/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;have spooked consumers.&nbsp; 



 Consumers generally get that they have to trade certain&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;for services, but are now warier of sharing their personal data.&nbsp; 



 Consumers want to control their own data and will act to do so if they can. 



 Levels of consumer trust for brands is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative">generally low</a>.&nbsp; 



 Consumers will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/14/half-of-americans-have-decided-not-to-use-a-product-or-service-because-of-privacy-concerns/">abandon</a>&nbsp;brands or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/security/cybersecurity-series-2019-cps.pdf">delay&nbsp;purchases</a>&nbsp;where they perceive a risk to their personal data. 



 The regulatory screws are tightening to protect consumers. 
 



<p>Indeed, privacy is the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">defining issue</a>&nbsp;of this decade that we predicted it would be. So it’s good news that …</p>



 3. A federal data privacy law is (finally) looking more likely 



<p>The US is one of the only major global economies without&nbsp;strong&nbsp;national privacy laws&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.comforte.com/12-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">akin to the GDPR</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While hopes for a federal data privacy law in the US have been raised and dashed many times over many years,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/topics/adppa/">American Data Privacy and Protection Act</a>&nbsp;has progressed further than any other attempt at a US federal data privacy bill and is looking increasingly likely to pass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two sticking points have been whether bills would pre-empt state law or enable enforcement of a private right of action. Democrats argue for a private right of action that will give consumers legal rights if government fails to enforce the federal law, while Republicans want a federal law to pre-empt state laws to end the patchwork of compliance obligations on business. A counterpoint on the Republicans’ pre-emption position is that some states with strong laws, such as California, may end up with weaker protections if a federal law pre-empts&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&amp;part=4.&amp;lawCode=CIV&amp;title=1.81.5">CPRA</a>.</p>



<p>The ADPPA is a compromise position. It’s worth viewing the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/us_federal_privacy_legislation_tracker.pdf">IAPP’s Federal Data Privacy Tracker</a>&nbsp;to understand the details of ADPPA and each of the other privacy-related bills proposed in Congress to date.</p>

<p>Predict-ETH Round 4 just completed and we’re ready to announce the winners — drumroll, please! First, second, and third places go to Soptq ($2500), Cheloco Barrios ($1500), and Jesus Valle ($1000) respectively. Each of the winning predictions showcases how to monetize data successfully using Ocean Protocol’s open source tools for the blockchain. Congratulations to&nbsp;all!</p><p>Predict-ETH is a recurring data challenge to predict the price of ETH and win prize money, using the ocean.py library. Accurately predicting ETH can be a valuable tool in buying and selling ETH, DeFi trading, yield farming, or DeFi protocol development. If your predictions are consistently on point, then you can sell them as a data feed on Ocean Market, earning you even more&nbsp;income.</p><p>Of course, predicting ETH is no walk in the park. It’s a complex task that requires skill, knowledge, and a bit of luck. But that’s exactly why Ocean Protocol hosts regular Predict-ETH competitions — to help you sharpen your machine learning skills, learn from others, and potentially make some cash along the&nbsp;way.</p> Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Setup <p>Predict-ETH Round 4 kicked off on March 7th, 2023. The Round 4 README guided contestants how to make their submissions. <a href="https://desights.ai">Desights</a> was used to host the competition in a decentralized fashion. We held regular workshops with the community for anyone working on the Predict-ETH challenge who wanted facetime with the Ocean core&nbsp;team.</p><p>The submission deadline was April 5th, 2023, at 23:59 UTC. Competitors had to make predictions for ETH price up to 12 hours into the&nbsp;future.</p> Predict-ETH Round 4 Evaluation <p>We streamlined the evaluation criteria for winning in this&nbsp;round.</p><p>The winner = whoever has lowest prediction error (normalized mean-squared error, or NMSE). That’s all. There is no subjectivity.</p><p>To be eligible, competitors must have produced the outcomes that the README&nbsp;guides:</p><p>✅ Signed up to Desights platform, and registered for this competition</p><p>✅ Created an Ocean data&nbsp;NFT</p><p>✅ On the data NFT, set a value correctly: correct field label, correct # predictions, prediction values following correct formatting, predictions encrypted with proper encoding on judges’ public&nbsp;key</p><p>✅ Transferred data NFT to Ocean judges before the submission deadline</p><p>✅ Submitted txid of this transfer to the Desights&nbsp;platform</p><p>✅ All on Mumbai network, not another&nbsp;network</p> Predict-ETH Round 4&nbsp;Winners <p>We’re proud to announce winners for Predict-ETH Round&nbsp;4:</p><p>First place ($2,500) goes to&nbsp;Soptq.</p><p>Second place ($1,500) goes to Cheloco&nbsp;Barrios.</p><p>Third place ($1,000) goes to Jesus&nbsp;Valle.</p><p>Great work, Soptq, Cheloco Barrios, and Jesus&nbsp;Valle!</p><p>Round 3 Statistics: Table of NMSEs, Ranks,&nbsp;etc</p><p>The following table shows the NMSE and NMSE rank by competitor’s data NFT&nbsp;address.</p> Conclusion <p>Crypto price prediction can be an interesting and fun task — better yet, it can be monetized immediately!

 DID, GLN, DUNS, BIC, TIN, and LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers are essential tools in the modern business world where B2B value is high and trading across borders and supply chain management is complex. Such organisation identifiers help streamline transactions, communication, trust, and collaboration between different parties by identifying and connecting the parties involved. </p>
<p>This blog post will provide an overview of six common organisation identifiers: Decentralised Identifier (DID), Global Location Number (GLN), Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS), Bank Identifier Code (BIC), Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). We will also look briefly at their respective real-world use cases.</p>
<p>All these identifiers, except DUNS, are identified in the World Trade Organisation’s <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">Standards Toolkit for Cross-border Paperless Trade</a>.</p>
 Decentralised Identifier (DID) 
<p>DID is a framework and container for identity, but not an identity scheme. DIDs are often used in conjunction with distributed ledger technology, such as blockchain. It allows individuals, organisations, and things to be identified and connected without the need for a centralised authority, and enables privacy protecting systems.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DID can be used to store or reference verifiable digital identities for people, organisations, and devices, enabling secure and private communication, transactions, and authentication in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.</p>
 Global Location Number (GLN) 
<p>GLN is a proprietary 13-digit unique identifier developed by GS1. GLN allow organisations to identify physical locations, legal entities, or functions within their organisation. The identification data is supplied by the entity.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: GLN is used to manage and track the flow of goods and services in the supply chain, from manufacturers to distributors to retailers. </p>
 Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) 
<p>DUNS is a proprietary nine-digit identifier assigned and managed by privately owned Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B). The DUNS number is used to identify businesses, primarily being used to provide a method for tracking and assessing the creditworthiness and financial health of organisations. Once considered the “standard” for organisation identification, as of April 2022 the DUNS ceased being used by the US federal Government.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: DUNS numbers are commonly used by businesses and governments to evaluate potential suppliers, partners, and customers. They help organisations make informed decisions about credit risk, procurement, and market research. </p>
 Bank Identifier Code (BIC) 
<p>BIC, also known as the SWIFT code, is an entity-supplied alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies financial institutions and sub-elements within the organisation. It is used for international wire transfers and messages between banks, ensuring accurate routing of transactions. </p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: BIC is crucial for cross-border transactions, such as international wire transfers, securities trades, and foreign exchange transactions. </p>
 Trader Identification Number (TIN) 
<p>Trader Identification Number (TIN) is a unique identifier assigned to Authorised Economic Operators. An Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) is a party involved in the international movement of goods that has been certified by a national Customs administration. TINs are assigned by national bodies, typically governmental, for the purposes of customs processing of import and exports. TINs are not publicly available or referenceable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>See: <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/standtoolkit22_e.htm">WCO Guidelines on Trader Identification Number</a></p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: TINs are used by importers to enhance the data quality of Customs clearance processes, improve the visibility and transparency of supply chains, and enable Customs to enhance supply chain security.</p>
 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) 
<p>LEI is a 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities and group structures in a live, publicly accessible database. It was introduced by the supra-national not-for-profit Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) under the direction of the G20 and Financial Stability Board (FSB) as a single identifier to enhance transparency of “who is who” and “who owns whom”, to identify counterparties and reduce risk in transactions. Over 300 regulations require or recommend the use of LEI. LEIs are only issued by GLEIF-accredited LEI Issuers.</p>
<p>Real-World Use Case: LEI is used to identify parties involved in financial transactions, including banks, investment firms, and corporations. It helps regulators monitor systemic risks, reduce financial fraud, and increase transparency in financial markets. More recently the LEI has been incorporated into innovative new use cases including entity data management, digital signing, B2B Identity &amp; Access Management and others.</p>
 Conclusion – the case for the LEI 
<p>Organisation identifiers evolved for jurisdictional or vertical markets, historically leading to an over-complex and confusing choice for businesses. The LEI is designed to simplify the concept of organisation identity by providing both accessible identity reference data, and acting as a “connector” to other specific-purpose identifiers. For example, a partnership between the GLEIF and SWIFT to publish BIC-to-LEI mapping demonstrates the flexibility of the LEI to co-exist alongside legacy identifiers, to simplify otherwise costly entity data management processes. </p>
<blockquote><p>The one global identity behind every business.<br>
LEI is the linchpin that connects the dots across the universe of entity identification.<br>
Global LEI Foundation</p></blockquote>
<p>Global trade needs a standardised organisation identifier, and fortunately the LEI is well on the way to making the case to be the one.</p>

<p>Dock has just released a Credential Template Builder in <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> that enables users to create custom credential templates to accommodate their specific needs and a variety of use cases. Before this feature was added, if users wanted to issue credentials using other than our pre-built templates such as University Degree and Proof of Employment, they would have to use the API to create a custom template (schema) and define the custom attributes they wanted a credential to have, which requires more technical knowledge. The Credential Template Builder is a no-code feature that allows anyone to choose which details they would like to add on their credential such as license number, area of concentration on a university degree, and membership type. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO of Dock said, “The Custom Credential Builder was added in response to the growing demand from our customers for a customizable and easy-to-use solution that accommodates a diverse range of use cases. Our team has worked tirelessly to create a solution that doesn't require technical expertise, enabling organizations of all sizes to build and issue custom credentials efficiently, cost-effectively, and for those credentials to be interpreted by any entity verifying them.”</p><p>This feature can be used to define custom attributes on documents that can be issued as <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials</a> for a variety of use cases, including:</p>  Identity documents  Professional licenses  Membership associations  Training certificates  Employment records   Benefits of the Credential Template Builder for Issuing and Verifying Organizations   Efficient: With a no-code credential builder, issuing organizations can create custom credentials without needing to know how to code. This makes it much easier for organizations to efficiently create and issue credentials.  Cost-effective: Using a no-code verifiable credential builder can be much more cost-effective than hiring developers to build a custom solution.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>I’m Emilio and I’m from&nbsp;Spain.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? Do you have any pets? What are your hobbies? What is your superpower? <p>I studied electrotechnical systems, but as I like everything related to new technologies, I have trained myself in different areas, as new technologies and innovations appeared. I like many different sports including kitesurfing, surfing, and snowboarding. I also love animals and I have a dog and two cats. If I had to think of a superpower I already have, it’s my ability to have a go at everything in any field, professional or personal, no matter how challenging it might be — although, sometimes I think this is also a weakness because I don’t focus my skills on any one thing in particular.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology at its inception therefore I had the opportunity to see the birth of its MainNet almost 5 years ago. Many projects were taking their first steps then around that time, and then the initial coin offering (ICO) fever arose and many of those projects disappeared. However, thanks to the continuous work of the Ontology team, the Ontology project is still going&nbsp;strong.</p><p>I work as an administrator for the Hispanic Ontology community. I resolve concerns within the community and keep the community informed of the progress of the project. I also look for synergies with other projects in the sector, to possibly integrate with Ontology solutions. I keep up to date with all the news and developments surrounding the crypto sector, so that I can inform the Ontology community of new updates and discuss these updates with other community members. Some of my day-to-day duties include monitoring and updating social networks, translating content, and looking for opportunities to cooperate with other projects to perform AMAs or integrate ontology solutions.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Contacting other blockchain developers and finding synergies and ways to integrate Ontology’s solutions is exciting, but at the same time very complicated. With that said, it’s something I do enjoy very&nbsp;much.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In five years, I expect massive adoption of Web3. I would like to see major companies choosing to integrate Ontology’s digital identity solutions (DID) and data (DDXF) solutions to achieve that adoption. It would be great if I could play a part in&nbsp;this.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-community-administrator-emilio-bur-d07338913bea">Meet the Team: Community Administrator, Emilio Bur</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork is a major milestone in the Ethereum<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain,</a> especially with its migration to proof-of-stake. This upgrade brings several benefits to the network like increased security, improved scalability and higher throughput, but the most important thing is the ability to pay ETH staking rewards.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To become a validator on the Ethereum network, users must have at least 32ETH. Those who can’t afford that amount of Ether can join shared staking pools like Lido or Rocket Pool. In such pools, rewards are proportionally smaller but still profitable as long as users remain staked for an extended period of time. &nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the biggest changes for validators introduced in Shapell is the ability to pay rewards for their work, which has not been possible since Merge.&nbsp;Rewards are now paid out to actual validators (instead of being split between them and end users). However, this doesn’t mean that end users won’t see any reward from their staked Ether – it simply means that their reward will come from the pool operators they stake their ETH with via smart contracts instead of directly from the Ethereum protocol. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another important feature of Shapella is that up to 1800 validators per day can fully unstake, which would equate to 57,600 ETH (~$113 million). This allows for a gradual release of rewards and prevents serious price drops due to drastic dumps by large investors. Additionally, in each block up to 16 validators can make withdrawals which creates even more liquidity on Ether and helps prevent bank-runs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The example below shows how ETH rewards payments are handled in Coinfirm Analytics Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to its records, one specific address (0xcfc7E96Be27d836b034b37132052549611341108) received one reward which can be seen in its balance graph on the AML Report. It also affects the overall address balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As this is not a typical “transaction”, this transfer does not have a transaction<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/hash/"> hash </a>and was not sent from a regular ETH address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To handle this, all rewards made after Shapella, appear on Coinfirm Analytics Visualiser under the synthetic address 0x00000000000000000000000000000WITHDRAWALS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This shows how Coinfirm Analytics tools keep track of all transaction movements related to Ethereum Shapella Hard Fork, no matter if it comes from or goes into this synthetic address or other ETH addresses associated with participants in the network.&nbsp;</p>

 Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing Spherity &amp; Legisym co-hosted webinar key takeaways<p>The PDG Blueprint is a functional design recommendation for the pharmaceutical industry to meet DSCSA compliance. But what does it mean for my DSCSA project? That’s what <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/georg-j%C3%BCrgens/">Georg Jürgens</a>, Spherity, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dwkessler/">David Kessler</a>, Legisym, discussed in our co-hosted webinar.</p><p>As co-chairs of the <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">Open Credentialing Initiative’s </a>Steering Committee, Georg and David explained the <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/PDG-Blueprint-Chapter-6.pdf">PDG Blueprint chapter “Credentialing and User Authentication”</a> and demonstrated how using OCI-specified credentials can positively impact a trading partner’s DSCSA project. They also shared their practical experience and knowledge acquired over the years to solve the challenge for Trading Partners to authenticate and authorize their counterparties in DSCSA-related Product Verifications.</p><p>We’ve put together a few key takeaways from the&nbsp;webinar.</p> #1: A network of systems requires interoperability. <p>Each participant in the supply chain has the choice between a multitude of systems and solution providers. These must be able to communicate with each other to meet DSCSA requirements. We need to ensure that all the participants are interoperable with each other, from pharmacies to manufacturers to protect healthcare supply chain security. This is why PDG collaborated with various stakeholders on the ‘Foundational Blueprint for DSCSA 2023 Interoperability’ to address TI/TS data exchange, product verification and tracing, authorized trading partner authentication and other key DSCSA requirements.</p>Source: Partnership for DSCSA Governance, PDG Blueprint #2: Credentialing as a security and authentication layer in electronic interactions. <p>While GLNs are re-usable enterprise identifiers, they are publicly available and, thus, cannot sufficiently identify trading partners in electronic interactions on their own, nor do they prove “authorized” status. That’s where OCI-aligned credentialing comes into play and closes the compliance gap. Credentialing adds a layer of security without changing current standards and provides digital evidence of who the interacting trading partner is and that they have the proper license or registration to be considered an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) as defined by&nbsp;DSCSA.</p> #3: Compliance decision: Automated or manual ATP&nbsp;checks? <p>If you opt for manual checks, you should understand that these are not compatible with VRS-based interactions. That means, the response can’t go back through the VRS process and turns into a manual process for both sides, requiring emails, phone calls, or other methods to facilitate the line of questioning: Who is the Trading Partner? Is the Trading Partner authorized? Is it really the Trading Partner who’s interacting with me at this very moment? It can turn into a very labor-intensive method. In contrast, if you have a credentialing process in place, the verification happens within far less than a minute. The decision to choose between these compliance options is up to each trading&nbsp;partner.</p>Automated ATP checks through OCI Credentialing for DSCSA Compliance.<p>If you made it this far and would like to get more guidance on OCI-specified credentials in the context of DSCSA, you might want to watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/GbrVcIb7Bcg">webinar recording</a> for more insights.</p><p>If you’re curious to see how the OCI-aligned credentialing works in action, get access to our <a href="https://www.caro.vc/register">demo&nbsp;now</a>!</p> Further reading <p>If you’re already familiar with the Open Credentialing Initiative (<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">OCI</a>), Verification Router Services (VRS), <a href="https://dscsagovernance.org/blueprint/">PDG Blueprint</a>, <a href="https://www.spherity.com/">Spherity</a>, or <a href="https://legisym.com/">Legisym</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/how-centralized-atp-repositories-complicate-dscsa-regulated-product-verifications-dc51a8bc672e">this article </a>is valuable for you to learn more about ATP&nbsp;checks.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/takeaways-from-the-webinar-the-implementers-guide-pdg-blueprint-on-credentialing-a67b25fcbaac">Takeaways from the webinar — The Implementers Guide: PDG Blueprint on Credentialing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With online gambling the preferred method for gaming in today’s society, both operators and players want to feel safe as the popularity of online betting continues to increase. However, with that comes certain responsibilities from both the operator and the player. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/online-gambling-market">With 2022’s global online gambling market valued at $63.53 billion</a>, online casinos want to guarantee that their players are practicing responsible gaming through developing information solutions that support and assist gamblers, safeguard the authenticity of gambling activities, and prevent fraudulent activities, thus giving players the assurance of using a safe online gambling site.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, there might come reservations from both parties that their time and efforts must be sacrificed in order to practice safe gaming, but that’s quite the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is responsible gaming and why is it important?&nbsp; 



<p>Responsible gaming is all about prevention. Players want to enjoy themselves, but sometimes things can go too far, or individuals might take advantage of the system. Instead, responsible gaming is a concept that encompasses several policies and requirements which apply to gambling stakeholders. These policies and requirements make sure operators adhere to the highest standards of quality, while offering a safe user experience that protects people from the potential negative consequences of online gambling.</p>



<p>The creation and maintenance of a socially responsible gambling environment and the provision of tools to support gamblers with their gambling behavior lies at the core of the <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2022/02/Consumer-Protection-in-Online-Gambling-Regulation-Jan31-EGBA-Final.pdf">European Commision’s Recommendation</a> principles. Although it is up to the individual players to take advantage of the tools being offered, it is up to the Member States to ensure that appropriate tools that facilitate safer gambling practices are available. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, ”the Recommendation specifies that online gambling operators should be required to allow players to set their own financial and temporal limits, to offer time-outs, temporary breaks and long-term self-exclusion schemes, to provide gamblers with information regarding their playing and expenditure patterns, and to initiate engagement with any customers whose playing patterns give indication of the potential development of gambling problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, it is suggested that gambling websites should display links to relevant support helplines and other details of support organizations in order to ensure responsible gambling. Furthermore, Member States are urged to&nbsp;create national self-exclusion registers that would enable players to exclude themselves from all online gambling operators licensed in that jurisdiction and to ensure that all operators have access to such registers.&nbsp;Through this encouragement, the number of Member States that offer national self-exclusion registers has actually increased over the past three years&nbsp;to a total number of 16. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus,&nbsp;gambling operators have the opportunity to give their customers all the tools they need to practice responsible gambling. However, it isn’t only through self-exclusion and monitoring gambling behavior that this will be achieved. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;entails a few more aspects on the side of the stakeholder. Here is a list that operators should be aware of and implement in order to establish responsible gaming:&nbsp;</p>



  Protecting vulnerable gamblers with responsible gaming tools and self-exclusion lists&nbsp;  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">Preventing underage gambling</a>&nbsp;  Incorporating safety measures to fight criminal activities&nbsp;such as i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/chip-dumping/">chip dumping as part of money laundering schemes</a>  Providing an information policy&nbsp;  Having an online payment protection&nbsp;  Maintaining a secure online environment&nbsp;  Complying with ethical and responsible marketing&nbsp;  



<p>The importance is therefore driven home through the above practices. Thus, companies in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">online gambling</a> sector who implement the above measures act as role models when it comes to the importance of responsible gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







 Underage gambling and fraud prevention. 



<p>Not only are vulnerable gamblers protected, as well as underage gamblers, but by having a safe online gambling site it allows the operator to fight criminal activities, which put not only the company in jeopardy, but also its players. With underage gambling becoming more popular, with <a href="https://www.roulettesites.org/blog/responsible-gambling/underage-gambling.php">nearly 40% of 11-16 year-olds wagering their own money</a> in the UK, this is one of the many reasons why <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">countries such as the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-germany-regulations/">Germany place heavy restrictions</a> on online gambling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the case of criminal activities, fraud is a serious problem in many aspects of the online world, not excluding online gaming. This is particularly the case when big sports events occur and operators see an increase in user activity. <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/news/2022/04/29/62427-digital-gambling-fraud-rate-grows-50--in-q1-industry-marks-secondhighest-increase">Just in the first quarter of 2022, the global online gambling fraud rate grew to 50%</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In consequence, safe online gambling sites are required to verify the identity of their players in order to prevent such cases, both fraud and underage gambling alike, from happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What does responsible gaming or safe gambling mean for gambling operators? 



<p>No matter the jurisdiction, responsible gaming is at the core of all regulated operators. This means that operators must ensure that their customers gamble in a safe and controlled environment by implementing practices to prevent and combat gambling addiction.</p>



<p>Thus, when looking at responsible gaming from an operator’s perspective, KYC is an important part of the matrix due to getting an overall picture of the players on their sites. Without identifying a player, monitoring that individual’s gambling behavior would not be possible. As such, KYC is crucial when it comes to responsible gaming because it helps prevent addiction, protects vulnerable players, as well as reduces fraud all by identifying players before they start gambling. In short, responsible gaming with the help of KYC is a crucial aspect of gambling operations that emphasizes the need for safe and sustainable gambling practices and will help secure a company’s reputation.</p>



 Securing players &amp; platforms. 



<p>With KYC a major part of responsible gaming, gambling operators need to secure not only their players but also their platform. Many operators face the challenge of performing the regulatory requirements correctly due to lack of knowledge or solutions. With jurisdictions having varied regulations such as those <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/expecting-consistency-among-eu-online-gambling-regulations-dont-bet-on-it/">across the EU</a>, it can be quite overwhelming to know <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gaming-regulation-in-europe-an-overview/">what needs to be included</a>. However, what responsible gaming comes down to is securing players and the platforms they use.</p>



<p>Thus, each market has different levels of importance for what triggers responsible gaming. Some may set more importance on Loss Limits, Deposit Limits or Time Limits with imposed monetary or time values. Some may focus on affordability of an individual player, multiple accounts, or regular changes in payment options. All of these data points tie into an overall player profile and from that an operator can assess if any interactions are required to either prevent a player from increasing their risk levels, a time-out (cool down period) is required, or changes in marketing towards a player (no bonus marketing, and more of a safe gambling marketing approach is required) or in some extreme circumstances closure of accounts.</p>



 How ID verification can assist in responsible gaming. 



<p>When it comes to online gambling and identity verification, many companies and players are turned off by the requirements. However, this need not be the case. Businesses can incorporate responsible gaming while keeping player conversions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The key to such success is through a user-friendly verification process that also prohibits fraud. By providing such an experience, huge sporting events such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qatar-2022-show-red-card-betting-fraud/">FIFA World Cup</a> or any gaming event can become perfect examples and opportunities for operators to showcase what they are able to do for their players.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By giving players options on how to identify themselves, like with&nbsp;automated identity verification&nbsp;options provided by IDnow, it takes into consideration background checks that take place before the ID verification, and what browsers and devices might be used by the players to meet customer demand.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">through the use of NFC</a>, operators are able to quickly scan an NFC document which requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. And not only that, it provides a higher level of security for the company through the reading of the chip, with more regulators accepting it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This in turn uncovers a new wave of sophisticated crime that is only detected through ID verification. Because when visual security features on an ID document, like holograms and watermarks, are forged to perfection it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features, like with NFC.</p>



<p>In the end, ID verification is a win-win for both the gaming operators and sports fans alike by providing high levels of security for the company and a fast and convenient onboarding process for customers. In fact, <a href="https://www.transunion.co.uk/blog/2021-igaming-fraud-report">83% of operators believe smooth digital transactions have become essential to business survival</a>. Trust is consequently forged between the operator and its players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>13th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform and main contributor to the protocol, announced that the version 4.0 of the T-REX implementation of the ERC3643, the open source blockchain protocol for tokenizing real-world assets, underwent a thorough security audit conducted by the leading Web3 auditor, <a href="https://hacken.io/">Hacken</a>. The results of the audit yielded a flawless score of 10/10, serving as a testament to the high level of security and integrity that the protocol offers.</p>

		 
	 
                      
	 
		 
			<p>The full score from Hacken builds upon the proven track record achieved by its previous version, which has received similar approval from the reputable third-party auditor, Kaspersky. Over the years, the protocol has undergone multiple developments to enhance its capabilities and cater to the needs of the tokenization ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERC3643 is the leading token standard for permissioned tokens. It provides a comprehensive framework for token issuers to enforce compliance and control, making it the most suitable standard for tokenization of real-world assets and financial instruments. With its proven track record of five years, it has become the de facto standard for tokenization. In fact, more than $28B of assets around the world have been tokenized using the protocol, including open-ended funds (UCITs and REITs), alternative funds, asset-backed securities, debt, real estate, equity, trade finance, with much more in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The key enabler of the compliance framework is ERC3643’s built-in decentralized identity (DID) framework, ONCHAINID. It provides a reliable way to ensure compliance by verifying the identity of token holders via verifiable credentials. As a result, this solution allows users to retain full custody of their assets, providing a high level of security and control all within a compliant environment, even on a public blockchain. Notably, the ONCHAINID standard was audited in parallel and earned as well a 10/10 security score from Hacken’s audit.</p>
<p>Hacken’s position as a top tier security auditor for blockchain protocols is indisputable. Its extensive portfolio includes conducting security audits for numerous high-profile crypto exchanges, underscoring their profound comprehension of the security necessities of blockchain-based systems. With both protocols earning 10/10 security audit scores from Hacken, users can trust that they are reliable and secure options for asset tokenization and identity verification.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is Tokeny’s latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are also open source. By making sure that the main token standard for tokenized securities is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, Tokeny aims to accelerate the growth of the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Munich, April 12, 2023 – IDnow, a leading European platform provider for identity proofing, has recorded an increase in transactions with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/produkte/idnow-eid/">German online ID function (eID)</a> by more than a factor of four for the year 2022. This means that eID usage at the Munich-based identity expert is growing much faster than the nationwide eID transaction figures, which increased by around 19% from 2021 to 2022, according to the <a href="https://dashboard.ozg-umsetzung.de/">OZGDB</a>. </p>



<p>When reading out sensitive eID data, IDnow can rely on its own eID authorization certificate, issued by the Federal Office of Administration (Bundesverwaltungsamt). The certificate allows IDnow, in cooperation with the Federal Printing Office (Bundesdruckerei), to read out the eID online ID card function in accordance with the Identity Card Act (Personalausweisgesetz, PAuswG) for identity verification. </p>



<p>Electronic ID card: Advantages of NFC technology</p>



<p>At IDnow, growth has been driven primarily by the more highly regulated industries such as the financial and eGovernment sectors. It is in these sectors, in particular, that the electronic ID card with its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">NFC-based (near field communication)</a> online ID function can show its strengths. Fraud prevention with this method is particularly high because the chip integrated in the ID card is extremely forgery-proof. Thanks to the high level of security, the solution is compliant with both the German Money Laundering Act (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/glossary/geldwaeschegesetz-gwg/">Geldwäschegesetz, GWG</a>) and the Telecommunications Act (Telekommunikationsgesetz, TKG).</p>



<p>As a sovereign-notified procedure, the eID online ID function offers the highest level of security among identification procedures. In addition, the identity check with the eID takes only a few minutes and is fully automated, i.e., it can be processed without service employees.</p>



<p>Only 8% of the population have used the eID</p>



<p>Despite the recent positive developments, the penetration rate of this identification method among the German population remains at a low level. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/digital-identity-index-2023-study-future-germany/">IDnow’s Digital Identity Index 2023</a> recently showed that even more than 10 years after its introduction, the eID function is hardly used on a broad scale. According to the YouGov survey, only 8% of the population has ever used it.</p>



<p>Private identification solutions such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">video identification procedures in a video chat</a> (38%) or on-site identification in a post office branch (40%) continue to dominate the German market.</p>



<p>One reason for this is the unfamiliarity of the eID solution – according to the Index, only 7% of the German population has any idea what the term “eID” means. The lack of use cases in everyday life, as well as the comparatively poor user-friendliness of the solution, also contribute to the fact that the method is used so little. Both a 6-digit PIN and an NFC-enabled smartphone are required. Data transmission via the NFC interface often causes users problems when reading it out.</p>



<p>“To counteract the low level of awareness of the solution, Germany needs extensive marketing and awareness campaigns by politicians and the private sector on the one hand. On the other hand, financial service providers, mobility providers, and telecommunications companies must dare to implement the solution in their onboarding processes. An increased range of use cases will automatically have a positive effect on awareness of the eID. All players, politics as well as businesses, must work closely together to make the eID a success after all,” explains Armin Bauer, co-founder and Managing Director Technology at IDnow.</p>



<p>Platform approach allows integration of different identification solutions</p>



<p>In the future, IDnow expects a further increase in the number of eID users due to various political decisions such as the Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz, OZG), the introduction of the BundID in additional federal states and the flat-rate energy fee for students. The higher penetration rate of NFC-enabled smartphones and onboarding in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> planned by the EU will also have a positive impact on penetration in the future.</p>



<p>“We see ourselves very well equipped for these developments with our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">platform approach</a>. After all, there will never be one, dominant solution in identity verification, as the needs of younger, older, tech-savvy or less-savvy people differ greatly. Instead, we rely on a wide range of different identification solutions to address all citizens’ needs,” Bauer continued. “If the user has misplaced their PIN or the smartphone’s NFC interface doesn’t work, for example, they can seamlessly switch to an alternative identification solution like VideoIdent on our platform and reliably complete the onboarding process.”</p>

Human &amp; automated moderation systems working together. Image generated by Midjourney.
<p>Moderation is a necessary feature of social spaces. It’s how bad behavior gets constrained, norms get set, and disputes get resolved. We’ve kept the Bluesky app invite-only and are finishing moderation before the last pieces of open federation because we wanted to prioritize user safety from the start.</p>
<p>Just like our approach to algorithmic choice, our approach to moderation allows for an ecosystem of third-party providers. Moderation should be a composable, customizable piece that can be layered into your experience. For custom feeds, there is a basic default (only who you follow), and then many possibilities for custom algorithms. For moderation as well, there should be a basic default, and then many custom filters available on top.</p>
<p>The basics of our approach to moderation are well-established practices. We do automated labeling, like centralized social sites, and make service-level admin decisions, like many federated networks. But the piece we’re most excited about is the open, composable labeling system we’re building that both developers and users can contribute to. Under the hood, centralized social sites use labeling to implement moderation — we think this piece can be unbundled, opened up to third-party innovation, and configured with user agency in mind. Anyone should be able to create or subscribe to moderation labels that third parties create.</p>
 An Ecosystem of Moderation Labeling 
<p>Here’s the way we’re designing an open, composable labeling system for moderation:</p>
 
 Anyone can define and apply “labels” to content or accounts (i.e. “spam”, “nsfw”). This is a separate service, so they do not have to run a PDS (personal data server) or a client app in order to do so. 
 Labels can be automatically generated (by third-party services, or by custom algorithms) or manually generated (by admins, or by users themselves) 
 Any service or person in the network can choose how these labels get used to determine the final user experience. 
 
<p>So how will we be applying this on the Bluesky app? Automated filtering is a commoditized service by now, so we will be taking advantage of this to apply a first pass to remove illegal content and label objectionable material. Then we will apply server-level filters as admins of bsky.social, with a default setting and custom controls to let you hide, warn, or show content. On top of that, we will let users subscribe to additional sets of moderation labels that can filter out more content or accounts.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the layers here. Centralized social platforms delegate all moderation to a central set of admins whose policies are set by one company. This is a bit like resolving all disputes at the level of the Supreme Court. Federated networks delegate moderation decisions to server admins. This is more like resolving disputes at a state government level, which is better because you can move to a new state if you don’t like your state's decisions — but moving is usually difficult and expensive in other networks. We’ve improved on this situation by making it easier to switch servers, and by separating moderation out into structurally independent services.</p>
<p>We’re calling the location-independent moderation infrastructure “community labeling” because you can opt-in to an online community’s moderation system that's not necessarily tied to the server you're on.</p>
 Community Labeling 
<p>Community labeling can be done by automated systems, or it can consist of humans manually labeling things. The human-generated label sets can be thought of as something similar to shared mute/block lists.</p>
<p>Here’s how we think a manual community labeling system will work:</p>
 
 Anyone can create a label set, then add admins or mods to help manage it 
 Mods can add labels that the set defines to accounts or content (“rude”, “troll”, etc.) 
 Anyone can subscribe to the set and have the labels be applied to their experience 
 
 What's Ahead 
<p>We’re landing a first pass on automated filtering in the app today, and will improve it based on user feedback. Community labeling is still in the works. We’ll be publishing more details soon.</p>
<p>Through this approach of a composable, customizable moderation system, we aim to prioritize user safety while giving people more control. An open labeling system for moderation contributed to by both developers and users will allow for innovation, transparency, and agency in this critical piece of social networking infrastructure where technical and social systems collide.</p>

     <p>It was a power packed day for Digital Trust today with 22 speakers joining us from around the world to share the latest in the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>It was a big – dare we say exciting – day for our community. We shared that after more than 10 years of growing and building the IdentityNORTH community focused on identifying how digital ID technology might be able to solve issues by rolling out socially beneficial distributed Digital ID. While we still don’t have those systems, we realized that the digital ID systems themselves were just the tip of the iceberg, we needed to be having broader conversations, talking about what would inevitably be built on top of these systems, how society would evolve, and how to ensure that safeguards and values are built into whatever we allow to be built. Most importantly, we felt it important to be bringing more perspectives to the conversations than were present before. Technology and how it affects us is evolving at an incredible pace. Conversations about harnessing tech and regulating it need to evolve too.</p>
<p>Starting this June, EXCITE will be where thousands of change-makers come together to advance the future of digital trust and ignite innovation. With a focus on Advancing Digital Trust, EXCITE events and content will focus on three key streams:</p>
 
 Advancing New Models of Trusted Service Delivery 
 Advancing Cybersecurity 
 Advancing Digital Talent &amp; Inclusion 
 
<p>EXCITE SUMMIT events will continue to bring together professionals and experts from both public and private sectors to collaborate, learn, and innovate on critical issues arising from the increasing digitization of our world: privacy, cybersecurity, inclusion, skills development, identity and access management, and data protection.</p>
<p>With the move to EXCITE, we plan to continue the beloved traditions from our community – creating discussion and networking opportunities to provide time for learning, collaboration, seeing how we can support each other’s work across industry and government here in Canada and around the world, honoring the leaders in our shared efforts, and of course providing great swag…</p>
<p>We will start new traditions to support us on this path and welcome your ideas and referrals as we are expanding to bring more individuals and organizations from different sectors into our community.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/2023-excite-annual-summit-registration-474871652897"></a></p>

   Managing multiple tiers of identity can help boost brand management, yield security gains, and uncover revenue opportunities  

<p>Does the following sound anything like your organization? A complex, layered enterprise with many different business units (BUs). Inside these BUs are different departments. Inside of some of these departments exist different brands or products that need to be discretely managed to present unique digital experiences for customers.</p>

<p>If so, you are part of a growing cadre of organizations managing <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/multi-brand">multi-brand</a> experiences.</p>

<p>Traditional approaches to identity and access management (IAM) tend to break down when faced with these types of advanced multi-brand identity hierarchies. In the following paragraphs, I’ll explain why — and what you can do to prepare your organization for next-level success</p>

 Managing identity in a multi-brand environment 

    
<p>The term "multi-brand experience" fits neatly at the intersection of IAM and customer success.</p>

<p>On the IAM side, the challenge is granting the right users (internal workforce users and end-user customers) access to the right digital properties or assets needed to do their job or to complete their purchases — and in a timely manner</p>

<p>Take internal users. If too much access is given — for example, you grant users in Brand 4 access to resources in Brand 1 — you can unnecessarily and unwittingly expose part of the business to employees who do not need those resources to do their jobs. Worse, you can potentially open up a greater footprint of your business to hackers or malicious insiders.</p>

<p>On the customer success side, knowing a user is a consumer of Brand 5 leads to all sorts of interesting possibilities for going deeper on that interaction and the customer’s user experience. You can, for example, present a highly personalized shopping experience on that preferred brand or introduce a loyalty program for users of a particular brand. You can even strategically micro-target products and services that the consumer may be interested in. Or do both, why choose? The key is all about having an elegant, frictionless experience that starts with identity</p>

<p>“Customers” can also be internal workforce users requiring access to new applications and services. Being responsive to their needs in a timely fashion is critical for maintaining a productive and satisfied workforce.</p>

 Why delegated administration has failed to address the multi-brand challenge 

<p>The way organizations have traditionally attempted to handle multi-brand experiences is through the use of groups.</p>

<p>The logic goes like this: when you onboard internal users, the admin assigns them to one or more groups. For example, one user gets assigned to human resources, another to marketing, and another to finance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groups can cover the gambit, including location, projects, specialties, geography, and more. So, one user can be a member of the “Cleveland Plant” and another employee a member of the “Manchester Office.” Almost everyone is a member of multiple groups. Various admins (through delegated administration) then manage access to the groups, either allowing or denying the members of those groups access to various resources.</p>

<p>But then things get complicated. Companies grow, reorganize, and go through all manner of&nbsp; change over time, throwing the task of managing by groups and delegated administration into chaos. Groups are suddenly left without an admin. I have talked with customers who are managing up to 30,000 groups within their organization! Of course, nobody can actually manage 30,000 groups or do it well in any kind of fashion. What you end up with is the illusion of control without having any ability to drive the business forward.</p>

<p>The B2B2C business model (that is, business-to-business-to-customer) has moved to the fore. This means that multi-brand requirements now extend to business partners or vendors — intermediaries — who have contact with the end-user customers. Being able to control access to applications and services using this model, through the partner, and right on down to the end customer is imperative, and cannot be done effectively with groups and delegated admin</p>

 Addressing the multi-brand challenge with organizational model 

<p>A better way to manage complex hierarchical identity requirements, including B2B2C, is through the use of an organizational model</p>

<p>An organizational model is first and foremost a data model. It is a structure that mirrors the actual organization itself (hence, the term “organizational model”). Rather than diving right into the typical IAM minutia of what groups, roles, and entitlements an individual user should be assigned to (all very important, by the way), an organizational model starts at the business level. By mirroring the way your business looks and operates, this model allows you to use identity more effectively and strategically to help the organization meet its business objectives.</p>

<p>An organizational model starts with a single organization, the top tier of the hierarchy. Then other organizational units (locations, brands, sub-groups, business units) can be flexibly built, assigned, and re-assigned across the organization as circumstances change. An almost infinite number of sub-organizations can be instantiated. Administrators are then assigned to each organizational unit, with the admins above having total visibility and control of other admins and members in the sub-orgs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does an organizational model differ from delegated administration? Here are a few differences (a non-exhaustive list)</p>

  Utilization of non-technical admins – Typically, administrators need to have some IT and identity chops, or at least be part of the IT org. But with an organizational model, admins are presented with a simple portal to support access requests within their particular organization. This portal is convenient for assigning admin rights to a department owner who needs to make quick access decisions for direct reports. It also makes it possible to assign admin rights for onboarding users within a vendor, partner, or supplier. 
	 Supports full inheritance and visibility – Changes made to the top-level org, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-orgs without requiring admin intervention. This ensures that no group gets left behind, including B2B2C partners and vendors, when security decisions get made at the top. All access decisions are logged for visibility and assistance in passing audits and meeting compliance requirements down the road. 
	 Greater span of control – Who knows the access needs of users better than the application owner, business owner, or department head? An organizational model puts control into the hands of these users, while keeping IT in the driver’s seat. It can also speed decision-making.  
	 Better enforcement of least-privileged access&nbsp;– Rather than spraying broad access rights across the organization, members of each group are confined to just what is in their particular organizational area. In complex organizations with many BUs, this means reducing the surface area of a potential attack. 
	 Better support of a B2B2C model – In the past, extending access to partners and your partners’ customers was usually a one-off operation, with the necessary application sitting unmanaged within a department. With an organizational model, these projects are folded into the overall identity framework, meaning they are fully supported and secured within the same identity stack as the other users and applications.

				  With ChatGPT 4 expanding its functionality through plugins, the emergence of AI virtual assistants capable of performing delegated tasks through text and voice input in a realistic human way is increasingly likely. In a new position paper, we look at a hypothetical “Chat Valet” booking a flight in order to illustrate why continuous verifiable identity is essential to managing the process.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The current inability to know how ChatGPT 4 formulates a specific answer to a specific question as it learns from answering questions successfully has created an outpouring of speculation as to what this all means for the future of business (the end of many jobs) to the future of humanity (the end, period).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as ChatGPT cannot give an account of its evolution in advance of evolving, we need to: anticipate how, realistically, the technology is most likely to be used in the near future, assess where problems may occur, and suggest solutions that, probably, should be adopted in advance of the problems occurring.</p>
<p>Here, the advent of plugins for ChatGPT gives us a useful prompt: If we combine the ability to “understand” text or verbal requests with a learning capacity to deliver successful responses and then add more ways to learn through plugins that <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/chatgpt-plugins-explained">expand functionality</a>, we can see how a chatbot could become a more adept <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-04-03/chatgpt-s-plugins-may-be-ai-s-iphone-moment-and-threat-to-google-search">virtual assistant</a> with the ability to act on its user’s behalf.</p>
<p>The following position paper explores this idea in more detail. It anticipates using a ChatGPT-like virtual assistant to book an airline flight in a fully delegated way that results in a “beautifully frictionless process.”</p>
<p>But it also imagines what “a compromised AI virtual assistant could do with access to all your accounts AND a predictive understanding of your behavior and preferences.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be able to take advantage of AI, this systemic risk needs to be addressed with some urgency; and to that end, we illustrate how open-source decentralized identity provides one way to tackle these problems. If we are to delegate tasks to an AI assistant, we need continuous, mutual verification between ourselves and the assistant. It must be able to trust that it is dealing with us as much as we must be able to trust that we, and we alone, are dealing with our assistant.</p>

  At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. What does it take to create a user-friendly "self-eject button" from applications on the internet?

<p>At Spruce, our core drive revolves around a world where users have full control over their identity and data in their digital interactions. However, this shouldn’t be at the expense of user experience in applications, or user experience around the control of said information. </p><p>To start with, let’s take a look at the web as it stands now. Current regulations governing user data protections have left us in the following state, which includes an illusion of choice - namely that one can leave, but not in any meaningful way.</p><p>For example, I can always export my data from Twitter or Google, but can I honestly do anything meaningful? I can scroll through endless machine-readable CSVs and marvel at my own witty fodder, but beyond that, there’s not much I can do with it. The goal for any system geared toward user control should be to answer the following questions:</p>  Can a user leave an app or service?  Can they have control over their information?  Can they user their information elsewhere?  <p>We believe that it all starts with a user being able to meaningfully leave a service.</p> Can I Leave an App or Service? <p><br>One of the first core tenets of user control is that, at any time, users should be able to eject from any system or application they don’t wish to use and have complete control over all of their generated data. Whether in the context of a social media platform, a banking website, or even productivity applications, the user, as the sole generator of information, should always be taken care of. </p><p>This is one of the cornerstones of the web3 movement regarding assets and identifiers. Your public key is an identifier under your control, and your on-chain activity translates across dapps.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Giving users control is not as easy as clicking a button to export data, as it will require various ways of representing different pieces of information that can be useful in other contexts. It will also require industry groups to coordinate and agree upon standard representations of different forms of data. Right now, the rights afforded to users mainly serve the purpose of not drawing the ire of regulators, by allowing users to export poorly formed files to let them know how they are being tracked. </p><p>Once granted control in the form of useful data exports and data custody, our goal should be to continually let users leave these existing platforms while granting the expectation that the experience will be nearly the same in a different context. </p><p>Thankfully, we’ve reached a point, especially with those working on the fediverse, web3, and more, that looks a lot like this:</p><p>Incredible steps have been taken across the space in key management, signing, and more to make this possible. We’ll always continue to commend those that came before us and those we collaborate with now on these complex problems. </p><p>However, the next step is the user experience around the control of this information.</p> Can I Have Control Over My Information?<br> <p>Now that we’ve established that the “can I leave” problem should always be answered with “yes,” the next question should be around how much control a user has over said exported information. Our goal as an organization is to never compromise on the user having the ability to take full control over their interactions but also to tip the scale in favor of user experience while we do it. Every organization philosophically aligned with this concept should be building toward this same type of outcome.</p><p><br>If a user could usefully export their data from an app or service but was limited to only using a large tech provider to continue to custody that data, then we haven’t really achieved user control and instead have just shuffled our trust assumptions. When thinking about decentralized data, it isn’t necessarily just about leaving that user at the whim of a decentralized network, but rather, giving the user control to specify where they custody their information and how they present it. </p><p>When considering this problem space, the following question should be the core litmus test of user control: can a user kick a custodian out and easily take custody of their own data? </p><p>We understand that some users will go with existing providers that they trust, but our goal is to also avoid situations where everyday users have to use complex systems to manage their own information. We want to see a world where a user can always control the governance of their data, specifying anything from a group of custodians to even the server in their basement as to where that data lives.</p><p>Additionally, as mentioned earlier, if a user were to ever self-custody their data, we want to avoid the situation where a user is forced to wrangle with a command line to get started.</p><p>And instead, have interfaces they recognize, while knowing users are storing and managing their own data:</p><p>Finally, now that we have exports that users can command, and custody users can achieve, we have to answer the final question.</p> Can I Use My Information Elsewhere?<br> <p>Finally, the last question in our for user-controlled data is, “Can a user now take this data under their control to different apps and services and use it there?” Users should be able to opt out of one service and replace it with a competitor. </p><p>This would result in a future where tech companies and services compete on user experience, rather than holding user content hostage as their primary competitive edge.</p><p>This is demonstratable in the world of social media. Content creators have built personal brand empires across social media platforms, including Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and more. These content creators are at the mercy of each independent social media platform, without a clear way to export their self-generated content, social graph, and brand relationships if one of those platforms shuts down (or becomes banned, as has recently been a concern with TikTok in the United States). This “profile hostage” situation happens across almost every service we use across the internet, but it requires a radical shift in how we collectively, across every industry, think about consumers’ relationships with companies.</p><p>This requires collaboration across public and private sectors to agree on common representations of specific data. User data could be anything from how a post is represented in the context of a user’s social graph, to even a credential linking a Twitter account to an Ethereum account. </p><p>At Spruce, we’re working on a lot of these core primitives, and want to build a world where all three questions aren’t just acknowledged, but answered.</p> <p>If you're curious about integrating Spruce's technology into your project, come chat with us in our Discord:</p><a href="https://discord.gg/spruce?ref=spruce"></a><p><br></p><p><br></p><p></p>

<p>We're making progress on IPVM! Learn more about our project to bring open and decentralized compute to IPFS.</p> What is IPVM? <p><a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a>, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a protocol and P2P file-sharing network that leverages content addressing for file identification and verification. <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a>, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, is Fission's effort to bring computation to IPFS using Wasm, SPKI, and object capabilities. Furthermore, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on prenegotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p> How Does IPVM Work? <p>Fission's Co-Founder and CTO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a>, gave an introductory presentation at IPFS Thing 2022. She explained how content-addressed data yields hashes, known as CIDs. When computation runs over these CIDs, new CIDs are output. This means we can compute over that data without needing a centralized server. And when combined with <a href="https://ghost.fission.codes//Wasm">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm), mobile compute even becomes possible. </p><p>And that's not all. The IPVM structure paves the way for several exciting features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optimization">adaptive/hot spot optimization</a>, allowing us to work more efficiently. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> How Does it Differ from Other Decentralized Compute Options? <p>Unlike other VMs, consensus is not required because no two machines running IPVM have to know that the other exists, which tasks they're running, or what the results were. IPVM lets the knowledge of the result of a computation propagate just to the other machines that ask for the results directly (unlike a blockchain where everyone is entirely up to date on all of the data). </p><p><a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">IPVM</a></p>  Extends IPFS with computation  Runs anywhere, including the edge, locally, and in the browser  No consensus required  Its primary use case is running Wasm and enabling interoperable services  Asynchronous  <p><a href="https://fvm.filecoin.io/">FVM - Filecoin Virtual Machine</a></p>  Runs computations for Filecoin  It’s blockchain-based and runs to consensus  Its primary use case is smart contracts and bringing user programmability to Filecoin  Synchronous  <p><a href="https://fluence.dev/docs/learn/overview">Fluence</a></p>  Serverless platform and computing marketplace  It's blockchain-based  Runs in-browser  Off-chain compute with on-chain validation  It's not designed for large-scale data persistence  Its primary use is for data caching, indexing, processing, and querying  <p><a href="https://docs.bacalhau.org/">Bacalhau</a></p>  Compute over Data using Docker containers and Wasm images as tasks  It's main use case is running compute over large datasets by sending most jobs to providers across the network  Can't run in-browser   What is IPVM's Current Status? <p>Since IPFS Thing 2022, Fission has been hard at work making IPVM a reality. In October of last year, we <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/spec">updated the spec's README</a>. </p><p>In Q1, we focused on research and design and began to develop an MVP. Named <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar</a>, this open-source implementation of IPVM (and an IPVM runtime) is geared toward Wasm execution in Rust and the browser. In February, we also held a three-day in-person IPVM workshop for our working group collaborators. </p><p>Entering Q2, we're working on discovery, first-class effects, and finalizing spec-level interop with several providers. We're also spreading awareness about IPVM at conferences like IPFS Thing, Causal Islands, and CoD Summit^3.</p> Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 + Causal Islands <p>Speaking of conferences, Brooklyn will present IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World as part of the Decentralized Compute and AI track at <a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing 2023</a> and Seamless Services for an Open World at <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/speakers/brooklyn-zelenka">Causal Islands</a> (Fission's first-ever conference!). </p><p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!</p><p>Seamless Services for an Open World</p><p>The advent of TCP/IP and the web produced an explosion of innovation by radically lowering the barrier to entry to connect over the network. Thanks to new technical and social innovations, we now have the building blocks for the next generation of open services: location-free verifiable data and computation.</p><p>‍Verifiable computation opens the door to content-addressed function invocations, results, and workflows. This radically lowers the complexity of historical architectures (e.g. the LAMP stack), networked, and distributed systems. Not only is this easier to reason about, but it also (paradoxically) enables superlinear scaling: the more it gets used, the more efficient it becomes!</p><p>This talk presents UCAN Invocations and the Interplanetary VM (IPVM). Code in this model can run anywhere (even offline), respects data privacy, and services interoperate seamlessly out of the box without pre-negotiation. Since computation doesn't happen in a vacuum, we will also describe how the workflow planner interacts with existing services and how to lift them into this seamless paradigm.</p><p>Zeeshan Lakhani will also present on Homestar at IPFS Thing. </p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing.</p><p>Brooklyn and Zeeshan will present at <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">CoD Summit^3</a> as well, with more details to come. </p> <p>If you are attending these conferences, we look forward to hearing your ideas and feedback on IPVM! Can't make it? Don't worry - the talks will be recorded and shared here on the blog. You can also participate in IPVMs development by joining the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM working group</a>.

 How artificial intelligence is likely to affect the online world of crime,&nbsp;and why we must act now. 



 



<p>If history has taught us anything, it is that with every innovation and development, whether technological or otherwise, there comes a new criminal endeavour to exploit suddenly created regulatory gaps and legal loopholes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT, which seemed to appear out of nowhere from the Tech Gods at the latter end of 2022, has been met with unbridled excitement, cautious trepidation, and most recently in Italy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">outright ban</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the weeks since the launch of ChatGPT 4.0, LinkedIn was quickly awash with ways that artificial intelligence could be used to supercharge operations; taking creativity to the next level by outsourcing the grunt work of actually doing it to AI, leaving humans with the important stuff like… erm… strategy, budget, and making a perfectly crafted coffee every time (although there are tools for those too).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media users on less business-focused platforms saw things less optimistically and stopped just short of predicting the imminent End of Days. Many argued that if we rely too heavily on artificial intelligence for creating content and take our hands off the wheel for too long, then this would weaken the argument for wrestling power back. Some even questioned whether we would even be capable after ceding generational creative control.&nbsp;</p>



 The next step in AI? 



<p>Despite such emotional public reactions, huge corporations including Apple, Microsoft, Google and HubSpot have all jumped on the ‘AI bandwagon’, or at least planning to embark very soon, and have announced that they will implement AI technology into its products in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to some tech titans and academics, however, humanity itself could be at risk if AI continues to advance too rapidly without proper and adequate guardrails. This could explain why many experts, including Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak, are calling for a six-month ‘time out’ on the AI arms race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>AI labs [are] locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.</p><a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter</a></blockquote>



<p>They argue that rather than continue to build even more powerful AI systems, all parties should pause work on development, and instead shift focus to making systems more accurate, safe, trustworthy and loyal, while ensuring problematic forms of bias are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/03/31/uncovering-the-different-types-of-chatgpt-bias/?sh=4b9c53a571bb">eradicated.</a> It would also, of course, allow time for policymakers and regulators to roll out governance.</p>



 What is the AI Act? 



<p>The European Commision is the first major governing body to formally attempt to regulate AI. In its proposed <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0206">Artificial Intelligence Act</a>, it warns of the need to monitor and “curtail’ AI use in social scouting, manipulation, and some uses of facial recognition (referred to as ‘high-risk’ AI). It also mentions General Purpose AI (GPAI) large language models like ChatGPT, which have applications in a wide variety of use cases. EU lawmakers have thus proposed an amendment to the Act, which would require GPAI providers to comply with the same standards and restrictions as “high risk” AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>March 2023 also saw the release of Europol’s <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/cms/sites/default/files/documents/Tech%20Watch%20Flash%20-%20The%20Impact%20of%20Large%20Language%20Models%20on%20Law%20Enforcement.pdf">‘ChatGPT: The impact of Large Language Models on Law Enforcement’</a> report, which detailed how artificial intelligence systems were currently being used by criminals and highlighted potential future misuse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what exactly have regulators got to fear?</p>



 The corruption of innovation. 



<p>While there is clearly excitement regarding how ChatGPT can boost productivity and supercharge operations, it is only a matter of time before criminals start using AI for nefarious activities, such as fraud, impersonation and social engineering. In fact, scammers are already utilizing the powerful technology on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scams</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/phishing">phishing</a> to churn out avalanches of fake documents (invoices, financial statements, contracts, transaction records) that are often more personalized and accurate than man-made documents (which often contain grammatical and other semantical errors). GPAI models can also be used to reproduce realistic language patterns to replicate the idiosyncrasies of individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Europol, one of the other major misuses of ChatGPT, and other artificial intelligence systems, is the potential for criminals with little technical knowledge to engage in cybercrime. This is because as well as being able to draft human-like language, AI can quickly produce (and correct) code in different programming languages. With relatively little effort, bad actors can easily create malware, malicious VBA scripts, and realistic AI chatbots that can assist in priming victims for the scammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, AI-powered software has achieved significant progress, taking the technology to the next level and offering increasingly robust solutions in many aspects of our daily lives. However, these advancements have also created opportunities for malicious use.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>With the rapid improvements in generative AI (a type of artificial intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models), it is not inconceivable that we are only a few months away from scammers using AI to create realistic looking passports and official sophisticated documents in any language, with correct letterheads and security features, such as holograms at scale, within a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifying which documents are authentic, and in the case of deepfake technology, which people are real, are likely to cause problems for companies without the most rigorous of Liveness checks and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fraud-detection-anti-spoofing-facial-recognition/">facial recognition technology</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChatGPT also poses clear concerns over data and privacy, as evidenced in March 2023, when Italian Data Protection Authority provisionally took the platform offline until it <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11925623/ChatGPT-BANNED-Italy-privacy-fears.html">“respected privacy”</a> and fixed a bug where other users’ chat history, and personal identifiable information (PII) was visible. Some major banks, including Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, have also broken ranks and taken steps to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/02/24/workers-chatgpt-use-restricted-at-more-banks-including-goldman-citigroup/?sh=281cac676cf4">limit staff utilizing ChatGPT</a> and similar platforms until research can be carried out on ways of ensuring “safe and effective usage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Controlling who has access to information, and whether that information is a) accurate and b) unbiased will be a top priority. Of course, this has always been a concern when using the internet, but the danger of unsubstantiated “fake news” is likely to grow exponentially alongside the increasing volume of content. For example, according to a recent ChatGPT enquiry, Aung San Suu Kyi was sanctioned by the European Union. Companies are therefore advised to not soley rely on ChatGPT for Sanctions and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> checks.</p>



 Knowledge is power: Fighting fire with fire. 



<p>There are clearly dangers when ChatGPT is in the wrong hands. However, in the right hands, AI can also be used for good, and to battle digital fraud, and other types of financial crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Increasing numbers of organizations, including IDnow are utilizing artificial intelligence to help digitize their Know Your Customer (KYC) processes and help to prevent fraud. Whether your business is in the Mobility, Financial Services, Gaming, or Crypto sector, if you need to onboard customers and need verify their identity, then there are major benefits of implementing an AI-enabled identity proofing service:&nbsp;</p>



  The most important step for any organization that wishes to protect its business from monetary and reputational harm is its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC process</a>. AI can help automate much of the analysis, including the processing of customer data, personal information, and transaction history.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>  AI can process huge swathes of information and verify customer identities, quickly, effectively, and securely. By automating tasks, bottlenecks in customer onboarding can be removed, allowing the company to scale at an unprecedented rate.  



  Check customers against sanctions and PEP lists (using a dedicated sanctions or PEP platform).<br>  Using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, AI can flag potential fraud in real-time. For example, AI can detect suspicious user behavior and alert the a platform’s security team, such as someone with the same identity using different gambling platform accounts to place bets at the same time.<br>  Multinational organizations can focus on servings its international audience, safe in the knowledge that they re compliant with complex and disparate regulatory requirements.<br>  By combining AI with anti-fraud technology, organizations can analyze vast volumes of data, including transactions, locations and times to identify suspicious patterns and activity.&nbsp;  



<p>The coming years will be crucial regarding the development, use and regulation of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Concerning KYC, the primary danger is identity theft and obfuscation. Specifically, generative models have enabled the creation of relatively user-friendly tools for generating more and more realistic attacks on both identity documents and biometric characteristics. This same technology is an important asset that we consider fighting efficiently against different kinds of fraud.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research and Development at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Dystopian days. Utopian bytes. 



<p>The threat posed by artificial intelligence is likely to be less Terminator, more Wall-E, so we shouldn’t necessarily be worrying about losing our clothes, boots and motorcycles, but more our creativity, autonomy and will to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clearly, there is no putting the ChatGPT genie back in the bottle now, even if we wanted to. We must learn to live with it, and learn from it, like it learns from us. Only then will we realize its [and our] true potential.<br></p>

 🇺🇸 U.S. Department of the Treasury 



<p>On April 6th, the U.S. Department of the Treasury published <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/DeFi-Risk-Full-Review.pdf">a report</a> on illicit finance risk assessment conducted on DeFi.</p>



<p>The report starts off by explaining key terminology and aspects of the virtual asset market such as technical elements used in DeFi, types of DeFi services and intrinsic characteristics and levels of decentralization of DeFi services.</p>



<p>It carries on by listing facets of DeFi that attract criminals to support their activities:</p>



  DeFi services that aid Money Laundering techniques:
  DEXs and Cross-Chain Bridges 



 Mixers 



 Liquidity Pools 
  



 Move funds obtained from Ransomware attacks: 



 Steal funds by exploiting:
  vulnerabilities of smart contracts 



 low-security levels used by companies and individuals 
  



 DeFi services proved to be lucrative in committing Fraud 



 Laundering proceeds from Drug Trafficking 



 Exploiting DeFi services to sustain a flow of funds destined for financing the acquisition and development of weapons of mass destruction 
 <p>DeFi services are found to be vulnerable to criminal use mainly because a link between the individual using them and the virtual asset transactional activity cannot be made. Reasons for this are:</p>



  DeFi services are not obliged entities due to their technical nature and AML/CFT regulations do not apply to them, thus users cannot be KYC’ed. 



 Direct peer-to-peer transactions are possible as there is no need for an intermediary due to the lack of a need for an account or custodial relationship. 



 Some DeFi services fall under FATF’s definition of a VASP. Jurisdictions with gaps in their AML/CFT regime are a safe heaven for such DeFi services which have no intent to abide by AML law. Topped with the cross-border and almost instantaneous nature of VA transactions some of such services are structure from the get-go as a front for money laundering or service created to assists criminals. 



 Some DeFi services are prone to fall victim of cyber-attacks due to the lack of requirements for cybersecurity and audits in the DeFi space. 
 <p>A set of Mitigating measure for the identified vulnerabilities are laid out surrounding:</p>



  Regulatory Frameworks 



 Public<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> Blockchain </a>Transparency 



 Use of Centralized VASPs as On- and Off-Ramps 



 Other Potential Industry Solutions 
  🇦🇺 Australian Supervisory Authority revokes Binance’s license 



<p>In Australia, Binance faced a targeted review conducted by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) which resulted in its financial services license for derivatives being withdrawn on April 6th as <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-091mr-binance-australia-derivatives-afs-licence-cancelled/">related by the Authority</a>.</p>



<p>ASIC opened the investigation into Binance’s local financial services business and discovered that some retail investors were misclassified as wholesale. Oztures Trading Pty Ltd is the legal entity trading as Binance Australia Derivatives. On April 5th the Authority received a license cancel request from the entity which was accepted and will come into effect on April 14th 2023. As a result, “clients will not be able to increase derivatives positions or open new positions with Binance; Binance will require clients to close any existing derivative positions before 21 April 2023; on 21 April 2023, Binance will close any remaining open positions.”</p>

<p>By Jess Turner, Executive Vice President of Global Open Banking and API at Mastercard&nbsp;</p>



<p>So much has changed over the last 20 years in payments that it’s hard to imagine the way the world used to be. A world where booking a trip or shopping for everyday needs required visiting a local travel agent or a grocery store in person, using paper currency for every transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, we’ve become used to an ever-expanding menu of payment choices. Different circumstances call for different types of payments — the convenience of cards for everyday purchases and extended payment terms; bill pay and account-to-account for recurring payments; installments plans for larger purchases spread over a few months. All of these options have emerged as money has become an increasingly digital or data-driven experience, and they are only expected to become more popular in the coming years. According to the results of <a href="https://www.finicity.com/blog/five-key-trends-to-consider-when-integrating-digital-payments-into-fintech-innovations/">Mastercard’s 2022 New Payment Index Report,</a> 85% of consumers made at least one digital payment in the past year and 93% expect to in the next 12 months. Consumers are also increasingly adopting alternatives such as digital wallets (35%), digital credit or debit cards (32%) and digital money transfer apps (31%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>We all saw the impacts of COVID when we needed to be socially distanced. Electronic payments played a key role in keeping life and the economy running. Now, those digital experiences are supercharging other activities. Open banking lets people and businesses safely share their financial data with forward-thinking organizations in order to access new and improved financial experiences like digital payments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Going forward, consumers will likely have access to even more sophisticated payment solutions. Mastercard’s 2022 Index Report also showed that:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Nearly 60% of consumers are open to connecting their bank account to other financial services to enable automatic repayments for installment plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 More than half of consumers have already used a merchant-specific currency, including loyalty points, store credit or “in-game” money.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Younger generations are more likely to explore payments in emerging spaces – 48% of Gen Z and millennials are interested in being able to purchase virtual products in the metaverse.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The financial data that’s now delivered from open banking was historically available to the consumers themselves – on a computer screen or a paper statement – but traditionally has been cumbersome and complex to use. Yet, with open banking, consumers can now take advantage of new services that make their daily lives easier and with higher levels of safety by opting to share their data with a host of financial institutions and third parties, ranging from billers, merchants, fintechs and digital platforms.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Open banking can help build an economy that works for everyone. Data is at the heart of every financial experience, from lending to money management to payments and beyond. It can also help the under-banked or those with thin or no credit files by providing easier access to financial data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world is still in the early days of open banking. As an industry, we’re connecting to additional financial data types (sometimes referred to as Open Finance) such as investments, retirement, payroll, and utilities. Financial institutions and fintechs are continuing to innovate financial experiences. In the ecosystem of payments, we’re dramatically expanding choices for consumers and businesses to pay or get paid how, where and when they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>







<p>As an industry, we’re increasing payment choice, but we’re also optimizing these experiences. Our Smart Payment Decisioning Tools integrate consumer-permissioned data in the account-to-account payment experience, providing billers with indicators of payment success likelihood. Then enhancing payment processing options based on factors like speed and confidence. We are working with our partners to modernizing account-based payments to provide the best outcome for consumers, banks and merchants. It can ensure a higher level of completed payments, supporting stronger impact for consumers and operational efficiencies for banks. Some of these data services are delivered through Finicity, a Mastercard company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As open banking-enabled financial services proliferate and their use impacts our daily lives, we as consumers and businesses will expect the same security, protections, and confidence we’ve come to expect of our other financial experiences. We will also see that our ability to control and safely share our data using bank accounts, Pay-by-Bank, blockchain, cards and digital wallets will be transformational to our money experience – making it easier to understand our financial fitness and gain the insights needed to make the best financial decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To deliver on its promise, open banking requires the most advanced principles and technology in data privacy and security — to provide an easy and effective way to verify account ownership and identity. The open banking ecosystem is rapidly expanding, ushering in the next wave of systems that scale. Players with deep expertise are injecting further trust for even greater adoption. Early results indicate that we’ve got a bright future ahead – more choice in lending and payment types, more control over our financial data and more insights to help us achieve our financial goals.&nbsp; Learn more about our Mastercard Open Banking solutions for <a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">payments</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">account opening</a>.</p>

<p>After diving into the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">science of quantum computing</a> in the second episode, the Entrust Engage podcast moves toward the world of blockchain and the impact of quantum computing on it in the third episode. Providing commentary on this topic was Jon Geater, Chief Product and Technology Officer at RKVST, and Pali Surdhar, Director of Product Security at Entrust. The intersection of blockchain and quantum computing is quite fascinating, and that’s exactly what this episode explores. Here are the four key things I learned from this conversation:</p>
<p>#1: What is blockchain? </p>
<p>Before we go further into how quantum computing impacts blockchain, it’s important to have a foundational understanding of just what this technology is. As this episode explains, blockchain is ledger-based, decentralized, and built on high-integrity cryptography. It features two crucial properties: Control is spread around to a number of participants, and accountability is shared and decentralized. Built on the foundation of cryptography and fair-access principles, blockchain ensures fair access, good control, and knowledge of trustworthiness of the data.</p>
<p>#2: Is blockchain at risk from quantum computing?</p>
<p>In blockchain, the threat from quantum computing has more to do with the integrity of historic ledger records than the decryption of data. If a bad actor was able to back-date data and effectively rewrite history by leveraging quantum computing, it would break the blockchain principle of ensuring the truthfulness of data.</p>
<p>While this could be a potential vulnerability in the future, at present blockchain happens to be partially quantum-resistant already. Even if the technology were to be compromised, it could only happen at one point in time, in one place, on one computer, and in one piece of memory. And then after that, the computer must convince the other participants in the consensus that this is the correct version of history to accept. In a sense, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks has some built-in quantum resistance.</p>
<p>#3: In that case, does blockchain need to be prepared to mitigate risk?</p>
<p>There’s a significant overlap between what’s being required by regulatory bodies and the capabilities of blockchain-based architecture. Since there’s already some resistance in blockchain to quantum attacks, is there any urgency to transition to quantum-safe techniques? This can depend on the use case, but the answer is probably yes.</p>
<p>In blockchain, if the use case involves a confidentiality requirement, key exchanges are occurring, and there exists the same vulnerability as in the wider internet. Another important consideration is the data inside the blocks themselves; users need to make sure the chain references or digests can’t be faked. That’s another situation in which it is useful to have quantum-resistant algorithms deployed.</p>
<p>#4: When should blockchain prepare for the quantum threat? </p>
<p>To paraphrase our experts: Prepare now but know you’re not alone. Blockchain creates accountability for its shared infrastructure. Blockchain users would be wise to update their cryptography and transition their algorithms to <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">quantum-safe options as outlined by NIST</a>. They exist in a community; the best advice is for users to come to a consensus about protecting assets and joint histories for the road ahead.</p>

				 <p>DIDComm — short for Decentralized Identifier Communication —&nbsp;is a new protocol for anyone or anything with a Decentralized Identifier to communicate directly with another Decentralized Identifier — and it has the capacity to change how we interact and create digital relationships</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>DIDComm is catching on. Just like when the internet was just becoming widely available and few were even aware of it — let alone knew what to fully expect — we are seeing similar potential in the way we securely communicate digitally.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identifier Communication (DIDComm), is a method for creating a direct, encrypted line of communication between the owners of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs, are a recent W3C standard, and can be thought of as global digital addresses for identity, though they are more than that. The key point is that they are decentralized — unlike the centralized identifiers we presently use in the form of emails or user accounts with logins and passwords. In these centralized forms of identity, your data is stored and managed by a third party from whom you “lease” an identity. You don’t actually own your email address. By contrast, you do own and control your DID; you can create any number of them; they are permanent for as long as you wish, and they can refer to organizations and things as well as people.</p>
<p>Because you can prove you are the controller of a DID, digital identity no longer needs centralizing authorities to prove your identity online, a process that has proven highly susceptible to hacking, impersonation and fraud. identity has been decentralized, and in this process, many of the problems around digital privacy and security disappear because you can now use a DID to share information that is held and controlled only by you.</p>
<p>The channel that does this sharing is created by DIDComm. In short, it’s a way for the owners of DIDs to communicate directly with each other.</p>
<p>New ways to digitally interact create new kinds of digital relationships</p>
<p>Here’s what makes DIDComm powerful: It allows a mobile device to function in a way that is currently impossible — as if it had a highly secure API that it could interact with in a highly available, highly efficient way. This liberates mobile devices — and their users — to interact with servers (We explain the significance of this in greater detail in “The DIDComm Economy”). Second, DIDComm is transport agnostic, meaning communication can be through a website, email, mobile push notifications, QR codes, or a text message. Third, each owner of a DID must agree to accept a connection to enable communication along that channel. This means you will always have confidence in the identity of who you are interacting with.</p>
<p>Comparing DIDComm to the internet</p>
<p>The focus of both DIDComm and the Internet is communication and relationships. The internet enabled people anywhere in the world to interact with one another without ever needing to meet or even exchange contact information. Unfortunately, no one anticipated just how successful the Internet would become as a way of networking billions of people, companies, and entities — and why, at scale, identity verification would be essential to trusted interaction online.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials were introduced to solve this problem, allowing you to store all of your personally identifiable information locally, under your control, and to share it as you see fit to prove who you are in a decentralized, frictionless way.</p>
<p>Too often when we discuss decentralized identity the focus is on these verifiable credentials, which is not unwarranted, as they are the means by which we store and share information in verifiable ways; but it is important to remember that, just like the internet, they are a means to an end, not the end. The end is a variety of rich activities that become possible once you have created a trusted digital relationship — such as messaging, video chatting, and file sharing. DIDComm is what truly enables these end-goal activities, and while messaging is where DIDComm is finding its footing, it is useful for so much more.</p>
<p>How will it impact you and when?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been several recent events to support the idea that people are taking notice of decentralization technology, and more specifically, DIDComm. Last year, <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/w3c-launches-decentralized-identifiers-as-a-web-standard">W3C launched Decentralized Identifiers as a web standard</a>, meaning that there will be more support for the solutions across the internet, and they note that some integrations are already underway. <a href="https://www.lissi.id">Lissi</a> also <a href="https://twitter.com/lissi_id/status/1639182249475313664">recently announced</a> that they are hard at work on adding a messenger feature based on DIDComm to their digital wallet. And lastly, Indicio is also proud to say that our wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, allows for secure messaging through DIDComm. As more people become aware of what this powerful technology can provide we expect to see more solutions looking to make use of DIDComm very soon.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying this technology for yourself you can find Holdr+ in the app store now on both <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.indicio.holdrplus">Google Play</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/holdr/id1620628623">Apple Store</a>.</p>

<p>Encryption is a foundational tool to secure data from unauthorized disclosure and protect privacy for users and businesses.</p>
<p>What is private key cryptography? It is a form of encryption that uses a single private key for data encryption and decryption.</p>
 What Is a Private Key? 
<p>A private key is a cryptographic key used in an encryption algorithm to both encrypt and decrypt data. These keys are used in both public and private encryption:</p>
 
 In private key encryption, also known as symmetric encryption, the data is first encrypted using the private key and then decrypted using the same key. This means anyone with access to the private key can decrypt the data. 
 In a public-key system, also known as asymmetric encryption, data is encrypted with a widely-distributed public key. This data can only be decrypted with a corresponding private key that the user keeps secret. This makes it possible for anyone to send encrypted data to the owner of the private key, who can then decrypt it using their private key. 
 
<p>In both systems, the private key is kept secret and not shared with anyone else. It is used to decrypt and read encrypted messages. However, in a symmetric system, there is only a single key (the private key). In asymmetric systems, a message uses the public key to encrypt data that must then be decrypted using a private key.</p>
<p>Private key encryption is often used to encrypt data stored or transmitted between two parties. For example, when you log in to a website using a username and password, the password is often encrypted using a private key before it is transmitted to the web server.</p>
<p>While private key encryption is a simple and efficient method, it has limitations regarding secure data transmission over a network. Since the same key is used for encryption and decryption, two parties must securely exchange the key before data can be encrypted and transmitted. If an unauthorized party intercepts the key, they can easily decrypt the data.</p>
 Private vs. Public Key Encryption 
<p>As previously discussed, public and private key encryption differ on how they create and distribute keys. As such, there are several different applications of each approach.</p>
<p>Some examples of private key encryption include:</p>
 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-size blocks and typically use a single, private key. Examples of block ciphers include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Blowfish, and Triple DES. 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt data continuously and are commonly used in real-time communication, such as voice or video streaming. 
 Hash Functions: Hash functions are one-way functions that generate a fixed-size output from any input, allowing data recipients to verify the integrity of the data. Examples of hash functions include SHA-256 and MD5. 
 
<p>Some examples of public key encryption include:</p>
 
 Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA): RSA was developed by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman as an asymmetric encryption standard used for encrypting data as well as for digital signatures and key exchange. 
 Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): ECC is a modern asymmetric key encryption algorithm becoming increasingly popular for key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption. 
 Diffie-Hellman: Diffie-Hellman is a key exchange algorithm that is used to securely exchange keys for common applications like secure communication and virtual private networks (VPNs). 
 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA): DSA is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm that is used for digital signatures. It is commonly used in programs like secure email and financial management. 
 
<p>Additionally, some applications use public and private key encryption combinations to secure data communications. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Pretty Good Privacy (PGP): This uses both private and public key encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. It uses symmetric-key encryption to encrypt the data and asymmetric-key encryption to securely exchange the symmetric key between the sender and the recipient. 
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): SSL is a cryptographic protocol that establishes a secure and encrypted connection between a web server and a web browser. SSL provides a secure method of data transmission over the internet by ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client and server. 
 
 What Is Private Key Management? 
<p>One of the most critical points of security failure around private key encryption (and encryption more broadly) is managing and protecting keys. If a key is compromised, then any data that uses that key is effectively open to the public.</p>
<p>This presents a problem, however, in that keys must be stored and, in some cases, transmitted so that users can decrypt information. Therefore, effective private key management is critical to maintaining the security and integrity of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Here are some best practices for private key management:</p>
 
 Secure Storage: Private keys should be stored in a secure location, such as a hardware security module (HSM), a smart card, or a secure file system. The storage should be physically and logically secure, and access should be restricted to authorized personnel only. 
 Key Rotation: Private keys should be rotated regularly to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by generating a new key and phasing out the old one. 
 Access Control: Access to private keys should be strictly controlled, and only authorized personnel should be granted access. The access should be logged and monitored for any unauthorized activity. 
 Key Destruction: Private keys should be securely destroyed when they are no longer needed to prevent any potential compromise. This can be done by using a secure key destruction method, such as cryptographic erasure. 
 
 Generating and Finding Your SSL Key 
<p>The process of generating keys will differ depending on the application used and your proximity to key and encryption administration.</p>
<p>For example, the admin of an SSL server can generate a certificate using the software on hand. Likewise, the admin can use the URL they manage to request SSL certificates (which will generate public and private keys) from a certificate authority. These keys would be located on the server on which they are created… but aren’t available for general access.</p>
<p>Likewise, an application that uses PGP (like an email service) may create and store private keys in a local directory–again, in a location where normal users should not be able to access them.</p>
<p>The reality is that the key must remain private whenever a private key is generated. Therefore, these keys are often encrypted and protected behind strong authentication and access standards.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Private Key Encryption? 
<p>There are several benefits of private key encryption, including:</p>
 
 Performance: Private key encryption algorithms are easier to implement. Furthermore, these algorithms can encrypt and decrypt larger data blocks faster than their public counterparts. 
 Authentication: Private key encryption can be used for authentication by providing a digital signature that verifies the identity of the sender. Furthermore, different forms of authentication (passwords, etc.) can be used to authenticate a recipient before decryption. 
 Integrity: Private key encryption can ensure data integrity through message digests or one-way hashes by detecting any modifications or tampering that may have occurred during transmission.

   Singapore is a major global financial hub that is well known for its forward-thinking approach to regulation and business-friendly tax and legal system. The island nation has created some of the world's most advanced AML/CFT regimes that place robust and effective KYC requirements at their center. For this regulatory focus article, we take a look at what those are and how they can be met with digi

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 3rd–9th&nbsp;April <p>Welcome to another edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week, we focus on IOSCO’s upcoming crypto regulation consultation paper, the US Treasury’s report emphasizing AML compliance for DeFi, the Indian government’s update on crypto regulations and fraud prevention, and ECB’s Elizabeth McCaul calling for strengthening MiCA provisions.</p><p>Before we move forward, let’s pledge to safeguard the ecosystem’s true ethos amid increasing calls for regulating the nascent crypto sector. This applies to both the industry stakeholders and the regulators, as only by working together can we ensure a balanced, secure, and thriving future for the world of digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s collaborate and make crypto a force for&nbsp;good!</p> IOSCO to Launch Crypto Regulation Consultation in Q2&nbsp;2023 <p>The International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) plans to release a consultation report on regulating crypto assets in Q2 2023, with the final recommendations to be published by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/AleksandarRitt4/status/1644582437832499203?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>IOSCO’s Fintech Task Force has dedicated two major workflows to decentralized assets, covering digital assets and DeFi, focusing on investor protection.</p><p>The Commission has previously published reports on DeFi, stablecoins, and influencers, recommending national regulators acquire supervisory capacities such as regulatory channels for consumer complaints and evidence-tracking processes.</p><p>The organization also urged regulators to take a granular and holistic understanding of the DeFi market to create relevant legislation. IOSCO is an association of securities and futures regulators with a board of 35 regulators and top executives, including heads of the US CFTC, the US SEC, and the UK&nbsp;FCA.</p><p>This development will likely have significant implications for crypto users and the broader ecosystem. For instance, it can increase transparency, accountability, and investor protection, which may help mitigate risks associated with fraudulent activities, scams, and market manipulation, providing a more secure environment for investors.</p><p>However, some crypto enthusiasts fear that stringent regulations could stifle innovation and hinder the growth of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Compliance with new rules may also impose additional costs and administrative burdens on projects and startups, potentially leading to market consolidation, with smaller players struggling to&nbsp;compete.</p><p>Ultimately, the impact of IOSCO’s recommendations on the crypto ecosystem will depend on how national regulators implement and enforce these guidelines, with the potential to either strengthen investor confidence or inadvertently limit the industry’s potential.</p> US Treasury Department Emphasizes AML Compliance for DeFi in Risk Assessment Report <p>The US Treasury Department has released a report on the risks associated with DeFi, calling for implementing AML compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). While the report does not establish new supervisory expectations, it highlights that even truly decentralized services should implement AML controls under existing BSA obligations.</p><p>The Treasury underscores that all individuals or entities providing financial services are subject to the BSA and its AML regulations.</p><p>The report calls for industry input and engagement as regulators seek to build potential industry guidance on AML for DeFi. The Treasury also suggests using emerging technology solutions, such as blockchain intelligence tools, digital identity, and zero-knowledge proofs, to support compliance with AML/CFT obligations while maximizing user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>This push for compliance may also have unintended consequences for the ecosystem.</p><p>For instance, smaller players in the DeFi space may face difficulties meeting the requirements, which could lead to consolidation and decreased innovation in the market. Moreover, the added compliance costs could deter new entrants and pressure existing projects.</p><p>With the Treasury seeking industry input and engagement, the extent of these challenges will depend on how flexible and accommodating the eventual guidance is and the effectiveness of emerging technology solutions in striking the right balance between AML/CFT obligations and user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Indian Government Provides Updates on Crypto Regulation and Fraud Prevention Efforts <p>India’s Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, Pankaj Chaudhary, addressed two sets of inquiries concerning crypto in the Lok Sabha, the country’s lower house of parliament.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/business_today/status/1503921022986514432?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>The first set asked whether the government planned to legalize crypto and what impact it would have on the common people, to which the minister responded that crypto is currently unregulated. Any legislation for regulation or banning would require significant international collaboration.</p><p>Regarding crypto-related fraud, the minister said they are dealt with under existing laws against fraud and cybercrime, and he added that the Ministry of Home Affairs had launched a portal for the&nbsp;same.</p><p>Moreover, the Enforcement Directorate has been investigating cases related to crypto assets under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and the Foreign Exchange Management Act.</p> ECB Official Calls for Stronger Crypto Asset Safeguards <p>European Central Bank (ECB) supervisory board member Elizabeth McCaul has said that the European Union’s proposed regulations for crypto assets are insufficient and that safeguards need to be strengthened to address the risks involved.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1644325011107266561?s=20">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>The Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) bill, set to be voted on by the European Parliament later this month, is an important milestone but is not enough on its own, McCaul said in a blog&nbsp;post.</blockquote><p>She suggested that significant crypto-asset service providers should be subject to both stricter requirements and enhanced supervision and that new quantitative metrics are needed to consider the type of business.</p><p>McCaul also argued that thresholds needed to be measured at the group level rather than at the individual entity level to address the complexity of operations.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule: Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-block-perspective-march-2023">The Block Perspective: European Crypto Regulatory Climate and its Impact on Crypto Ecosystem — March&nbsp;2023</a></p><p>____________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Join us for Fission's first-ever conference! We're exploring the future of computing with experts in AI, programming language theory, computational media arts, and more.</p> Causal Islands: The Origin Story <p>Fission co-founders Boris and Brooklyn have been working together for quite a while on computing, distributed systems, and encryption in an effort to create developer tools that make building applications more accessible.</p><p>After attending <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6fvZA0L-ok&amp;list=PLFkGFMxuCsI2hwxF0TjUVGq-iLmn3MkIb">BlueYard's EthCC side event</a> in 2022, they were inspired by the speakers and attendees who brought their diverse research interests and areas of expertise into the conversation. They realized that being able to connect with folks outside of their regular circle was invaluable, and decided that they wanted to hold a conference of their own. One where everyone could learn from each other and share their knowledge while working on the future of computing. </p><p>The name "Causal Islands" comes from physics. It refers to how information traveling at the speed of light hits a physical limit. In our distributed systems, we experience this physical limit as latency - a function of our proximity to data centers and the quality of our connectivity. Brooklyn has used this concept in several of her talks to highlight how edge compute plays a part in reducing latency.</p><p>As we thought about it, it seemed like a good metaphor: we can think of us as all existing on our own islands of information: building our tech stacks and pursuing research into different areas of the future of computing, each in our own direction.</p><p>The Causal Islands conference is designed to bring together and engage everyone interested in the future of computing, both to share what they're working on, and to learn and be inspired by cross-disciplinary approaches on other islands of focus.</p><p>Now that you know the origin and purpose of the conference, let's jump into some frequently asked questions!</p> Who is behind Causal Islands? <p><a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a> created Causal Islands with the generous support of <a href="https://www.blueyard.com/">BlueYard Capital</a> and <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a>.

They also make really great flavoured sparkling water if you'd prefer!)</p><p>Brooklyn Zelenka, CTO and co-founder of Fission, Zeeshan Lakhani, staff research engineer at Fission and co-founder of Papers We Love Conference, and Chad Fowler, partner and CTO at BlueYard Capital, formed the programming committee that brought together our amazing set of speakers.</p><p>You can watch a recent AMA live stream with the programming committee below:</p> Where will this conference take place? <p>This is a three-day, single-track conference taking place in person April 25-27, 2023 at the <a href="https://paradiseonbloor.com/">Paradise Theatre</a> in Toronto, Canada, as well as virtually.</p><p>There is also an <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/program/party">evening social</a> at Lula Lounge for any of the Toronto tech community who can't make it to the conference, but would love to network and see some cool art + tech performances!

It was an exciting one as expected that aimed to promote innovation and collaboration among new digital identity businesses and initiatives in the APAC region. Open Space <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unConferences</a> is a participatory event where attendees co-create the agenda together live each day of the event. The focus is on discussing the subject with professional colleagues from a variety of identification sectors, there are no keynotes or&nbsp;panels.</p><blockquote>Secure and interoperable identity is necessary for engaging with people to benefit on the problems in today’s world such as tracking trade, supporting labour markets, and crossing borders for a variety of reasons. Significant investments have been made into the development of interoperable standards, protocols, systems application layers, conceptual use cases, and more.<br>APAC Digital unConference is one such newly initiated forum where people from the region have a platform come together, brainstorm on such problems to find solutions to with the emerging trends &amp; technologies and most importantly, to collaborate — eventually, get benefitted.</blockquote> People behind the idea — unConference - <p>The people behind the idea of the APAC Digital Identity unConference are passionate professionals who believe in the importance of digital identity and its impact on society. The Internet Identity Workshop (<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW</a>) had a major inspiration for the APAC Digital Identity Conference. The APAC event was organised and hosted by the two IIW facilitators and producers, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaliya/">Kaliya Young (Identity Woman)</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidi-nobantu-saul-0291941/">Heidi Nobantu Saul</a>, in partnership with a nearby business, Newlogic. IIW is being facilitated &amp; organised since year 2005 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/windley/">Phil Windley</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/docsearls/">Doc Searls</a> besides these two veterans.</p><p>The opportunity was to conduct an event for the APAC region in the same Open Space unConference style as the Internet Identity Workshop.</p> The new way of ‘Being Involved’! - <p>The new way of being involved is what makes the unConference unique. Unlike traditional conferences where attendees sit through pre-planned sessions, the unConference is a participant-driven event that empowers the attendees to take ownership of the agenda. It is a platform to share knowledge, ideas, and best practices in an open manner. All the sessions were led by experts in the field and moderated by volunteers from the community. The unConference is an event where the participants have the freedom to create their own agenda and ask questions, connect with others, and contribute to the conversation.</p> Glimpses of the topics covered&nbsp;- <p>The sessions were highly interactive, and participants had the opportunity to exchange answers to questions and get feedback.</p><p>Glimpses of the topics covered at the UnConference:</p><p>Day 1, Thursday, March 02,&nbsp;2023:</p>  Standards for Distributed ID for&nbsp;Asia  Sri Lanka Digital&nbsp;ID  Open Discussion: Navigating, Recognition Across&nbsp;Borders  What Constitutes Indigenous ID in SSI Approaches  Decentralised Identity Foundation (DIF) Ecosystem  Pictures as Identifiers  How Cloud Wallet could act as a bridge in the SSI&nbsp;space  DCDR — Data-Centric Digital&nbsp;Rights  Singpass — Singapore’s National Digital&nbsp;ID  “Not QR” Codes + Civil Registration + Vital Statistics  <p>Day 2, Friday, March 03,&nbsp;2023:</p>  (ToIP) Digital Trust Ecosystems  Identity &amp; Domain&nbsp;Names  Whiteboard Session: Elements That Make APAC Trust Framework  Building Open Source Communities + New&nbsp;Ideas  Verifiable Identity: Social Media — “The Bali Process”&nbsp;Context  Blue Economy and Regional paperless trade  NFTs as an Identifier — Pro’s Con’s Is it worth&nbsp;it?  Verifiable Credentials — Exchange Protocol and Wallet Interaction   Key Takeaways - <p>There have been several key takeaways from the unConference. However, some of the key ones include&nbsp;-</p><p>1. There was a unanimous vote to have APAC level collaboration to draft a APAC Digital ID Trust Framework. This group can have the participants of the working group shared diverse operating realities, their learnings and interests in building a coherent method to trust each other’s <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity systems</a>. As a key conclusion on this, it was agreed to house meetings for this group under one of the Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) working&nbsp;groups.</p><p>2. It was encouraging to see that a few countries in the APAC have already embarked on the journey of building Digital Identities infrastructure for the nationwide benefit of its citizens. Couple of the examples were&nbsp;-</p>  Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of <a href="https://www.dhi.bt/">Druk Holding and Investments Limited</a> (DHI) — Bhutan’s investment arm, updated about Bhutan just launched a new national digital ID system (NDI). Bhutan NDI is Bhutan’s new National Identity System, developed by Druk Holding and Investments (DHI) for GovTech Bhutan. The NDI will have citizens eight years old and above enrolled into it. Apart from the ID card, the NDI wallet will carry other information including health, tax filings, education and census records as well as revenue and bank statements, and business documents.  Singapore (they are implementing <a href="https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/">SingPass</a>). The representatives from the Singapore government who attended the unConference stated that with SingPass, the citizens can access over 2,500+ services by over 800+ government agencies and businesses at their fingertips  Sri Lanka government also leveraged an India based open source platform, MOSIP, to implement Digital identity management for its citizens.  <p>3. Decentralised Identity Foundation (<a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a>) and Trust Over IP Foundation (<a href="https://trustoverip.org/">TOIP</a>) are the forums where most of the innovation is happening — innovation in terms of tech stack&nbsp;, frameworks, libraries and standards for Decentralised Identity, Trust Frameworks, Governance Frameworks, Trust Ecosystems, et. al. It was an opportunity for the first time attendees of such Digital Identity unConference to get first hand update about these two&nbsp;forums.</p><p>4. We urged the facilitators that the next APAC event should be hosted in India. Considering the vast diversified demography spawning across technology enthusiasts to unicorns to startups to government representatives to people from all walks of life, there will potentially be a huge attendance for the&nbsp;event</p> Benefit to participate in future&nbsp;- <p>Everyone should participate in the UnConference, especially those who are interested in digital identity, including individuals, practitioners, researchers, regulators, implementers, government leaders, technologists, digital and privacy rights activists. The UnConference is an excellent opportunity where individuals representing various standards, initiatives, and businesses can congregate, exchange knowledge, form relationships, and advance the&nbsp;cause</p> Proud Sponsors&nbsp;- <p>AyanWorks was honoured to be one of the sponsors of the inaugural APAC Digital Identity unConference. Companies that sponsored the event besides <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a> included <a href="https://gluu.org/">gluu</a>, <a href="https://newlogic.com/">Newlogic</a> and <a href="https://opendevelopmentmekong.net/">Open Development Initiative</a>. Over the past 4 years, AyanWorks has been working in the core <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Decentralised Identity solutions</a> space and delivering solutions to our global clients. With this experience at our strength, we strongly believe that such events are essential to bring awareness, do more evangelising and move forward in the new digital era followed by innovation, building digital identity infrastructure and developing secure, dependable digital identification ecosystems.</p> Summing it&nbsp;up! <p>To summarise, the APAC Digital Identity unConference is a great place to network, learn, and add to the conversation about digital identities. We invite everyone to take part in upcoming activities, all future APAC Digital Identity unConferences and keep promoting innovation in the Digital Identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>See you all in the next such event in APAC.. hopefully in India&nbsp;🙂!!</p>

</p><p>Blockchain technology offers huge benefits – decentralization, transparent interaction, high levels of security, and immutable record keeping. It has enabled a thriving crypto ecosystem to grow and support continuous technological innovation. However, one of the main problems with many blockchain networks is their scalability. Scaling is an issue when the amount of data passing through the blockchain hits a limit due to the insufficient capacities of the blockchain.</p>



<p>In an ideal case, a blockchain would be able to process countless transactions per second, also known as throughput or with the acronym TPS. However, the Bitcoin main chain can only handle about 3-7 TPS. By comparison, Visa can process more than 20,000 TPS using the VisaNet centralized electronic payment network. The difference is in the level of decentralization and privacy that Bitcoin and other blockchains aim to provide.</p>



<p>Similarly, Ethereum is coming to a point where it faces scalability challenges. As of summer 2022, Ethereum is processing an estimated 500,000 transactions per day, which equates to 30 transactions per second. By comparison, Visa's payment system can process up to 150 million transactions per day and 65,000 transactions per second. This far exceeds the processing power of Ethereum. Ethereum 2.0 is expecting it to increase to 20,000-100,000 transactions per second however it will take few years to reach that maximum capacity.</p>



 What Are Layer-2 Scaling Solutions? 



<p>Layer 2 refers to secondary frameworks or protocols that build on top of existing blockchain systems. The main purpose of these protocols is to solve the transaction speed and scaling problems faced by major cryptocurrency networks. It not only reduces workload on main net, but maintains the same security and decentralization standards as the underlying blockchain.</p>



 Layer-1 v/s Layer-2 Blockchains 



<p>Layer 1 blockchain refers to the underlying blockchain network architecture and protocols that serve as the foundation for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based use cases. It is the core layer of a blockchain system and consists of the basic building blocks that enable data storage, transaction processing, and consensus mechanisms.</p>



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions are technologies that build on top of existing layer 1 blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, to increase their scalability and efficiency. Layer 2 solutions allow for off-chain processing of transactions, which helps reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its scalability.</p>



<p>One of the key differences between layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain technology is scalability. Layer 1 blockchain networks have limited transaction processing capacity, which can result in slow processing times and high fees during periods of high demand. Layer 2 solutions address this issue by reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on the main blockchain, thereby increasing its capacity.</p>



 Advantages of layer 2 blockchain solutions 



<p>Layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages, including:</p>



 
 Scalability: Layer 2 solutions can help increase the transaction processing capacity of existing blockchain networks, making them more scalable and able to handle higher volumes of transactions. By offloading transactions from the main blockchain, layer 2 solutions can reduce congestion and increase throughput. 
 



 
 Speed: By processing transactions off-chain, layer 2 solutions can significantly reduce transaction processing times, resulting in faster and more efficient transactions. 



 Lower fees: Layer 2 solutions can help reduce the fees associated with blockchain transactions by reducing the workload on the main blockchain and reducing the amount of data that needs to be stored on it. 



 Improved privacy: Layer 2 solutions can enable privacy-preserving transactions by using techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs and state channels to keep transaction data off the main blockchain. 



 Interoperability: Layer 2 solutions can enable interoperability between different blockchain networks, allowing for the seamless movement of assets and data between them. 



 Flexibility: Layer 2 solutions can be tailored to specific use cases and can be designed to work with a variety of blockchain networks, making them a flexible and versatile solution. 
 



<p>Overall, layer 2 blockchain solutions offer several advantages over traditional layer 1 blockchain networks, including improved scalability, speed, privacy, and interoperability, making them an essential component of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>



 What Types of Layer-2 Solutions Out There? 



<p>There are several types of Layer 2 scaling solutions, each with its own approach to increasing the scalability of blockchain networks. Here are some of the most common types of Layer 2 solutions:</p>



 
 State Channels 



 Plasma 



 Rollups 
 



 State channels blockchain solution 



<p>State channels are a layer 2 blockchain solution that allows for off-chain transactions between two parties. State channels enable fast and cheap transactions by keeping most of the transaction data off the main blockchain.</p>



<p>Projects - Lightning Network, Celer Network, Trinity</p>



<p>Here's how state channels work:</p>



 
 Two parties create a contract that defines the rules of their transaction. 



 They deposit their cryptocurrency into a shared channel, which is a smart contract on the blockchain. 



 They then conduct their transactions off-chain, using the rules defined in the contract. 



 Once they are finished, they close the channel and settle their balances on the main blockchain. 
 



<p>State channels are useful for microtransactions, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive. They can also be used for real-time, interactive transactions, such as online gaming or instant messaging.</p>



 Plasma layer 2 solution 



<p>Plasma is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that was first proposed by Vitalik Buterin and Joseph Poon in 2017. The goal of Plasma is to enable the Ethereum network to process a large number of transactions, while still maintaining the security and decentralization of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma chain projects- Polygon, Loom Network</p>



<p>Here's how Plasma works:</p>



 
 A smart contract is created on the Ethereum network that serves as the root chain. 



 Child chains, also known as Plasma chains, are created off of the root chain. These Plasma chains are fully functional blockchains with their own validators, but they are connected to the Ethereum network. 



 Transactions on the Plasma chains are processed off-chain, and are only submitted to the Ethereum network when a block is finalized. 



 The finality of blocks on the Plasma chains is enforced by the root chain, which acts as a final arbiter for any disputes that arise. 
 



<p>Plasma is useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. It can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main Ethereum network would be prohibitive.</p>



 Rollups 



<p>Blockchain rollups are a type of Layer 2 scaling solution that aim to improve the scalability of blockchain networks by grouping multiple transactions together before submitting them to the main blockchain for verification. There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups, which assume that most transactions are valid and only require minimal verification, and ZK-rollups, which use zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions off-chain before submitting them to the main chain.&nbsp;</p>



 
 Optimistic Rollups 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution for blockchain networks that offer several advantages over traditional on-chain transactions. Here's how they work:</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then validated by a small group of validators who check for fraudulent or invalid transactions. 



 Once the batch is confirmed, it is sent to the main blockchain and added to the ledger. 
 



<p>Optimistic Rollups are useful for applications that require high transaction throughput, such as decentralized exchanges and gaming platforms. They are also ideal for micropayments, where the transaction cost on the main blockchain would be prohibitively expensive.</p>



<p>Optimism and Arbitrum are popular optimistic rollup projects</p>



 
 Zero-Knowledge Rollups 
 



<p>Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK Rollups) are a layer 2 blockchain solution that enables fast and efficient transactions while maintaining the security and decentralization of the underlying blockchain network.</p>



<p>Projects- Minaprotocol, immutableX, loopring, ZK Sync</p>



<p>Here's how ZK Rollups work:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Transactions are processed off-chain and bundled into batches. 



 The batches are then verified using zero-knowledge proofs, which enable the network to verify the transactions without revealing any of the transaction data. 



 The verified batches are then submitted to the main blockchain, where they are added to the ledger. 
 



<p>&nbsp;ZK Rollups are useful for applications that require high throughput, such as decentralized exchanges or gaming platforms. They can also be used for micropayments, where the cost of conducting the transaction on the main blockchain would be prohibitive.</p>



<p>To sum up, the implementation of layer 2 scaling solutions is paramount in overcoming the scalability and usability limitations of blockchain technology. These solutions allow for increased transaction throughput, decreased fees, and enhanced functionality, all while maintaining the security and decentralized nature of blockchains. As more projects adopt layer 2 technologies, we can anticipate remarkable progress in the blockchain industry, along with the emergence of fresh use cases for decentralized applications.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our upcoming articles, where we will dive deeper into various layer 2 projects and provide detailed insights into their technical details, advantages, limitations, and potential use cases.&nbsp; Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, developer, or investor, our articles will provide valuable insights into the latest developments in blockchain scaling solutions. </p>

<p>Cyberattacks continue to increase at an alarming rate, and many security breaches can be traced back to an authentication issue. Whether a password or a password plus an additional authentication factor, attackers are adept at bypassing them at scale. For example, over 100 million multi-factor authentication (MFA) attacks <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/feature/Ways-to-overcome-multifactor-authentication-vulnerabilities">were recorded in Q1 2022</a>, whereas such attacks were virtually non-existent in 2019.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Just this month, law enforcement agencies in Europe and the U.S. announced the seizure of a major online <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/criminal-marketplace-disrupted-international-cyber-operation">marketplace that offered over 80 million stolen login credentials</a>, giving cybercriminals access to accounts in the financial sector, critical infrastructure, and government agencies, among others. This hasn’t put them out of business, however, as the group’s admins announced the marketplace would soon be available <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-seizes-stolen-credentials-market-genesis-in-operation-cookie-monster/">through other channels</a>.</p> 
<p>The pressure on security teams is showing no signs of abating, and against that backdrop, we compiled our <a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report">State of Passwordless Security report</a> for a third consecutive year. For this report, we asked 1,000 IT/IS security decision-makers from around the world about the state of cybersecurity in their organization and where passwordless security currently fits into their defense strategy.&nbsp;</p> 
 Authentication Is Still Highly Vulnerable  
<p>As has been the case in our <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-state-of-passwordless-security-in-2022ss-security">previous two reports</a>, authentication remains the greatest weakness in enterprise cybersecurity. Of the professionals we interviewed, 60% said their organizations had suffered breaches through authentication-based attacks across the last 12 months. These breaches can then be used as launchpads for further attacks, such as ransomware or data theft.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The ability of attackers to automate phishing processes, including buying easy-to-deploy kits on the dark web, make any authentication process featuring passwords and other shared secrets high-risk. This ease of access means that even low-skilled attackers can launch successful assaults on major corporations. However, despite these clear and obvious risks, most organizations don’t make any changes to their authentication processes after a successful attack. Even worse, a majority still deploy passwords in some form, with 57% using the most basic username and password combos for some systems.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Since credential theft is still the easiest and most successful method for attackers, major industry groups and the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">federal government</a> have advised organizations to deploy phishing-resistant, passwordless methods.&nbsp;</p> 
 Global Cyber Defenses: New Avenues of Attack  
<p>Virtually every organization has suffered some form of cyberattack over the last year. The main vectors for these attacks are common threats such as phishing and ransomware, but one, in particular, has shown noticeable growth. Nearly 30% of organizations were hit by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">push notification attacks</a>, which have more than doubled their prevalence since the 2022 report (12%).&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>This increase relates to how organizations have tried to counter their greatest cybersecurity weakness (passwords) with multi-factor authentication. MFA requires a user to authenticate themselves using two or more factors based on knowledge (i.e., password or PIN), possession (i.e., device or hardware security key) or inherence (i.e., fingerprints or face scans).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the general acknowledgement that passwords are easily phished or cracked, MFA in the form of a password plus an additional factor, has been widely considered a possible solution. However, as our report shows, this has not proven to be an effective security measure. For example, attackers can bypass push notification MFA by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">spamming users with push requests</a>, aka MFA prompt bombing, hoping the user will accept.&nbsp;</p> 
 Passwordless Security: A Multi-Problem Solution  
<p>The most tangible consequences of authentication-originated breaches are monetary, costing organizations an average of $2.95 million annually. This doesn’t factor in the longer-term financial impacts of losing business to rivals and reputational damage.</p> 
<p><a href="https://get.hypr.com/2023-passwordless-security-report"></a></p> 
<p>The problems with passwords, however, extend beyond their serious security implications. From a user-experience perspective, passwords are the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">root cause of significant frustration</a>. Our report reveals that 81% of respondents experienced occasions where they could not access critical information because they’d forgotten a password. Along with the time spent logging in with passwords, password resets and account lockouts significantly impact employee productivity and, consequently, their bottom line.</p> 
<p>The costs are also very real at the IT support desk. Our report uncovered some thought-provoking insights into how much upholding password-based authentication costs organizations yearly. Enterprises spend 32% of their IT helpdesk budget on password-related issues, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-much-does-a-password-reset-cost">such as resets</a>. This equates to $465,645 annually, or $375 per employee per year, wasted on password issues.</p> 
<p>While passwordless security has its own implementation costs, it is generally far cheaper than maintaining password-based systems.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Short-Term Future of Passwordless Security  
<p>Despite the clear and obvious problems using passwords causes on an annual basis, many organizations have yet to adopt full passwordless security. Even though the security leaders interviewed were almost unanimous in their belief in passwordless security benefits, organizations still face significant obstacles.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>These obstacles range from fears around integration with their current technology stack to lacking the internal knowledge to implement a new system, to general misunderstandings of what exactly constitutes phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA. Only 3% of organizations that state they use passwordless solutions are using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. This means that 97%&nbsp;of the “passwordless” solutions deployed are susceptible to phishing and push attacks.</p> 
<p>Our State of Passwordless Security Report 2023 gives an in-depth insight into exactly how much authentication weaknesses are costing organizations every year. We also look at the global state of passwordless security and how organizations respond to the biggest threats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as the Biden administration released its new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;on March 1, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/about">Hyperledger Foundation</a>&nbsp;responded with this truth bomb:&nbsp;Open source&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity technology</a>&nbsp;will not only achieve the strategy’s goals, it’s available right now.</p>



<p>It’s an opinion we wholeheartedly applaud.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/02/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-national-cybersecurity-strategy/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>&nbsp;centres on this theme: “We must&nbsp;ensure the Internet remains open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure — anchored in universal values that respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2023/03/13/the-role-of-decentralized-identity-in-implementing-the-white-house-national-cybersecurity-strategy">statement</a>&nbsp;responding to the strategy, Heather Dahl, Hyperledger Foundation governing board member and Indicio CEO, pointed out that the problems the strategy is addressing don’t require a “moonshot to solve” because they have been “a central concern among open-source technology communities like those at the Hyperledger Foundation for many years. And they—we—have found solutions.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl explained:</p>



<p>“Decentralized identity has provided a way to provide a verification layer for digital interaction; we have ways to prove who we are and know who we are interacting with; we have ways for people to hold their data and share it in a way that preserves their privacy.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to overstate the importance of the next point: These aren’t paper solutions or future ware; industries are leading the adoption of this technology. The prospect of secure, seamless travel—which would take a passenger from online check in to boarding, through border control, and all the way to unlocking their hotel room—is driving the creation of a verifiable digital travel credential.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl drew on examples in decentralized identity applications from&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/about/">Indicio</a>, the company she heads up, which span “everything from employee identification to auditing devices monitoring emissions to tracking supply chains. We’ve used Hyperledger Foundation technologies to develop verifiable credentials that manage financial transactions, from passwordless proof of account ownership to reusable KYC.”</p>



<p>Importantly, Ms Dahl said the solutions are ready and universally available: “The future is happening now. And because so much of this work has been built on open source codebases (meaning many developers, companies, and even governments passionate about the technology have contributed code), the future is available to everyone.”</p>



<p>Ms Dahl specifically called out&nbsp;Strategic Objective 4.5 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in which the White House notes “the human cost of inaction and inertia” as being data breaches that affected nearly 300 million people in 2021 alone and which stem from the lack of secure digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She welcomes the Federal Government’s desire to “encourage and enable investments in strong, verifiable digital identity solutions that promote security, accessibility and interoperability, financial and social inclusion, consumer privacy, and economic growth,” saying:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One of the remarkable things we have seen with open source verifiable digital identity is that it has been embraced by businesses and governments alike: everyone who sees the technology in action immediately sees how it is the building block for digital transformation: a way to upgrade web2 and tangible infrastructure for creating web3. With verifiable credentials, anything can be given an identity and that identity and the data associated with it can be verified seamlessly. Decentralized Ecosystem Governance — a machine-readable way of managing roles, rules, and trust within a verifiable identity ecosystem — solves the problem of governance, elegantly.</p>



<p>The ability to implement seamless verification transforms every aspect of digital interaction. If you can trust the data, you can devise processes, products, and services that are frictionless and trustworthy, whether it be proving you own a bank account or want to share your health records or cross a border. Again, this is already happening.”</p>



<p>Read Anonyome Labs’ co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley’s explanation of why&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials are the “killer feature of DI.”</a></p>



<p>The Hyperledger Foundation is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation. Anonyome Labs is an active member of the Hyperledger Foundation and has been contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community for some time. Hyperledger hosts the decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects and Anonyome Labs contributes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python">Aries Cloud Agent (ACA-PY)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-vcx">aries-vcx</a>&nbsp;projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>See all the additional ways Anonyome Labs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">actively contributes to decentralized identity development</a>.</p>



<p>Clearly, we agree with Ms Dahl’s commentary on the new national cybersecurity strategy finding its legs in decentralized identity, so we’ll leave you with her final quote: “As the White House and the Federal Government move forward, we hope they will recognize the enormous progress that has been made, that the moonshot worked, and now we’re ready for the stars.”</p>

 In this vlog, 1Kosmos VP of Product Marketing, Robert MacDonald, is joined by our VP of Product Management, Javed Shah, and our Marketing Manager, Abigail Edwards, to discuss their experience at Gartner IAM. 
 
 
 
 
<p></p>
 Abigail:<p></p>
 
<p>Gartner IAM. Woo woo. What a good time.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>It’s a great time. It’s always a great time.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>It is fun. We have fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Hello.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I’m going to ask you some questions about it.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>All right, fire away.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, to start, what’s Gartner IAM ?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, from my perspective, I’ll let Javed talk from PMA side, but from a PMM side, it’s the preeminent identity and access management event that happens every year. So if you want to know what’s going on in the IAM space and what the trends are, what the emerging technologies are, where the market industry is going, you go to this event. And it’s been like that since I’ve entered the IAM space about 20 years ago. It’s also a good opportunity for me to go check out and see what some of my competitors are doing.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Like Rob said, yes, absolutely. It’s a gathering place, annual gathering place of all things identity. Identity professionals, vendors, customers, and of course analysts. It’s also a place to discover stuff. There’s a lot of discovery going on every single day. And I think as much as we are learning from what the analysts are thinking about their research, I believe that the analysts are learning from us as well. Especially the one-on-one sessions where you put an arcane requirement from a bunch of customers you heard about in front of an analyst, you put them in a deep think mode, right? So it’s really useful. And it obviously works the other way where the analyst will drop some piece of information. This quote comes to mind, “You’re either orchestrating or you’re being orchestrated.” Remarkable in my opinion because that’s kind of the drift we’ve been on here at 1Kosmos for a while now, really trying to make things easier and add value on top of passwordless, add security to passwordless. So really important Session held once a year.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We liked Texas. Texas was Fun.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>And now it’s going to be in Texas apparently. So used to the Vegas life-</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>And we had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But that’s history. All good.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had a booth.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>We loved Texas, yeah.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>We had great conversations and engagement, but why and where does 1Kosmos fit into this event?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, it’s a good question. Again, from my perspective, and Javed, you may have a different one. But there’s a lot of trends that are taking place within our industry right now. One of those is passwordless, right? And another one is actually identity verification, funny enough. How to prove an identity online. And being that we play in both of those spaces and is really the only vendor to bring both of those capabilities together, we fit into that space quite nicely. If we look at just a lot of the conversations, Abigail, you were in the booth. When we talked about what we did, it aligned very well to what customers were trying to solve. Especially when we brought into the fact that they came in looking for passwordless.</p>
<p>We say, “Oh, by the way we do that is building a verified identity so you can ensure you know the user behind the device.” And at the end of the day, that’s what people are trying to do. There’s lots of technologies that are laying on top to try to make that happen, but at the end of the day, what we bring to the table is a concept of, and it’s one of the things that Akif talked about, is this concept of identity plus selfie. Is it identity plus selfie? ID plus selfie, yeah, thank you. To ensure you know who that user is by the device. So if you combine the identity, I did it again, the ID plus selfie, you end up on a path that puts you in a position of security that hasn’t been available until 1Kosmos, to be frank.</p>
<p>And when customers see it, and this event for us was better than the last time we were there because the market continues to evolve and people are starting to understand what we’re doing. It’s a very interesting conversation and one in which we are leading the conversation in, which is also fun. We had a couple of people show up at our booth because of Javed, talked about meeting with the analysts, they met with a couple of analysts. They’re looking to do some specific things and they left that meeting and came directly to our booth to learn more because we’re the only ones that can do an IAL or AAL level two certified authentication. Nobody else can do that. We’re the only ones that can do that. So it’s a very different conversation for us than I think it is from some of the other people that are attending that show. Right Javed? What do you think?</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely, we have to be there. We’re going to educate the market about how to do Passwordless correctly, Passwordless securely. We are the only NIST certified IAL2 authenticator on the planet. We have to be there. We are the ones who are helping educate the market. The analysts are learning from us and they’re kind of repeating a little bit of our sentiment now. It has picked up that construct of ID plus selfie, it’s something we’ve been saying for four years now. It’s been on our website for three years now.</p>
<p>You do passwordless because you know who the person is, not who the device is. That’s the right way to do passwordless. Every other exhibitor in the passwordless space prefers to use final authentication, bring a device. Well, we demonstrated we could use seven touch IDs on one phone to unlock a demo. That’s not knowing the identity to open the demo. That’s knowing the device and that’s a shared device. That’s not how we do it. So I think it’s really important for us to be there and for this, I guess, dissemination of information that we are very good at. And I think the market’s really not very good at it yet because it’s still learning.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Love that. What would you say in terms of all these conversations that happened in our booth, did anything throw you off? Any questions or unique conversations that really stuck, that felt different than our typical conversations at these types of events?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>For me, the big one, as I mentioned, we had an organization come straight to our booth after talking with one of the analysts. They were curious about what a digital identity wallet was. “Tell me about how that works.” And that’s not typically a question we get. Normally it’s like, “Tell me how you do passwordless.” Or, “Tell me how you do identity verification.” But the concept of an identity wallet may not be new. The way in which we deliver it, certainly is. And they were interested in the way we bring all of that together.</p>
<p>How do we build that wallet? What’s behind it? What’s the supporting technologies for us to make that work? The fact that we can support the concept of bring your own identity was a very hot button for them. And they spent about an hour in our booth learning more about our technology and how all of this stuff comes together. And that conversation didn’t happen the last time we were at this show because customers just didn’t quite understand it. But the market is moving such that it’s evolving so quickly that we’re starting to have those conversations now. That’s a big one for me.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, and I would agree obviously, and for me it was interesting. Folks are showing up at these events. The IRS was there, Costco was there, so many different large companies. Navy Federal was there. Folks are taking a look at what they’ve been doing for the last 20, 30 years, which has been the paper-based onboarding of new hires, whether they’re full-time or they are contractors. It’s interesting how they are suddenly looking to digitize everything as if that’s going to be possible. But there is this impossible dream. Everyone comes up in shows, “Well, my help desk receives a phone call. Can you digitize that for me? I do this manually and it’s a process. Can you digitize that for me?” Those are impossible problems to solve as the technology in the phones and the onboard biometrics with your laptops and all. The state-of-the-art doesn’t support the impossible use cases, but folks are asking the question anyway, and I think that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad thing just because it’s an impossible or a difficult problem to solve, doesn’t make it a bad thing. It means that there are discussions happening behind closed doors and the doors have opened. Now those discussions are in our booths, and I think that’s where you tend to get that expansion of that circle, that knowledge domain, which is just starting to happen. I did not get questions like that in the last Gartner event, but this time around there were questions like that, and of course there were difficult answers to those and sometimes there was comfortable silence as well. Where everybody realized, “Well, I just asked an impossible question,” but they’re there. They have your number and I feel that can lead to only good things. So that was kind of a standup for me because it was different.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I mean, great conversations, unique questions. What overall, sessions, booth, other vendors being there, the analysts that were present, the attendees walking around, what are your overall thoughts of how this event went?</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Well, again, for me, this is the first event I’ve been to since, not that I want to say that word again, but COVID, right? It’s the first time that I’ve been on a show floor in three years almost. So it was good just to get back out and meet people face-to-face. Not to mention, I mean, listen, this is a very small space. It’s fun to see past coworkers and past customers that you’ve worked at or with at other companies that you may have been part of. But at the end of the day, there’s always takeaways. There’s always things that you’re going to learn.</p>
<p>And this event is absolutely no exception to that. And it’s a very beneficial show if you can get there. There are lots of things that you are going to learn no matter how experienced you are. There’s always going to be something that is going to make you stop and think about whatever you just saw, watched, heard, whatever that might be. It’s always a great event. There’s always things that I’m learning, whether it be from customers or from analysts or even some of the other vendors around the show floor, but it’s always a very good event and always a very good time. Always time very well invested going to it.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>It was good to catch up with friends from, what, 20 years? Folks still in the business. You enter this industry, you don’t leave it because it’s the identity business, as we said in the session, we are truly the only providers of our own identity. Hopefully people are starting to learn that, understand that. That’s been our value prop for nearly half a decade now. The analysts are starting to speak what we are speaking and imagine meeting all of those individuals, those folks at the same place. I was quite pleased with the venue, to be honest. I was not sure what to expect after Vegas.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, I was too.</p>
 
<p>Javed:</p>
 
<p>But it was good.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>I think it’s better than Vegas, personally.</p>
 
<p>Abigail:</p>
 
<p>I liked it. At the Gaylord in Grapevine.</p>
 
<p>Rob:</p>
 
<p>Yep.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><br>
Identifiers are a crucial part of our daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have both private and public identifiers. On the private side, examples include Social Security numbers and Driver’s Licence numbers, and there are many private or closed identity systems that manage private identifiers for us. Sometimes, they give us these identifiers in the form of cards or tokens. On the public side, we use public identifiers every day, such as Phone Numbers, Email Addresses, Domain Names, and Usernames.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these identifiers, both private and public, are created and managed by central authorities, such as governments, financial institutions, telcos, email providers, domain name registrars and most service providers. This centralization means that we don’t really have ownership and control over our identifiers or identities, leaving them vulnerable to fraud and misuse.</p>
<blockquote><p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/J1AQUlvdz4I?t=2043">podcast episode 45</a>, Drummond Reed makes the point that the email address is still the most widely used identifier, but the most valuable for newer systems and where the Social Web is going is your mobile phone number. The mobile phone number is the most valuable identifier on the dark web because, with mobile phone number portability, it’s your address across multiple systems. It’s also the one you’re likely to hold on to because it’s a pain to change it. Some people have more than one, but a lot of folks only have one of those, whereas it’s very common for us to have multiple email addresses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before recording this podcast, I watched a presentation called the <a href="https://vimeo.com/809258916/92b420d98a">AI Dilemma.</a> The presentation was made by some of the same people who created the <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/">Social Dilemma</a> documentary on Netflix. In this presentation, they talked about how content-based authentication is dead. With certain advances in AI, deep fakes can be done so easily through both voice and video. You could perfectly mimic someone’s voice with just three seconds of audio, which is kind of scary. It made me think about all these telephone scams that happen and how it’s going to become easier and easier to scam people.</p>
<p>How can we better authenticate things in a world where identity takeovers continue rising, and spoofing is becoming practically impossible to detect? Unpacking identifiers is a good place to start.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized identifiers</a>, or a new way of managing our identities could be an example of something that could help solve these problems. There’s a growing need for decentralized identifiers that put ownership and control back into the hands of individuals, enabling secure/private/confidential conversations, interactions and relationships.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast conversation include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 An overview of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) – how DIDs came about, their history and evolution. 
 The core properties of DIDs – what sets them apart from other types of identifiers. 
 DID Methods. As of this post, there are 160+ DID Methods listed in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">this registry</a>. Are they all decentralized? Why are there so many? What are some popular ones that have been adopted? 
 What things to consider in your selection criteria for the right DID Method(s). 
 When would one use DIDs for abstraction purposes vs vanilla public-key cryptography? 
 DID Documents – what can be stored in them? How are they linked to a DID? What are some examples of things you can store in the authentication and service endpoints. How do you interact with them? 
 Using blockchain vs non-blockchain (e.g., DNS server) implementations for storing DID Documents. What are some key elements to take into consideration when looking at these different options? 
 Do DIDs disrupt or enhance existing certificate business models? 
 The power of DID Resolution – how has it evolved, how does it work? (see video ⬇️ for a great explainer)

<p>Fission can't wait to return to IPFS Thing. We're presenting nine talks and will share progress on some of our most anticipated projects, including IPVM, RhizomeDB, and a Passkeys + UCAN integration.</p> What is IPFS Thing? <p><a href="https://2023.ipfs-thing.io/#">IPFS Thing</a> is a week-long gathering for the IPFS implementors community featuring talks, workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more.</p><p>Last year the conference was held in Reykjavik, Iceland. Here's a quick recap:</p>IPFS Thing 2022 Recap<p>Fission attended in 2022 and gave four talks about our work in the IPFS ecosystem. You can watch a playlist of those talks here (click the image to navigate to the playlist):</p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfW9my7NCey9Np7ZYwDjA32w5of3JWKId"></a>A Playlist of Fission's 2022 IPFS Thing Talks (CLICK TO PLAY) Fission Talks at IPFS Thing 2023 <p>This year IPFS Thing will be held in Brussels, Belgium, April 15-19, and Fission is thrilled to return for another year. We look forward to connecting and collaborating with many innovators in the space and are incredibly honored to be giving nine(!) talks throughout the week. </p><p>Here are the talk abstracts:</p> Interplanetary Databases Track <p>Querying Decentralized Data in Rhizomatic Systems with Quinn Wilton</p><p>Shifting storage and compute toward the far edge reflects an extreme departure from traditional cloud-based architectures, bringing with that shift a new set of challenges for application developers. Rhizome is a decentralized database for InterPlanetary Linked Data that embraces these challenges to open up new ways of thinking about consistency, interoperability, and privacy. This talk introduces the ideas underpinning Rhizome, and demonstrates how they come together to empower developers to build and reason about new types of peer-to-peer and decentralized applications.</p> Data Transfer Track <p>CAR Mirror Reflections with James Walker</p><p>CAR Mirror describes a method for efficiently diffing, deduplicating, packaging, and transmitting IPLD data from source to sink. In this talk, there will be an introduction to the CAR Mirror protocol followed by a review of the current state of the Go implementation.</p><p>Data Transfer Batching Techniques Featuring Blake3, CAR Mirror, and More with Phillip Krüger</p><p>Batching block transfer is the main way to optimize DAG exchange compared to bitswap. This talk discusses current proposals for batched data transfer, such as blake3 with bao, sending CAR files, CAR mirror, and GraphSync. We’ll look at what use cases they do and don’t solve and which techniques from one protocol could be applied in others.</p> IPFS On The Web Track <p>The Name Name Service – Discoverable, Verifiable Names for Decentralized Infrastructures with Blaine Cook</p><p>NNS is a new approach to providing distributed discovery for human-readable names. NNS builds upon DIDs and UCANs to allow permissionless delegation and service discovery, emphasizing improving end-user UX for IPFS and related services. This talk will overview the approach, discuss use cases, and explore anticipated challenges.</p><p>WNFS: Versioned and Encrypted Data on IPFS with Phillip Krüger</p><p>The WebNative File System (WNFS) empowers users with extensible metadata, file and directory history, conflict resolution, and encryption with fine-grained access levels. We show a rough outline of its design goals, how it works, our roadmap, and possibly a demo of our new Rust implementation.</p> Integrating IPFS Track <p>Decentralizing Auth, and UCAN Too with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>UCAN is a decentralized auth format used by several DWeb, web3, and IPFS projects. Much like how IPFS uses content addressing to liberate data from centralized hosts, UCAN uses CIDs and OCAP to liberate apps from centralized auth servers. Learn how UCAN can help throughout the IPFS stack, from block-level access to user permissions to application interop.</p> Community &amp; Governance Track <p>Starmaps: A Cross-Team Roadmapping Tool with Bastien Dehaynin</p><p>I would like to share Starmaps, a tool Protocol Labs developed for roadmapping based on Github issues. It is especially good for rendering cross-teams/projects roadmaps, which is perfect for improving visibility inside the network and communicating dependencies more easily. We have started using it at Fission, and our goal is to have as many PLN projects as possible rendered in a single Starmap where you can navigate and look at the dependencies between projects. </p> Decentralized Compute &amp; AI Track <p>IPVM: Content Addressed Compute for an Open World with Brooklyn Zelenka</p><p>Curious about the latest from the IPVM WG? This talk presents updates from the working group: a high-level overview of IPVM, standards to date, the latest roadmap, and lessons learned so far. This includes invocation and workflow models, a (pluggable) effect system, a principled approach to partial failure, open interop, kernel functionality, private data handling, and the most common question: what IPVM is *not*!</p><p>Foundations for Open-World Compute: Homestar, an IPVM Tale with Zeeshan Lakhani</p><p>At Fission, we've been laying down the groundwork for an IPVM implementation called Homestar, a distributed compute engine built with IPFS and IPLD at its core, along with first-class support for the Wasm (WebAssembly) Component Model and Interface Types, a vision for managed effects, and primitives for open-world replayability, capability discovery (UCAN capabilities specifically), and execution coordination. In this talk, we'll predominantly focus on the deterministic Wasm subset of the engine, particularly on why we've sided with the Wasm Component model, how we bidirectionally translate between IPLD and Wasm Interface Types at runtime and aim to achieve a legitimate write once, run anywhere ethos. We'll also dive into approaches related to the monumental challenge involving open-world interoperability, especially in the context of other distributed workflow frameworks and toward the goal of fault-oblivious computing. </p> UCANs + Passkeys <p>In addition to these exciting talks, our newest Fissioneer, <a href="https://twitter.com/hugomrdias">Hugo Dias</a>, will offer demos of a prototype he built that uses a combination of Passkeys and UCANs to authenticate users signing into Webnative apps. </p><p>As you know, we at Fission love <a href="https://webnative.dev/">passwordless authentication</a>. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">Passkeys</a> are a fantastic opportunity to onboard more users into apps without them needing to create a password, Ethereum wallet, or use a browser extension. Currently, Passkeys work best for Web2 use cases because they need to connect a server and the user's device for validation purposes. However, we want a local-first solution - one that is native to the browser. </p><p>That's where UCANs come in! UCANs can act as a source of truth for authorization, where servers would typically come into play. To utilize UCANs and have decentralized auth, you need a DID and a private key. Passkeys can use face scanning, fingerprint touch, or hardware authenticators to seed DIDs and cryptographic signatures. This is what we're working on implementing at Fission.</p><p>If you want to see Hugo's demo, find him at IPFS Thing!</p> Stay Informed <p><a href="https://lu.ma/ipfsthing2023">In-person tickets</a> are still available for IPFS Thing 2023, but if you can't make it to Brussels, don't worry! All talks will be recorded, and we will be sure to share them on the blog (with a deeper dive into each talk) when available.</p><p>On that note, be sure to <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/">subscribe to our newsletter</a> so you can receive our blog posts and Fission news directly in your inbox.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, check out our previous update here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-29/">  Spruce Developer Update #29  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything), is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Currently, we're working on adding support for working with user-controlled data in SSX. If you're curious about this work, message us in our Discord! We hope to have more announcements about changes to the library later this quarter.   We released a new package supporting Auth.js, NextAuth's spiritual successor. We've also updated our tutorials to reflect the new changes and plan on creating additional guides around its usage (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/76?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #76</a>).  We've added an update to revalidate sessions when users change accounts using their wallet to ensure that the currently selected wallet is attempting to establish a session with a given application (<a>ssx #88</a>).  We've pushed numerous fixes to our Gnosis Safe login extension, including a fix for the modal flashing when there's no active delegation for a multisig, a fix for the SSX instance freezing if the modal is closed during the sign-in process, and some additional housekeeping (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/98?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #98</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/100?ref=blog.spruceid.com">100</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/103?ref=blog.spruceid.com">103</a>).  Additionally, we've added a fix for any login failures if <code>resolveEns</code> is set to <code>true</code> and a user is on a network that isn't supported by ENS (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/102?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #102</a>).  We've added callbacks on SSX server middleware routes to increase flexibility for executing additional code during the authentication process &nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/105?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssx #105</a>).  Finally, we made several additions and updates to our documentation and a few fixes for our end-to-end tests for the library.   <p>We would also like to thank everyone who beta-tested SSX Quest, a credential issuer built on SSX and Kepler during ETHDenver. </p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/plant-a-tree-and-control-your-data-with-ssx-at-ethdenver/">  Plant a Tree and Control Your Data with SSX At ETHDenver  We’re happy to announce that we are demoing an app called SSX Quest that shows how Sign-In with Ethereum can extend user control into interactions with user-controlled data, beyond just identity.  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>We're happy to announce that we'll be planting 100 trees for all the folks who obtained and presented credentials within the application. To learn more about SSX Quest, check out the article above. </p> Sign-In with Ethereum Core Libraries <p>Sign-In with Ethereum is a new form of authentication that enables users to control their digital identity with their Ethereum account and ENS profile instead of relying on a traditional intermediary.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-integrates-sign-in-with-ethereum-into-metamask-for-better-user-experience-and-safety/">  Spruce Integrates Sign-In with Ethereum Into MetaMask for Better User Experience and Safety  We’re now happy to announce a significant step forward in Sign-In with Ethereum adoption with a direct integration into MetaMask.  SpruceSam Gbafa    </a>  We're extremely excited to announce our collaboration with MetaMask to bring native Sign-In with Ethereum support to the MetaMask extension wallet! Now, when a user signs in with Ethereum using MetaMask, they will be presented with a neatly formatted "sign-in" request along with domain binding which protects users from phishing attacks. For more information on this integration, check out the article above.   We're in the process of making numerous updates and security improvements to our <code>siwe</code> core TypeScript library. Stay tuned for more information on these changes.   The ReCap specification (<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ERC-5573</a>) has been updated to reflect new developments in the distributed capabilities space (EIPs <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6654?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#6654</a>, siwe-recap <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-recap/pull/14?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#14</a>), bringing it in line with the UCAN specification to enable integration between SIWE-based applications and applications using UCANs and CACAOs.   Kepler <p><br>Kepler is a decentralized storage network organized around data overlays called Orbits. Kepler allows users to Securely share their digital credentials, private files, and sensitive media to blockchain accounts, all using your existing keys.</p>  CORS support has been improved and made configurable via a simple boolean, making testing and deployment easier for those not using a load balancer (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/kepler/pull/138?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#138</a>)  We're currently working on replication in Kepler and configurable storage limits in orbits. If you're curious about our work on Kepler, please reach out to the team.    SpruceID <p>SpruceID is a decentralized identity toolkit that provides everything you need for signing, sharing, and verifying trusted information.</p> TreeLDR <p>TreeLDR is a schema definition language that aims at describing both the structure and semantics of the defined schema in a comprehensible way. It lies at the intersection between <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">RDF</a> and structure-oriented schema definition frameworks such as <a href="https://json-schema.org/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">JSON Schema</a>.</p>  We are currently working on TreeLDR being able to define a trait definition for each RDF class (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/treeldr/pull/124?ref=blog.spruceid.com">treeldr #124</a>).    Rebase   In Rebase, we've now added PRs for a finalized version of flows for credentials that attest ownership of NFTs and POAPs (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/53?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #53</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/54?ref=blog.spruceid.com">54</a>).   Additionally, we've added several PRs that simplify integration times, and we're currently adding TypeScript bindings to its client for a much better developer experience in the frontend (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/56?ref=blog.spruceid.com">rebase #56</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/57?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#57</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/rebase/pull/58?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#58</a>).   <p>Spruce lets users control their data across the web.

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Dr. Kendall Mao and I am the Chief Scientist for Ontology.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am very interested in cryptography and I also play basketball and football, among other sports. I had two pets when I was a child, a cat, and a dog, and now I have a pet&nbsp;snail.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I have been the Chief Scientist for Ontology since July 2018. My duties include conducting technical research on the underlying technology of blockchain, Ontology’s decentralized identity system, and zero-knowledge proof mechanisms. I also research how we can combine elements of the blockchain and identity&nbsp;system.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>In my opinion, there are three things that make Ontology stand out from other blockchains. Firstly, the efficient confirmation of the Ontology blockchain. The Ontology chain adopts the VBFT consensus algorithm, which can support high concurrent TPS and fast confirmation of blocks. Secondly, Ontology’s multi-virtual machine system currently supports three types of virtual machines: NeoVM, WasmVM, and EVM, enabling developers familiar with different programming languages to quickly develop dApps. Finally, Ontology’s decentralized identity system sets it apart. Ontology was the first team to realize the importance of the decentralized identity system and has been exploring this technology for quite some&nbsp;time.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>The most exciting part of the Ontology project is its decentralized identity framework.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>The moment when I really decided to devote myself to the blockchain field was by far the most critical and career-defining moment in my&nbsp;career.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited to see how the expansion of decentralized applications into the mainstream industry brings about real and much-needed autonomy for users, over their identity and&nbsp;data.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the next five years, in the field of Web3, decentralized collaboration and decentralized social networks may be a trending use of DID frameworks. Ontology will continue to do a good job in building the infrastructure for Web3, not only providing an easy-to-use blockchain but also continuing to provide Web3 with a decentralized identity system and related content, such as decentralized reputation, which is the cornerstone of Web3 applications.</p><p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-chief-scientist-dr-kendall-mao-9dc77c5d82da">Meet the Team: Chief Scientist, Dr. Kendall Mao</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Despite their ubiquity, passwords have become – at best – an anachronism and, at worst – a gaping security blindspot for organizations and individuals alike. To put it simply, passwords are bad. They represent one of the weakest links in security, are a leading cause of breaches, and are both difficult and frustrating to manage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ll say it again. Passwords are bad. Bad for security and bad for user experience. Bad across the board. Bad bad bad. One can even argue that they are the most prevalent and broadly accepted (albeit irrationally) global vulnerability. They offer practically zero redeeming qualities whatsoever and you should stop using them immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, passwords suck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, since you are on the Ping Identity website, I’m likely preaching to the choir on the shortcomings of password security. Most of us already know this all too well. We also know that adopting passwordless authentication can solve all these problems through enhanced security, better user experience, and streamlined access management:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For customers, passwordless authentication improves engagement while also lowering abandonment rates. These seamless experiences ultimately drive higher revenues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>For employees, passwordless authentication results in less time entering and resetting login credentials. In turn, this equals higher productivity and less strain on helpdesks.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While increased profits should be motivation enough to embrace passwordless, the security benefits are also glaringly obvious. Case in point, <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/2020/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf">80% of breaches involve brute force attacks or the use of lost or stolen credentials</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the pros of going passwordless drastically exceed the cons of sticking with the status quo. So – this begs the question – why the heck are we still using passwords?!?!</p>

 Stakers can claim DF31 rewards. DF32 runs Apr 6— Apr 13,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 32 is here&nbsp;(DF32).</p><p>DF32 is the third week of DF Main, the final phase of DF. This week, users can earn rewards up to 150K OCEAN.

In fact, it’s a self-contained description of Ocean Data Farming (DF), including all the details that matter. It is up-to-date with the latest reward function, weekly OCEAN allocation, and estimates of APYs given the current amount of OCEAN&nbsp;staked.</p><p>DF is like DeFi liquidity mining or yield farming, but is tuned to drive data consume volume (DCV) in the Ocean ecosystem. It rewards stakers with OCEAN who allocate voting power to curate data assets with high&nbsp;DCV.</p><p>To participate, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">users lock OCEAN to receive veOCEAN</a>, then allocate veOCEAN to promising data assets (data NFTs) via the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/data">DF&nbsp;dapp</a>.</p><p>DF31 counting started 12:01am Mar 23, 2022 and ended 12:01am Apr 6, 2023. 75K OCEAN worth of rewards were available.

This phase emits 150K OCEAN / week and runs for 52 weeks total. (A detailed DF Main schedule is&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>.)</p><p>Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Some key parameters:</p>  Total budget is 150,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (75,000 OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  <p>Active rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee">rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508">publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6">asset’s DCV * 0.1%.

For example, people could have a “Credentials Soul” for their curriculum vitae and a “Financial Soul” for the records of their transactions, allowing them to build a confirmable digital Web3 character established on their experiences and preceding actions.</p><p>Perhaps one of the most powerful aspects is that SBTs owned by one Soul can be issued or attested by other Souls who are counterparties to these relationships, like other individuals or institutions. For example, a company can distribute SBTs to employees, or a school can issue SBTs to students who completed specific courses or&nbsp;majors.</p> SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs <p>Nowadays, most NFTs are ownership certificates for digital art or collectibles. People buy, trade, or display NFTs as a symbol of wealth and status. The goal of SBTs is to transform NFTs into an object beyond wealth, a unique and untransferable token.</p><p>NFTs portray capital and ownership, whereas SBTs represent an individual’s or entity’s reputation. SBTs do not consist of financial value and cannot be traded once distributed to someone’s wallet. The table below shows a summary of the difference between SBTs and&nbsp;NFTs:</p>[Source: Cointelegraph] SBTs and DAO&nbsp;voting <p>Trust is one of the main challenges involving the Web3 industry. How can a person’s reputation be trusted in a system made to be trustless? In the financial sector, SBTs can be used to represent someone’s credentials, where reputation will act as collateral to get a loan, in contrast with the current way of checking the borrower’s bank account balances and credit&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Another use of SBTs is in decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting. As an alternative to the current governance model, based on the number of tokens a member holds, DAOs could provide SBTs assigning voting power dependent on users’ interactions with the community. This model would prioritize voting power to the most dedicated users with a strong reputation.</p><p>Additionally, SBTs can improve the integrity of DAO voting, defending it in particular against Sybil attacks, where an individual or a group of bad actors take over a DAO by purchasing the majority of governance tokens. This way, voting proposals can be manipulated, and the project’s direction can be influenced by those with majority voting power. The public and verifiable nature of SBTs can help distinguish and prevent bad actors from entering the DAO and, therefore, halt corruption and Sybil attacks from taking&nbsp;place.</p> SBTs’ possible use&nbsp;cases <p>SBTs have a broad spectrum of possible usage in everyday life; a few examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Education records: certification as proof of completion of the required courses. A university could issue SBTs storing the credentials and confirming the relevant qualifications and university membership to graduated students.  Credit history: SBTs can be used to represent traditional credit reports, allowing lenders to access the borrower’s credit history. As a result, people cannot hide or ignore their obligations.  Job applications: Job applicants can submit SBTs representing their educational credentials and professional certifications provided by universities and past employers.   Which SBTs are&nbsp;active? <p>SBTs are quite new, but there are some already in&nbsp;action:</p>  The <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a> is the first SBT issued on the BNB chain by Binance. The BAB token is the credential Binance users get when they have passed the KYC process and has no monetary&nbsp;value.  Pangea, one of Metadium’s partners,<a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c"> launched SBT.PIZZA</a> in collaboration with Yonsei University, a top university in Korea. The project allows Yonsei to issue SBTs to students who satisfy qualifications like attending specific lectures, seminars, or activities.  <p>With SBTs being so new, there is still much to be learned. For now, it seems unlikely they will completely replace the NFT system but they could serve as an alternative to identity&nbsp;control.</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>오늘은 SBT가 무엇인지, 그리고 SBT가 우리의 일상 생활에 어떻게 적용될 수 있는지에 대해 자세히&nbsp;알아보겠습니다.</p> SBT란? <p>Soulbound Token(소울 바운드 토큰), 혹은 SBT는 블록체인 기술을 사용하여 개인의 신원과 자격 증명을 나타내는 공개적으로 검증 가능하고 양도가 불가능한 NFT(Non-Fungible Token)입니다. 이 개념은 2022년에 이더리움의 공동 설립자인 Vitalik Buterin과 FlashBots의 전략 고문 Puja Olhaver, 그리고 정치 경제학자이자 사회 기술자인 E. Glen Weyl이 발표한 &lt;탈중앙화 사회&nbsp;: 웹3의 영혼을 찾아서(Decentralized Society&nbsp;: Finding Web3’s Soul)&gt;라는 논문에서 처음&nbsp;소개되었습니다.</p><p>SBT는 근무 경력, 의료 기록 및 개인 또는 단체에 속하는 모든 정보로 구성될 수 있습니다. SBT가 영구적으로 귀속된 지갑이나 계정은 “Soul(소울)”이라고 불리며, 사람들은 그들의 다양한 삶의 모습을 표현하는 소울 여러 개를 가질 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 자신의 이력서를 위한 “자격증명 소울”과 거래 기록을 위한 “금융 소울”을 가질 수 있으며, 이를 통해 자신의 경험과 이전 활동을 바탕으로 확인 가능한 디지털 웹3 캐릭터를 구축할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 가장 두드러지는 특징 중 하나는 한 소울이 소유한 SBT가 다른 개인이나 기관처럼 관계의 상대역인 다른 소울에 의해 발행되거나 증명될 수 있다는 것입니다. 예를 들면, 회사는 직원들에게 SBT를 배포할 수 있고 학교는 특정 과정이나 전공을 이수한 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 NFT <p>요즘 대부분의 NFT는 디지털 아트 또는 수집품에 대한 소유권 인증서입니다. 사람들은 부와 지위의 상징으로 NFT를 사고, 거래하고, 전시합니다. SBT의 목표는 NFT를 고유하고 양도할 수 없는 토큰, 부 이상의 객체로 변환하는&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>NFT는 자본과 소유권을, SBT는 개인 또는 기업의 평판을 나타냅니다. SBT는 금전적 가치를 포함하지 않으며 한 번 누군가의 지갑에 분배되면 거래될 수 없습니다. 아래 표에서 SBT와 NFT의 차이점을 확인할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT와 DAO&nbsp;투표 <p>신뢰성은 웹3 산업이 직면한 주요 과제 중 하나입니다. 신뢰할 수 없게 만들어진 시스템에서 어떻게 사람의 평판을 신뢰할 수 있을까요? 금융 분야에서 SBT는 대출자의 은행 계좌 잔액 및 신용 점수를 확인하는 현재 방식과 달리 평판이 대출을 받기 위한 담보 역할을 하는, 누군가의 자격 증명을 나타내는 데 사용될 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>SBT의 또 다른 용도는 탈중앙화 자율 조직(DAO, Decentralized Autonomous Organization) 투표입니다. DAO는 한 유저가 보유한 토큰의 양을 기반으로 하는 현재 거버넌스 모델의 대안으로, 유저와 커뮤니티의 상호 작용에 따라 투표권을 할당하는 SBT를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이 모델은 강력한 평판을 가진 가장 열정적이고 활발한 유저에게 투표권을&nbsp;우선시합니다.</p><p>또한 SBT는 DAO 투표의 무결성을 향상시켜 특히 개인 혹은 위험인물들이 거버넌스 토큰의 대부분을 구매하여 DAO를 인수하는 시빌 공격(Sybil attack)으로부터 DAO를 방어할 수 있습니다. 이러한 공격 방식은 투표 제안서를 조작할 수 있으며 프로젝트의 방향은 다수결 권한을 가진 사람들에 의해 영향을 받을 수 있습니다. SBT의 공개적이고 검증 가능한 특성은 위험인물이 DAO에 진입하는 것을 구별하고 방지하는 데 도움이 될 수 있으며, 부패와 시빌 공격이 발생하는 것을 막을 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> SBT의 사용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 일상 생활에서 광범위하게 사용될 수 있습니다. 몇 가지 예는 아래와&nbsp;같습니다.</p>  교육과정 기록: 필수 과정을 이수했다는 증명. 대학은 졸업한 학생들에게 자격증을 저장하고 관련 자격과 대학 구성원 자격을 확인하는 SBT를 발급할 수&nbsp;있습니다.  신용 기록: SBT는 전통적인 신용 보고서를 나타내는 데 사용될 수 있으며, 대출 기관이 대출자의 신용 기록에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 즉, 사람들은 그들의 법적 의무를 숨기거나 의도적으로 무시할 수&nbsp;없습니다.  입사 지원: 입사 지원자는 대학 및 이전 근무 기업에서 제공한 학력, 전문 자격증을 나타내는 SBT를 제출할 수&nbsp;있습니다.   SBT의 실제 적용&nbsp;사례 <p>SBT는 상당히 새롭지만 이미 사용 중인 경우도&nbsp;있습니다.</p>  <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/BABT?source=header">Binance Account Bound (BAB)</a>는 Binance가 BNB 체인에서 발행한 최초의 SBT입니다. BAB 토큰은 Binance 사용자가 KYC 프로세스를 통과했을 때 받는 자격 증명이며 금전적 가치가&nbsp;없습니다.  메타디움의 파트너 중 하나인 판게아는 국내 최고 대학인 연세대학교와 협업하여 <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadiums-new-partnership-with-pangea-inc-promises-further-expansion-in-the-metaverse-ba29a6a8322c">SBT.PIZZA</a>를 출시했습니다. 이 프로젝트는 연세대학교가 특정 강의, 세미나 또는 활동에 참석하는 등 일정 자격을 갖춘 학생들에게 SBT를 발급할 수 있도록&nbsp;합니다.  <p>SBT는 완전히 새로운 개념이기 때문에 아직 배울 것이 많습니다. 현재로서는 SBT가 NFT 시스템을 완전히 대체할 것 같지 않아보여도, 신원 제어의 대안으로 작용할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Sources:   <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-soulbound-tokens-sbt">What Are Soulbound Tokens (SBT)? | Binance&nbsp;Academy</a>  <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-soulbound-tokens-building-blocks-for-a-web3-decentralized-society">What are Soulbound Tokens?

				 <p>The Indicio Network Consortium is a community for advancing decentralized identity technology through enterprise blockchain. Here’s how it delivers value to its members—and why you should join!</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By France Donegan-Ryan</p>
<p>Indicio is building a community for organizations and businesses who want to be the leaders in the Enterprise Blockchain Community —and we want you to be a part of it. The Indicio Network Consortium is open to all, and there are many benefits to joining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is community important?</p>
<p>Community is a fast growing and strategic initiative for companies, and, contrary to what you might think, it’s not just a strategy for the big B2C brands, it’s an increasingly important strategy&nbsp; for B2B and startup organizations as well. In fact, nearly <a href="https://cmxhub.com/community-industry-report/">80% of founders</a> reported building a community of users as important to their business with 28% describing it as critical to their success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Communities play a vital role in building customer loyalty, driving brand evangelism, and delivering customer satisfaction. A <a href="https://peerboard.com/resources/online-community-statistics">2021 survey</a> found that 84% of companies that worked to improve their customer experience through community programs reported an increase in revenue. The same survey also revealed that customer-centric companies with branded online communities are 60% more profitable than companies that don’t focus on their customers.</p>
<p>Successful and supportive communities are built with the needs and wants of members at the forefront of their mission. When we were designing the Indicio Network Consortium we worked closely with customers, industry leaders, and community management data to create a meaningful program. We found that people, most of all, wanted to have a platform or space to connect with others with similar interests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the Indicio Network Consortium?</p>
<p>Consortium members can be Node Operators, Transaction Endorsers, or both. Node Operators support the Indicio Network by volunteering to run a copy of the Indicio ledger on a server that is under their authority. Each copy of the ledger is a node on the network, and multiple copies of the ledger distributed across multiple nodes and geographical locations forms a decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consortium members can also be Transaction Endorsers, which means taking on the process&nbsp; of approving writes to the network by other companies and organizations according to network governance rules. Node Operators can also be Transaction Endorsers, but only Node Operators can serve as Trustees for the Indicio Network, ensuring that the network meets its mission parameters.</p>
<p>Consortium benefits</p>
<p>There is no fee to become a Consortium Node Operator. Once approved you receive complementary decentralized identity and business training, professional technical support in operating your node, and have access to promotional opportunities provided via Indicio media channels and events. Also, there is a dedicated Slack space for all members to ask questions, get updates, and network. You’ll receive regular technical and community updates and have the chance to attend quarterly summits. Through these community activities you’ll have opportunities to build mutually beneficial relationships with peers, share how your business is using decentralization technology, learn from others, and highlight your progress and achievements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>All Node Operators are eligible to apply to be a Transaction Endorsers on the Indicio MainNet, or you can sign up directly and not operate a node. Being a Transaction Endorser provides you with additional revenue opportunities for your decentralized identity business model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several Transaction Endorser ledger write (e.g., DIDs, schema, credential definition etc.) packages you can choose from. Additionally, if you’re a Node Operator you receive a 25% discount:</p>
<p>Unlimited ledger writes&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 on time fee | $3750 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>100 ledger writes and unlimited recovations&nbsp;</p>
<p>$995 annually | $746 with Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Make your life easier with the Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/">Transaction Endorser Wizard</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p>$5000 one time fee | $3750 with the Node Operator discount</p>
<p>Consortium goals</p>
<p>We want the consortium to be a catalyst for business growth and for decentralized identity technology to reach new audiences. To do this, we will ensure there are regular opportunities to learn about what’s happening in the space, to hear from Indicio engineers and executives about technical and business developments, and to share in technical advancements that benefit us all.</p>
<p>Get started!</p>
<p>It’s easy! You just fill out this <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1xPes3CuyQqeGBbWU8FtrNQ4frvz?__hstc=120675671.f98fdba5ad0ff4a13870d9ac264b8ec2.1592507681167.1679007187879.1680045054218.195&amp;__hssc=120675671.9.1680045054218&amp;__hsfp=2726948359">application</a> for review by our Board of Trustees. On approval, the Indicio team will help you onboard and get set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>User account access is a foundational form of cybersecurity, addressing both internal and external threats.</p>
<p>How does Privileged Access Management (PAM) aid security? PAM centralizes privileged data access control to support protection against unauthorized access.</p>
 What Is Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Privileged Access Management is a set of technologies and processes to control and monitor access to privileged accounts that control or touch sensitive or mission-critical data. These accounts will have “elevated” privileges or more access to information or processes that could, in the wrong hands, represent threats to security and compliance.</p>
<p>Account access is one of the oldest security concerns in computing, due in no small part to the fact that the first line of user security is ensuring strong and effective account access that prevents untrained or malicious users from stumbling on important system information.</p>
 Standard Versus Privileged Account Access 
 
 Standard accounts are non-privileged accounts typically held by everyday users who only need limited system resource access. Standard accounts can be used to access apps like shared files, email, or productivity suites but can’t get into global systems that handle metrics, configuration files, or executable files. 
 Privileged accounts have elevated permissions and access to critical IT systems. These accounts are typically used by admins that need to make changes to core files or systems, including configuration files, databases, or even data used by operating systems. Depending on the type of system, admins can perform various operations like deleting and moving files or installing programs. 
 
<p>PAM is an approach that allows administrators to delineate users and functions and promote system integrity and security. This is especially true for organizations following the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/principle-least-privilege/">Principles of Least Privilege</a> (PoLP), which states that users should have minimal access necessary to complete their tasks.</p>
 What Are Common PAM Controls? 
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/password-management/">Password Management</a>: PAM will include controls that protect passwords from attack, require complex passwords, rotate passwords regularly, and use controls to prevent common password attacks. This can consist of centralized <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/identity-management-service/">identity management</a> like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/federated-identity-management/">federated identity</a> or Single Sign-On (SSO) approaches. 
 Access Control: Common forms of control like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can centralize rules to ensure that access to resources is limited to those with a reason, a necessity, or clearance to do so. 
 Auditing and Monitoring: PAM solutions will provide auditing capabilities that enable organizations to demonstrate compliance with regulations, policies, and security guidelines. This includes monitoring user account activity and maintaining reports of those activities for predictive security or forensic purposes. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Implementing PAM? 
<p>Perimeter security isn’t just about protecting a system from external threats. Internal security typically involves perimeter protection around different resources. This is particularly true in zero-trust systems where no user is inherently trusted and must be re-authorized at every access point. PAM is the very foundation of navigating these approaches to security.</p>
<p>Organizations use PAM for various reasons, including:</p>
 
 Reducing Attack Surfaces: PAM solutions will typically use heightened authorization and authentication measures (multi-factor authentication, biometrics, etc.) for privileged accounts. Since these accounts are often targets of attacks, then this approach helps focus security on critical system access. 
 Compliance: Many regulatory frameworks require specific control over private or sensitive data access. PAM is a critical component in meeting these compliance requirements. 
 Principle of Least Privilege: There is only one way to effectively implement PoLP, and that’s clearly understanding and managing privileges accounts and access controls within a system. As such, if you expect to leverage least privilege as a security priority, PAM is necessary. 
 Auditing: Part of a PAM system is using audit logs to determine which user accounts can access privileged information and how they do it. Not only are audit logs critical for security in general, but reviewing logs can help security determine if a threat is imminent–for example if odd behavior from a privileged account suggests that it has been compromised. 
 
 What Are the Challenges of Implementing Privileged Access Management? 
<p>Implementing a PAM system can be a complex process. The combination of data flows, applications, and users makes proper account management a challenge.</p>
<p>Some of the common challenges of implementing a PAM system include:</p>
 
 Integration: If you have existing authentication and security systems in place (like logging systems, SIEM solutions, account management software, etc.), then additional PAM controls must be integrated in a way that doesn’t disrupt any workflows or overall system integrity. 
 Applications and Environments: Many businesses use different environments spread across cloud systems and providers. PAM solutions must support different protocols and access methods to remain effective in complex IT environments. 
 Usability: PAM policies, improperly implemented, can also impact user productivity and experience, leading to frustration and resistance among users. 
 Compliance: Not all access policies are created equal. It’s integral that PAM policies meet compliance requirements, especially if your operations fall under different jurisdictions. 
 
 Is Privileged Access Management the Same as Identity and Access Management (IAM)? 
<p>While these two security approaches may overlap in practice, they are two distinct practices in user security. IAM and PAM are related, but they differ in their scope and applicability to different user accounts.</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">IAM</a> provides centralized user management services. These solutions are used to manage access to non-privileged accounts within an organization. 
 PAM, on the other hand, is focused on managing access to privileged accounts–that means administrator, IT, or executive accounts. 
 
 Support Your PAM Infrastructure with 1Kosmos 
<p>Integration is a major issue with PAM systems. You need an authentication system that works with principles of least privilege while maintaining strict security and usability for employees. That means strong biometrics bound to the privilaged user,, decentralized user management, and a consistent user authentication experience regardless of risk. .</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get these benefits, along with the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy.

<p>#BendNotBreak</p><p>In this series of 4 blogs we will explore the emerging work that we are undertaking in partnership with <a href="https://www.laudesfoundation.org/what-we-do">Laudes Foundation</a>. The overall goal of the collaboration is to look with fresh eyes at the challenges and opportunities presented by an equitable decarbonisation of Europe’s land and buildings. A major component of this journey is to identify innovative individuals and organisations who are working in this space. For Laudes, building and supporting a community of changemakers who are working to achieve outcomes such as fair work and green, affordable housing is a critical element of the transition ahead. We hope that these first thoughts will prompt discussions and questions and we would welcome your views and critiques. Please do get in touch if you would like to contribute.</p> Blog 1 (of 4): Considering the fundamental ecological, physical and social constraints of the Built Environment  Applying a new conceptual filter to old challenges <p>The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything.</p><p>If you are reading this blog then you almost certainly understand how to think in terms of systems. Ideas such as looking upstream of the crises to identify root causes and the interconnected nature of the world’s wicked problems will be familiar. You probably have a particular area of interest or expertise. You might be working on education because you sense that if we could encourage a new generation of systems thinkers then our future would be transformed. Or you might be certain that the core problem is the embedded growth obligation of our economic system. Perhaps your focus is on biodiversity and preserving life’s ecosystems, because without these the economy and education are both meaningless. In these (and many other) convictions we would agree. Each is arguably ‘the’ underlying cause and each requires a response. The reality is a kaleidoscope of upstream factors and if we fail to address a single one then there is a real danger that we fail at everything. Following this logic, it seems that we need an ecology of responses rather than multiple upstream solutions.</p><p>This kind of framing can make us feel individually powerless but if we can allow ourselves to lean into the uncertainty and complexity of what is unfolding, then new opportunities surface. An alternative frame is to shift our focus from trying to enact solutions (for example, a Europe wide retrofit rollout or building a certain number of green homes) and to think instead about the dominant forces that are acting on the sector. What do these trends mean in terms of the constraints we must operate within and around? An obvious example is the current spike in electricity prices which is putting enormous pressure on household budgets. If prices are set to rise into the future, will it even be viable to achieve our current comfort levels of heating and cooling by electrifying the existing infrastructure? Even if energy prices fall, existing global mineral reserves are insufficient to manufacture even one generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, H-cells, batteries, wind turbines and solar panels)¹.</p><p>With this in mind, we would like to propose a conceptual tool to help think through the constraints and identify strategies that could help to navigate them. Imagine an image filter that you apply to a familiar landscape. The basic features are unchanged, but the perception is altered so that some objects are in sharper relief and others are hardly visible. Or perhaps like the artist<a href="https://www.oliverjeffers.com/maps-and-globes"> Oliver Jeffers</a>, you turn the image (and the political motivations behind it) on its head to expose a different story. What do you notice that you didn’t consider before? If this type of perspective shift related to the operating space in which you work rather than to a nondescript image, how would you respond? Would it feel exciting, threatening, opaque or simply more than you have time for this&nbsp;week?</p>Oliver Jeffers — This way up, 2018 [oliverjeffers.com]<p>We, like many of you, have considered the cascading and multiplying threats of the 21st Century across many aspects of our work. After a wide review of the literature and some spirited dialogues (both internal and external) we have narrowed these trends down to four bottleneck filters; factors that we consider to be the most significant in analysing the constraints of Europe’s built environment decarbonisation challenge. These filters are intended as thought prompts rather than definitive conclusions and we are curious to hear how they sit with you. Do any of them intuitively ring true or do you think we are missing some fundamental elements? Is this kind of framing useful or do you view it as an unnecessary distraction?</p> The constraints: 4 bottlenecks that will shape the future of Europe’s built environment <p>The scope and scale of the transition ahead is unprecedented in terms of the human, physical and financial resources that will be required. In the EU, it is estimated that retrofitting the existing building stock will demand an estimated EUR 275 billion of additional investments per year to achieve EU climate targets by 2030². Despite the scale of this requirement, raising and managing this level of financial investment will only be part of the challenge.</p><p>We would therefore like to invite you to think about four additional constraints and how they apply to the work you are doing at the moment. How might they shape the strategies, design options and pathways that you think will be optimal for the transition of the built environment? What are you doing already that recognises and addresses these converging limitations? What might you need to lean further into or away&nbsp;from?</p><p>1. Labour constraints</p><p>Labour shortages combined with an insufficiently skilled and ageing workforce, means that resourcing sustainable building activities (for both modernisation and construction) is already a major problem for the building sector³. If we don’t make this sector more engaging and inclusive, we will simply not attract the volume or quality of labour required. This dynamic will be further complicated by migration patterns that will not necessarily correlate to labour needs (in timeframe or geographical spread). Climate and war refugees will not neatly arrive in areas earmarked for planned renovations or green building programmes. Even if they did, there will be other escalating labour priorities such as providing care or improving food security. As these pressures intensify it is likely that the allocation of labour to building renovation versus other critical missions will become a significant strategic issue.</p><p>To add fuel to the fire, across much of Europe, the shift from rural to urban areas is intensifying (in Romania and Slovenia for example the vacancy rate of dwellings in rural areas exceeds 20%⁴). If these and other transitioning geographies around the world continue to urbanise using modern technologies, then the pressures on carbon, material and energy budgets will be far greater than currently estimated.</p><p>2. The energy&nbsp;crisis</p><p>The labour constraints above will be further accentuated by a reduction in the so-called ‘fossil workers’ who have boosted our productivity over the last century. Globally we currently use around 100 million barrels of oil per day (c. 36 billion barrels per year) but this resource is becoming harder and more expensive to obtain, even if we put aside the carbon considerations. To put this into perspective, one barrel of oil is equivalent to the amount of physical labour that a human can produce in 4.5 years⁵. The annual consumption of around 8 billion humans is therefore 4.5 barrels per person (36bn barrels divided by 8bn humans) which equates to 20 years of equivalent human labour per person (4.5 barrels * 4.5 years = 20 years). This is an extraordinary statistic that has profound implications for our future living standards.</p><p>The renewable energy sector is growing rapidly but still only represents around 11% of global energy consumption⁶. Since 2000, the use of electricity by the building sector has increased almost five times faster than the corresponding improvements in the decarbonisation of the electricity generation⁷. Unless we shrink other areas of the economy the additional energy requirements of building decarbonisation may not even be possible within our current economic&nbsp;system.</p><p>3. The material&nbsp;crisis</p><p>This brings us onto the material crisis where energy shortages will collide with a requirement to power the mining of staggering quantities of additional materials. Take copper for example, which is an essential component for retrofitting⁸. Prior to 2020, humanity mined 700 million tons of copper back to 4,000 BC, but to keep up with current copper demand (excluding additional requirements from decarbonisation or electrification) we will need to mine that volume in the next 22 years i.e. we will compress 6,000 years of extraction into just&nbsp;22⁹.</p><p>Threaded through this bottleneck are geopolitical tensions that will almost certainly further intensify material resource pressures. Turkey for example, currently sources 35% of its aluminium (which is a critical building material) from Russia¹⁰. Other minerals used in construction (for example nickel as a component of stainless steel) are starting to be extracted from the deep sea beds of the global ocean. Here too tensions are rising as the frontiers of extraction expand, with China holding more contracts issued by the <a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/11/geopolitics-deep-sea-mining-and-green-technologies">International Seabed Authority</a> than any other&nbsp;country.</p><p>4. Ecological dynamics</p><p>In 2021, the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/957292/Dasgupta_Review_-_Abridged_Version.pdf">Dasgupta review</a> on the economics of biodiversity was commissioned by the UK Treasury and concluded that ‘we are currently damaging it [the natural world] so profoundly that many of its natural systems are now on the verge of breakdown’. Declining biodiversity levels are a tragedy in their own right but without careful management will also limit the availability of biomaterials for green building technologies. Added to this are the intensifying severe weather patterns that will require huge improvements in the resilience of buildings, thus putting further pressure on natural stocks. If we aspire to reconfigure the built environment using green materials we must first reconceive the relationship between our buildings and living resources such as timber. Imagine a future where the shape and quantity of our buildings must be defined by the regenerative potential of our forests, rather than the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>To put the above into context of the built environment, we did some rough calculations based on the global 96% carbon emission reduction requirement to stay within planetary boundaries and a per capita allocation of that budget per country¹¹. Our assumptions were also based on the current allocations of carbon to the construction industry in Europe (39% overall and 11% to pure construction) and an average emission figure of c.50 tonnes of carbon per new build. Using these high level figures, we estimate that the maximum number of houses that can be built within the carbon budget per year, would be around 176,000 for the whole of Europe and just 15,000 for the UK. To be clear, this is before we consider climate reparation budgets which will further restrict that number. In the context of 700,000 people being reported homeless per day in Europe¹² and an annual target of 400,000 new homes to be built in Germany alone, these numbers are shocking.</p> Strategies and design options: flipping our perspective to meet the future&nbsp;halfway <a href="https://uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/lyon-metropole">Home Silk Road Project,</a> Lyon [Urban Innovative Actions]<p>Building on the bottlenecks above we have been thinking through strategies that are either implied or invited by these constraints. This is our equivalent of drawing the map upside down and re-evaluating how to navigate the changing landscape. There are many possibilities; some are already being used to triage existing issues, some are quietly coalescing to power the next generation of responses, some are still conceptual. The following prompts summarise the strategic design principles that we have been thinking&nbsp;about:</p><p>Consider a no (or low) build future for Europe: There is no question that people need safe, green homes but can we realistically and ethically plan to build and renovate them with resource and energy pressures escalating? If we can’t build the required homes then we will need to intensify our use of the existing building stock. This could include a radical repurposing of Europe’s vacant buildings (including the 16% of homes that are currently unoccupied¹³) and reconfiguring how we equitably share&nbsp;space.</p><p>Embrace low-tech dematerialisation: If we can’t mine or recycle the materials needed we will simply need to use less of them. Some of these resource savings may come from technological improvements, but we can also look at strategies that simplify our lifestyles? Do we really need to keep our houses at 20 degrees year round? Could we instead move to zonal heating where areas of the building are subdivided into smaller compartments for heating according to seasons? For example, it might be possible to think about radiant heating panels for targeted heat requirements such as over a work&nbsp;desk.</p><p>Think upstream of the solutions as well of the problems: We might think of plentiful materials with low levels of embodied carbon as providing uncontroversial solutions, but what if we widen the boundary of our risk assessments? For example, bamboo is considered to be a low-carbon material with strong mechanical qualities, but without careful management bamboo invasion can negatively impact native plant diversity¹⁴. Seeking multiple perspectives on any response being proposed will be essential if we are to prevent today’s solutions from becoming tomorrow’s escalation pathways.</p><p>Embed a culture of care: The working conditions and social status of those who are currently working in the industry is worrying. In 2020, more than 20% of fatal work accidents in the EU occurred within the construction industry¹⁵. In the UK, the <a href="https://www.ciob.org/industry/research/Understanding-Mental-Health-Built-Environment#:~:text=Mental%20ill%2Dhealth%20is%20a,professionals%20their%20thoughts%20and%20experiences.">Chartered Institute of Building </a>has recently reported that ‘Mental ill-health is a silent crisis within the construction industry’, with male construction workers three times more likely to die from suicide than the national average. These are deeply disturbing statistics on a human level that fuel the subliminal narratives that percolate into every decision. How can we expect a worker appraising a development project to meaningfully embrace wellbeing outcomes, when their lived reality of achieving financial targets is in such stark contrast?</p><p>Re-common housing as a universal basic service: Since the 2008 financial crisis investor-owned housing in Europe has increased by 700 percent¹⁶. On average across Europe 18% of dwellings are overcrowded, 35% are under occupied¹⁷ and 16% are not occupied at all¹⁸. The situation is so absurd that a group of activists in Brussels have created an entirely fictional district (<a href="https://www.leegbeek.brussels/">Saint-Vide-Leegbeek</a>) to highlight the 6.5m m2 and 30,000 units of empty properties in the city alone. Housing cannot legitimately remain subject to price speculation and wealth protection in a fair and sustainable future. How could the narrative of housing as an asset (together with the financial practices around it) be reframed, to spark a wide-scale public debate about what housing means in a resource constrained future?</p><p>Ignite imaginative thinking: What if an alternative resource-light architecture is predominantly constrained by a failure of our collective imagination rather than by a lack of viable alternatives? After Covid restrictions were lifted in Europe, many people expressed their wish not to return to their old patterns of living and working. This is obviously a dramatic example but does highlight the power of people viscerally experiencing alternative ways of living, in terms of shifting value perceptions. This is an idea being playful explored by the <a href="https://new-european-bauhaus.europa.eu/index_en">New European Bauhaus</a> which invites Europe’s citizens to co-create a ‘sustainable and inclusive future that is beautiful for our eyes, minds, and&nbsp;souls’.</p><p>Build the politics of transition: Many of the required strategies and capabilities will not be politically acceptable at present but everyday politics will be a powerful driver in meeting the future halfway. How for example would our responses differ if citizens felt empowered to shape and design their own futures? Would residents of a district or city accept skyrocketing levels of inequality and homelessness if they felt there were realistic alternatives? How would working conditions change if organisations agreed to operate under a revocable social licence, that was periodically audited by a random selection of local stakeholders?</p><p>Move on from impossible: If the transitions we were expecting are moving further out of reach then we must stop chasing the impossible and think about responding to the difficult. Taking retrofit as an example, if the materials and energy will not be available to insulate the entirety of Europe’s housing stock, then perhaps we can also create houses within houses using tent-like removable heat capture. Similarly, if we cannot mine the minerals of choice to power our heat pumps, then we will need to start investing in alternative battery technologies powered by plentiful elements such as sodium and fluoride.</p><p>Strategies Xn&nbsp;: Whilst we are happy to share our thinking, we feel strongly that our work will only be robust and meaningful if we begin building on it in community with Laudes and the wider network of built environment practitioners. This is an evolving area and we are committed to holding time and space within it to hear and support your&nbsp;ideas.</p>Co-Hab Athens [<a href="https://cooperativecity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ozanam-1.jpg">Cooperative City Magazine</a>] Closing thoughts <p>In a collaborative workshop between DML and Laudes in December 2022, we discussed the 4-filter constraint framework described above. One concern that was raised was that inequality seemed to be a fundamental omission. If we are applying the filter of labour then thinking through the inequality implications of any goal or strategy would also seem important. Spiralling inequality is undisputedly a destructive and undesirable dynamic in our current socio-economic system. It should and absolutely must be addressed. However, we see this as a structural constraint of the wider economic system in which the built environment is nested, rather than as a specific barrier to inclusive decarbonisation strategies. We will explore and unpack this distinction in our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Finally, this initiative will be hollow without input from the people working towards these common goals. Our wish is to amplify your voices, to learn from you and critically to take your feedback on board to improve our own work.

				<p>Trinsic has written extensively on IDtech products and their importance to the future of identity. In this post, we include a brief explanation, but if you would like to dive further, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-idtech-and-why-does-it-matter/">check out our blog posts</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about IDtech products, we’re talking about applications that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need. These products aren’t necessarily decentralized, though we believe decentralized identity solutions will eventually win because they are better for users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve purposefully not included infrastructure platforms (you’ll note that Trinsic is not on the map), open source libraries, or blockchains on this list. While these things enable the creation of IDtech companies and their products, they are not categorized as IDtech in and of themselves. The reason being is that IDtech refers specifically to products and applications that help consumers manage their identity and data.</p>

				<p>IDtech products are opening a new world of digital experiences for both people and businesses. We believe IDtech is on the verge of breakthrough growth that will be compared to the Fintech boom that brought the means for businesses, both large and small, to provide financial services directly to customers like never before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, Trinsic is an IDtech infrastructure company. IDtech companies build on top of Trinsic, so they can spend the majority of their time focused on bringing their product to market instead of building complex, underlying infrastructure. We have chosen to build our infrastructure with decentralized technologies, because as we mentioned above, we feel that decentralized identity (often called SSI) provides the most optimal experience for end users to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number one factor that will influence the adoption of decentralized identity is amazing IDtech products that users love. IDtech products that solve real problems for users. We are excited to see the continued success of the IDtech products listed in the market map and look forward to the development of many more!</p>

 AyanWorks won “FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 - India: Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication” <p>We at AyanWorks, have always been moved by challenging ourselves with the complex problems in the Blockchain space, be it exploring &amp; evaluating new stacks, contributing to complex open source projects, taking challenges head on to build solutions for, participating in the hackathons to build solutions with cutting edge technologies. Continuing with this DNA, AyanWorks team participated in the ‘FIDO Developer Challenge 2022 — India’ hackathon event. Theme for this challenge was ‘Go Passwordless with FIDO Authentication’. More details can be <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-developer-challenge-2022-india/">found&nbsp;here</a>.</p><blockquote>We are thrilled to announce that AyanWorks has made it to the top 3 finalists in the challenge. We are honoured to be recognised for our innovative work in the field of digital identity and verifiable credential management (see <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-awards-winner-and-top-finalists-of-developer-challenge-india/">official announcement</a> from FIDO Alliance).</blockquote><p>Demo Day</p><p>The final demo and awards event was held at the Samsung Research Institute in Noida and it provided us with a fantastic opportunity to meet and network with various individuals and developers in the field. It was an great platform for us to showcase our SSI (<a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>) mobile wallet app, powered by <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkeys</a>, which stores user’s credentials securely using advanced cryptography, thus preserving the privacy of the individual and the data in her wallet. As they call — ‘Privacy-by-Design’ and ‘Privacy-by-Default’.</p><p>Our team worked tirelessly to develop the solution that is not only secure but also user-friendly and easy to use, making it accessible to everyone. We believe that <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital decentralised identity</a> and cryptographically signed &amp; digitally verifiable credential management is an important step towards a more secure and reliable internet ecosystem. Our SSI mobile wallet app, implements the authentication method using FIDO Passkeys, provides a solution to some of the most significant challenges faced in the space today, such as security vulnerabilities and data breaches.</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, our primary focus has always been on creating innovative solutions that serve the best interests of our clients and users. That’s why we’re proud to say that our SSI mobile wallet app is designed with greater preference to the highest security and user privacy standards, while providing an unparalleled user experience.</p><p>Our recognition as a finalist in the FIDO developer challenge is a true testament to the dedication of our team. We’re thrilled to have had the opportunity to showcase our work on this platform, and we’re grateful to the FIDO Alliance &amp; FIDO India Working Group team for providing us with this opportunity. We’re excited to continue driving positive change in the digital identity space and helping our clients and users navigate the complex digital landscape with confidence.</p><p>Why Passwordless?</p><p>Cybercrime damages the world economy $2.9 million every minute, with 80% of cyberattacks targeting passwords. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) has warned that online users in the country are being targeted by phishing scams, which involve an attacker fooling a victim into clicking malicious links in order to steal sensitive data like passwords, login information, and One Time Passwords (OTP). In India, the National Crime Record Bureau reported 4,047 cases of online banking fraud in 2020, with 1,093 of those cases involving OTPs. The recent global epidemic has increased enterprises’ readiness to adopt password-less FIDO Authentication, making it easier to solve than ever before thanks to the rising number of devices supporting FIDO and the availability of a public WebAuthn&nbsp;API.</p><p>To summarise</p><p>At <a href="https://ayanworks.com">AyanWorks</a>, we remain committed to delivering innovative <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">digital identity solutions</a> that meet the needs of our users, while prioritising security and privacy. Our recent recognition as a top finalist in the FIDO developer challenge validates the quality of our solutions and motivates us to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation further. We believe that building strong relationships with our fellow developers and industry leaders will enable us to drive positive change in the digital identity space. If you’re interested in learning more about our solutions or partnering with us, please visit our website or reach out to our team. We will be happy to share the details and also arrange for you a quick demo of our solution.</p><p>You can contact us <a href="http://www.ayanworks.com/contact-us/">here</a>.

<p>In the information age, trust, privacy, security, compliance, and user experience are paramount. While last-gen identity solutions based on passwords, emails, devices, and wallet addresses are still prevalent, people are paying for this convenience with one of their most valuable assets — personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>The emerging Web3 makes the problem of data security and fraud more immediate, but it also provides solutions.</p><p>Decentralized identity systems promise to empower users to verify themselves and conduct online transactions without disclosing their personal information. However, many existing platforms can’t offer a holistic solution that addresses critical aspects like digital identity, interoperability, user data security, compliance, and payments — that’s where Nuggets makes the biggest difference.</p><p><a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a> is the only product that enables organizations to comply with regulations whilst maintaining their privacy, guaranteeing data security, and remaining fully decentralized. As a super-wallet, Nuggets also enables multi-rail payments and provides a convenient cache for crypto assets — all tied to a verified decentralized identity.</p><p>Best of all, Nuggets is available globally right&nbsp;now.</p> More power to&nbsp;you <p>Requiring just one-time onboarding during sign-up, Nuggets focuses on providing a user-friendly, secure, and interoperable experience across Web2 and Web3. The solution provides a merit-based reputation and prioritizes protecting users’ data — enabling them to navigate the digital world with confidence and&nbsp;ease.</p><p>By leveraging a combination of Self Sovereign Identity (SSI), auditable nuggets of data, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), peerDIDs, and verifiable credentials, Nuggets has created a state-of-the-art solution that puts privacy and security at the heart of its&nbsp;design.</p><p>Users’ identification is linked to W3C verifiable credentials and ZKP proofs, allowing them to confirm their status without revealing any private information.</p><p>Nuggets is also a fully customizable, ready-to-deploy solution that supports real-world use cases. As such, brands can seamlessly integrate Nuggets into existing infrastructures, compliance processes, payments, and customer experience immediately or offer Nuggets as a standalone identity solution.</p><p>One of the most critical challenges facing Web3 is complying with regulations without requiring users to hand over a litany of personally identifying information to a centralized third party. Until now, there has been no decentralized way for Web3 protocols to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>Solving this issue, Nuggets features built-in tools to ensure compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and The Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, without compromising decentralization, privacy, or autonomy. Whether you’re an individual, DeFi protocol, exchange, or DAO Nuggets creates a frictionless, secure experience and reduces the risk of cybercrimes while simultaneously ensuring users’ privacy and security and increasing operational efficiency. Nuggets’ self-sovereign identity solution also serves as a critical entry point for DeFi, as it allows users and service providers to operate in a verified, compliant environment.</p> Cultivating a Vibrant Web3 Ecosystem <p>Nuggets’ vision goes beyond creating a cutting-edge identity solution — it is committed to nurturing collaboration and adoption within the Web3 ecosystem.

 CircuLaw — using existing laws and regulations to accelerate the transition to a circular&nbsp;economy <p>CircuLaw is an open public service that is aiming to accelerate the circular economy transition by enabling policymakers to make more and better use of existing laws and regulations.</p><p><a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> is a digital platform that presents opportunities within the existing legal and regulatory framework in the Netherlands in an accessible, digestible and ultimately implementable way. Over the past two and a half years, we (Dark Matter Labs) have been working alongside the City of Amsterdam, and various knowledge and funding partners to conduct research, design, develop and launch alpha and beta versions of <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a>. The platform currently enables policymakers to explore opportunities around 3 themes: sustainable timber construction, wind turbines and mattress production chains. More themes will&nbsp;follow.</p>CircuLaw.nl — English&nbsp;page Introductions, and some&nbsp;context <p>CircuLaw builds upon Dm’s work supporting regulatory innovation in <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Legitimacities-Toward-a-network-of-city-based-regulatory-experimentati">Montreal (Canada</a>), Madrid (Spain) and <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/Civic-City-Exploring-future-regulatory-infrastructure-and-digital">Copenhagen (Denmark</a>). In 2019, we engaged with the City of Amsterdam as part of EIT Climate-KIC’s Deep Demonstrations programme. In Amsterdam, we have an innovative and forward-thinking partner, the city has <a href="https://time.com/5930093/amsterdam-doughnut-economics/">embraced the doughnut economic model</a> and has a relatively large and growing number of staff devoted to innovation and accelerating its <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/policy/sustainability/circular-economy/">circular economy transition.</a></p><p>The Netherlands is aiming for a fully circular economy by 2050. Setting targets is a vital first step, but meeting such targets requires immediate and drastic changes in the way that we produce, build, manufacture and consume. According to the <a href="https://www.circularity-gap.world/2022">Circularity Gap Report (2022)</a> increased material extraction means our economies are becoming even less circular — shockingly, global circularity has shrunk from 9.1% in 2018 to just 7.2% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Research from the <a href="https://www.pbl.nl/publicaties/integrale-circulaire-economie-rapportage-2023">Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency</a> states that the drastic changes we now need cannot rely only on policy aiming to support and facilitate circularity initiatives of parties that are mainly experimenting, but also if we are serious about reaching circularity goals, then we cannot exclusively focus on making changes in laws and regulations; the public sector must use current regulatory powers much more effectively to compel rapid change across wider&nbsp;society.</p><p>Making and implementing new regulations is time-consuming, so back in late 2019 and early 2020, Amsterdam was already pondering how it could make better use of existing ‘hard’ instruments — the components of its current legal, regulatory or taxation systems — to begin accelerating change. Even among municipalities leading the battle against climate breakdown, these existing hard instruments remain largely underutilised. According to <a href="https://www.royalhaskoningdhv.nl/nl-nl/challenges/duurzaamheid/circulaire-economie#downloadrapports">Royal HaskoningDHV’s 2022 research</a> such directive use of regulations accounts for only 1% of activity.</p>Circular Activities of local and regional authorities (Royal Haskoning, 2022)<p>Having spent almost two and a half years working around policymakers in Amsterdam and the wider Netherlands, we recognise how incoherent the legal and regulatory system can seem. Firstly and fundamentally, pivoting towards a circular future requires the use of a regulatory system that was never developed to drive the transition to a circular economy. For policymakers with circular economy goals, navigating this regulatory system forms a formidable obstacle.</p><p>Accessing and evaluating the relevant information and policy options takes a lot of time and requires expensive legal expertise, so when a return on that investment is uncertain, policymakers are often deterred from exploring possibilities. In instances where legal support is sought, it also tends to be highly specialised, because the different parts of the regulatory system are so fragmented. Even in the rare instances where a legal or regulatory instrument is successfully used to bring about policy change in a municipality or province, information about the outcome tends to remain localised and knowledge is rarely passed on. As a consequence, policymakers across the Netherlands still opt to pursue change via more voluntary agreements (covenants) and innovation subsidies, irrespective of their chances of making the necessary impact. Assertive use of legal and regulatory opportunities remains ‘too damn difficult’, even though we won’t get much further without&nbsp;it.</p> CircuLaw’s solutions <p>In response to this, CircuLaw attempts to piece the fragments together; to make the Dutch regulatory system more easily accessible to its policymakers by quickly directing them towards relevant instruments and information.</p><p>Behind the scenes, we’re analysing existing laws and regulations, extracting relevant instruments and then translating the findings into understandable, readable, shareable, applicable insights; policymakers in all levels of government can use these as starting points for shaping actionable policies.</p><p>By combining this analysis with a breakdown of innovations that did (and didn’t) work, CircuLaw aims to provide an overview of the current systems and practices. To do the legal analysis we created the following replicable methodology:</p> CircuLaw’s methodology for law&nbsp;analysis Methodology for law&nbsp;analysis<p>1. Choosing theme<br>We’re choosing themes or product groups (e.g. wind turbines) based on impact, influence, momentum and existing opportunities.</p><p>2. Researching theme<br>Defining how the chain of the product is put together, understanding who plays a role in this, which circular processes are already in place, etc. This analysis helps us to see which (technical and policy) solutions are already available for some problems and which ones still need to be developed, leading to a set of operational goals.</p><p>3. Demarcating laws<br>Identifying laws and regulations that can help us achieve the operational goals.</p><p>4. Analysing laws<br>We’ve developed an analysis key to thoroughly examine laws and regulations at local, provincial, national and soon also EU level to identify relevant instruments and opportunities.</p><p>5. Ranking opportunities<br>Based on the influence of an instrument in practice and its legal feasibility we rank the instruments.</p><p>6. Translating legal language<br>To be readable and understandable by policymakers without a legal background we present our content without using&nbsp;jargon.</p><p>7. Creating overviews<br>Our overviews allow policymakers to explore findings according to authority level, the way the instruments interrelate or as a filterable list.</p>Different instrument overviews based on authority level, how instruments interrelate and as a filterable list. For the interactive overviews see <a href="http://www.circulaw.nl">circulaw.nl</a> Some things we have learned so&nbsp;far <p>The shift towards a systemic policy focus on the circular transition is only really getting started, though there’s increasing appetite for the work and it’s taking place with a growing sense of urgency across all layers of government in the Netherlands. But when it comes to learning and measuring impacts, there’s still vast terrain left to explore. CircuLaw is among several initiatives working across the Netherlands to accelerate change. It’s still early days, but we’ve been given the space to co-create a flexible, iterative tool to best serve the particular requirements of its end users. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned over the past two and a half&nbsp;years.</p><p>1. We need to be sensitive towards existing policymaking and implementation processes</p><p>When we began working with policymakers in different parts of the municipal organisation, we were aiming to closely witness — and perhaps map — their policymaking processes. Almost immediately, we started to realise the sheer diversity of policymaking and implementation processes. Each policy domain relevant to the circular transition (and there are more than one might imagine) has its own practices and logic; and all policymakers bring their own knowledge, experiences, networks and approaches. Every potential instrument has its own implementation journey requiring expertises scattered across several departments and teams, and this work all takes place within differently structured municipal organisations with their own hierarchies, internal politics and working cultures.</p><p>As a result, policy making is both relational and non-linear, so working out how to help at a generalised level presents a challenge. Top down, one-size-fits-all approaches are doomed to&nbsp;fail.</p>A simplified illustration of the context of a policy maker timber construction — drawing by Yvonne de Meij van Streefkerk (Team CircuLaw)<p>2. We’re focusing on the policymaking frontrunners</p><p>Amsterdam has a team devoted to its circular economy transition, positioning the city at the vanguard amongst global capitals. As our work has expanded across the Netherlands, we’ve opted at this stage to cater to those municipal practitioners prepared to experiment and take greater risks in their policy-making decisions. Some of the approaches and discoveries might not be immediately applicable in a municipality with 0.5 FTE working towards a circular economy, but we’re aiming to establish precedents amongst frontrunners that then show a growing body of evidence to inspire and enable colleagues in organisations with less in-house capacity. By demonstrating and documenting a wide range of cases at the edge of current practice, we hope to create a real shift in what is considered possible within the current rules and regulations in cities across — and beyond — the Netherlands. And we hope it will contribute to a better shared understanding of where actual changes in the law are needed to further accelerate change.</p><p>3. We need to support both replication and innovation</p><p>There’s still plenty of potential for change using the existing regulatory system. Identifying and mapping relevant legal and regulatory instruments around different themes and product groups will begin to increase navigability and coherence, but then successfully utilising those instruments to change outcomes is a different matter. When an existing legal instrument has been implemented, <a href="https://www.circulaw.nl/">CircuLaw.nl</a> can provide a step-by-step walkthrough of how change has been achieved, with examples and shared lessons. This approach could stimulate replication and greater uniformity across the Netherlands — critical for shaping e.g. the investments of suppliers of goods and services to the government.</p><p>While there is definite value in documenting previous successes, we also need to establish ways to support policymakers who are looking to do unprecedented things; to give them the tools and confidence to innovate using (existing) legal instruments that might have been previously overlooked or underutilised.</p><p>4. We’ll need help to monitor and measure impact in a complex, adaptive&nbsp;system</p><p>There are so many factors involved in any policy making process that claiming impact or attributing causality can be difficult. At some level we need metrics to establish whether we’re doing the right things, but, however effective, regulatory instruments are only ever a part of the policymaking picture.</p><p>Some impacts of CircuLaw might be relatively straightforward, others might take ten years to take full effect. It’s never going to be as simple as measuring the increase in % of instruments used, because a single instrument might account for repeated change. So we’re exploring the best way of working with the City of Amsterdam’s Monitoring team to look at material flows, such as concrete or food, to establish what would be most useful to&nbsp;measure.</p><p>CircuLaw is also about increasing shared awareness about possibilities in law and regulation. We’ve already seen an example of a circular economy team hiring a legal policy expert, recognising it’s important to have this knowledge within their team, or hearing people say, “OK, we’ve seen what you are doing, we are going to see how we can work more like that”. This shows the kind of early impact that can lead to later successes, and any measurements of impact will have to be a mixture of qualitative and quantitative findings.</p><p>5. The value of working in an ecosystem</p><p>In co-creating CircuLaw, we’re working in an expanding ecosystem. We’re not just developing ideas internally and then encouraging their adoption within a municipality. Instead we’re forming a team between organisations. The collaboration started between Dm and the city of Amsterdam, but has now expanded to include a variety of public institutions, legal experts and funding partners from across the Netherlands. Together, we’re developing a platform and testing ideas with and for experienced policymakers.</p><p>As a small organisation Dark Matter Labs is able to move with greater agility than a large municipality, but developing CircuLaw requires a range of expertise and experiences. Dm brings strategic designers, system thinkers, developers, visual designers and user experience designers, and CircuLaw requires us to orchestrate an ecosystem of people with deeper policymaking expertise, greater experience of governmental operations, legal expertise and context-related circular economy knowledge.</p><p>We’re still thinking uncompromisingly about what needs to happen, and how it might be possible, but alongside policymakers who’ll work with it every day because if CircuLaw is to have any impact then it needs to be&nbsp;used.</p><p>6. Public tech has to be created with and for&nbsp;humans</p><p>While we began this blog by stating that more assertive approaches are required — top-down, government-led public tech projects cannot expect to be fully embraced. Successful public tech needs to recognise human experience in all of its messiness. While this might occasionally require non-linear co-creation processes, it will ultimately result in products that better reflect the end users’ reality. By entering a process of consistent user testing and iteration, we’ve not only developed a clearer understanding of how policymakers approach their work, but also the transition their work is having to&nbsp;undergo.</p> Next Steps <p>So far, we’ve co-created a small, manageable platform, but to demonstrate viability beyond the Netherlands, CircuLaw will need to cover many more themes, incorporate wider legislation (e.g. EU), and develop a more sophisticated taxonomy of relevant legal instruments. Our ambition is to pass the hosting and running of CircuLaw to a national organisation by the end of 2024, but before that’s possible, there’s still lots of work to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>1. A continuous dialogue with Dutch policymakers</p><p>In order to make CircuLaw part of the Netherlands’ wider circular economy policy landscape we’re collaborating with a community of practice to better understand how policymakers go about their work, to help more fully recognise the practical barriers that policymakers tend to run into when attempting to use instruments, and to create an avenue for feedback. From this we’re looking to establish whether policymakers want extra information, whether they want courses, or workshops or templates to give them increased confidence when navigating the legal and regulatory system.</p><p>2. More themes in more&nbsp;places</p><p>Amsterdam provided a very suitable environment to initiate the CircuLaw platform, but to stand any chance of accelerating the wider circular economy, CircuLaw needs to exist beyond the confines of a single municipality or country. A lot of the regulation currently on the platform also applies to the wider Netherlands but the next step is to begin incorporating EU Law. We’ve already authored <a href="https://openresearch.amsterdam/nl/page/90992/europese-wet--en-regelgeving-circulaire-economie">three white papers</a> on this subject. We’re currently exploring food, solar panels and other product groups as additional themes.</p><p>3. Maintaining the CircuLaw&nbsp;platform</p><p>While we’re still testing and continuously improving the platform, we can be highly responsive in adapting the design and implementing required changes. Once more fully embedded, CircuLaw will require regular maintenance in order to expand thematically, ensure that information is kept up to date, and allow users to submit feedback and access support when required. In order to remain open and accessible to public sector users and other circular economy actors, we imagine the type of organisation that would host CircuLaw for the long term needs to maintain a non-commercial model, and without a&nbsp;paywall.</p><p>4. Improving the methodology and its execution</p><p>The current execution of the legal analysis methodology requires time and capacity; it’s human endeavour. No doubt much of this will always remain the case; but for the CircuLaw approach to be replicable, scalable and easy to update we’re looking to see what parts of this methodology could be done in more efficient ways; we are hoping to explore possibilities in AI and Natural Language Processing to improve and accelerate legal analysis and translation capabilities, alongside the more creative research&nbsp;work.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you’d like to know more, or have suggestions, questions or thoughts then get in touch with <a href="mailto:Romy@darkmatterlabs.org">Romy@darkmatterlabs.org</a> — as this project is part of a collective endeavour to accelerate the transition to a more circular economy (and to transitioning to a just, regenerative economy more in general), we are keen to hear any feedback that can help us and others learn to achieve these goals together.</p><p>The current platform is mostly in Dutch, but we’re working on translating it into English.

     <p>For consumers, organizations and companies alike, the topic of digital security has become increasingly paramount in recent years, especially with the rise of digital fraud and scams. With this in mind, Allan Foster’s upcoming session, “Does Trust Matter?” at the <a>IdentityNorth 2023 Spring Symposium</a> is generating significant interest.</p>
<p>As a retired identity and digital security professional with a career spanning 40 years leading and guiding teams at Apple, Netscape, AOL, Guru Associates, Microsoft, Intel and Sun Microsystems, Foster has an extensive background in the field. He most recently served as the Vice President of Global Partner Success at ForgeRock, a leading provider of digital identity solutions. His wealth of knowledge and experience make him well-equipped to discuss the key trends and tactics impacting the digital environment on a global scale.</p>
<p>One of the main issues Foster will address at the <a>virtual two-day event</a> is the importance of securing digital identities. As more people conduct business and social activities online, it is becoming more crucial to protect against scams and social engineering. This is especially true in Canada, where digital fraud is on the rise. Foster will provide insights into the tactics and technologies that can be used to protect consumers and organizations in this critical time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Foster will also delve into the darker side of identity. As he has noted in the past, “One of the problems of identity is that it has a very dark side in as much as it enables authoritarianism.” This statement underscores the importance of understanding the complexities of digital identity and the need for responsible practices.</p>
<p>Foster’s session is <a>just one of the many compelling presentations</a> being offered at the symposium and the event as a whole promises to be an engaging and informative learning and networking opportunity for digital security professionals &amp; experts and anyone interested in digital security and identity.</p>
<p>Attendees can expect to gain valuable insights into the current state of digital security, as well as practical strategies for protecting their businesses, and personal digital properties and platforms against fraud and scams. In addition to Allan Foster’s session, there is a full stream during the Spring Symposium dedicated to Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure/Cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Sharing about the March online developer training and student experiences.</p> What <p>This March the Holochain Foundation, collaborating with our education partner Mythosthesia, hosted a four day, online developer training. This training focused on giving developers the skills needed to develop Holochain applications in a clean, simple, and robust manner; and it taught them to reason about distributed systems from an agent-centric perspective.</p><p>The weekend following the training we held a two day build event where the newly minted Holochain devs could test their skills and demo their projects.</p> Who <p>Holochain partnered with Mythosthesia, the new venture by Marcus Philips who co-founded <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Hack Reactor</a> and experienced dev educator Muhammad Meigooni, in order to provide world-class instruction to our community. Marcus and Muhammad are really passionate about Holochain and it has been a pleasure working with them to develop this course. </p><p>Attending the event was an experienced cohort of 18 developers, which ranged from folks who had been developing on Holochain for years to those totally new to the community. Preparing for this training we conducted extensive tech checks (including a solid grasp of the Rust programming language) and culture interviews to ensure that everyone taking the course would be able to get the most from it and that they could grow into valuable community members.</p> What Was Built <p>Our build weekend was short. With only a day and a half of build time before the demo, none of the projects demonstrated had reached an MVP status. However, this is only partially due to the limited time. The developers also chose large and potentially impactful projects that were never meant to be completed in a weekend, ones they all seem dedicated to continuing work on. Their thinking and progress on these projects is inspiring. </p><p>While we could gush about how incredible this cohort of developers is, we would prefer to simply show you. The following are some highlights from the demo.</p> Short Demo Descriptions <p>Harlan Wood has been working on the <a href="https://github.com/trustgraph?ref=blog.holochain.org">TrustGraph</a> technology for Holochain over the last year, but at the build days he got it working with a live application. TrustGraph is a reputation system built for platform interoperability that leans into peer-to-peer networks through its transitive trust algorithm which can be used for things like feed filtering. <br><br>Watch this quick video to learn more about how TrustGraph might be used:</p><p>John Hopkins started mapping out a DID implementation for Holochain. We won’t speak about this too much right now because identity is such a huge topic and we have separate updates about that coming, but it was encouraging to see a dev, new to the framework, who was thinking about a lot of the same things we have been.</p><p>Matt Gabrenya started creating a registry of composable app elements that developers could use to create unique arrangements, easily pulling these elements together. This reminded us of the composable applets of We but for the development layer rather than the user layer.</p><p>Without there being a direct connection between the two projects, we can already imagine how this might interface with <a href="https://www.generativeobjects.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Generative Objects</a> (GO) founder Walter Almeida’s work. He came to this training with the express intent of integrating Holochain into GO’s Meta Modeler so that it is possible to generate custom Holochain applications in a low code environment. Customizable Holochain applications that anyone can build and publish without needing years of developer experience? Yes please. We’ll definitely keep you up to date as these projects progress.<br><br>There was also a crop of projects focused on financial applications.<br><br>Joshua Vial and Nicholas Stebbings designed the fundamentals of an app that would make it easy to bootstrap an authority list, based on social trust structures, that would serve to authenticate cross chain and cross DHT transactions, ensuring that ledgers on both sides of an exchange were updated appropriately. Meanwhile Julien Lucca, Ross Eyre, Ché Coelho, and Leo Proechel worked on a credit clearing algorithm that uses agent-centric methods to find debt cycles in B2B contexts and cancel them out. Even the course instructor Marcus Philips spent time refining the design for a protocol he started for a Transitive Favor Network. This would be a radically peer-to-peer currency protocol where each individual would only need agreed-on systems of value exchange with their direct neighbors, but which would allow strangers to still exchange with each other by finding connections through the social graph. </p><p>Watch this video of Julian, Ross, Che, and Leo describing their Credit Clearing Algorithm:</p> Course Reviews <p>How did the course turn out? Rather then trying to explain a group’s shared experience, we’ll just quote a few of the responses from the students’ course feedback forms:</p><blockquote>“I thought this was a really excellent way to gain an introduction to Holochain, and it definitely left me with a thirst to learn more. I think the curriculum is well thought out and gives the perfect HDK 101.” —John Hopkins</blockquote><blockquote>“A very cohesive bunch of minds gathered with a yearning for more knowledge and discovery — which makes for a refreshing classroom experience. It is clear that the choice of cohort and instructors was very well considered and this has led to a wealth of knowledge in the room, and excellent coordination throughout.” —Nicholas Stebbings</blockquote><blockquote>“I can't think of another class or training I've been in where I enjoy the community as much as I have in this class. I have learned so much from the questions and side conversations.” —Patrick Winfield</blockquote><blockquote>“This course has been invaluable and incredibly empowering. It has also been a super-collision of incredibly competent and fascinating folk.” —Ché Coelho</blockquote><blockquote>“Super fun and useful! Definitely exceeded my expectations. The course is super grounding and down to earth — getting all the way down to DHT ops and all the way up to capability claims.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The course is great. It provides a thorough grounding in the conceptual building blocks of Holochain, along with the practical tools and experience to build working apps. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how Holochain works, what it can do, and how to make it do those things.” —Anon</blockquote><blockquote>“The Holochain developer immersive has been exceptionally stimulating. It's helped to solidify my understanding of distributed systems in general and has led to a deeper appreciation of the HC architecture and its potentially integral role in bringing digital technologies into alignment with the human-social organism. Our studio intends to become active developers and supporters of the ecosystem.” —Ross Eyre</blockquote><blockquote>“This is an excellent technical deep-dive for developers who wish to write Rust code based directly on the HDK. It is well-constructed, descriptive, paced excellently, and presented by very knowledgeable and passionate people.” —Acea Spades Black</blockquote> A Self-Paced Online Course <p>We expect to have more dev training sessions in the future, but in the meantime we are producing a self-paced, online course available to anyone who wants to learn to develop on Holochain. </p><p>This course will consist of recordings from the March dev training so that you get the same information and education that we provided to this past cohort. You’ll need to know some Rust, and there won’t be the hands-on element, but by supplementing your experience with online build events, Discord office hours, and the support of our thriving developer community, we think that this course will help you grow as a Holochain developer.<br><br><a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/QQoJ4s3D?ref=blog.holochain.org">Fill out this interest form</a> and we’ll let you know when the course is live.</p>

<p>Was GDPR v1.0 the data protection solution everyone hoped for? Let’s explore how General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) didn’t live up to our expectations. And let’s also ask the important question; will GDPR v2.0 be able to solve the issues?</p>
<p>After a near decade of pulling back and forth, the balance in the tug-of-war between monetising personal information and safeguarding it took a major step towards the latter. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and its enforcement from 2018 was a watershed moment in global technology regulation. It forced even multinational organisations to take personal information seriously or risk possible penalties reaching up to 4% of annual global turnover. Overnight, the GDPR became Brussels officials’ poster child of powerful legislation. One that could show that all organisations need to abide by the law just as much as one-person start-ups. However, in the five years since the GDPR entered into force, it has become clear that the GDPR wasn’t the solution we thought it was. Serious concerns and numerous loopholes have been discovered by privacy activists, technology experts and even national privacy watchdogs alike.</p>
 Current issues with GDPR 
<p>The core problem is that under the GDPR, all companies, including the tech giants, are overseen by the national regulator in the EU country in which they are headquartered. In practical terms, this so-called “one-stop shop rule” directs most of the major compliance investigations run through the Irish and Luxembourgian systems, because the largest technology companies, such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, have all set up their European headquarters in one of these two countries (due to favourable taxation and other legislation). This in return results in EU-wide precedents that reflect the political climate of only two countries, not 27.</p>
<p>Both Ireland and Luxembourg have faced mounting criticism in the recent years for slow, and even lax, enforcement which they officially deny. However, claims of lax enforcement does not equal no enforcement, the Irish data authority has recently imposed a &gt;$200M <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/irish-data-protection-authority-gives-eu-397-billion-present-meta">fine against Meta</a>. Meta however earns a million dollars every 15 minutes, and therefore we are back at the same problems we had before the GDPR. That ignoring the law can be very profitable, and private individuals still have little leverage to safeguard their privacy online.</p>
<p>To my mind this brings us to a very unpleasant question – is the GDPR really a tool for safeguarding EU residents’ privacy, or a tool for punishing US-based multinationals?</p>
<p>It is 2023, and year after year there is talk about EU-wide class actions and seemingly widespread support for them. Yet the actual legislation fails to materialise again and again. Retaliating against the big US-based multinationals for disregarding the European Commission is one thing. But making me, as a private individual, decipher corporate structures and hunt for the correct competent authorities is another problem.</p>
 Evolution of the GDPR 
<p>The European Union is finally taking concrete steps in fixing the dysfunctionalities of its poster child. The solution? More legislation.</p>
<p>The now 7-year-old law will get a facelift before summer 2023. The solution seeks to correct its glaring problem: the extremely lop-sided way that Irish, and to a lesser extent Luxembourgian, data protection commission and courts can steer the entire 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>The details are unfortunately scantly available. The official take is that the new legislation will “harmonize some aspects of the administrative procedure” in cross-border cases and “support a smooth functioning of the GDPR cooperation and dispute resolution mechanisms”, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13745-Further-specifying-procedural-rules-relating-to-the-enforcement-of-the-General-Data-Protection-Regulation_en">as the Commission explains</a>. Simply put, it seeks to end the jurisdiction shopping inside the 27-country bloc.</p>
<p>However, fixing failed regulation with more regulation can often end up doing the opposite. So why not take the chance to simply state that; EU Data Subjects may choose to use their home jurisdiction. While proceeding to combine the GDPR, the ePrivacy directive (aka the “EU cookie law”), and even the 3Q2023 Data Governance Act, to ensure that there are no conflicting requirements. One could possibly dare to wish for a plethora of improvements from the perspective of private EU residents, but so far, the silence is deafening.</p>
 How the improvements will help individuals/businesses 
<p>It is clear that the precedents cannot rest solely on two countries’ shoulders in a union of 27 countries. For us private individuals, the proposed changes are a step in the right direction. Any organisation that is clearly GDPR compliant will not face any issues, and ending jurisdiction ­shopping will level the playing field between local organisations and big multinationals. It will be interesting to see what, if any, effect the new legislation will have on the EU-US relations regarding privacy protections as well. But we might have to wait until the, seemingly inevitable, Schrems III case goes through the court system to find out whether the EU-US data protection tug-of-war will finally end.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one should keep hybrid (cloud + on-premises) solutions in mind when deciding where and how to process any personal data. Hybrid solutions can bring the best of the two worlds, geographically determined identity data residency with cloud-based IAM capabilities, as explained in more detail in <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/understanding-hybrid-cloud/" title="Understanding hybrid cloud">Understanding hybrid cloud</a>.</p>

			 Crisis Resilience: How Tokenization Could Empower Banks 
<p>The recent bank crisis has sparked concerns and uncertainty in the financial world. With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, and the collapses of Silvergate Bank, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank. We want to share some of our views on the role tokenization may play in the future of banking.</p>
 Bank Runs: Crisis Calls for Transparency and Trust 
<p>Countless bank runs have occurred throughout financial history, as&nbsp;no bank can survive a situation where a large number of depositors demand repayment simultaneously. Banks mostly generate income by lending deposited funds at higher interest rates; they cannot maintain enough cash reserves to cover all deposits at once.</p>
 The Twitter-era Bank Crisis Spreads Contagiously Faster Than Ever 
<p>Swift information dissemination via social media and mobile banking accelerates the potential for bank runs. In a single day, Silicon Valley Bank’s customers withdrew $42 billion, far exceeding the largest bank run in modern U.S. history, which happened at Washington Mutual in 2008 and totaled $16.7 billion but took 10 days to transpire.</p>
<p>As the banking crisis continues, people are increasingly distrustful of keeping their money in banks, as illustrated by the following chart.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dbs.com.sg/treasures/templatedata/article/generic/data/en/CIO/032023/230327CIOP.xml?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8o29LGsAwykYDlGGDppfQnYM6HnQ1ZRTOiXAwCM4rCWbn3Vtey9nrrBfAM5sg7Zo-C8_m8">According to DBS</a>, in 2023, US commercial banks experienced their largest deposit drop in four decades, surpassing even the 1981 Volcker-era decline.&nbsp;This situation calls for banks to enhance risk management and transparency to regain depositors’ trust.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Money Moves To Money Market Funds 
<p>Depositors are shifting money to money market funds&nbsp;due to concerns about banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, investing in long-term government bonds, which experienced losses when sold to meet depositor demands. Additionally,&nbsp;money market funds offer attractive yields,&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vmfxx?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">some are over 4%</a>, significantly higher than the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/bankers/national-rates/index.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">0.37% FDIC-reported rate&nbsp;</a>for bank deposits. Financial Times reported that money market funds have received over&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/032523bc-3b92-4b94-b6b8-ebbe1d606b2c?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">$286 billion in inflows during March</a>, as depicted in the chart below. It marks the largest month of inflows since the Covid-19 crisis began.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Furthermore,&nbsp;money market funds can tokenize their assets to rapidly gain market share&nbsp;and even take it a step further by allowing tokenized funds to be used as collateral. This is precisely what J.P. Morgan and BlackRock achieved l<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/jpmorgan-finds-new-use-for-blockchain-in-collateral-settlement?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--u_j_Ai-ISYIzSbY0aqbjqbc4sulXpymrm7x_nJ-nAuIFh4MmUrfv6sNU2WJDaBFcg80tM">ast May</a>, settling their first transaction using tokenized money market funds as collateral, paving the way for bridging Traditional Finance (TraFi) with Decentralized Finance (DeFi).</p>
 Tokenization: Steering Institutions Towards Crisis Resilience 
<p>The internet has revolutionized the way we exchange information, but the transfer of value has remained relatively unchanged, especially in private markets.&nbsp;Tokenization provides the solution to allow value to be exchanged efficiently and securely, empowering banks and institutions to navigate financial crises. Let’s list a few benefits:</p>
 
 Transparency: Tokenization offers an immutable and publicly accessible record of asset ownership and movement, boosting investor confidence and accountability in banks’ portfolios and balance sheets. We saw a similar trend in cryptos post-FTX with the emergence of “proof-of-reserves” by exchanges and new services from data providers such as Chainlink. 
 Real-time rebalancing: Tokenization enables the atomic settlement of securities, granting banks greater flexibility and resilience during liquidity crises by enabling rapid asset trades. 
 Dynamic Portfolio:&nbsp;Tokenization allows banks to create extensive, diversified portfolios. Private assets have been overperforming public assets for years. Tokenization is transforming private markets with a shared infrastructure that enables seamless global trading of private assets. Consequently, banks can strengthen risk resilience by investing across various regions and markets. 
 24/7 Automated Risk Management:&nbsp;Tokenized securities enable banks to deploy smart contracts for automating risk strategies and processes, providing continuous monitoring and automatic adjustments to portfolios when predefined conditions are met. 
 DeFi Bailouts:&nbsp;As blockchain-savvy investors move towards DeFi for its transparency and code-based approach, banks could potentially leverage DeFi for refinancing and assistance during crises in the future, once massive adoption is realized. 
 
<p>The recent bank crisis has exposed the weaknesses in traditional banking systems and the need for change. As the future of securities is tokenization, it would certainly play an important role in the future of banking crises; as we explore, the benefits and challenges will be more clear.</p>

<p>The proposed changes focus on actions to be taken by competent authorities in the following areas:</p>



  cooperation between authorities, other stakeholders and prudential supervisors; 



 supervisory expectations should follow a consistent approach when supervision of institutions is the subject of multiple authorities; 



 train their staff to have all necessary expertise and technical knowledge to properly conduct their tasks for the supervision of crypto-assets service providers. 
 <p>They also expand on:</p>



  sources of information available to competent authorities when supervising crypto-asset service providers (CASPs /VASPs); 



 „how competent authorities should determine the type of guidance needed within the sector and how to communicate this guidance in the most effective manner” 
 <p>Amendments in the following areas are proposed:</p>



<p>1. ‘Subject matter, scope and definitions’</p>



<p>2. Guideline 4.1 ‘Implementing the RBS model’</p>



<p>3. Guideline 4.2 ‘Step 1 – Identification of risk and mitigating factors’</p>

   by Marius Goeddert  When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, many organizations were forced to digitize at a speed exceeding their security capabilities. Remote work meant that employees accessed company networks from potentially unsafe end devices. Today, many in the e-commerce business work in a hybrid mode – partly from home, partly from the office – and are thus potential insider threats.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, many organizations were forced to digitize at a speed exceeding their security capabilities. Remote work meant that employees accessed company networks from potentially unsafe end devices. Today, many in the e-commerce business work in a hybrid mode – partly from home, partly from the office – and are thus potential insider threats.</p>
<p>According to today’s guest in our Speaker Spotlight, Rajan Barara, Director of Product Management for Identity at Entrust, Zero Trust can help mitigate the risk of insider threats. At its core, Zero Trust stipulates that trust should never be the default setting and that access requests should always be verified. This can also mean, that employees should in most instances have the least possible access privileges and be granted access just in time (JIT).</p>
<p>Together with Wolfgang Goerlich, Advisory CISO for Cisco Secure, Gerald Horst, Partner Digital Identity EMEA at PwC, and Michael Jones, Identity Standards Architect at Microsoft, Rajan will discuss the future of Zero Trust in a panel entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5335/2">Zero Trust: Where do We Want to be in Five Years?</a> at the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023.</p>

<p>Do you know who your customers are? This sounds like a trick question, but it isn’t. Although organizations are required to have Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks baked into their interactions with customers, the degree of certainty around a customer’s identity isn’t always as high as it should be. Identity theft is a pervasive problem, and it leads to many challenges for banks, lenders, insurance carriers, and other financial institutions. Reported instances of fraudsters using stolen identity information to open new bank accounts under a victim's name grew by 32% in 2022 in the U.S. according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Data-Book-2022.pdf">FTC</a> to over 110,000 cases – in each of these situations, the bank’s KYC/AML process failed. Meanwhile, in the UK, instances of credit card ID theft, where a criminal either opens a new card using a stolen identity or takes over a genuine account in good standing, were up 101% YoY midway through 2022 according to <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-10/Half%20year%20fraud%20update%202022.pdf">UK Finance</a>, with a reported gross loss of £21.4m in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These financial crimes are costly to consumers and financial institutions alike. For financial services organizations, a failure to verify their customers’ identity in situations such as these carries a reputational cost, too – so it’s important to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

Identity Providers like Okta try to help you via multiple support systems. Still, it can feel like a lot of work. Especially since you’re responsible for way more than authentication alone in the applications you work on!</p>

<p>As part of authentication, your client application makes multiple calls to an authorization server, and you get back several strings, which are tokens. Let’s demystify what’s going on behind the scenes and closely examine what those tokens are and how you use them within your client application.</p>

 Authentication and Authorization using OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) 
<p>OAuth 2.0 with OIDC is the best practice for adding authentication and authorization to your software applications. Authentication verifies the identity of who you claim to be, and authorization verifies you have access to data you want to see or actions you want to perform. It is lightweight with less effort to set up and use than Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an alternate authentication and authorization mechanism that pre-existing systems may use. For newer systems, you’ll want to use OAuth 2.0 + OIDC.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OAuth 2.0 handles authorization to resources, such as when your front-end application gets data from a backend API by making an HTTP request. OAuth 2.0 standards have the flexibility to support authorization across your entire application system through different flows and grant types. For example, different OAuth 2.0 flows support JavaScript-based front-end applications, for your APIs and back-end services to communicate, and even for IOT devices in your home automation system. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity layer on OAuth 2.0 that provides standardized identity information.</p>

 OAuth 2.0 + OIDC for JavaScript clients and SPA 
<p>SPAs and other JavaScript front-ends are public clients, which means they can’t maintain secret information for authorization, unlike a confidential client. A confidential client (such as a traditional server-rendered web app) can keep super secret information such as a Client Secret for authorization. In both application types, we should use a flow called Authorization Code and an extension to the flow called Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).</p>

<p>Let’s see how this flow works step-by-step following what happens when a cute dinosaur named Sunny prepares to sign in to the “Rawr” app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application starts the process and generates a random, long string — the code verifier. Then it creates a code challenge from the code verifier. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The client application holds on to the code verifier. It then makes an authorization code request to your authorization server, in this case, represented by Okta. The authorization code request includes the code challenge along with some critical pieces of information, such as</p>
 
   Client ID 
   Scopes, including at least the following:
     
       <code>openid</code> required for specifying the app uses OIDC in verifying the user’s identity 
       <code>profile</code> for accessing the user’s profile information, such as their name 
       <code>offline_access</code> to request a Refresh Token as part of this call 
     
   
   Redirect URI for the callback location within the client application when sign-in is complete 
   A random alphanumeric string for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) 
 

<p></p>

<p>The authorization server redirects the user, Sunny, to a web page it hosts to sign in and provide authorization consent.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Sign-in success! The authorization server returns an authorization code to the client application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that there’s an authorization code, the client application makes a request to the token endpoint of the authorization server and sends the authorization code and the code verifier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To process the token endpoint request the authorization server ensures the authorization code is still valid and that the code verifier matches the code challenge sent in the authorization request. This step is part of the PKCE extension.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Yay! Success! The authorization server returns three tokens:</p>
 
   Access token 
   ID token 
   Refresh token 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now that Sunny successfully signed in, they can continue their rawring lessons!</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now that you have these three tokens let’s better understand what each one is for.</p>

 Auth tokens in OAuth 2.0 + OIDC 
<p>These three tokens provide crucial information about your identity, access to resources, and the ability to stay authenticated securely.</p>

 ID token 
<p>The ID token is about the user, so information about Sunny in this case. This authentication token is returned from the OpenID Connect layer. It contains standardized identity information such as email, name, and issuing party, called claims. The ID token may include extra claims for information critical to Sunny’s identity, such as their dinosaur family, which is a Smileasaur of course.</p>

 Access token 
<p>The access token is a key that grants access to data or to perform an action. This authorization token is returned from the OAuth layer. The token has metadata about the token itself, such as the issuing party, information about requested scopes made in the original request, and the expiration time. Access tokens are intentionally short-lived for public clients and are a safety mechanism since it guards access to resources, and it’s dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands!</p>

 Refresh token 
<p>The Refresh token allows us to exchange it for new, shiny tokens. This optional <code>offline_access</code> scope we added in the original authorization code request allows the access token to be short-lived but does not require Sunny to authenticate to get a new token repeatedly. Refresh tokens can be longer-lived than access tokens, but for public clients, the lifetime of Refresh tokens should also be short. We want to make sure bad actors can’t get a hold of a Refresh token to gain access to an access token! For public clients like SPA, it’s a best practice also to use Refresh Token rotation, which improves security by rotating refresh tokens after each use.</p>

<p>While each step of this OAuth flow to get the tokens is critical to ensure a secure authentication and authorization process, let’s inspect the two requests in more detail.</p>

 Create an OAuth 2.0 + OIDC Compliant Authorization server 

<p>We’ll start by setting up an authorization server in Okta and use the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool to inspect the Network requests. This authorization server is OAuth 2.0 and OIDC compliant so we can use it within applications that conform to those specs.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code>. In the upcoming steps, you’ll need those values to configure Okta in your SPA client.</p>

 View the well-known endpoint for OIDC Discovery 

<p>Authorization servers have standard, public endpoints for discovery by clients. Let’s take a peek at the OIDC discovery document.</p>

<p>The OpenID Connect specification requires a standardized mechanism for client discovery. You can find it at <code>{Issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration</code>. Open up a browser tab to the OIDC discovery endpoint. It is also JSON formatted data that looks something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the discovery response, we have the endpoints for the authorization and token requests which we’ll use in the following steps. We also have a user info endpoint to query for user information and endpoints to validate the ID token. If you find the property for <code>claims_supported</code>, you’ll see the claims cover various identifying information about the user.</p>

 Debug the authorization code and token requests 

<p>We can see this OAuth flow using the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> tool. Open the site on a browser with good developer debugging capabilities. You’ll see something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Some fields are pre-populated, which is helpful. Add the other key information needed:</p>
 
   Authorize URI (required) - the authorize endpoint from the discovery doc 
   Client ID (required) - the Client ID value from Okta CLI 
   Scope (required) - <code>openid</code> is already added for us. Add <code>profile</code> and <code>offline_access</code> with spaces in between. The form field should look like <code>openid profile offline_access</code>. 
   Response type (required) - select “Use PKCE?” to unlock a few new fields, but everything is auto-populated. The debugger discovers the token endpoint automatically for us. 😎 
 

<p>Open debugging tools in your browser to watch for redirection and network requests. You’ll want to make sure you’re preserving logs between page refreshes.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the page, you’ll see how the authorization code request is formed. Press Send Request to start the flow.</p>

<p>First, you’ll authenticate using Okta if you still need to sign in by redirecting to an Okta-hosted sign-in page. Redirecting to the Identity Provider’s hosted sign-in page is the best practice for security, so it’s also a common practice you’ll see across Identity Providers. Completing sign-in redirects you back to the OIDC debugger with a success message. You’ll see the authorization code automatically exchanged for tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The token format for ID tokens is JSON Web Token (JWT). The access token from Okta is also a JWT. JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that allows systems to exchange information in JSON format securely. They are compact and safe from modifications, but our tokens contain public information. Don’t worry! They are secure, just not confidential.</p>

<p>You can copy the access token or ID token value from the response and read the contents using a <a href="https://jwt.io/">JWT debugger</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So this is cool, but what do we do with the tokens in our SPA? Let’s bring these concepts into our front-end application.</p>

 Add authentication to your SPA 

<p>First, we need an Okta OIDC application supporting our SPA’s redirect URI. We could edit the existing OIDC debugger application we created previously, or we can use a handy Okta CLI command to set everything up for us and to scaffold out a sample application in our preferred framework.</p>

<p>Use the following command in the terminal to get going quickly. There’s a separate command for each Angular, React, and Vue.</p>

<p>Angular</p>
   <code>okta start angular
</code>   

<p>React</p>
   <code>okta start react
</code>   

<p>Vue</p>
   <code>okta start vue
</code>   

<p>Follow the instructions in the terminal to start the application. You should be able to sign in and sign out. Additionally, you can watch network requests for the calls it makes.</p>

<p>We don’t have a refresh token by default. You can enable that in the Okta Admin Console. Navigate to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer site</a> and sign in to your Okta organization. In the Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and select the Okta application for the SPA you created. Edit the settings to enable Refresh Token. It automatically adds Refresh Token Rotation. Save your changes.</p>

<p>If you still need to, open the SPA code in your favorite IDE. Depending on your framework, navigate to the <code>config.js</code> or <code>app.config.ts</code> file. You’ll see the OIDC config and property for <code>scopes</code> where you will add <code>offline_access</code>. Your OIDC config looks something like this:</p>

   <code>{
    clientId: CLIENT_ID,
    issuer: ISSUER,
    redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
    scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access']
}
</code>   

<p>Now try rerunning the SPA. If you inspect the network request, you’ll see the refresh token too. You can see the tokens by looking at the contents of your local storage too.</p>

 Use auth tokens in SPAs 

<p>Now that we have these tokens in our SPA, what do we do with them? Let a trusted OIDC library, such as the Okta SDKs, handle all the token requests and refresh them for us. Behind the scenes, the OIDC library is hard at work exchanging tokens.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re primarily interested in the contents of the ID token and using the access token.</p>

 How to use the access token 
<p>The access token gives us access to resources. That means we use access tokens in outgoing API requests that our application needs, like for Sunny to get their next rawring lesson.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll send the access token as a Bearer token in the HTTP call’s Authorization header. So in the case of Sunny, the outgoing HTTP call looks like this.</p>

   <code>GET /lessons
Authorization: Bearer access_token_value
</code>   

<p>You’ll want to ensure you’re not adding the access token to calls outside your system by maintaining an allowlist of origins that should include the token.</p>

<p>A great way to manage adding the Authorization header and the logic to verify the call matches the allowlist of origins is using an interceptor. Interceptors sit between your application and outgoing (or incoming) HTTP requests. Angular includes the concept of interceptors within the framework, and if you use Axios in Vue or React apps, you can configure interceptors there.</p>

<p>You can see access tokens in action within the SPA you previously created. If you navigate to Messages in the application, it will make a call to a resource server and add the access token to the Authorization header. If you want to see the messages request succeed, you’ll need to run the resource server in Okta’s <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4">samples-nodejs-express-4 repo</a>.</p>

 How to use the ID token 
<p>Since the ID token contains user identity information, you can use it to start populating your user store and for supporting identifiers you need immediately, such as their name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the SPA you previously created, you can see all your claims if you navigate to Profile.</p>

<p>The Okta SDK automatically decodes the ID token so that we can use the claims without decoding the payload ourselves. But before we jump right into using the claims, the Okta SDK first validates the token signature, which helps ensure the token’s integrity and that it hasn’t been altered. Let’s take a quick peek under the covers at what happens during this validation process.</p>

<p>Since this token is a JWT, we can rely on standard validation for JWTs for the validity of the token itself. Next, it will validate some claims in the payload, including:</p>
 
   <code>iss</code> - the issuer, which should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, we passed this in as the “Authorize URI” 
   <code>aud</code> - the audience, which should match the client ID of your Okta application 
   <code>nonce</code> - an arbitrary one-time value that should match the original request. In the OIDC Debugger tool, it was pre-populated for us. 
   <code>exp</code> and <code>iat</code> - the expiry time and issued at times, respectively. Only non-expired tokens with an expected issue time here, please! 
 

<p>Once you have the access token, you can also make a request to the OIDC Discovery document’s User Info endpoint, which may contain more information about the user than what is available in your ID token. You may also need to add any user information and user settings from API calls within your system into your user store since the SPAs we write have complex user information.</p>

 Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over eight million records breached in the field in Q3 of 2022.

<p>Financial services are one of the most targeted industries in the world for cyberattacks, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence/">suffering nearly 20% of all attacks in 2022</a>. This is understandable considering the high-value outcomes of successful attacks and the fact that, despite supposed security improvements, attacks are still relatively successful, with over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1329989/us-number-of-records-exposed/">eight million records breached</a> in the field in Q3 of 2022.</p> 
<p>Data breaches don't just affect the institution that's compromised but also affect confidence in the sector as a whole. The <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2021/03/global-cyber-threat-to-financial-systems-maurer.htm">International Monetary Fund</a> has highlighted the significant threat that weak financial services cybersecurity poses to the industry and the world. Potential outcomes range from a loss of confidence in financial services to widespread economic instability.</p> 
<p>That's why global cybersecurity regulations have been ramped up over recent years, as they strengthen the security posture of individual firms and the industry overall. Here we'll look at the most important financial services cybersecurity regulations in 2023.</p> 
 New York — NYDFS Part 500  
<p>One of the US's most important pieces of cybersecurity legislation is the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-nydfs-multi-factor-authentication-requirement">New York Department of Financial Services cybersecurity bill</a>, technically known as 23 NYCRR Part 500. The bill affects any firm that operates under the Banking, Insurance or Financial Services laws out of New York, which will be most financial services firms in the US.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It requires firms to implement a cybersecurity policy over data governance, access controls and consumer privacy. It also obligates the introduction of more robust security methods, such as the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for protecting non-public information.</p> 
 US — Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)  
<p>The original Sarbanes-Oxley Act was instrumental in codifying the disclosures companies must make to current or potential investors, as well as the penalties that are due for breaches (with executives being directly on the line for up to $1 million and ten years in prison).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>It has since been <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5069/text">updated to include cybersecurity considerations</a>. It now obligates all publicly traded companies in the US and their wholly-owned subsidiaries to declare adherence to cybersecurity best practices in areas such as authentication and data safety. They are also required to report any data breaches publicly.</p> 
 California — California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)  
<p>Introduced to help protect the privacy rights and consumer protections of Californians, <a href="https://support.hypr.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044300832-Does-HYPR-support-the-California-Consumer-Privacy-Act-CCPA-">the CCPA </a>affects any company which does business with Californians and meets one of the following:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Has a gross revenue of over $25 million  
  Buys, sells or receives personal data on 50,000 consumers  
  Makes over half its revenue from selling consumers' personal information&nbsp;  
  
<p>The fines can be up to $2,500 for unintentional violations and $7,500 for intentional violations, which will be multiplied per record stolen in the case of a data breach.</p> 
 US — Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  
<p>The GLBA has a specific <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/how-comply-privacy-consumer-financial-information-rule-gramm-leach-bliley-act">Privacy of Consumer Financial Information Rule</a> that directly affects financial services cybersecurity. This concerns non-public personal information (NPI) that a company will collect when informing about or providing a financial product or service. Fines for non-compliance can be up to $100,000 per violation and five years in prison for complicit directors.</p> 
 EU — General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
<p>All companies processing the data of European Union citizens are affected by the GDPR. The law determines how data is used and protected and governs how consent must be used for collecting it. Along with data usage, timely reporting of breaches is also obliged if it affects EU citizens.</p> 
<p>For financial services cybersecurity, adhering to GDPR in 2023 is essential. Failure to do so can lead to fines of $20 million or 4% of global revenue, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach">Amazon receiving the biggest fine so far of $888 million</a>.</p> 
 UK — Data Protection Act  
<p>After the UK left the EU, it kept the GDPR which it passed into law as the <a href="https://uk-gdpr.org/">Data Protection Act (2018)</a>. It is roughly the same as the EU-GDPR (just amended for UK citizens) but still carries the same requirements around data safety, consent and reporting, and fines for non-compliance.</p> 
 EU — Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2)  
<p>The PSD2 was introduced to make it easier for financial services companies to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/open-banking-psd2-and-achieving-strong-customer-authentication">integrate and securely share data</a> while making payment systems safer. In addition, the law set specific technical standards for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-security-guide/strong-customer-authentication-psd2">strong customer authentication</a> and improving security measures.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The measures affect all companies catering to consumers in the EU and any payments that start, travel through or end in the EU. This puts clear obligations on financial services cybersecurity, even for firms outside the EU.</p> 
 Global — Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)  
<p>The PCI-DSS covers the processors of payments from major credit and debit card companies. To achieve compliance, financial services cybersecurity programs must meet several obligations, such as protecting cardholder data, encrypting data in storage and transmission, and authenticating access to all system components. Breaches of the PCI-DSS may result in fines and restrictions in using major credit cards.</p> 
 Singapore — Monetary Authority of Singapore Notices on Cyber Hygiene  
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) regulates financial institutions in the banking, capital markets, insurance and payments sectors. The <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/cyber-security">MAS has issued </a>a collection of notices on cyber hygiene, which are a set of legally binding requirements that financial institutions must take to mitigate the growing risk of cyberthreats. The cyber hygiene notices cover six key areas, which include securing administrative account access, regular vulnerability patching and mitigation controls for systems that cannot be patched, written and regularly tested security standards, perimeter defense systems, malware protection and multi-factor authentication for any system used to access critical information.</p> 
 Canada - Bill C-11  
<p>Expected to be passed into law in Canada in early 2023, <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2022/op-c11_addario/">Part 1 of Bill C-11</a> will introduce the Consumer Privacy Protection Act (CPPA) into law. The regulations are heavily based on the NYDFS Part 500 and give recommendations on securing systems and data, as well as obligations on the collection, usage and storage of data.</p> 
 US — FFIEC Standards  
<p>The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) is an interagency body that sets standards for all federally supervised financial institutions, including their subsidiaries. The FFIEC cybersecurity best practices includes guidance on effective <a href="https://www.ffiec.gov/press/pdf/Authentication-and-Access-to-Financial-Institution-Services-and-Systems.pdf">authentication and access risk management practices</a>. The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/ffiec-endorses-passwordless-mfa">FFIEC authentication standards</a> emphasize multi-factor authentication (MFA) as a critical security control against financial loss and data compromise, similar to the PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication mandate. It includes references to NIST standards SP 1800-17 and SP 800-63B, which provide implementation guidelines for passwordless MFA based on FIDO specifications.</p> 
 US — FTC Safeguards Rule  
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/ftc-safeguards-rule-what-your-business-needs-know">FTC Safeguards Rule</a> requires non-banking financial institutions, such as mortgage brokers, auto dealers, and payday lenders, to implement a comprehensive security program to keep their customers’ information safe. The FTC Safeguards Rule was recently updated, with the compliance deadline set for June 9, 2023. Among the new provisions is a mandate for multi-factor authentication for anyone accessing customer information. It should be noted that this includes <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktop and server access</a>, not just applications.</p> 
 Protect Data and Systems with Strong Authentication  
<p>The financial services sector is at high risk of cyberattacks due to the value of successful data breaches or <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a>. To combat this, state, national and supranational governments and industry groups have introduced several financial services cybersecurity regulations to ensure best practice is deployed throughout the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common thread throughout much of the financial services cybersecurity regulations worldwide is the protection of data and stronger authentication systems. HYPR's True Passwordless MFA solution uses FIDO2, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-fido2-authentication">the "gold standard" of phishing-resistant MFA</a>, to help companies secure their systems and achieve regulatory compliance.

<p>Establishing a new legislative structure for the digitalisation of commercial trade documents and enabling digital identity for corporates are the most discussed trade transformation topics of 2022.</p>
<p>In an episode published on the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/electronic-trade-documents-bill/" title="Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast">Ubisecure Let’s Talk About Digital Identity podcast</a>, the relationship between digital identity and the trade business, as well as the legal reforms regarding data driven trade, are discussed very articulately. Chris Southworth, Secretary General of ICC United Kingdom, and Oswald Kuyler, former director of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, both leading names in this industry, clearly convey the work done in the direction of digitalisation of trade and the roadmap for removing barriers.</p>
<p>Significant and major legal reform steps have been taken, continuously and decisively, in the UK, Germany, France, China and further G7 countries for the digitalisation of international trade.</p>
<p>What needs to be understood about digitalisation is not just the conversion of paper trade documents into a digital format like PDF, but also the gathering of data from papers with AI technology.</p>
<p>The legal reforms such as the UK’s Electronic Trade Documents Bill&nbsp;allows for certain trade documents to be digital, such as bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes, warehouse receipts, and insurance documents. These currently must be on paper and physically possessed. Under the Bill, digital trade documents – in other words, trade data – will be on the same legal footing as their paper-based equivalents.</p>
 Why do we need this legal reform? 
<p><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2022-11-07/debates/EFDEB437-4656-42AA-B3FF-0531B0DFA9BB/ElectronicTradeDocumentsBill(HL">The problem is pretty simple</a>: to have possession of goods—if they are under a bill of lading, for example—you must be able to possess that document. It is much more than a contract of terms, but it is a possessive document. Possess the paper and you possess the goods. How is it possible to take this ownership into a digital and intangible, and yet in so many ways so contested, world?</p>
<p>With the standardisation of the trade data used by the main stakeholders of international trade, who are logistic providers, banks and insurance sectors, we will experience a kind of digital revolution similar to that of the inclusion of internet usage in the 1980s, which caused the information age and globalisation of the world. Today, for example, the ICC’s Digital Standards Initiative (DSI) and the United Nations Centre for trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) lead these standardisation efforts in cooperation with sectors such as logistics and banking towards a new world age.</p>
 Cornerstones of Digitalisation 
 Enabling Wide Usage of Digital Identities 
<p>The main two cornerstones that will ensure digitalisation in trade are enabling wide usage of digital identities by corporates and transacting with electronic transferable records.</p>
<p>Digitalisation decisions of leading countries eventually will help to relax anti-terrorist regulations and KYC processes of bankers which tied them up in knots in terms of operational processes, with the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA and then the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>In addition, with digital identity, it will be easier for SMEs to access new supply chain networks but also financial resources. The trade finance space of SMEs is calculated to close the 1.5 trillion USD financing gap.</p>
<p>In supply chain management, it is not easy for a buyer company to onboard a reliable supplier that will provide goods to the production line. In order to ensure trust in trade transactions, these problems should be figured out, who the supplier company is in real life and whether it actually produces what it says or its trade partners or references are really their partners as claimed by the supplier, and more importantly, which staff are authorised to sign on behalf of the corporate. For this reason, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures are carried out in the processes of carrying goods, sharing information and transferring payments between the parties of the trade.</p>
<p>As trust and transparency cannot be provided, aside from the operational costs, the rapidly growing supply chain financing gap of SMEs can’t be tackled. Clearly, there has been great potential in the field of finance.</p>
<p>Additionally, if trade business can reduce operational costs, paperwork can be shifted to make our world a better place in the sense of sustainability.</p>
 Transacting with Electronic Transferable Records 
<p>Another main cornerstone of digitalisation is aligning national legal frameworks to run on electronic transferable records. Which means handling of data, instead of paper, in trade transactions.</p>
<p>Recently, when I asked why an SME owner doesn’t export, they said “I don’t have the time and resources to trade with a ‘red tape’”. Imagine that there are no bureaucratic processes in an export! With the widespread use of digital identity, a supplier can trade without needing bank intelligence or references. What a great potential!</p>
<p>In order to tackle the rapidly deteriorating climate problem of the world, complying with the international legal regulations of ESG and 0-Carbon is not a “nice to have” situation, but it has become an inevitable necessity. This means that legal authorities should reach sensitive commercial trade data of the corporates.</p>
<p>In order to carry out legal inspections, transparent data on trade is crucial; not the information that companies, customs, terminal operators and banks try to collect one by one from papers stuck in data silos.</p>
<p>In this case, the most important technological need is to provide data confidentiality, which will provide the element of trust between the trade parties. The privacy of commercial data is almost even more important than the privacy of individual data. Individuals have been sharing their personal information, private stories, and photos every day for years. After fearlessly sharing it on social media such as Facebook and Instagram, the world started to discuss and take precautions on personal data privacy.</p>
 Data Confidentiality in Digital Identities for Legal Entities 
<p>In commercial life, neither companies nor logistics providers nor banks can scatter their data as boldly as individuals, saying “it’s good to go digital”. It is very important which information will be disclosed to whom in the digital identities of legal entities.</p>
<p>The legal presence, name and address information of the company in the country where it is located may be public and available to all trading partners, but for example, its balance sheet, profitability, credibility in banks, trading partners or signatories with which it does business cannot be public.</p>
<p>Similarly, the data on the bill of lading, which includes, for example, the buyer of the exported goods, must be confidential. This data, which cannot be processed because it is stuck in papers at the moment, provides a kind of “confidentiality” indeed. However, to make world trade of this size sustainable, we must change all paper-based processes.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the decreasing trust in central structures as a result of financial crises, the only technological solution that can pave the way for central structures that are insufficient to manage the world trade exceeding 22 trillion USD, seems to be Blockchain and DLT today.</p>
 Tackling digitalisation 
<p>Will the efforts of the country’s customs to facilitate trade solve the problem of digitalisation and transparent data? I think it will be insufficient. Because the main data owner parties that carry out international trade are corporates, and it seems like the only way to focus on companies’ needs is to evolve digitalisation.</p>
 The Impact of ICC Regulation 
<p>The latest regulation of the ICC, such as the URDTT (Uniform Rules for Digital Trade Transactions), is one of the most concrete steps taken on this path. For the first time in its history, the ICC Banking Commission has published a set of rules that focuses on corporates, not Banks. Even the word “Bank” is not mentioned in the URDTT, and financial service providers are included as a secondary source for risk mitigation or financing.</p>
<p>UNCTAD- #MLETR (Model Law on Electronic Records) is also the best example of this as a draft model law. This Model Law has succeeded in drafting a legal text that stipulates providing commercial data privacy as the top priority of transacting with electronic trade data. Now there is a need for neutral entities such as the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>The trade industry is struggling to form neutral and interoperable entities of digitalisation which are valid internationally and in cooperation with local (legal) structures. I think this is the right form of governance of digitalisation.</p>
 Benefits of the Digitalisation 
<p>With the digitalisation journey, not only will the problems in the management and financing of supply chains will be resolved. But also, the smuggling, fraud, corruption and VAT losses that countries face will be mostly controlled. The fraudsters, who know the commercial documents and banking process, are now living a good life thanks to the run-down structure based on paper.</p>
<p>Not to mention the VAT losses; in the UK alone, the VAT deficit is estimated at £9 billion. If we make a rough calculation considering the VAT leakage amount in the total imports of goods and services (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-trade-in-numbers/uk-trade-in-numbers-web-version#import-statistics">£609 billion</a>) of the UK in 2020, we can say that the VAT loss of all countries in world trade is about 2.3 trillion USD. Such a huge amount!</p>
<p>It is time to start global cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. It would be beneficial to roll up our sleeves for cooperation in the field of digitalisation and international digital identity. By controlling this kind of fraud, we can use revealed sources for SME’s finance and complying with ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) rules or tackling the climate crisis.</p>
 Global Digitalisation Growth 
<p>There are 53 countries in the UK’s commonwealth and the most prominent countries which meet the same basis with English Law are India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. With the adoption of the electronic trade document law, which is currently in the “fast track” stage in the UK legislative process, great impact on the commonwealth area will be seen. Moreover, the adoption of English law in international trade agreements and letters of credit is a centuries-old tradition in the world.</p>
<p>Germany, France and the USA have made significant progress in the adoption of the electronic trade document law. China, on the other hand, is taking firm steps forward in this area. These countries have a large area of influence and the potential for the acceleration of data-driven digital electronic trade is quite high in the coming years.</p>
<p>Therefore, digital supply chain documents and finance operating platforms such as the Bolero International (WiseTech Global Group), Contour, Essdocs, which have managed Rulebooks, will find themselves a great commercial opportunity with digital data-based trade that has become law. Although technology provider platforms based on blockchain technology experienced “winter conditions” in 2022, they will be able to scale rapidly from 2023 with the availability of legal infrastructures.</p>
 How should organisations prepare for digitalisation? 
<p>So, what should companies and banks do for the upcoming digitalisation era?</p>
<p>Is it wise to wait for these developments to mature?</p>
<p>Especially small companies and local banks seem far from creating a vision to prepare for the effects of the big change coming. Some large companies think that they can adapt to digitalisation by relying on their size, but if they do not prepare their workforce, which is their most valuable resource in their medium-term business plans, they will not only be more vulnerable to negative impacts like COVID, but also may lose their competitive advantage in their own sector. In the view of that what should companies do? Watch out for upcoming articles.</p>

<p>After some of the basics of quantum computing are explored in the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/introduction-to-quantum-computing-and-post-quantum-cryptography-pqc/">introductory episode of the Entrust Engage podcast</a>, episode two takes listeners deeper into the science behind this topic with an <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">interview featuring Dr. Carmen Palacios-Berraquero</a>, award-winning quantum physicist and CEO of Nu Quantum. &nbsp;Many interesting areas were covered – from a brief history of quantum computing to what the future benefits of this field might be. Here are the 6 key takeaways from this episode:</p>
<p>#1: The episode kicked off with a concise history of quantum computing, which goes back to the ’80s when people first began to look at how to apply quantum theory to computing. Then in the ’90s, Shor’s algorithm was developed, which significantly sped up the calculation of factorization problems and was the first step in potentially breaking RSA encryption. Experimental physicists also found new hardware in which you could encode quantum information. Progress in quantum computing continued to exponentially accelerate in the 2000s and 2010s and led to a kind of modern-day space race of different hardware approaches. In these earlier years the field was still largely an academic endeavor, whereas in the past seven years the academic pioneers of this race moved into the industry to set up startups. In 2019, Google declared “quantum supremacy.” And in 2021, more than $3 billion was invested into quantum computing, further cementing its importance to the future of technology.</p>
<p>#2: So, what exactly is “quantum supremacy”? For starters, Dr. Palacios-Berraquero prefers the term “quantum advantage.” When Google announced that it had achieved this, what did that really mean? How significant was this?</p>
<p>Well, Google was essentially successful in using quantum computing to solve a problem that would have been infeasible for a classical computer. However, the problem it solved had no application in the real world. While the industry is moving toward solving commercially useful problems, there is still progress to be made before any organization can consider itself to have a true quantum advantage.</p>
<p>#3: There is consensus that the quantum computing threat to traditional public key algorithms will be a reality within the decade. However, taking Google’s 2019 claim of quantum supremacy into consideration, the question arises: Has this timeline been accelerated?</p>
<p>The answer: not necessarily. There are two main factors to consider here. The first is that it is very hard to scale these machines. The second is that there are lots of errors in quantum computers’ processors. Error correction schemes are very complex and take up quite a few logical qubits in quantum computers, leaving fewer qubits to perform logical computations. So, even with the progress made at present, the threat timeline of quantum computers has not accelerated.</p>
<p>#4: Is the news about quantum computing all about its threats and challenges? Echoing what we learned from episode one, absolutely not! There are major benefits that quantum computing can unlock in the future. For starters, quantum computing can crack those intractable problems we can’t currently solve today. This opens entirely new applications, markets, and industries. Some examples include both material and drug design, paving the way for innovations in healthcare and the battle against climate change. In the near term, quantum computing promises benefits like financial portfolio optimization, improvements in machine learning algorithms, and the simulation of quantum and physical systems.</p>
<p>#5: &nbsp;What is a quantum random number generator and how different is it from what we know of entropy in cryptography today? The quantum random number generator is based on the main proposition of quantum theory that the outcome of a measurement is completely unpredictable. It uses this principle to generate entropy/random numbers. Over the past decade, it has been proposed to use these generators as a source for cryptography.</p>
<p>The main difference is that entropy used in cryptography currently is based on classical mechanics, where theoretically everything is predictable. In theory, by knowing the exact functioning of a system and combining it with a lot of computing power, you could predict the outcome of a classical random number generator.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different, though. Current cryptography uses mathematical tools in addition to a random number generator, making it quite impossible to crack. While the industry is debating the use and applications of a quantum random number generator, it’s still a long way from adopting it in cryptography.</p>
<p>#6: Additional benefits in development include quantum computing as a service (QCaas) and quantum internet. These are two very different things. QCaaS is a means by which users can access quantum computers via the cloud. For example, AWS hosts around five quantum computers, and a user can buy time on them through the cloud and run various algorithms. And there’s a long line of users queued up to use these computers. Who are these users? A mix of academics and researchers as well as R&amp;D departments in industry. However, these machines are still in the labs of companies, and it will be a while before they can function independently in a data center.</p>
<p>Now let’s unravel the service known as quantum internet. Picture a computer network that can send quantum information between distant computers, and there you have it in a nutshell. This technology is still largely contained to the realm of academia, and it’s still unknown what the exact commercial application will be. What we do know is that it’s still some years away.</p>
<p>The science behind quantum computers is pretty fascinating, and if you’re looking to learn more, I recommend listening to the <a href="https://engage.podcasts.entrust.com/e/the-science-behind-quantum-computers/">second episode</a> of Entrust Engage.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access IT systems and data is at the core of cybersecurity, especially as most successful cyber-attacks are enabled by the abuse of stolen credentials. Access management, therefore, is an essential part of any cybersecurity strategy, but in the modern business world, where cloud computing, virtual machines, DevOps, automation, AI, and remote working are common, this can be extremely challenging.</p>
<p>Adding to the complexity of access management, these business IT technologies and practices increasingly involve the use of service accounts for humans and machines to perform IT tasks. These are commonly known as privileged accounts, which are given to privileged users to enable them to access critical resources and perform admin-level actions.</p>
<p>In the light of continually increasing and evolving cyber threats, management of this high-level access is critical for all modern businesses because the misuse of privileged accounts and credentials is a popular and powerful technique used by cyber attackers.</p>
 PAM necessary for almost everything related to business IT 
<p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions are designed to enable organizations to deal with these challenges, and with today’s complex operating environments and interconnected machines, and the proliferation of privileged accounts, almost everything related to business IT has some need for PAM. But this is a dynamic and evolving market space driven by changing threats and business IT environments.</p>
<p>As a result of widespread adoption of cloud services, for example, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) platforms are disrupting the traditional PAM market, demand for dynamic cloud access continues to grow, and Just in Time (JiT) and Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) demands are beginning to impact the market.</p>
 Customer Identity &amp; Access Management highlights in the EIC agenda&nbsp; 
<p>Whether your organization is considering implementing PAM for the first time or looking to replace or augment existing solutions, it is important to understand exactly why PAM is necessary, what are best practices, how this market is evolving, and the business benefits. A good place to start, is the dedicated <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/935">PAM track</a> at this year’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud &nbsp;Conference</a>.</p>
<p>In the modern business world, there is an increasing demand for contact-free onboarding experiences, passwordless authentication, decentralized identity, and policy-based access. Get up to speed with these and other trends in access management and learn how to future-proof existing access management investments in a session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/3">Access Management Trends in a Connect Anywhere World</a>.</p>
<p>Drilling down to the specific topic of Privileged Access Management (PAM), it is important to recognize that all organizations are different and so it is important to choose the PAM solution that best fits your organization’s technical, security, and business requirements. Discover what the PAM market has to offer and how to choose the right solution in this market overview for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5334/1">Privileged Access Management Solutions</a>.</p>
<p>As already discussed, privileged accounts are very powerful and are a top target for cybercriminals, but they are often anonymous and shared. Learn how to take control of privileged access in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/1">Trust No One, Always Verify</a>.</p>
<p>Learn how to make a business case for PAM, conduct a proof of concept, and achieve a return on investment in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5323/2">Preparations for Smoother PAM Flight</a>, and discover how to handle identities and accounts in the context of a Privileged Access Security Service based on the real world experience of a German bank in this session entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5328/1">Privileged Access Management – Moving from Cost to Service Centre</a>.</p>

 <p></p><p>The United States’ potential ban of TikTok is the latest and loudest warning sign of our increasing need for a decentralized internet. Consumers are quickly wondering where they’ll go for their short form video content if TikTok is taken away. Creators are faced with the reality that their income could immediately dry up if the most viral social media platform to date disappears. Lastly, businesses could potentially watch one of their most powerful distribution channels go up in flames overnight.</p><p>Distribution and content, two of the most valuable assets on TikTok, are currently owned by the platform instead of the users who worked so hard for them. A follower on TikTok can’t be transferred outside of the platform, and a video on the social media giant is currently owned and stored on TikTok’s servers. It’s the very nature of Web2 infrastructure that platforms like TikTok absorb an incredible amount of ownership and responsibility to store, manage, and steward the relationships and data on them, putting end users and businesses at risk.</p><p>So what’s the alternative? How can we build platforms that turn over data ownership to the users of that platform rather than hoard massive amounts of power? The answer is to build Web5 applications that enable users to maintain ownership of their data so platforms can stick to what they do best: curating and serving that data.</p><p>Let’s consider the model a platform like TikTok currently uses. They ask users to upload videos to TikTok servers and then store, sort, organize, and serve that content. In a Web5 world, users could store their own videos on their own decentralized web node(s) and grant access to that content to TikTok. TikTok would adhere to a common schema to access that content - one that any other platform, such as Facebook or Instagram could access as well, and then layer its own metadata such as likes, comments, and analytics on top of that.</p><p>Follower counts wouldn’t need to be limited to a single platform, instead allowing users with a single decentralized identifier to follow users, creators, or businesses across platforms. This would decouple platforms and distribution, meaning that the marketing power of individuals and businesses wouldn’t be wholly subject to the whim of community guidelines or editorial discretion of platform owners. In this model, a TikTok ban would simply mean that TikTok’s metadata - like counts, comments, and other analytics - would be stripped away, but the content and creator-follower relationships would persist. TikTok and platforms like it would still be able to curate their excellent algorithms, monetize on in-feed ads, and more, while holding less power over their users’ content and reducing the overhead of storing incredibly large amounts of video content on behalf of their users.</p><p>If a Web5 future that returns ownership to users and decouples platforms from data sounds appealing to you, be sure to check out our ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975">GitHub</a> or join us on <a href="https://discord.gg/tbd">Discord</a>.</p>

 Ontology Monthly Report — March&nbsp;2023 <p>Ontology is incubating a new Layer2 project called <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-foundation-incubates-new-layer-2-solution-goshen-network-dc4b03258cdc">Goshen Network</a>. This collaboration further promotes interactivity between Ontology &amp; Ethereum ecosystems, providing a better choice for developers &amp; users in the Web3&nbsp;world.</p> Developments/Corporate Updates  Development Progress   We are 100% done with the L2 blockchain browser.  We are 50% done with the optimization of the interface of the governance contract.  We are 30% done with the EVM bloom bit index optimization.  We are 30% done with the high ledger memory usage optimization.  We are 20% done with the optimization of the snapshot of the call of Ontology EVM contract.  We are 15% done with the optimization of ONT staking liquidity.  We are 15% done with the L2 Sequencer Service.   Out &amp; About — Event Spotlight <p>It was all hands on deck this month with a string of news reports and developments:</p>  Ontology has just hit 20k followers on CoinMarketCap! Thank you to our incredible community for your continued support and belief in our vision for a decentralized future&nbsp;.    Ontology has held an AMA on CoinMarketCap. Some users expressed their curiosity in our CMC community.    Continuing our ‘Meet the Team’ series, we’re very pleased to ask several team members and Ontology Harbingers a few questions.    Have you heard about the real-life uses of the $ONT token? It’s more than just an investment opportunity! We collaborate with Guardarian, where you can buy and sell $ONT with local currency; We collaborate with HYVE, where you can get paid for your work in $ONT; We collaborate with UQUID, where you can shop with $ONT; We collaborate with BITSA, where users can use<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ONT&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $ONT</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ONG&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $ONG</a> tokens to easily recharge their accounts for online and offline payments, transfers, and ATM withdrawals.    It’s time for our latest #OWN101, as part of our #OWNInsights series. We brought the definition of “ONG”, “TPS”, “Depeg”, and ”Optimistic Rollup”.    Have you heard of <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1636360620789620736?s=20">ONTID</a>? It’s a decentralized identity solution that is gaining popularity due to its unique features. ONT ID is a better DID solution for several&nbsp;reasons.    As part of our Harbinger Interview Series, we’re happy to have chatted with Donny Clutterbuck about his experiences with Ontology, #DID, and our fantastic community.    Ontology <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1633059958026797061?s=20">MainNet</a> is a high-performance proof of stake (PoS) blockchain that supports a wide range of programming languages and virtual machines, including NeoVM, WasmVM, and Ontology&nbsp;EVM.
