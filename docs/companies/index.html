DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF63 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams.

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable<a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/"> identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

     <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
     <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
     <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
     <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
      10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
     <br> 
       
       Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
       100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
       Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
       De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
       Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
       Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
       Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
       De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
       Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. (Er zijn ontwikkelingen op die gebied met diverse partijen).<br><br>  
       En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>IBM <a href="http://ibm.com/watsonx">watsonx</a> is changing the game for enterprises of all shapes and sizes, making it easy for them to embed generative AI into their operations. This week, the CEO of WellnessWits, an IBM Business Partner, announced they embedded watsonx in their app to help patients ask questions about chronic disease and more easily schedule appointments with physicians.</p>



<p>Watsonx comprises of three components that empower businesses to customize their AI solutions: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a> offers intuitive tooling for powerful foundation models; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a> enables compute-efficient, scalable workloads wherever data resides; and the third component, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a>, provides guardrails essential to responsible implementation. Watsonx gives organizations the ability to refine foundation models with their own domain-specific data to gain competitive advantage and ensure factual grounding to external sources of knowledge.</p>



<p>These features—along with a broad range of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/artificial-intelligence-apis">traditional machine learning and AI functions</a>—are now available to independent software vendors (ISVs) and managed service providers (MSPs) as part of IBM’s embeddable software portfolio, supported by the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/ODNKAAKJ">IBM Ecosystem Engineering Build Lab</a> and partner ecosystem.</p>



<p>The watsonx platform, along with other IBM AI applications, libraries and APIs help partners <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2022-10-25-IBM-Helps-Ecosystem-Partners-Accelerate-AI-Adoption-by-Making-it-Easier-to-Embed-and-Scale-AI-Across-Their-Business">more quickly bring AI-powered commercial software to market</a>, reducing the need for specialized talent and developer resources.</p>



 A platform prioritized for enterprise AI 



<p>IBM is focused on helping organizations create business value by embedding generative AI. Watsonx provides the functionality enterprise developers need most, including summarization of domain-specific text; classification of inputs based on sentiment analysis, threat levels or customer segmentation; text content generation; analysis and extraction (or redaction) of essential information; and question-answering functions. The most common use cases from partners often combine several of these AI tasks.</p>



<p>ISVs need the flexibility to choose models appropriate to their industry, domain and use case. Watsonx provides access to open-source models (through the Hugging Face catalog), third-party models (such as Meta’s Llama 2) and IBM’s own <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/building-ai-for-business-ibms-granite-foundation-models/">Granite</a> models. IBM provides an <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-09-28-IBM-Announces-Availability-of-watsonx-Granite-Model-Series,-Client-Protections-for-IBM-watsonx-Models">IP indemnity</a> (contractual protection) for its foundation models, enabling partners to be more confident AI creators. With watsonx, ISVs can further differentiate their offering and gain competitive advantage by harnessing proprietary data and tuning the models to domain-specific tasks. These capabilities allow ISVs to better address their clients’ industry-specific needs.</p>



<p>Let’s explore a few AI use cases that span different industries.&nbsp;</p>



 Exceptional customer care through AI solutions 



<p>Today, customers expect seamless experiences and fast answers to their questions, and companies that fail to meet these expectations risk falling behind. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ceo-generative-ai/customer-service">Customer service has leapfrogged other functions to become CEOs’ top generative AI priority</a>. Given this trend, companies should be looking for ways to embed generative AI into their customer care portals. To accelerate this process, companies can implement AI-infused customer care commercial solutions. IBM’s embeddable AI technology, such as IBM watsonx Assistant and watsonx.ai, allows ISVs to quickly and easily build AI into their solutions, which in turn helps them to reduce time to market and reach their customers sooner.</p>



<p>Watsonx allows enterprises to effortlessly generate conversation transcripts with live agents or automate Q&amp;A sessions. With watsonx.ai, they can obtain concise conversation summaries, extract key information and classify interactions, such as conducting sentiment analysis to gauge customer satisfaction. This information will further refine and improve the information available to the agents.</p>



 Streamline your procurement process using watsonx 



<p>By embedding AI technology in enterprise solutions, organizational leaders can connect disparate, broken processes and data into integrated end-to-end solutions.</p>



<p>For example, supply chain management can be a challenge for companies. The process of changing suppliers can be a time-consuming and complex task, as it requires intensive research and collaboration across the organization. Instead of spending cycles and resources on creating an in-house solution that streamlines this process, companies can implement an AI-infused supply chain management solution developed by ISVs. ISVs are experts in their domain and build their solution with enterprise-grade AI–such as watsonx Assistant, watsonx.ai, and watsonx.data–so companies can feel confident in their selection.</p>



<p>Watsonx Assistant can serve as a user-friendly, natural-language Q&amp;A interface for your supplier database. In the background, watsonx.ai generates database queries and content like Requests for Proposals (RFPs) or Requests for Information (RFIs), while Watson Discovery analyzes supplier financial reports. Watsonx.data acts as a front end for the company’s ERP system, with up-to-date attributes about inventory items, ratings of suppliers, quantities available and so on, along with a third-party data warehouse providing further decision criteria. Thus, teams can work smarter and move toward better, more integrated business outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

 Partner success stories 



<p><a href="https://www.wellnesswits.com/post/wellnesswits-embeds-ibm-watsonx-assistant-in-app-to-improve-access-to-chronic-disease-specialists">WellnessWits</a> is using watsonx Assistant to create a virtual care solution that connects patients to chronic disease specialists–from anywhere. The platform features an AI-powered chat functionality that can help patients gather information and answers about their chronic disease and facilitates personalized, high-quality care from physicians that specialize in their condition.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ubotica-partners-with-ibm-for-one-click-deployment-of-space-ai-applications/">Ubotica</a> is leveraging IBM Cloud and watsonx.ai in its CogniSAT platform, enabling developers deploy AI models to satellites for a wide variety of observational use cases such as detecting forest fires or space junk. CogniSAT improves the efficiency with which data is stored and processed, providing edge-based analysis onboard satellites.</p>

<p>When extreme weather strikes, it hits vulnerable populations the hardest. In the current global climate of stronger and more frequent storms, heat waves, droughts and floods, how do we build more positive environmental and social impact? We have a responsibility to apply our technological expertise, resources and ecosystem to help the world become more resilient to these environmental challenges.</p>



<p>We need a three-pronged approach to long-term sustainability: preparing the workforce with skills for a greener future; forging strategic cross-sector partnerships; and empowering purpose-driven individuals and organizations with the right tools and technology to accelerate action.</p>



 Equipping the current and future workforce with green skills 



<p>According to new Morning Consult research commissioned by IBM, 71% of business leaders surveyed anticipate their business will emphasize sustainability skills criteria in their hiring in the next two years, with 92% expecting to invest in sustainability training in the next year. There is already a skills gap in technology and sustainability, and these results show that it continues to grow.</p>



<p>But when it comes to training and credentials in green and technology skills, there just aren’t that many options. IBM already has a strong track record of providing free skilling resources to communities that are underrepresented in tech, most recently with a commitment to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ai-skills-for-all-how-ibm-is-helping-to-close-the-digital-divide/">skill 2 million learners in AI.</a> So, to help prepare the experts of tomorrow with the green and technology skills they need, we are providing free training on IBM SkillsBuild.</p>



<p>Our initial curriculum offerings will include three courses: Sustainability and Technology Fundamentals, Data Analytics for Sustainability and Enterprise Thinking for Sustainability. Through these foundational courses, learners will explore topics like ecology, biodiversity and social impact to help them develop a comprehensive understanding of sustainability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lessons will include real-life case studies and opportunities to learn about how AI can assist businesses in achieving sustainability goals and mitigating climate risks. The courses also provide instruction in data analytics contextualized around sustainability use cases. We will also add more advanced courses that take a deeper look at how data analysis and visualization skills can be applied to practical sustainability use cases, such as examining energy consumption in a community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These courses are available to high school students, university students and faculty, and adult learners worldwide. Learners are free to take as many courses as they want and to study at their own pace. Upon successful completion of some of these courses, learners receive a credential that is recognized by employers.</p>



<p>IBM SkillsBuild has a global reach, and it has already benefited many learners with the inspiration and resources they need to pursue careers in technology. For instance, in Nigeria, <a href="https://ravenewsonline.com/2023/04/11/how-increased-access-to-stem-education-can-curb-nigerias-teeming-youth-unemployment/?sf178129919=1">Clinton Chidubem Amam</a> found employment as a graphics designer after completing IBM SkillsBuild courses, and his work was displayed at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this year. Meanwhile, Oscar Ramirez, who arrived in the US as a child from Mexico, was able to investigate everything from AI to cybersecurity and project management while finishing his studies in Applied Mathematics and Computational Mathematics at San Jose State University.</p>



 Uniting sustainability experts in strategic partnerships 



<p>Whether it’s closing the green skills gap or tackling environmental challenges, you can’t go at it alone. Addressing big challenges requires collaboration and strategic partnership with experts that intimately understand the nuances of different domains.</p>



<p>That’s why IBM’s <a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/corporate-social-responsibility/2023-citizens-awards-winners">award-winning </a>pro-bono social impact program, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a>, selects innovative organizations focused on solutions worth scaling. In this program, diverse cross-sector experts in topics such as sustainable agriculture and renewable energy come together from both inside and outside IBM. Using a human-centered approach along with <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-w5-Go7qCAxU9jIkEHUIxBecQFnoECAcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Fgarage&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Ay7C8rTOWtUjEDrKu-soY&amp;opi=89978449">IBM Garage</a>, artificial intelligence, advances in data, cloud and other technologies, these teams collaborate on projects to help vulnerable populations become more resilient to climate change.</p>



<p>Five organizations are now joining this initiative on the path toward clean water and sanitation for all (UN SDG6):</p>



 
 The University of Sharjah will build a model and application to monitor and forecast water access conditions in the Middle East and North Africa to support communities in arid and semi-arid regions with limited renewable internal freshwater resources. 



 The University of Chicago Trust in Delhi will aggregate water quality information in India, build and deploy tools designed to democratize access to water quality information, and help improve water resource management for key government and nonprofit organizations. 



 The University of Illinois will develop an AI geospatial foundation model to help predict rain fall and flood forecasting in mountain headwaters across the Appalachian Mountains in the US. 



 Instituto IGUÁ will create a cloud-based platform for sanitation infrastructure planning in Brazil alongside local utility providers and governments. 



 Water Corporation will design a self-administered water quality testing system for Aboriginal communities in Western Australia. 
 



<p>We’re excited to partner with organizations that deeply understand the water and sanitization challenges that communities face. IBM has committed to support our sustainability accelerator projects, including our sustainable agriculture and clean energy cohorts, with USD 30 million worth of services by 2025.</p>



 Supporting a just transition for all 



<p>To build a more sustainable world, we must empower communities with the skills, tools and support they need to adapt to environmental hazards with resilience. By providing access to IBM technology and know-how, we can empower the communities most vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather and climate change. And by democratizing access to sustainability education through IBM SkillsBuild, we help the next generation of experts realize their passion for applying advanced technology to preserve and protect the environment. These efforts, along with our strategic partnerships, will lead us all into a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms.

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>The 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study identifies a daunting 4 million-person workforce gap. This shortfall in qualified candidates hampers industry growth. To tackle this challenge, the industry must broaden its recruitment scope, targeting individuals with potential to learn, including those from diverse backgrounds like business, arts, or engineering. Cultivating entry-level opportunities for students, young professionals, and career changers is vital for industry expansion. However, assessing cybersecurity aptitude in candidates without direct experience poses a challenge. Traditionally, the industry has lacked accessible entry points for newcomers. In this presentation, ISC2's CEO, Clar Rosso, advocates for a clear and adaptable pathway to cybersecurity careers, offering data-driven insights and strategies to ignite recruitment efforts and welcome new talent into the field.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-cybersecurity-workforce-gap-cre23"></a>

  <p>Paul Fisher delves into the multifaceted approach required to foster trustworthiness within complex software supply chains. This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders.

<p>A couple of years ago, I published a blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/11/aes-turns-20/">AES Turns 20</a>, celebrating the 20th year since the trusted symmetric algorithm was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the article, I dug into post-quantum and how Lov Grover’s quadratic speed-up algorithm might be applied to brute force attacks on symmetric algorithms. NIST’s position on this remains unchanged; symmetric algorithms such as AES 192 and AES 256 bit are good for the next couple of decades. The general recommendation persists: Anything with less than 112 bits of classical security should not be used. If there are any doubts, consider doubling the key length if you are using shorter bit lengths.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the post-quantum threats being discussed and the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attack frequently mentioned on technology websites and cited by some of my colleagues. I decided a blog post was in order to investigate a bit further. My colleague Dave Butcher, Technical Sales Consultant, is as passionate about PQ as I am, and I enlisted him to discuss the topic in more detail and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on what is meant by Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. The attack assumes that classical encryption techniques applied to data today, to make it unreadable and unusable, will in the future be vulnerable to attack from post-quantum computers. They will be able to crack the hard math problems that today’s computers would take in some cases hundreds and even thousands of years to solve. So, the idea is bad actors and nation-states will intercept and steal (harvest) data. They’ll then store it and wait until quantum computers are capable of crunching the numbers and decrypting the data to make it readable.</p>
 Data In Motion With TLS 
<p>Some of you might be thinking that most data at rest is encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES, so surely we are in decent shape and this isn’t a real threat? I initially jumped to the same conclusion and then realized it is a bit more nuanced. Data at rest is typically encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES and should be resilient to Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. However, data is typically transported to a location before it comes to rest using network switches, routers, load balancers, etc. And this is where is gets a bit more nuanced. As data is moved around on the internet, a range of communication protocols are in play. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto protocol in use on the Internet securing HTTPS web pages, email, WhatsApp, and a myriad of other applications. To establish a secure connection between a client and server the TLS handshake is invoked:</p>
 
 The client sends a Hello message detailing the TLS version being used and available cipher suite. 
 The server responds back with their Hello message confirming TLS version and cipher suite followed by the server’s certificate, which includes the public key of the server’s asymmetric key pair. 
 This is then used in a key exchange where a symmetric-based session key is encrypted and sent to the server using the server’s public key. 
 
<p>The server now has the same symmetric encryption key as the client – this is a pre-requisite for symmetric encryption. A secure bi-direction channel is now established between client and server and data can be efficiently encrypted, transported, and stored at its final destination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is the session key is based on a symmetric algorithm, which is the most efficient way to encrypt bulk data – asymmetric algorithms are not efficient at<br>
encrypting bulk data. Based on current NIST recommendations, as long as the symmetric key is a decent length of bits it’ll be resistant to a PQ attack. However, the asymmetric public/private keys used in the key exchange step are most likely using RSA- or elliptic-curve-based cryptography. These are the classical asymmetric algorithms that Peter Shor identified in the late 1990s as being vulnerable to being compromised by a quantum computer. It is unlikely that state-sponsored actors will be targeting data stored at rest; instead they’ll be targeting data in transit armed with the knowledge that asymmetric keys are used in the key exchange process. If they can intercept that transaction and store it away while biding their time, then in the future they’ll be able to use a quantum computer to factorize the asymmetric key pair, allowing them to expose the symmetric key and thus decrypt the data. Voila!</p>
 Actionable Steps to Mitigate Against Harvest Now, Decrypt Later 
<p>So, Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is a valid concern for organizations who store long-term encrypted data. What steps should you be taking to mitigate such attacks?</p>
 
 Start using longer symmetric key lengths. This is likely an easy change as AES with a 256-bit key has been part of the AES standard from the beginning. Most TLS services rely on standard TLS implementations that include configurable cipher suites. Changing to a longer key length is likely as easy as updating a configuration file and restarting a service. Many other tools you are using may also have this option. 
 Consider adding protection to communication paths that move high-value data to prevent Harvest Now, Decrypt Later later attacks. For example, there are VPN implementations (e.g. Open Quantum Safe’s OpenVPN project) that have been built using newer quantum-resistant cryptography. These are not fully standardized, but when you control both ends of a communication path (for example, between a branch location and headquarters) utilizing a non-standard protocol is not an issue. 
 Think about using pre-shared keys for certain interactions where you share symmetric encryption keys out of band, such as by exchanging physical media. This eliminates the asymmetric key exchange that is vulnerable to quantum computers. 
 Understand if there are already quantum-resistant versions of the protocol that you are using that you could migrate to today. For example, the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/#introduction">Signal messaging protocol</a> has been updated to be quantum-resistant. Consider becoming a first adopter. 
 Prioritize crypto-agility within your organization. Planning and building crypto-agility are going to be key to adopting quantum-safe cryptography. While this does not fix the problem today, it puts your organization in the best position to quickly adopt post-quantum cryptography as it becomes available and minimize the vulnerability window for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. 
 
<p>One of the tools that can help you plan is Mosca’s Theorem. Understanding how long your data needs to be secure is key to prioritizing projects to mitigate Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data that has fleeting value is probably not at high risk for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data whose value remains high even as time begins to approach the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers needs to be a priority for secondary protection. Mosca’s Theorem is discussed in more detail in an earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/07/a-bridge-to-post-quantum-cryptography/">A Bridge to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 The PQC Elephant in the Room 
<p>The elephant in the room when post-quantum cryptography is being discussed is “when”? When is this going to happen? The answer is of course we don’t really know. It could be five years away. It could also be 10 or 20+ years away. However, to play devil’s advocate, what if nation-state actors already have quantum computers with sufficient processing capability running in their labs? It’s not quite apples to apples, but there are some precedents. Public key cryptography was first postulated by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and its implementation as RSA announced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. At least that is what was understood to be the case until in 1997 some UK secrets held by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) became declassified, revealing that British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cocks</a>, working for the&nbsp;intelligence agency, described an equivalent public/private key system in an internal document in 1973. Whether it was ever used is pure speculation, but it does illustrate the art of the possible. With that we will leave you to ponder, but at least you should now be clear that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is real.</p>

<p>In late October, Ocean Protocol sponsored a General &amp; DeFi theme hackathon at ETHMiami. Participants could select a technology stack to build upon in teams, creating a tool, business case, proof of concept, or other applications using the chosen technology stack.</p><p>Approximately 17% of the teams at the hackathon opted into taking the Ocean Protocol track. The top 3 projects, as scored by the protocol and hackathon organizers, received prizes for their execution, creativity, and technology implementation.</p><p>Three distinctive projects applied blockchain and Ocean technologies to niche mini-product and platform offerings, which led to increased use and flexibility of the Ocean Protocol. Their product abstracts and information were as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st — xTRUST — Decentralized Trust&nbsp;Fund <p>The team behind xTRUST aimed to build a service with privacy-preserving data sharing through smart contracts. This allowed a guarantor to fund a contract, designate a beneficiary, set a time interval, and define the conditions for the transfer of ownership. Beneficiaries could redeem and allow access through the Ocean Protocol’s access control mechanisms within the limits set by the guarantor. xTRUST targeted a traditional financial wealth and data ownership management gap, offering a digital asset transfer solution. The team was inspired by Ocean Protocol’s initiatives in safe AI, finance, and data sharing, focusing on democratizing access to opportunities. They demonstrated their application using the Ocean <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts">Smart Contract</a> libraries for various functions and hosted the dApp on&nbsp;AWS.</p><p>This niche financial mini-product targets a demand in traditional financial wealth management and data ownership management does not equate to support: Digital Assets and ownership transfers.</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s mission statement and value proposition inspired the team to ensure safe AI, Finance, and data sharing globally while preserving privacy.</p><p>View xTrust <a href="https://github.com/Jacob8765/eth-miami-hackathon">Github Repository</a>.</p><p>In this short concept and idea definition, the repository above shows the team’s basic attempt to launch a full-stack DeFi dApp for initiating trust funds and enabling a beneficiary to redeem them. In the hackathon, they were able&nbsp;to:</p><p>- Develop a minimum solidity&nbsp;contract</p><p>- Sketch out the UI in&nbsp;Figma</p><p>- Begin implementation of the front-end UX/UI</p><p>- Set up AWS infrastructure to host the&nbsp;dApp</p> 2nd — Data Sea — Data Access &amp; Ownership <p>Data Sea was on a mission to revolutionize data access and ownership. They addressed the problem of accessing niche and consistent datasets, which is incredibly challenging in the real estate, finance, and healthcare sectors. Data Sea’s solution included features like encrypted data streaming, consumer data ownership, dynamic NFTs, ERC-20 access tokens for secure data transfer, and robust data storage using Ocean’s technology. They also provided an automated AI integration for property data and a mechanism for data reselling. Data Sea outlined simple steps for uploading data, controlling access with tokens, reselling data, and integrating AI.</p><p>DataSea took a mission statement to ‘Revolutionizing Data Access &amp; Ownership’</p><p>This team diagnosed features used to offer solutions to the problem statement above:</p>  Encrypted Data Streaming: DataSea allows providers to stream waves of encrypted datasets and AI models to buyers, ensuring security and authenticity.  Consumer Data Ownership: Empower users with the ability to securely sell their data, fostering a new age of data sovereignty.  Dynamic NFTs: Utilization of Ocean Protocol to create dynamic NFTs that store encrypted user data, combining data innovation with blockchain integrity.  ERC20 Access Tokens: Facilitating the secure access and transfer of data ownership.

 Protect access to all applications and resources with Security Service Edge 
<p><br>Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">now in preview</a>, includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, and secures access to any app or resource for users and devices connecting from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integrations across Microsoft’s SSE solution and the Microsoft Entra portfolio make it possible to enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions before granting access to any application or website. This works no matter which identity provider the application uses—without requiring any changes to the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you are testing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access?rtc=1">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>, our identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG), to secure access for Microsoft 365 traffic. We are expanding the public preview to include all internet apps and resources by the end of 2023 with new core capabilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Context-aware SWG with web content filtering to restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Universal Conditional Access to extend adaptive access controls to any network destination, such as an external website or a non-federated SaaS application.  &nbsp; 
 Compliant Network Check,&nbsp;an easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services.&nbsp; 
 Source IP restoration in ID Protection and Conditional Access location policies that maintains each user’s original source IP to enable backward compatibility of trusted location checks and continuous access evaluation, identity risk detection, and logging.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is our identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for any private app or resource. New capabilities in private preview include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for more protocols in addition to TCP, including UDP and private DNS, so you’ll be able to transition from your traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) to a modern ZTNA solution. 
 Conditional Access controls and modern authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), to secure access to all private applications and resources for remote and on-premises users. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our SSE solution works with your existing security and network solutions through integrations across Microsoft’s security stack and open partner ecosystem. We’re partnering with other vendors in this space, starting with <a href="https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-help/integrations-439794/solution-guides/microsoft-security-and-netskope-integration-solution-guide/microsoft-and-netskope-sse-coexistence/">Netskope</a>, to demonstrate seamless side-by-side operation in the same environment. We’re committed to giving you the flexibility to choose the SSE solution that best fits the network traffic in your environment. For both Internet Access and Private Access, we’re also announcing cross-OS client support for Windows and Android in public preview, and for MacOS and iOS in private preview. Our SSE solution is now available globally (except in China and Russia) with SSE edge locations coming in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at our upcoming <a href="https://aka.ms/AccelerateSecurity">Tech Accelerator Ask Microsoft Anything (AMA) session</a> to discuss with our product experts all your questions about Microsoft’s SSE solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and more 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we turned on security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name">Azure Active Directory</a>) for almost seven million existing tenants, which cut the number of compromises in those tenants by 80 percent. Based on the positive customer feedback, we’re helping more Microsoft Entra ID customers protect themselves by automatically enrolling eligible tenants into Conditional Access policies based on customer risk signals, current usage, and licensing. Microsoft-managed conditional access policies&nbsp;will start with three policies that enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) in high-risk scenarios. You can learn more details in Alex Weinert’s recent blog post, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. The policy details are shown in a context pane to the right, indicating that the selected policy requires certain administrator roles to perform multifactor authentication when accessing the Microsoft admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all MFA methods offer equal protection. The more effective MFA methods, such as FIDO2 Security keys, Windows Hello, Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA), and passkeys, use cryptographic techniques to make authentication phishing-resistant. The preview of Microsoft Entra CBA allows you to tailor authentication policies by certificate, resource type, and user group. All these phishing-resistant authentication methods make it possible to eliminate passwords altogether, so they can’t be guessed, intercepted, or phished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting passkeys across our ecosystem, starting with Windows 11. Once you create a passkey for a website, application, or service using Windows Hello, you can sign in from your device using your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. This gives enterprises and government customers an additional, phishing-resistant alternative to physical FIDO2 security keys. Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to sign in using passkeys managed from the Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> now detects anomalies such as an unusual token lifetime or a token played from an unfamiliar location. When a trigger is alerted, Conditional Access can immediately expire the token and force reauthentication along with other measures, such as a password reset or step-up MFA, without requiring manual intervention. If a user makes a password change on-premises, Entra ID Protection can now <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/remediate-user-risks-in-microsoft-entra-id-protection-through-on/ba-p/3773129">automatically remediate their risk</a>. This makes it easier for hybrid organizations to take advantage of user risk policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integrations for more robust Permissions Management 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> has two significant integrations that will give you insights on permission risks so you can improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/PermissionsManagementDefenderForCloud">Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) integration</a> preview consolidates identity and access permission insights with other cloud security information in a single interface. This view will display actionable recommendations for addressing permissions risks, as well as the Permissions Creep Index, and make it easier to enforce least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which is now in public preview, provides and efficient way to consolidate insights into other cloud security posture information on a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">second integration</a>, now generally available, allows ServiceNow&nbsp;customers to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) via the ServiceNow portal. This popular IT service management (ITSM) solution strengthens your Zero Trust posture by adding access permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow. Now when a user requests access approvals, the ServiceNow Plugin fetches the latest data from Permissions Management, then sends the requested user permissions, along with time-bound approval based on the requestor’s roles, back to ServiceNow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evolving secure identity and network access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a single integrated solution with comprehensive capabilities with Microsoft Entra will simplify access security for your admins and give your end users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra portfolio works together to help you secure identities, devices, networks, and workloads. It extends to any user type, including customers, partners, and digital workloads. And now, with our SSE solution, Microsoft Entra is converging identity and network access controls into a single policy engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the latest innovations in Microsoft Entra will make it easier for you to secure access to everything for everyone.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – November 15, 2023 – <a href="https://appruvr.co.uk/?ref=blog.dock.io">Appruvr</a>, a platform that automates the qualification verification process for employers and candidates, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Appruvr makes it easy for organizations to verify credentials instantly without contacting the issuing party or checking physical documents while enabling individuals to control their own data.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof digital document that proves something about an individual or entity, such as someone’s identity or qualification. Verifiable Credentials are instantly verifiable and enable users to present information in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp; </p> Problems: Credential Fraud and Unnecessarily Long Verification Processes  <p>Delaney Millward, Founder of Apprurvr, started the company because he had first-hand experience of seeing how many job applicants embellished their credentials. He relied on websites including LinkedIn and recruitment agencies but found many people didn’t fit what they were looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the traditional recruitment processes is that the information relies solely on what candidates claim they are qualified for. This experience started his journey to find a solution where an organization could quickly and efficiently verify the credentials. At the time, the solution didn’t exist.</p><p>Credential fraud is a huge global problem:&nbsp;</p>  83% of employers believe their hires have lied about qualifications  1 in 5 employers admit to not verifying graduate qualifications  47% of job applicants admit to inflating grades  Fake diplomas and degrees make 7 billion dollars a year worldwide  Credential fraud costs UK businesses £23 billion pounds every year  <p>Credential fraud has financial consequences and affects public safety, particularly when fraudsters work in high-stakes jobs like surgeons, nurses, or construction workers. Many people around the world have died or been injured by unqualified people working in jobs that they got as a result of fake credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credential verification is still generally slow, complex and expensive. To illustrate, even the fastest verification times are approximately 3.8 days, which is cumbersome when we consider the speed of the job market in many sectors. Employers don’t have the capacity to verify all of these credentials, particularly when they need to hire many people in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appruvr is at the forefront of harnessing verifiable credential technology to solve credential fraud issues and give organizations the solutions to make credential verification easier and faster.</p> How Dock's Technology Enables Appruvr to Fast-Track the Credential Verification Process <p>When Appruvr was building their solution and researching Verifiable Credential providers, they felt that Dock could meet their technological needs and shared the same goals of empowering both organizations and individuals with tools to make the journey from education to employment more seamless and efficient.</p><p>These are some of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials in the education and workforce sectors:&nbsp;</p>  Employers can hire candidates faster because they can check the authenticity of credentials instantly.&nbsp;  Organizations can verify credentials without storing that data because individuals hold and control the data on their mobile identity wallet app.  Graduates can conveniently and efficiently prove their credentials in a way that preserves their privacy without relying on a third party.  Job applicants can prove their credentials anywhere in the world at any time in an era where remote and gig work is growing.  <p>By integrating Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials Platform</a>, Appruvr seamlessly transforms education and workforce credentials into fraud-proof and instantly Verifiable Credentials.

  <p>Automated Threats to web applications are according to the Open Web Applications Project (OWASP) a misuse of their inherent valid functionality by applying automated means. Usually, those automations are referred to as `bots´. The attackers usually reverse engineer the web application, e.g. an e-commerce platform, and based on their discovery, craft bots to exploit vulnerabilities or gaps that allow them to pursue their goal on the platform in an undesirable way. A famous example are sneaker bots, whose goal is to obtain a competitive advantage over human clients in purchasing hyped articles like sneakers. Addressing automated threats is a company-wide effort and requires to tackle the problem from many angles reaching from DevSecOps, architectural changes, raising awareness, establishing transparency in the business, implementing preventive controls, to detective controls. In the first phase of our research, we tackled the problem in a big e-commerce company on this entire spectrum of challenges and are now at the position to enhance our approach in a second phase. In the second phase, we aim for an approach to harden a web-application platform with existing detective and reactive controls using aspects of generative approaches and adversarial attacks while also considering explainability.</p>
<p>In the talk, we are going to explain and motivate the problem space, explain the insights from the first phase and outline the goals of the second phase of our research.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-web-application-security-cre23"></a>

  <p>Comprehensive protection of networks, system infrastructures, hardware and software, applications and data is part of every cyber security strategy. But what does this actually mean for identity and access management?&nbsp;Unloved for many years and repeatedly declared dead: passwords. Large IT companies have been promising us a password-free future for a long time. Is it really that easy to finally turn your back on passwords? The fact is that we have to deal with a large number of passwords every day in order to complete our professional and private tasks. Every password should be unique, highly complex and as long as possible. But what does the frightening everyday life with passwords look like today, what will it hopefully look like in the future and why it is essential to deal with the topic right now, explains&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Holzinger in his lecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/is-the-future-really-password-free-cre23"></a>

  <p>AI actors are poised to eclipse the number of human users on the internet. Many industry observers have decried such growth, pointing to the immense risks that such a brave new world poses. How can security systems even keep up with the rate of expansion in AI technologies? How can enterprises hope to compete with the vast amounts of money, time, and resources that AI companies use to train their models? Such questions presage a significant evolution in the way the tech industry envisions, develops, and deploys security systems.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way forward, but it requires the cybersecurity market to shift toward a pattern that follows what AI vendors have done: make the science of biological systems the template for cybersecurity. Breakthroughs in social science, political science, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience demonstrate that our focus should be on establishing trustful relationships rather than a direct reliance on structural interventions such as identity management, attack surface management, and zero trust practices. The pathways that enable biological entities to come to trust and successfully collaborate with each other are known to science. In this presentation, Global Head of Research Mike Neuenschwander will delve into what changes are coming to the security market in order to achieve such levels of trust online.&nbsp; The presentation will provide a market roadmap for vendors, enterprises, governments, and standards organizations alike to create a security model that is highly collaborative and ultimately highly trustworthy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23"></a>

  <p>The best CISO’s are never surprised! But now that SaaS apps like Salesforce, ServiceNow, or M365 have become mission-critical for organisations and process sensitive data, it's getting harder to keep track of the security metrics. CISO’s tell us they are flying blind and hope for the best. You shouldn't have to simply trust your app teams or run periodic third-party assessments to stay on top of how your SaaS is configured. What if you could define the security guardrails, which identities have access to which data, continuously monitor for drift, and be automatically alerted when a metric needs your attention? Nothing falls through the cracks. No more hope for the best, spreadsheets, and surprises.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-saas-revolution-cre23"></a>

  <p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply from 17 January 2025, aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of entities across the EU financial sector and to further harmonise key digital operational resilience requirements for all EU financial entities. DORA sets out uniform requirements for the security of network and information systems of companies and organisations operating in the financial sector as well as critical third parties which provide ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) services to them, such as cloud computing or data analytics services. DORA creates a regulatory framework on digital operational resilience, whereby all financial entities need to make sure they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. These requirements are homogenous across the EU, with the core aim to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. DORA is complemented with several “regulatory technical standards (‘RTS’)” which give more details on requirements for cyber security.</p>
<p>As the whole DORA legislation cannot be presented in a short timeframe, I will focus on the part that is most important to ensure cybersecurity and the part that is the most interesting one for the audience, the RTS on ICT Risk Management Framework. I will give a quick overview and highlight the topics, which will bring the most workload to the industry. The biggest challenges will be in the areas of Asset Management, Operations Security, Network Security and Encryption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/what-are-the-main-challenges-cre23"></a>

  <p>How can I effectively address cybersecurity vulnerabilities within my organization? Also, what are the implications of the Cyberresilience Act for this? EDITH, the European Digital Innovation Hub for Hesse, has extended an invitation to Dr. Steven Arzt, a cybersecurity expert from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, for a #DigiTalk session discussing best practices for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.</p>
<p>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is the process with which ethical hackers report vulnerabilities in software and systems to manufacturers and system operators. Researchers commonly often assess the security status of a system or product independently, i.e., without a formal invitation, contract or integration into a company’s strategy. While these unasked-for vulnerability reports are still considered an insult by some companies, others openly embrace their value for strengthening the company’s IT security by interacting with the hacking and research communities. In his talk, Dr. Arzt shows how a proper CVD process can greatly benefit companies and the wider IT security community at the same time. It is shown how CVD can not only help identify and fix vulnerabilities, but also send a strong positive message about a company’s attitude towards IT security.</p>

<p>If identity verification is to emulate the convenience of digital payments, the wallets we use need to offer more functionality than just the ability to accept, hold, and present a verifiable credential, they need to have the tools to fully manage your digital identity and data sharing.</p>
<p>The first additional feature to look for in a digital identity wallet is process management. Sometimes the process for being issued with a verifiable credential is simple: you fill out a few forms from the issuing party, which are confirmed by the issuing party, and then you are issued with a credential. For example, when applying for a mobile driver’s license there are several attribute fields to fill out, such as name, height, weight, eye color, etc. These allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you are the correct person to issue the license to.</p>
<p>But what if the DMV decides it needs more information? Does the wallet notify you? Does the DMV have a procedure in place to notify you? Often services like this simply don’t have the time or processes in place to inform you of the need for more information, and the onus is on you to follow up. By having process management built into the wallet it would be able to easily notify you that the process is stalled and explain why.</p>
<p>The second feature to look for is the ability to act as a verifier and be able to read credentials. Every identity wallet by default is designed to hold credentials and create presentations of the information they contain; this allows you to share your mobile driver’s license or a proof of your age. But before you share this information, it would be ideal to be able to verify for yourself who you’re sharing this information with. For example, if you were pulled over by someone dressed as a police officer, this functionality could confirm that they actually are a police officer, and even provide you with important information such as their jurisdiction, name, and badge number. Similarly, this function would also allow two people to simply verify each other, for example when meeting someone for the first time: if a person comes to your door claiming to be from the gas company you could verify their credentials before letting them in to your house, and they could verify that you are the correct customer they are supposed to be helping, providing an additional layer of security and confidence.</p>
<p>The third feature we recommend is the ability to offer mutually authenticated two-way messaging. This allows you to cryptographically validate the identity of who you are interacting with (and they, you), and is a powerful way to deter fraud. (To learn more about how this works, <a href="https://indicio.tech/secure-two-way-communication-is-decentralized-identitys-secret-sauce-to-stopping-financial-scams/">read our recent article.</a>)</p>
<p>But besides stopping fraud, this feature also changes the way businesses and individuals can interact: instead of getting a letter or email from your bank, it can ping you to ask questions or start a conversation. Unlike email, this is a direct, encrypted communication that you know is coming from your bank. You can also easily sever this connection, and while you probably don’t want to do this with your bank, you may want to remove the ability for other parties to contact you.</p>
<p>In sum, we see identity wallets as building the foundation for digital relationships and these features provide powerful ways to build trusted digital relationships that are more richly interactive.</p>

<p>Passwords, while integral to security measures, can pose significant threats due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Weak or reused passwords, susceptibility to phishing and brute-force attacks, and potential insider threats all make passwords a weak link in your security posture.</p>
<p>Although ubiquitous and seemingly secure, passwords can pose a significant threat to organizations for various reasons. Common issues include the use of weak or easily guessable passwords and password reuse across multiple accounts, making it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, the prevalence of phishing scams and brute-force attacks means that even the most careful users can become victims. Lastly, the risk of insider threats, where employees with compromised credentials can exploit their access, is an ever-present concern.</p>
<p>To effectively counter these risks, organizations need to look beyond passwords and embrace robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing MFA introduces an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors. It not only validates user identities using their passwords but also involves a second form of verification like a one-time code sent to the user’s mobile device. However, while MFA provides additional security over passwords, it is still susceptible to MFA bypass attacks such as SIM swap, MFA prompt bombing, and more.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations must explore comprehensive security solutions beyond just passwords and traditional MFA and look to phishing-resistant MFA such as certificate-based authentication.</p>
 The Entrust Solution 
<p>Entrust Desktop Credential Provider for Microsoft Windows, which provides robust passwordless and multi-factor authentication for Windows desktop login, is one such solution. It integrates with Entrust Identity Enterprise (IdE) and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), allowing comprehensive user authentication and management. Entrust Desktop responds to various use cases like workstation login, password change, and unlock, thereby enhancing security and providing better access controls.</p>
<p>Using MFA with Entrust Desktop Credential Provider increases organizational security, provides better control over system access, offers various choices to meet specific security needs, and helps meet regulatory requirements.</p>
 MFA Methods Supported by Entrust Desktop: 
 
 Passwordless Authentication: This method eliminates the need for users to remember and input a password for subsequent logins after their initial setup. Instead of the traditional password-based approach, it relies solely on Entrust’s second-factor authentication mechanisms. This not only simplifies the user’s experience but also offers a secure way to verify their identity, given the robustness of the second-factor authentication techniques involved. 
 OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication: A unique, time-sensitive password is dispatched to the user’s registered contact details – either their email address or phone number. Since the PIN is valid for only a short duration and can’t be used more than once, it reduces the chances of unauthorized access. 
 Token Authentication: Here, users authenticate themselves using secure tokens, which can be either hardware devices or software-based. These tokens can originate from Entrust or other reputable vendors in the cybersecurity realm. Entrust provides support for two main types of tokens:
 
 Response-Only Tokens: Provide authentication through a simple response mechanism 
 Challenge-response Tokens: Engage users in an interactive authentication process, where the system sends a challenge and awaits a correct response 
 
 
 
 
 Mobile Soft Token Authentication: In this approach, users receive an out-of-band authentication challenge directly on their mobile devices. These challenges can range from simple prompts to more interactive mechanisms, making the process both user-friendly and secure. 
 Grid Authentication: A unique method that presents users with a grid filled with an assortment of characters organized in rows and columns. During the login process, users are asked to provide specific characters from predetermined coordinates on the grid. Given its unconventional nature, this method offers an extra layer of security against automated bot attacks. 
 Knowledge-Based Q&amp;A Authentication: Here, users respond to a set of personalized questions either online or offline. These questions are typically formulated during the user’s initial setup and are based on information only the user is likely to know. The Q&amp;A mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the Entrust Identity Enterprise platform, specifically via the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Server (or the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Module) or the Identity as a Service platform. This method combines the security of knowledge-based tests with the convenience of user-defined answers. 
 Mobile Smart Credentials Authentication (Certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity): This is an advanced out-of-band authentication strategy. Users receive a challenge on their mobile devices, which is then signed by the Entrust Mobile Smart Credential app upon verification of the user through biometrics or a unique PIN. Once signed, the challenge is verified by the Entrust Identity Enterprise or the Identity as a Service platforms. 
 
<p>While Entrust supports multiple MFA authentication mechanisms, we highly recommend using a phishing-resistant authentication mechanism with passwordless certificate-based authentication via our mobile smart credential application.</p>

   A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges 

<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>

<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>

<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>

<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>

<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>

 About the study 

<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>

 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 

<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>

<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>

<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.<a>1</a></p>

 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 

<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>

<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>

 What benefits await? 

<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>

<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>

 How can you move forward?

<p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases for us than simply proving our capability to operate a vehicle–many people use their driver’s license as their primary form of identification. As we shift to a digital-first world, people will need credentials to represent all facets of their identity digitally in a secure way. Whether it be proving identity to apply for a loan or purchasing a controlled substance online, it’s becoming increasingly important and necessary for entities to offer people the option to present a digitally issued ID document remotely.</p><p>This means that it is critical to build mobile driver’s license (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats, so verifiers across different geographies and industries can use a consistent framework to confirm a person’s identity. To ensure the secure and interoperable use of these digital credentials, international standards are being developed and tested. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event, organized by SpruceID, was a significant milestone in this ongoing journey.</p><p>We’re delighted to have hosted a successful, fully-remote, and asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations. Read on to learn more about ISO/IEC 18013-7, a recap of the interoperability event, and how the results and findings are being used to drive the digital identity industry forward.</p> A Brief Introduction to ISO/IEC 18013-7 <p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 is the working group that defines standards for motor vehicle driver’s licenses and related documents, to provide a common technical framework and promote the safe and secure use of this technology. The 18013-5 standard specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 defines requirements for the security, data elements, and information exchange of mobile driving licenses (mDL) between the mobile device and authorized parties while upholding user data protection and safeguarding driver privacy.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 focuses on attended in-person use cases where parties are in close proximity during the presentation of a digitally issued ID document. After introducing the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 took another step forward by publishing a Committee Draft consultation of ISO/IEC 18013-7, a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p><p>The objective of our interoperability event was to provide a collaboration forum for implementers of ISO/IEC 18013-7 to come together and test their respective solutions to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standards.</p> Joining Forces for Testing <p>The Interoperability Event was hosted remotely, with an asynchronous testing window spanning three weeks. This allowed participants enough time to actively test and collaborate iteratively with other implementers to optimize their own implementations and use cases.</p><p>The event was open for all implementers of 18013-7 to participate without any restrictions regarding organization size or any particular working group membership. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, including both public and private sectors, across multiple geographies. Any observers interested in understanding the maturity and adoption of the draft standard were also welcome to join and listen in.</p><p>The participating mDL reader implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Credence ID, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Okta, OneProof, Panasonic, Ping Identity, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID, and Thales.</p><p>The participating mDL implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, NEC, OneProof, Panasonic, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID (jointly with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles), and Thales.</p><p>Testing participants were encouraged to test both Rest API and OpenID4VP implementations to inform recommendations for refining the clarity of the technical specification related to both protocols.</p> Results and Reflections <p>There were many takeaways and learnings from the test event that will ultimately help to inform both the standard and interoperability moving forward. Notably, the draft specifications were found to have no major issues necessitating normative changes. Most interoperability challenges were largely a result of updates to the draft documents in advance of the interoperability event, which some participants did not have sufficient time or resources to address. However, the successful resolution of these issues demonstrated a shared commitment to fostering interoperability and will help improve this documentation in the future.</p><p>Feedback from the event, along with preliminary aggregate, anonymized test results, and troubleshooting, was presented to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 WG10 in Singapore. The findings and resolutions were documented as N2349 in the ISO Global Directory. So far, these insights have been incorporated into the latest version of ISO/IEC 18013-7, submitted as N2356. N2356 is the first draft of a Technical Specification, which includes all the improvements and insights we've gathered during our test event to enhance the specification for better interoperability.</p><p>If you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into these findings, a comprehensive event results publication can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114730549750609434292&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">be found here</a>. </p> Onwards and Upwards for 18013-7 <p>We look forward to continuing to play a role in advancing the 18013-7 standard and other digital identity standards. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event was a testament to the collective effort to advance standards for mobile driver's licenses, and how much progress we can make together to eventually bring this standard to life for public use. The successful interoperability demonstrations of mobile driver’s licenses that can be presented and verified remotely over the internet will introduce a new class of use cases for verifiable digital identity and evolve the way we use mobile driver’s licenses today.</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. As digital identity technologies, such as mobile driver's licenses, become more pervasive and usable for online user experiences, it is important to be mindful of introducing privacy-preserving capabilities from their inception. To that end, we think carefully about technology mitigations for privacy risks and concerns raised by civil liberties organizations, such as "phoning home," in the mDL implementations that SpruceID works on. You can learn more in our <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>We’d like to thank all implementers for taking the time to participate in the test event. This event marked a crucial step towards creating a digital identification landscape that is secure, interoperable, and universally accessible. As we continue our journey towards fully realizing the potential of mDLs, collaborative, open events like these play a vital role in shaping the future of digital identification.</p>  📄  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Event Results Publication</a>   <p>About SpruceID: At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. </p>

 The Brazilian gambling industry is about to become regulated. IDnow investigates how the grey market currently works, and some of the dangers of using unregulated gambling platforms. 



 



<p>Brazil effectively banned gambling in 1946; a more-or-less all-encompassing restriction that remained largely in place until 2018, when sports betting was legalized. However, as virtually no regulation was ever implemented, Brazilian players and international gambling platforms have been operating in a somewhat grey area ever since. This is all due to change once Brazilian online gambling regulation is formally approved in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The limbo appears to work, at least on the face of it. And at least for international operators. Surprisingly, despite the lack of clear regulation, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back within the fold of the Brazilian economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the projected numbers are likely to be even larger when regulation finally passes, as there are vast swathes of the Brazilian would-be gambling community that are not currently gambling, despite wanting to.</p>



 To gamble or not to gamble? That is the Brazilian question. 



<p>In 2021, a survey on Brazilian attitudes toward gambling discovered that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-desafio-da-preven%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-lavagem-de-dinheiro-nos-jogos-odilon-dutra/?originalSubdomain=pt">39% of Brazilian participants said they didn’t gamble</a> because they felt uncertain of the safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over half of all potential players said they would feel more confident playing online if they had more information about the companies. This is understandable as many gambling operators are not very clear about who their owners are, or even the location of their headquarters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same survey, 51% of participants said they would like to see more player protection mechanisms put in place. Read more opinions from the Brazilian betting community in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">blog, ‘How does the Brazilian betting community really feel about upcoming regulations.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite operating in the grey, international gambling operators have achieved considerable visibility through advertising on television and the internet, and through sponsorship of Brazilian football clubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the wave of publicity and ensuing popularity <a href="https://mundorubronegro.com/apostas-brasil/casas-apostas-ilegais">has raised concerns</a> about the impact of gambling addiction, the growth of scams, and the threat of money laundering.</p>



 Wait, so is online gambling legal or illegal in Brazil? 



<p>The most obvious question that many have when they see adverts for online gambling platforms but find out online gambling is essentially illegal, is well, how does that work? The answer lies in <a href="https://seudireito.proteste.org.br/site-de-apostas-e-ilegal/">Law 13.756,</a> which allows operators to offer their services in Brazil if their headquarters are outside of Brazil and there are no physical points of sale. In practice, this law enables bookmakers to use websites, on the condition they are hosted internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these websites operate according to the rules of the countries in which they are based, such as Curaçao, the UK or Malta, they are not required to obey Brazilian laws, such as the Consumer Defence Code. This is all set to change when Brazilian regulations are formally passed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has meant that from 2018 until whenever the regulations finally come into force, international bookmakers have operated with a sort of impunity and without needing to implement fair gaming rules or player protection measures.</p>



 What do Brazilian players think about using unregulated gambling platforms? 



<p>The Brazilian gaming community is waking up to the realities of dealing with unregulated gambling operators. Common complaints made on social media and forums include users making deposits but being unable to withdraw them, and even stories of players who have had their accounts blocked following a good streak in sports betting or on online casinos. However, there is a growing awareness among the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">Brazilian betting community</a> that these kinds of scams are not representative of the entire gambling industry, but rather just unreliable websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upside to the online proliferation of so many negative stories has led to <a href="https://www.extraclasse.org.br/geral/2023/03/bicheiros-e-contraventores-investem-em-cassinos-on-line-e-apostas-esportivas/">increasing numbers of Brazilian gamblers</a> actively seeking information about the risk of less reliable, unregulated online gambling sites.</p>



 Arguments for and against KYC processes in Brazil. 



<p>While the vast majority of the Brazilian betting community seem to accept the value of undergoing a KYC process, there are <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/betano/casa-de-aposta-nao-quer-pagar-meu-saque-e-fica-pedindo-fotos-de-todos-o-tip_DSBUzJ1HW0713vYD/">some who have expressed privacy concerns</a> over some operators’ requirements for players to take and send photographs of themselves holding identity documents. Many also fear that when dealing with an international operator, if there was a problem associated with sending documents, for example a data breach, then they would not be able to rely on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/11txan7/%C3%A9_seguro_enviar_meus_documentos_para_uma_casa_de/">national legal protection measures</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A common complaint among international gambling operators is on the difficulty of performing the Brazilian KYC process due to the wide variety and disparity of identity documents in Brazil. For example, each state in Brazil offers slightly different ID cards, which have dates and document numbers in different places, for example. Difficulties <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/bc-game/verificacao-kyc_OcihHkmZ_wp6BSrb/">surrounding the KYC process</a> has affected some players’ ability to <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/188bet-apostas-esportivas-online/verificacao-de-identidade-kyc-prejuizo-de-u-75_Gp8gh8oJt_YPqbvA/">transact and make withdrawals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes the integration with the Cadastro de Pessoas Fiscias (CPF), a tax number that every Brazilian is issued with, all the more important for identity verification and KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian industry insiders say that the implementation of KYC measures to obtain a licence (Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Unpacking the complexities of the Brazilian gambling license structure’ here</a>) means more than just following a legal requirement, it will also <a href="https://g-mnews.com/pt/compliance-kyc-transparencia-que-gera-confiabilidade/">help operators prevent fraud</a>.</p>

This means, in effect, they create a synthetic jurisdiction that sits between nation states, resting on international treaties, The Mattereum model can be seen as a new form of network state itself, as well as a convenient legal tool to be used by other network states (or indeed any other individual or entity) for managing trade in physical goods. It could become a “pluggable” legal layer to support other network states, particularly the ones exporting physical goods. If a thing has a price tag, it can be part of this synthetic jurisdiction, irrespective of whether the object is land in Oregon, gold in a vault in Singapore or investment grade whisky in a barrel in Scotland, subject to the same law and the same guarantees. It is a state for physical objects, rather than a state for people, but arguably a state nonetheless. What makes it so is that it has the machinery to resolve legal disputes between people, under the rules that they opt into when they use Mattereum. It’s where your legal problems go to be resolved. Resolving trade disputes is one of the more critical aspects of a state, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><blockquote>The innovative Mattereum Asset Passport created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state&nbsp;future</blockquote><p>This is not new to us; while network states are gaining in prominence and importance as their potential becomes clear, Mattereum has been thinking about this kind of thing from the very start. Five years ago, in the early days of our company, I wrote a speculative document about this very thing with two of my colleagues from Mattereum. Until now it has not been published outside the organisation but given its new relevance I thought I would share it. The language does not perhaps use current terminology (e.g. for Free Economic Zones read network states, for smart property register, read MAPs), but I feel the ideas are possibly even more relevant now than they were&nbsp;then.</p> “Towards a Digital&nbsp;Hansa: <p>Past Precedents as Inspiration for a Global Confederation of Free Economic Zones By James Hester, Anton Shelupanov, and Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</p><p>As Free Economic Zones (FEZs) have emerged and developed, these unique commercial entities have gradually come to share more in common with each other than with the parent nation states in which they are located. It is only natural, then, that a desire would arise to unify their efforts towards common business goals, as for example in the Eurasian belt where the Digital Silk Road initiative seeks to facilitate interaction between FEZs in the region. Since formal unification would be geopolitically disruptive, the goal should be a strong but informal confederation capable of acting on the world stage at state-like levels and capable of facilitating commerce between members. As it happens, there exists a precedent for such a vast and formidable mercantile body in Europe’s past which could provide an inspiring model for how an equivalent organisation could be formed and governed&nbsp;today.</p><p>The Hanseatic League, also known as the Hansa (Middle Low German for ‘guild’), was a confederation of trading centres in the Holy Roman Empire which, founded in the 12th century, became the dominant mercantile power in Northern Europe for the next four centuries. Composed primarily of German towns and headquartered in Lübeck, member towns worked to ensure mutual protection of trade and the smooth conduct of commerce between them. They were never formally unified, being towns under the control of the Empire or neighbouring kingdoms including Sweden, Denmark, England, and Kievan Rus. Yet all members adhered to the bonds required of them in the Hanseatic charters, and heads of state learned quickly not to antagonise them lest they risk being cut out of trade (effectively an economic death sentence). They were governed by the consensus of their members, with regular meetings of representatives from each town to decide on pressing issues. They even levied troops and ships from members for mutual protection when necessary, meaning that they were capable of amassing a respectable military presence. So although not a state, they acted with near state-like power and were regarded as such by Europe’s&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>When we consider the degree of organisation which was achieved by the Hansa with the technology at their disposal, it is easy to see how a similar institution is not only possible today, but greatly enhanced and facilitated by our current technological innovations. Near-instant communication enables unprecedented efficiency in logistics coordination and maintaining relationships with clients and partners. Containerisation has revolutionised the transport of goods through standardisation and optimal use of space. And now, blockchain technology stands poised to automate elaborate and time-consuming administrative and legal procedures, reducing once exasperating but inevitable aspects of conducting business to previously unthinkable levels of ease and straightforwardness. Not only could we establish such an institution today and reap the resulting commercial benefits, we could do it better than our ancestors ever&nbsp;dreamed.</p><p>So what would an equivalent confederation of FEZs, our Digital Hansa, look like? A single strong economic centre (Lübeck) provided the foundation on which the original Hansa was built, with all members consenting to abide by the ‘Law of Lübeck’ in governing their activities. To avoid any one member becoming overly influential, member FEZs could jointly adopt a governance framework of a neutral body such as UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). They would also agree on a means of achieving consensus on policy and activities, and commit to abide by a single set of standards and regulations. These would apply appropriately across the confederation’s three tiers: individual companies operating in an FEZ, individual FEZs, and the combined global&nbsp;network.</p><p>Members would also pledge mutual aid to one another. This aid would take several forms. Parent states would negotiate the necessary economic concessions to enable member FEZs and their component companies to conduct business among themselves in the same manner worldwide. Members would speak with a collective voice in international forums such as the UN, and organise a communal legal defence and hardship funds to be drawn upon by any member in need. It is even possible, after delicate negotiations with each parent state, to organise some form of mutual defence pact whereby member states would contribute somehow to the protection of one another in times of necessity. A useful existing model is the single market and customs union established across members of the European Union. Just as these agreements remove economic barriers and facilitate trade with EU member states, a Digital Hansa would enable unhindered commerce between FEZs regardless of their location on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The blockchain applications developed by Mattereum are well placed to provide much of the necessary digital infrastructure for a global confederation of Free Economic Zones. The identities of member individuals and companies, the standards adhered to by all tiers of the organisation, and perhaps a complementary industry-standard accreditation such as a D-U-N-S Number, would be recorded on an immutable and accessible digital record. Consequently, external businesses engaging with members would be able to easily verify relevant details and proceed, safe in the knowledge that any company operating within a member FEZ operates under the same established regulations and practices.</p><p>The Smart Property Register operated by Mattereum would track and manage assets and resources across the confederation’s three tiers. No matter the asset’s location in the world, while in custody of a member, clients could rest assured that its storage and transport would be managed with an established standard of care. Tokenization of assets would also enable trade to be conducted without necessitating the transfer of physical goods from owner to&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Furthermore, since economic concessions from parent states would enable the transport of goods between member FEZs with reduced or eliminated tariffs and other expenses normally incurred while engaging in international trade, using member companies for transport and logistics would become particularly enticing.</p><p>For whatever governing framework member FEZs choose to jointly subscribe, Mattereum’s smart contracts could provide the means by which members commit to abide by them. This would prove especially useful in the resolution of disputes. Mattereum’s arbitration mechanisms would be in place both to resolve any claims or grievances that arise, and enable governing powers to enforce resolutions with all due authority and means. Streamlining such otherwise onerous processes will both reduce administrative and legal costs for all parties, as well as allay fears of time and resources wasted should a dispute&nbsp;arise.</p><p>The positive impacts would be considerable. Political benefits would be significant, as parent states which are not currently influential players on the world stage would gain influential partnerships in the wider international community. They would also have a greater voice in world affairs by virtue of the confederation’s collective actions. The economic benefits would be equally striking. Member companies would dramatically reduce administrative and legal costs, and would also see increased profits as clients are attracted to the reduction of costs and hassle which would come from working with members. Furthermore, the necessary digital infrastructure would already be in place within member FEZs, allowing businesses to plug into existing systems rather than building them from the ground up. Parent states would also reap commercial benefits through greater internal economic activity and increases in&nbsp;FDI.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest impact of a Digital Hansa would be the advent of a new commercial ecosystem. The confederation imagined here would create a new global standard of business conduct which would dramatically strengthen relationships between companies and clients. If a company is ‘Hansa’-backed, no matter its location or its jurisdiction, clients could know exactly what that means, and proceed with confidence. As the original Hansa ushered in a period of previously unprecedented commercial cooperation and prosperity for the Holy Roman Empire, a Digital Hansa stands ready to do the same for the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Over the last year or so, I have written pieces about how the innovation created by Mattereum, the <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> can help bring about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">limitless ecommerce</a>, how it can <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">help AI </a>revolutionise the way we do business, how it can enable not only a circular economy but the more efficient and realistic <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">spiral economy</a> as well as how it can transform the trade in real world assets through <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">tokenization and fractionalization</a>, and now I am talking network state. I sometimes feel we could be seen as just jumping on the latest bandwagon to catch the eye of VCs looking for the flavour of the month, but then I realise that we are just showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing.</p><blockquote>We are showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing</blockquote><p>Mattereum’s innovation is deep and profound; it took six years and several million pounds to get our system to work, it was not easy, and no one else has come close to achieving the same thing, but it is working, and has been live and serving customers for over two years&nbsp;now.</p><p>By creating a connection between a token on the blockchain and a physical thing in the real world that will stand up in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide we have made something that will provide the deep foundations for trade in the future. It really can make ecommerce faster and smoother by removing the majority of the barriers to high value transactions. The same thing makes it possible for AI to recognise that the digital twin of a physical object really does represent something in the real world and to enable the tracking of objects through their lives so they can be reused and recycled efficiently. In addition, by being able to facilitate the tokenization and fractionalization of physical assets with ownership firmly established, it does utterly change the way things like <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a> and<a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf"> gold</a> can be traded. So too, can it provide a way for network states to manage physical assets that enhances their function, and there will be other things it can revolutionise too, it’s just waiting for people to identify the potential.</p><blockquote>The MAP is deep infrastructure, like railway lines or HTML; it does the same thing, whatever the traffic you choose to run on it, and it has the potential to change the future just as&nbsp;much.</blockquote><p>If you are working on a project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="mailto:contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">The Network State and the Digital Hansa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, the world’s most popular open-source <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration platform</a>, is considered a major milestone in the history of cloud-native technologies. Developed internally at Google and released to the public in 2014, Kubernetes has enabled organizations to move away from traditional IT infrastructure and toward the automation of operational tasks tied to the deployment, scaling and managing of containerized applications (or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>). While Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container management, many companies also use the technology for a broader range of use cases.</p>



 Overview of Kubernetes 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">Containers</a>—lightweight units of software that package code and all its dependencies to run in any environment—form the foundation of Kubernetes and are mission-critical for modern microservices, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> software and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> workflows.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker">Docker</a> was the first <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a> software tool to popularize building, deploying and managing containerized applications. But Docker lacked an automated “orchestration” tool, which made it time-consuming and complex for data science teams to scale applications. Kubernetes, also referred to as K8s, was specifically created to address these challenges by automating the management of containerized applications.</p>



<p>In broad strokes, the Kubernetes orchestration platform runs via containers with <a href="https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/How+does+Kubernetes+create+a+PodF/1_9z271sfl">pods</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/bg/cpl?topic=process-concept-nodes">nodes</a>. A pod operates one or more Linux containers and can run in multiples for scaling and failure resistance. Nodes run the pods and are usually grouped in a Kubernetes cluster, abstracting the underlying physical hardware resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kubernetes’s declarative, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">API</a>-driven infrastructure has helped free up DevOps and other teams from manually driven processes so they can work more independently and efficiently to achieve their goals. In 2015, Google donated Kubernetes as a seed technology to the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation</a> (CNCF) (link resides outside ibm.com), the open-source, vendor-neutral hub of cloud-native computing.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-history/">Read about the history of Kubernetes </a>



<p>Today, Kubernetes is widely used in production to manage Docker and essentially any other type of container runtime. While Docker includes its own orchestration tool, called <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/docker-swarm-vs-kubernetes-a-comparison/">Docker Swarm</a>, most developers choose Kubernetes container orchestration instead.</p>



<p>As an open-source system, Kubernetes services are supported by all the leading public cloud providers, including IBM, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google. Kubernetes can also run on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/bare-metal-dedicated-servers">bare metal servers</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> in private cloud,&nbsp;hybrid cloud and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">edge</a> settings, provided the host OS is a version of Linux or Windows.</p>



 Six top Kubernetes use cases 



<p>Here’s a rundown of six top Kubernetes use cases that reveal how Kubernetes is transforming IT infrastructure.</p>



 1. Large-scale app deployment 



<p>Heavily trafficked websites and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> applications receive millions of user requests each day. A key advantage of using Kubernetes for large-scale cloud app deployment is autoscaling. This process allows applications to adjust to demand changes automatically, with speed, efficiency and minimal downtime. For instance, when demand fluctuates, Kubernetes enables applications to run continuously and respond to changes in web traffic patterns This helps maintain the right amount of workload resources, without over- or under-<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/provisioning">provisioning</a>.</p>



<p>Kubernetes employs <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/">horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) to carry out <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a> (as for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tivoli-monitoring/6.3.0.2?topic=usage-cpu">CPU</a> usage or custom&nbsp;metrics) by scaling the number of pod replicas (clones that facilitate self-healing) related to a specific deployment. This mitigates potential issues like traffic surges, hardware problems or network disruptions.</p>



<p>Note: HPA is not to be confused with Kubernetes vertical pod autoscaling (VPA), which assigns additional resources, such as memory or CPU, to the pods that are already running for the workload.</p>



 2. High-performance computing 



<p>Industries including government, science, finance and engineering rely heavily on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hpc">high-performance computing (HPC)</a>, the technology that processes big data to perform complex calculations. HPC uses powerful processors at extremely high speeds to make instantaneous data-driven decisions. Real-world uses of HPC&nbsp;include&nbsp;automating stock trading, weather prediction, DNA sequencing and aircraft flight simulation.</p>



<p>HPC-heavy industries use Kubernetes to manage the distribution of HPC calculations across hybrid and multicloud environments. Kubernetes can also serve as a flexible tool to support <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=types-batch-jobs">batch job</a> processing involved in high-performance computing workloads, which enhances data and code <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/txseries/8.2?topic=decisions-portability">portability</a>.</p>



 3. AI and machine learning 



<p>Building and deploying <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> systems requires huge volumes of data and complex processes like high-performance computing and big data analysis. Deploying machine learning on Kubernetes makes it easier for organizations to automate the management and scaling of ML lifecycles and reduces the need for manual intervention.</p>



<p>For example, the Kubernetes containerized orchestration platform can automate portions of AI and ML predictive maintenance workflows, including health checks and resource planning. And Kubernetes can scale ML workloads up or down to meet user demands, adjust resource usage and control costs.</p>



<p>Machine learning relies on large language models to perform high-level <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a> like text classification, sentiment analysis and machine translation, and Kubernetes helps speed the deployment of large language models to automate the NLP process. As more and more organizations turn to <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> capabilities, they are using Kubernetes to run and scale generative AI models, providing high availability and fault tolerance.</p>



<p>Overall, Kubernetes provides the flexibility, portability and scalability needed to train, test, schedule and deploy ML and generative AI models.</p>



 4. Microservices management 



<p>Microservices (or microservices architecture) offer a modern cloud-native&nbsp;architecture approach where each application is comprised of numerous loosely connected and independently deployable smaller components, or services. For instance, large retail e-commerce websites consist of many microservices. These typically include an order service, payment service, shipping service and customer service. Each service has its own <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rest-apis">REST API</a>, which the other services use to communicate with it.</p>



<p>Kubernetes was designed to handle the complexity involved to manage all the independent components running simultaneously within microservices architecture. For instance, Kubernetes’ built-in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.2?topic=availability-high">high availability</a> (HA) feature ensures continuous operations even in the event of failure. And the Kubernetes self-healing feature kicks in if a containerized app or an application component goes down. The self-healing feature can instantly redeploy the app or application component, matching the desired state, which helps to maintain uptime and reliability.</p>



 5. Hybrid and multicloud deployments 



<p>Kubernetes is built to be used anywhere, making it easier for organizations to migrate applications from on-premises to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a> environments. Kubernetes standardizes migration by providing software developers with built-in commands for effective app deployment. Kubernetes can also roll out changes to apps and scale them up and down depending on environment requirements.</p>



<p>Kubernetes offers portability across on-premises and cloud environments since it abstracts away infrastructure details from applications. This eliminates the need for platform-specific app dependencies and makes it easy to move applications between different cloud providers or data centers with minimal effort.</p>



 6. Enterprise DevOps 



<p>For enterprise DevOps teams, being able to update and deploy applications rapidly is critical for business success. Kubernetes provides teams with both software system development and maintenance to improve overall agility. And the Kubernetes API interface allows software developers and other DevOps stakeholders to easily view, access, deploy, update and optimize their container ecosystems.</p>



<p>CI/CD—which stands for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-integration">continuous integration (CI)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-delivery">continuous delivery (CD)</a>—has become a key aspect of software development. In DevOps, CI/CD streamlines application coding, testing and deployment by giving teams a single repository for storing work and automation tools to consistently combine and test the code and ensure it works. Kubernetes plays an important role in cloud-native CI/CD pipelines by automating container deployment across cloud infrastructure environments and ensuring efficient use of resources.</p>



 The future of Kubernetes 



<p>Kubernetes plays a critical IT infrastructure role, as can be seen in its many value-driven use cases that go beyond container orchestration. This is why so many businesses continue to implement Kubernetes. In a 2021 <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2022/02/10/cncf-sees-record-kubernetes-and-container-adoption-in-2021-cloud-native-survey/">Cloud Native Survey</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) conducted by the CNCF, Kubernetes usage is shown to have reached its highest point ever, with 96% of organizations using or evaluating the containerized platform. According to the same study, Kubernetes usage continues to rise in emerging technology regions, such as Africa, where 73% of survey respondents are using Kubernetes in production.</p>



 IBM and Kubernetes 



<p>Kubernetes schedules and automates tasks integral to managing container-based architectures, spanning container deployment, updates, service discovery, storage provisioning,&nbsp;load balancing, health monitoring and more. At IBM we are helping clients modernize their applications and optimize their IT infrastructure with Kubernetes and other cloud-native solutions.</p>

<p>Data monetization is a business capability where an organization can create and realize value from data and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>&nbsp;(AI) assets. A value exchange system built on data products can drive business growth for your organization and gain competitive advantage. This growth could be internal cost effectiveness, stronger risk compliance, increasing the economic value of a partner ecosystem, or through new revenue streams. Advanced data management software and generative AI can accelerate the creation of a platform capability for scalable delivery of enterprise ready data and AI products.</p>



 Why data monetization matters 



<p>According to <a href="https://hbr.org/2022/07/a-better-way-to-put-your-data-to-work">McKinsey in the Harvard Business Review</a>, a single data product at a national US bank feeds 60 use cases in business applications, which eliminated $40M in losses and generates $60M incremental revenue annually. In the public sector, <a href="https://content.tfl.gov.uk/deloitte-report-tfl-open-data.pdf">Transport for London</a> provides free and open data across 80 data feeds powering over 600 apps and contribute up to £130m to London’s economy.</p>



<p><a href="https://cisr.mit.edu/publication/2023_0801_DataMonetization_WixomBeathOwens">Data monetization is not narrowly “selling data sets</a>;” it is about improving work and enhancing business performance by better-using data. Internal data monetization initiatives measure improvement in process design, task guidance and optimization of data used in the organization’s product or service offerings. External monetization opportunities enable different types of data in different formats to be information assets that can be sold or have their value recorded when used.</p>



<p>Creating value from data involves taking some action on the data. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-monetization">Realizing that value is the activity that ensures there is an economic benefit from the created value that contributes to the organization’s bottom line</a>.</p>



 Data monetization strategy: Managing data as a product 



<p>Every organization has the potential to monetize their data; for many organizations, it is an untapped resource for new capabilities. <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=IDC_P31301">Data-as-a-Service and data marketplaces are well established</a> to create data value from initiatives built on data analytics, big data and business intelligence. But few organizations have made the strategic shift to managing “data as a product.” This <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-management">data management</a> means applying product development practices to data. High performing, data-driven organizations have created new business models, utility partnerships and enhanced existing offerings from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025">data monetization that contributes more than 20% to the company’s profitability</a>.</p>



<p>The key play is to treat data as a strategic asset with a user-centric product approach where this new product can be consumed by a diverse set of applications. Organizations build trust in their data and AI by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/dont-pause-ai-development-prioritize-ethics-instead/">demonstrating transparency and ethics</a>, recognizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/data-privacy">data privacy</a>, adhering to regulations, and keeping data safe and secure.</p>



 Data products and data mesh 



<p>Data products are assembled data from sources that can serve a set of functional needs that can be packaged into a consumable unit. Each data product has its own lifecycle environment where its data and AI assets are managed in their product-specific <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-lakehouse">data lakehouse</a>. Flexibility in data collection is made possible when product lakehouses connect to and ingest data from many sources, using many different technology protocols. Additionally, by managing the data product as an isolated unit it can have location flexibility and portability — private or public cloud — depending on the established sensitivity and privacy controls for the data. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">IBM watsonx.data</a> offers connectivity flexibility and hosting of data product lakehouses built on Red Hat OpenShift for an open hybrid cloud deployment.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">Get started with watsonx.data </a>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-mesh">Data mesh</a> architectures have now emerged as the cost-effective way to serve data products to a variety of endpoint types, with detailed and robust usage tracking, risk and compliance measurements, and security. One or more data products are served over the mesh and consumed by an end-user application as an auditable transaction.</p>



<p>For example, a financial markets business might offer one product giving a real-time market data feed and another offering finance-related news. A consumer might build a decision-making application leveraging both of those products and offer trading options based on price and political or environmental news.</p>



 Building a solution capability for data management 



<p>Developing a capability depends on the ability to “connect the dots” for your stakeholders. It is a supply chain from your raw data sources to the transparent and traceable exchange of value when a data asset is consumed in an end-user experience.</p>



<p>You can do this by developing a solution framework for data monetization that incorporates:</p>



 
 Lifecycle processes 



 Technology components 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-integration">Continuous integration</a> (CI), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-delivery">continuous delivery</a> (CD) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/continuous-deployment">continuous deployment</a> automation 



 Platform service models 
 



 Three stages of the data monetization lifecycle process: 



 
 Create: Raw data is accessed and assembled into data products. 



 Serve: Data products are discoverable and consumed as services, typically via a platform. 



 Realize: Each data service has an agreed unit of value which is transacted and measured. 
 



Figure 1: The Data Monetization Lifecycle



<p>The raw data that fuels data monetization will come from three source categories: enterprise systems, external data and personal data. Data products are assembled from operational and analytical views of company and customer data which can be combined with public data sets (not necessarily free). Personal data is an important view across enterprise and public data that needs to be managed correctly by an organization. When a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten">“right to be forgotten” request</a> is invoked it spans from the raw data source to the data product target.</p>



<p>Data products come in many forms including datasets, programs and AI models. They are packaged and deployed for consumption as a service, and there can be multiple service types for any one product. Popular service consumption types include download, API and streaming.</p>



<p>Take the example of a client who integrated a set of disparate company ESG data into a new dataset. Their data services were a full dataset download plus an API wrap around the data, which could be queried for ESG data based on a company ticker symbol.</p>



<p>Data monetization is about realizing value from data. The consumer of data product services needs the ability to find and assess a product, pay for it and then invoke one or more of the service endpoints to consume it. Depending on the user’s business model they may be consuming that service for their own use in their capabilities, or under appropriate license terms to create a downstream product or customer experience using the data product for their own revenue stream.</p>



Figure 2: The Data Monetization Value Chain



 Achieve scale with a platform approach 



<p>A user’s options for consumption vary. The traditional approach may have been for the data product supplier to distribute its large one-size-fits-all datasets direct to clients or into multiple data marketplaces. For APIs, they may have built them into the catalog ecosystems of each hyperscaler cloud catalog. For AI models and associated datasets, they could look to utilize a marketplace like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>. These consumption provisions now start to become a complex, federated and less cost-effective way of maximizing profit from transaction and subscription revenues.</p>



<p>With the data monetization solution framework, the maximized return on value can come from a data product provider becoming a data SaaS business. The framework defines a reference architecture that integrates a set of technologies and products including IBM Data and AI products.</p>



Figure 3: Implementing the Solution Stack with IBM Data and AI



<p>Implementation across the full lifecycle covers:</p>



 
 Create: Ingest source data sets and feeds and transform these into data product assets using hybrid cloud lakehouse technology with integrated data science and AI development environments. 



 Serve: Build cloud services for data products through automation and platform service technology so they can be operated securely at global scale. 



 Realize: Instrument the data product services to enable adherence to risk and compliance controls with event and metrics data integrated to financial management. 
 



<p>A further extension on this SaaS capability is where the data product provider also offers a multi-tenant, multi-user creator environment. Multiple parties collaborate in their own development spaces, consuming the data product services on the platform in their offerings and then hosting for consumption by their customers.</p>



 Enterprise artificial intelligence 



<p>Many organizations have built mature software systems with machine learning and deep learning functions to power their business processes and customer offerings. Generative AI has only served to accelerate the options for data product design, lifecycle delivery and operational management.</p>



<p>Platform builders and operators can use AI models to build tools. Creators can use those tools to discover or learn about data in enterprise systems and public domain. Code generation “co-pilot” tools (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-code-assistant">watsonx Code Assistant</a>) build and maintain automations and create natural language driven experiences for operations or customer service. These add to established practices of using AIOps and advanced analytics around finance and risk functions.</p>



<p>Data product owners and service owners can innovate with Generative AI tools. They can augment data set assembly with generated synthetic data and create new analyses of data sources, which in turn can eliminate outliers and anomalies. Doing so can increase the quality of data integrated into data products. It can be used to develop data product specific classification and knowledge bases of data sets, as well as build organization and domain specific AI models to offer as products.</p>



<p>Enterprise Generative AI is beginning to orient itself around what are the right type of models and training approaches. More importantly they are looking at the trust and transparency of the datasets these models are trained on, plus the legal indemnification position when using them.</p>



<p>Data product owners that are building or integrating such models must consider trust and transparency when designing the value exchange. By utilising watsonx.ai, an organization’s data monetization roadmap can take advantage of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/building-ai-for-business-ibms-granite-foundation-models/">models such as IBM Granite</a> to be assured of its transparency and indemnification.</p>



 Accelerating data monetization 



<p>The foundational products that can be used to build the platform are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak for Data</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak for Integration</a>. Their components enable development of data products and services for end user consumption at production scale. watsonx.data adds data product lakehouse abilities and watsonx.ai adds advanced generative AI model development.</p>



<p>A cohesive data monetization service experience can be built with these products and pre-designed automation workflows. Built to run on Red Hat OpenShift this gives the advantage of a scalable platform that can be built once, deployed across multiple private on-premises and public cloud infrastructures, and run as a consistent single service.</p>



<p>Using this IBM solution framework organizations can shift to using data as a strategic asset and inject innovation into the business model through enterprise AI technology.</p>

			<p>14th November, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Today holds dual significance: not only does it mark the launch of <a href="https://www.artsgain.com/en/">Artsgain</a>‘s groundbreaking tokenized blue-chip art fund, but it’s also the birth anniversary of the legendary artist, Claude Monet. </p>
<p>A trailblazer, Monet forever changed the way we perceive art. In the same pioneering spirit, Artsgain’s tokenized fund will introduce unprecedented liquidity avenues for art investors, echoing Monet’s revolutionary essence in today’s financial world.</p>
<p>Artsgain, a Barcelona-based VC firm specializing in high-quality blue-chip investment funds featuring art, antiques, and collectibles from globally renowned artists, is excited to partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading enterprise-tokenization platform, to make their vision of increasing liquidity for these one-of-a-kind assets a reality.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, art has been an exclusive asset class which can be attributed to its limited access and significant initial capital requirements, making it challenging for many to participate and even more frustrating knowing that the art market has been consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>In fact, since the year 2000, the art market, categorized by blue-chip artists’ performance, has statistically proven a higher return than popular indices like the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 by a multiple of 3x proving to be a great diversification strategy.</p>
<p>Artsgain is on a mission to transform the art market by offering tokenized shares, in order to improve liquidity and create a secondary market for its tokenized art securities. Their collaboration with Tokeny aims to simplify the investment process, guiding investors seamlessly into the world of blue-chip art.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating the open-source permissioned token standard ERC3643 via Tokeny’s platform, Artsgain not only assures regulatory compliance within the EU securities regulation framework under MiFID, but also fosters enhanced liquidity for art assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization allows for easier trading and transferability of art-related tokens, leading to improved liquidity in the market. The innovation offers new opportunities for shares in the art fund while maintaining compliance standards at the smart contract level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Artsgain emphasizes the ESG components of its operations: from transporting to managing artworks in a sustainable way, dedicated 0.3% of the funds to NGOs for disabled artists, and positive screening for women artists.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to support Artsgain in the world of art investing with our cutting-edge software. Art, like technology, is an ever-evolving canvas of innovation and creativity. Our tokenization solution will empower them to navigate this intricate masterpiece, providing the tools they need to blend the brushstrokes of finance with the vibrant palette of the art world, creating a masterpiece of investment success.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Our intent is clear: we aim to be inclusive and environmentally conscious while providing unparalleled investment opportunities. The world of art has for too long been an enclave for a select few. By leveraging technology and our deep expertise in art, we are democratizing access, ensuring more people can appreciate, invest in, and benefit from these incredible assets.  Xavier OlivellaCEO of Artsgain

<p></p><p>"What can you actually build with Web5?" This is one of the most common questions I've heard as I enter my two-month mark at TBD. It's one thing to discuss the theoretical aspects of Web5, with its focus on decentralization and user empowerment, but it's another to see tangible, innovative applications come to life. This is why builders, visionaries, and project maintainers at TBD are excited to showcase <a href="https://www.netonomy.io/">Netonomy</a>, a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5</a> project built by <a href="https://github.com/demattosanthony">Anthony Dimatteo</a>.</p> What is Netonomy?<a title="Direct link to What is Netonomy?">​</a> <p>Anthony describes Netonomy as "an application that allows users and organizations to own their digital identities, data, and finances." The goal is to give users a digital home for their identity, data, and assistants - all under their control and not dependent on centralized platforms. Netonomy leverages Web5 concepts for data management and storage, but it also incorporates artificial intelligence through vector databases. </p><p>Here's how it works from a user perspective: a user can upload any document, from developer documentation to rental insurance information. Then, the user asks an AI-powered chat assistant questions about details within the document, such as "When does my rental insurance expire?" Subsequently, the chat assistant would quickly search the document and respond to the user.</p> Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?<a title="Direct link to Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?">​</a> <p>Anthony used the following Web5 technologies to build Netonomy:</p>  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - The app generates a DID to identify you when you first launch it. This is stored in the browser and acts as your identity.  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a> - A DWN is created in the browser to store your data encrypted securely. Anthony uses it to store uploaded files.   Future plans<a title="Direct link to Future plans">​</a> <p>There are many cool features Anthony wants to explore next, including:</p>  Decentralized vector databases - When you upload files like PDFs, the content is extracted and indexed in a vector database. Vectors allow data developers to embed data for meaning and quickly queried. The vector database is centralized, for now, hosted by Anthony. But he wants to eventually decentralize it by storing vectors directly in the DWN   Data sharing - Via protocols to share files with other DID owners  Payments - Integrate Bitcoin and blockchain payments  Contacts directory - Manage contacts via DIDs  Messages - Decentralized messaging between DWNs  Mobile app - Bundle DWN in a mobile app for access across devices   Check it out!<a title="Direct link to Check it out!">​</a> <p>To accelerate development, Anthony plans to open-source the project and invite community contributions. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/Netonomy/netonomy">Netonomy on GitHub</a>. </p> Rewatch the full episode<a title="Direct link to Rewatch the full episode">​</a> <p>Learn more about what he's building and watch the full live stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ9Vq_Moa8I">here</a>.</p>

<p>The talk will identify 13 emerging non-technical information risk trends, ranging from human hallucination and cognitive narcissism to institutional paradigm collapse and perimeter fetishism to Capitalist power overreach (and several others) that are having current, real-world security impacts, but which remain unaddressed in cybersecurity strategies and deployments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solutions will be suggested and explored across business, operating, legal, technical, social, political, economic, biological and even evolutionary pathways, offering a toolkit of options that attendees can immediately apply in their organizations’ security program.&nbsp;Specific strategies for managing, de-risking and leveraging near and long-term personal and professional interactions in this steep part of the curve of exponential change will be suggested.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/revealing-hidden-dimensions-cre23"></a>

<p>In today’s hyper-competitive digital landscape, the rapid development of new digital services is essential for staying ahead of the curve. However, many organizations face significant challenges when it comes to integrating their core systems, including Mainframe applications, with modern technologies. This integration is crucial for modernizing core enterprise applications on hybrid cloud platforms. Shockingly, a staggering 33% of developers lack the necessary skills or resources, hindering their productivity in delivering products and services. Moreover, 36% of developers struggle with the collaboration between development and IT Operations, leading to inefficiencies in the development pipeline. To compound these issues, repeated surveys highlight “testing” as the primary area causing delays in project timelines. Companies like State Farm and BNP Paribas are taking steps to standardize development tools and approaches across their platforms to overcome these challenges and drive transformation in their business processes.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/solid-state-drives">solid-state drives (SSDs)</a> have become the top choice for many compute environments because of their better read/write speeds and lack of moving parts when compared to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hard-disk-drive-vs-solid-state-drive/">hard disk drives (HDDs)</a>. However, with many options to choose from, finding the right fit for your needs can be challenging.</p>



<p>In this post, we’re going to look at one of the most widely used types of SSD, the M.2, and the most popular (and fastest) protocol available for connecting SSDs to motherboards, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/nvme">non-volatile memory express (NVMe)</a>.</p>



<p>While the terms M.2 and NVMe are often used interchangeably, they actually refer to different technologies that can be used together or separately. Simply put:</p>



 
 NVMe is a storage and transfer protocol specifically designed for high-performance, non-volatile storage media. 



 M.2 is an SSD form factor that enables high-performance storage. 
 



<p>M.2 SSDs connected using the NVMe interface deliver some of the fastest data transfer speeds available.</p>



 What is a solid-state drive (SSD)? 



<p>SSDs are a type of semiconductor-based storage device that relies on flash memory to store data in a computer. Unlike magnetic storage—such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy drives that store data using magnets—SSDs use NAND technology, a type of non-volatile storage that doesn’t require power to maintain its data. In an SSD, each memory chip is constructed of blocks containing memory cells (also known as pages or sectors) that each have bits of memory. Whereas hard drives have inherent latency and access time because of platters and the movement of read/write heads, SSDs have no moving parts, making them much faster.</p>



 What is NVMe? 



<p>NVMe (non-volatile memory express) is a protocol for data transfer with reduced system overheads per input/output per second (I/O, or IOPS) that is used in SSDs and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/flash-storage">flash storage</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49243923">2023 International Data Corporation (IDC) report</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), NVMe was designed to speed data transfer to systems connected via a PCI express, a serial expansion bus that’s standard for connecting a computer to one or more peripheral devices. Unlike its predecessor, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), NVMe was built for high-performance, non-volatile storage media, making it an excellent choice for both consumer and enterprise workloads.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/nvme-vs-sata">For a full comparison of NVMe and SATA, read “NVMe vs. SATA: What’s the difference?”</a>



<p>NVMe can be used at the enterprise level with a smaller infrastructure footprint and using less power than the popular Small Computer System Interface (SCSI). NVMe SSDs can deliver better response times than HDDs because of improvements to their drivers, allowing for parallelism and polling and helping reduce latency to avoid CPU bottlenecks.</p>



<p>In 2011, NVMe storage technology was introduced as an alternative to SATA and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) protocols, which had been the industry standard for several years. In addition to improvements in storage and technology over its predecessors, NVMe contributed to the development of important technologies that were being developed at the same time, including the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus 



<p>One of the most important differentiators of NVMe SSDs is the way it accesses flash storage. By using a Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus, it removes the “middleman” controller, greatly reducing latency. However, NVMe’s can also run on any type of “fabric” interconnect—such as Fibre Channel and Ethernet—and within Ethernet, iWarp, RoCEv2, iSER and NVMe-TCP.</p>



<p>PCIe Gen4 is the latest PCI Express specification, and its data transfer rate is double Gen3’s. While Gen3 PCIe’s have a transfer rate of 8 giga transfers per second, (GT/s) per PCIe lane, Gen4’s rate is 16 GT/s, or two GB/s per PCIe lane.</p>



 Parallel command queues 



<p>Unlike drives using SCSI protocol, which can only deploy a single command queue, NVMe SSDs can run tens of thousands of parallel command queues at once. With NVMe SSDs, the connection method is independent of the protocol. For example, NVMe PCIe connectors can access a single drive via a PCIe link running the NVMe protocol.</p>



 What is an M.2 SSD? 



<p>M.2 drives (or Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF) drives) are a kind of SSD that connects to a computer’s motherboard via an M.2 interface. M.2 drives are extremely power efficient compared to other kinds of SSDs and take up less space. Additionally, they don’t require cables of any kind to connect, and they are both smaller and faster than the widely used, 2.5-inch SSDs.</p>



<p>Despite their relatively small size, M.2 drives still hold just as much data as their peers (up to 8 terabytes, or TBs) and typically run faster. They’re easy to install and compatible with any motherboard that has an M.2 slot. Even if your motherboard doesn’t have an M.2 port, an M.2 drive can still be connected using an adapter card that fits a PCIe slot.</p>



 SATA M.2 SSDs 



<p>SATA drives are becoming an increasingly popular form factor due to their compatibility with older technologies. While NVMe SSDs still have more bandwidth, many older computers don’t support either NVMe or PCIe technology, making an M.2 SATA interface the best option.</p>



<p>SATA SSDs can achieve a maximum data transfer speed of 6 gigabytes per second (Gbps), which is slower than other, newer interfaces. Strictly in terms of performance, SATA M.2 is the lowest-grade type of SSD on the market. But the technology is still considerably faster than an HDD, with three or even four times the bandwidth. Additionally, SATA M.2 SSDs are more affordable than NVME SSDs, and for motherboards that don’t have room for a 2.5-inch drive, SATA M.2 is a great alternative.</p>



 M.2 NVMe SSDs 



<p>NVMe technology is characterized by high bandwidth and fast data transfer speeds. Top-performing NVMe drives exceed 3,000 megabytes per second (MB/s), and some of the newer models can reach up to 7,500 MB/s. NVMe M.2 SSDs provide the fastest data transfer speeds on the market, by far. Another attractive feature of NVMe technology is right there in its name: Non-volatile memory. This specification means that power is not required for an NVMe device to retain its data.</p>



<p>Unlike other technologies, NVMe M.2 SSDs connect directly to a computer’s CPU using a PCIe socket. This feature enables the drive’s flash memory to function through PCIe as opposed to a SATA driver operating at a considerably slower speed. Through the PCIe bus, an NVMe M.2 SSD drive can achieve a transfer speed of a whopping 20 Gbps, more than three times that of a SATA M.2.</p>



 Which kind of SSD is right for you? 



<p>Users who are new to these technologies may find themselves asking which is better—NVMe or M.2?The reality is that there really is no comparison. They’re different technologies and you don’t need to choose between them because you can have both. When choosing a storage drive, an NVMe M.2 SSD is one of the fastest and easy-to-install drives available.</p>



<p>However, there are many factors to consider besides speed and performance when purchasing a drive. To streamline the process, we’ve compared the most popular technologies using four critical factors: Price, technical specifications, storage capacity and speed.</p>



 
 Price: Until recently, SATA M.2 SSDs were comparably cheaper than NVMe M.2s, making them an attractive option for budget-minded users. However, with the price of NVMe M.2s dropping every year, price isn’t as important a factor as it used to be. As of the writing of this article, a Samsung NVMe and a Samsung SATA M.2 SSD with storage capacities of either one or two TB ranged from between USD 64 and 130 on Amazon. 



 Technical specs: This is where the difference between the two technologies really begins to stand out. Some older devices simply won’t support NVMe technology, making a SATA M.2 the best choice. Also, before purchasing an NVMe drive, users will want to check the compatibility of their system and make sure it has enough PCIe connections to support multiple devices. 



 Storage capacity: NVMe and SATA M.2 drives are typically offered in either 1TB or 2TB options. Users looking for something larger can upgrade to 4TB and 8TB models at a considerably higher price point. At the time of writing, 4TB M.2’s of both the NVMe and SATA variety were going for between USD 200 and 300 on Amazon, and their 8TB SSD counterparts were closer to USD 400. &nbsp; 



 Speed: NVMe M.2 SSDs high-performance, high-throughput and high-speed data transfer capabilities are key differentiators in the market. NVMe technology leverages the PCIe interface, allowing it to connect straight into the CPU and the SSD. This helps lower latency and improve system responsiveness. Depending on your needs, however, you might not require the lightning-fast speeds an NVMe M.2 SSD provides, in which case a SATA M.2 SSD is a slightly cheaper option. While not as fast as NVMe SSDs, SATA drives are still considerably faster than any HDD. If you’re a gamer or using your PC for office applications, a SATA M.2 SSD is probably fine.&nbsp; 
 



 NVMe and M.2 use cases 



<p>At this point, we’ve established that NVMe and M.2 aren’t competing technologies—instead, they can actually complement each other. For business needs at the enterprise level, the benefits of using NVMe are simply impossible to ignore. M.2 SSDs certainly have plenty of enterprise use cases, but they are also widely popular among consumers looking to upgrade a laptop or PC. Here are some of the most popular use cases for both technologies:</p>



 
 High-performance computing: NVMe has the speed and storage capacity necessary to handle parallel processing, one of the key requirements of demanding applications like as high-frequency financial trading, AI and ML. 



 Demanding applications: Apps featuring real-time customer interactions and fast access to large volumes of data often rely on NVMe technology to run their workloads. Examples include e-commerce, personal finance and many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> apps. 



 Data centers: NVMe M.2 SSDs help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> expand their storage capabilities and still deliver lightning-fast speeds. According to <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/DataInfrastructureTrends2021/Toc">a recent report from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)</a>, nearly three-quarters of businesses already use NVMe SSD storage or are planning to acquire it in the next year. 



 Video and graphics editing: Many video editors use NVMe M.2 SSDs to expand their storage and still get the high processing speeds their applications require. What’s more, the slim, small profile of at portable NVMe M.2 makes them ideal for lightweight computers like laptops, notebooks and ultrabooks for editors on the go. 



 Gaming: Many serious gamers have come to depend on the fast load times that NVMe M.2 SSDs provide. An affordable, easy-to-install upgrade, NVMe SSDs deliver a smooth gaming experience and enhance day-to-day PC usage for a variety of other applications as well. 
 



 NVMe and M.2 solutions 



<p>NVMe technology paired with the M.2 form factor helps consumers and enterprises achieve the fastest data transfer speeds on the market. For gaming enthusiasts, video editors and other users looking to upgrade their PC storage and transfer capabilities, NVMe M.2 SSDs make an attractive option.</p>



<p>At the enterprise level, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/flashsystem-5200">IBM Storage FlashSystem 5200</a> provides compact, powerful storage along with all the benefits of NVMe technology. The 5200 helps enterprises achieve greater speed, performance and scalability from their data storage solution.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 31st October to 13th&nbsp;November <p>Welcome to our latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Turkey’s planned crypto regulations aimed at exiting the FATF grey list, the UK’s focus on stablecoins, New York’s task force on digital currencies, and the SEC’s call for clearer crypto rules. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Emerging Global Trends in Crypto Regulation <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is undergoing significant changes worldwide, with countries and regulatory bodies adapting to the evolving digital asset&nbsp;market.</p><p>Turkey’s Regulatory Push: Turkey is moving towards introducing new legislation for crypto-assets. This step is aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. The nation’s goal is to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list,” indicating its commitment to addressing strategic deficiencies in its financial systems.</p><p>UK’s Stablecoin Focus: In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are seeking public feedback on their approach to regulating stablecoins. They aim to balance the potential benefits of stablecoins for faster, cheaper payments with the need to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1722289568563531909?s=20">Image Source</a><p>New York’s Exploratory Task Force: New York is proposing a task force to study the impacts of digital currency and blockchain industries. This initiative aims to guide the state in addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies.</p><p>SEC’s Call for Clearer Crypto Rules: At the SEC Regulation Outside the United States conference, Commissioner Mart Uyeda stressed the importance of providing definitive rules and guidance for the cryptocurrency market rather than relying solely on enforcement actions. This stance highlights the ongoing debate over the classification and regulation of digital assets as securities.</p><p>These developments signify a global trend towards more structured and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. As nations and regulatory bodies navigate this complex and dynamic field, the focus should remain on ensuring consumer protection, market integrity, and fostering responsible innovation within the digital asset ecosystem.</p> Turkish Government Proposes New Crypto Laws to Address FATF Compliance Gaps <p>Turkey is on a mission to revamp its stance on cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to shake off the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” label, a designation underscoring the country’s previous shortcomings in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) practices.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of addressing these critical areas, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has announced imminent legislative proposals targeting the crypto sector, marking a significant step towards aligning with 39 of the 40 FATF standards.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>Turkey’s push to strengthen AML and CTF regulations in the crypto sector could greatly enhance investor confidence, making the market safer and more attractive for investment. Additionally, aligning with FATF standards may ease Turkey’s integration into the global crypto economy, allowing for smoother international crypto transactions and partnerships.</p><p>On the flip side, the upcoming legislative changes could also bring a wave of uncertainty for crypto businesses operating in Turkey, as the specifics remain unclear. This could create challenges in compliance and strategic planning. Furthermore, the new laws might impose rigorous compliance requirements on crypto entities, potentially stifling innovation and adding to operational costs.</p><p>Overall, as Turkey advances toward legal reform, the global financial and crypto communities remain watchful. The outcome of these regulations will not only influence Turkey’s financial standing but also set a precedent for how emerging markets should navigate the intricate balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> New York State Senate Pushes for Crypto Task&nbsp;Force <p>In a significant move, New York State Senate Banking Committee Chair James Sanders is advocating for a proactive approach towards digital currency, cryptocurrency, and blockchain industries. Sanders proposes a 16-member task force, appointed by the governor and the Legislature, to comprehensively study these sectors. This includes examining their impacts on state tax revenues, energy consumption, and the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Mike Lomas of the Financial Guys supports minimal regulation in general but suggests more oversight in the crypto sphere, especially for currencies not traded on public exchanges. Drawing parallels with the dot-com bubble, Lomas advocates for federal rather than state-level regulation, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investments and banking stability.</p> Positive Aspects: <p>New York’s approach, characterized by forward-thinking, can catalyze enhanced comprehension and regulation of digital currencies. This initiative positions New York potentially as a frontrunner in the evolving crypto industry. With its balanced perspective, the Task Force strives to marry regulatory needs with the acknowledgment of the burgeoning industry’s potential, thereby nurturing responsible growth within this&nbsp;domain.</p> Negative Aspects: <p>However, the path toward new regulations may breed uncertainty among crypto businesses and investors. This could translate into a temporary deceleration in market dynamics within New York. Additionally, there lies a risk of potential overregulation.</p><p>An overly cautious regulatory approach could echo the apprehensions reminiscent of the dot-com era, inadvertently stifling innovation in the crypto sector. Such a scenario might prompt crypto businesses to migrate to jurisdictions with more accommodating regulatory landscapes.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/five-must-have-attributes-for-your-travel-rule-solution">Five Must-Have Attributes for Your Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/decoding-fatf-travel-rule-solution-pricing-your-ultimate-guide-to-compliance-costs">Decoding FATF Travel Rule Solution Pricing: Your Ultimate Guide to Compliance Costs</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, legacy applications often stand as barriers to progress. These existing systems, characterized by outdated technology and architecture can hinder an organization’s ability to keep up with changing business needs and pose significant security and operational risks. Staying competitive is essential in today’s fast-paced business industry—this is where legacy application modernization comes into play.</p>



<p>In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the intricacies of software modernization, its profound importance, strategies for successful implementation, potential challenges and the integration of new technologies.&nbsp;</p>



 Understanding legacy applications&nbsp; 



<p>Legacy applications, in the context of information technology, refer to systems that have been in use for an extended period and typically exhibit the following characteristics:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Outdated technology: Legacy applications often rely on outdated technology, which means they were built using older tools and systems. These outdated technologies can make them incompatible with modern standards and best practices.&nbsp; 



 Inefficient performance: These systems might suffer from inefficiencies and slow response times that hinder productivity.&nbsp; 



 Security vulnerabilities: Due to outdated security measures and lack of updates, legacy applications are more susceptible to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> threats.&nbsp; 



 High maintenance costs: The need for ongoing maintenance and support for legacy applications can result in escalating costs over time.&nbsp; 



 Limited scalability: Scaling these systems to accommodate growing demands can be challenging and costly.&nbsp; 



 Poor adaptability: Legacy applications might not easily adapt to changing business requirements, making them ill-suited for modern, dynamic organizations. This is one of the main issues with legacy applications. They are often built on legacy code, which can be poorly written and annotated. This results in knowledge silos, which can be a huge strain on an organization when employees move on. Their successors may find it very hard to understand the code that’s been written, blocking the progress to making changes.&nbsp; 
 



 Approaching legacy system modernization 



<p>Legacy system modernization is the process of upgrading or transforming outdated, often monolithic and inefficient legacy systems into more contemporary, efficient and adaptable solutions. Developing a solid app modernization strategy is key to success. This strategy helps guide you through the process of adopting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a>, encapsulating legacy software and introducing modernization solutions. The goal is to create a new system that enhances business processes and improves customer experience.</p>



<p>Microservices are a crucial component of modernizing legacy applications. They involve breaking down large, monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable components or services. The practice of encapsulating or enclosing certain data or components within well-defined boundaries is essential to achieve better maintainability in software systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Legacy application modernization is often approached as part of a broader <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> initiative. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to create new business processes and customer experiences (or modify existing ones) to meet changing business and market requirements. It often involves the integration of digital technologies and customer-centric approaches to improve business operations and competitiveness. Improving business value often involves enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing competitiveness.</p>



 Benefits of modernizing legacy systems&nbsp; 



<p>Modernization is not necessarily about replacing these applications entirely, but rather about revitalizing them to meet contemporary needs and standards. Modernizing legacy applications offers a multitude of advantages for organizations seeking to remain competitive and efficient:</p>



 
 Improved performance and efficiency: Modernization can significantly enhance the performance and operational efficiency of legacy applications, resulting in quicker response times and improved user experience.&nbsp; 



 Enhanced security and compliance: Upgrading security measures and ensuring compliance with industry standards are integral components of modernization. Doing so helps reduce the risk of security breaches and avoid costly compliance issues. &nbsp; 



 Better user interface and experience (UI/UX): Modernization often involves revamping the user interface and user experience, contributing to increased customer and employee satisfaction.&nbsp; 



 Cost savings: Through modernization, organizations can reduce maintenance costs, optimize hosting and better leverage a global workforce, leading to substantial cost savings in the long run. For example, a retail company that has been using a legacy inventory management system for several years is less cost-efficient. This system is outdated, slow and requires constant maintenance to keep it running smoothly. Modernization would reduce maintenance costs and improve employee productivity by speeding up the process.&nbsp; 
 



 Application modernization strategy: Assessment and planning 



<p>The journey to modernization begins with a comprehensive assessment of your organization’s applications and systems. This assessment aims to evaluate the current state, strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas for improvement. After a thorough assessment, the next crucial step is to develop a clear modernization strategy aligned with your business goals and objectives. A well-crafted modernization strategy ensures that the efforts are focused, cost-effective and designed to yield the desired outcomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the assessment and planning phase, consider various modernization approaches. The IBM topic page addressing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-modernization">application modernization</a> highlights the following:</p>



<p>“The most important way to start any application modernization project is with an application assessment. Taking an inventory of what you have is almost always one of the most obvious ways to start a transformation like this. Once you have a list, you can start plotting all of those applications against an x and y axis of ease/difficulty and potential increased value if modernized.”&nbsp;</p>



 Five key modernization strategies&nbsp; 



<p>Modernizing legacy applications can take various forms, depending on the specific needs and circumstances of your organization. The choice of strategy depends on factors like the current state of the application, budget constraints and the desired outcome. Some common strategies include the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Rehosting: Rehosting involves migrating legacy applications to a new environment with minimal changes to the existing code and functionality. It’s a suitable choice when a quick transition is required, but it may not leverage the full potential of modernization. Understanding the code structure is essential in understanding the organization and arrangement of source code in a software application. 



 Refactoring: Refactoring is the process of restructuring and optimizing existing code to improve its performance and maintainability without altering its core functionality. This strategy can be effective for enhancing an application’s efficiency. 



 Replatforming: Replatforming entails moving legacy applications to a different platform or infrastructure. This can lead to performance improvements and scalability, but it involves some level of code adaptation. 



 Re-architecting: Re-architecting involves a comprehensive redesign of the application’s architecture to meet modern standards. It often requires a phased approach, effectively managing the process while addressing architectural issues. 



 Full replacement: In cases where legacy systems are too outdated, a full replacement may be necessary. While this strategy provides a fresh start, it comes with the challenge of potential disruptions during the transition.&nbsp; 
 



 Potential challenges and solutions 



<p>Modernization journeys will vary organization to organization, but there are a few very common aspects that many modernization efforts must address.</p>



 Technical debt 



<p>Modernizing legacy apps can be a complex undertaking, often hindered by technical debt. Technical debt is a metaphor in software development that refers to the consequences of choosing a quick solution to a problem instead of a more comprehensive and responsible approach. Like financial debt, it represents a trade-off between short-term gains and long-term costs.</p>



<p>Technical debt occurs when software developers or teams make deliberate or unintentional decisions to take shortcuts or compromise code quality in the interest of meeting immediate development goals or deadlines. This is often because it can be time-consuming to effectively update system quality. These shortcuts can result in poor code quality or workarounds that don’t necessarily address the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root cause</a> of the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address technical debt, you can:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Prioritize reduction: Focus on reducing technical debt within legacy code by restructuring and refactoring to make it more maintainable and adaptable.&nbsp; 



 Transition to cloud-native systems: Moving toward <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> systems can enhance scalability and cost-effectiveness, ensuring that your applications are ready to meet future demands. You might also consider a broader <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-migration">cloud migration</a> strategy (perhaps as part of a digital transformation effort) or a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> approach if on-premises solutions are still required.&nbsp; 



 Embrace a DevOps methodology: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> outlines a software development&nbsp;process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software&nbsp;by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT&nbsp;operations teams. With a DevOps practice, companies can be more agile and more proactive, taking insights into how their software systems are behaving in real-world scenarios into account as they consistently roll out software updates and new features to meet users’ needs. 
 



 Security&nbsp; 



<p>Security is a core consideration in modernization efforts. Modernization provides an opportunity to reinforce and update security measures. To ensure the security of modernized applications, integrate security early. Incorporate security measures from the beginning of the modernization process, making it a core component of the application’s architecture and design:</p>



 
 Conduct a risk assessment: Conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment to identify potential threats that may emerge during modernization. 



 Define requirements and expectations: Clearly define security requirements and expectations for the modernized application. This should cover areas such as data protection, access controls, encryption and regulatory compliance. 



 Ensure compliance: Lastly, ensure that modernized systems comply with relevant regulations and that there is a regular process in place that ensures compliance stays up to date. 
 



 Future-proofing 



<p>The planning aspect really can’t be stressed enough. Create a comprehensive roadmap that outlines how an organization intends to modernize its applications and maintain current moving into the future. It should include goals, methodologies, timelines and resources required for achieving modernization objectives.</p>



<p>To stay competitive and future-proof your modernized applications, consider the following:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Develop APIs: Create <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interfaces (APIs)</a> to connect modernized systems with existing applications and the broader ecosystem. APIs are crucial for enabling the integration and interaction of various software systems, services, and platforms.&nbsp; 



 Use frameworks: Frameworks are pre-established sets of libraries, tools and conventions that provide a foundation for developing software applications. They help streamline development by offering ready-made solutions for common tasks. 



 Leverage modern technologies: Incorporate modern technologies like automation, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> and other new solutions. This can involve delivering modernized applications with new features and capabilities or even upgrading the entire system infrastructure when necessary. 
 



<p>Overall, it is important to update legacy applications to ensure business growth and to keep pace with the ever-changing business landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once your business has decided to switch to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a> software system, the next step is to implement ERP. For a business to see the benefits of an ERP adoption it must first be deployed properly and efficiently by a team that typically includes a project manager and department managers as well.</p>



<p>This process can be complicated and feel overwhelming, depending on the needs of your organization. However, once new software is implemented successfully, organizations will ideally see the increases in productivity and cost savings benefits an ERP system can bring to your business. The switch to an ERP system can streamline your business needs and be beneficial to both the end user and entire organization.</p>



 Steps to implement ERP&nbsp; 



<p>Below is a breakdown of a step-by-step ERP implementation plan. We’ll start by going through what organizations should do prior to choosing an ERP system and then dive into best practices for implementation success.</p>



 1. Discover and plan to implement ERP 



<p>Before the ERP implementation process can occur, an organization must assess how its current systems are functioning. This is the first step to a successful enterprise resource planning integration and must be completed prior to choosing an ERP software.</p>



<p>In the first step of this implementation methodology, an organization must review the current system and processes to get a full picture of how the business is working and where there might be pitfalls. In this step, an ERP implementation project team should also be established for decision-making purposes. Areas to assess can include, financial, manufacturing, inventory, sales and more. This step will also be important to understand gaps and current issues, such as process inefficiencies and potential requirements for the ERP system.</p>



<p>Once the review of the organization’s current system, workflow, and everyday functions are assessed it’s time to select the right ERP system that meets your business requirements, such as budget forecasting and pricing. An ERP software can be acquired in this first step if the requirements have been well-defined. These requirements will depend on if an organization uses ERP system on-premises or in the cloud ERP.</p>



<p>A change to a modern ERP system can be very straight forward if there is a clear roadmap and project plan for your ERP deployment. A clear and honest conversation with employees will ensure organizational buy in.</p>



 Questions to ask as you define the scope of your organization’s needs: 



 
 What business functions will be automated by the ERP software? 



 What are the ERP system’s specific data requirements and is it compatible? 



 Which key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be tracked? 



 Is the software scalable and flexible enough to evolve with the organization’s needs? 



 What is the timeframe for implementation and deployment? 
 



 2.&nbsp;Create a design and prepare to implement 



<p>At this point you’ve chosen the ERP system for your business. The next step is the design phase. This is the step to configure the ERP software solution so it fits your organization’s specific needs.</p>



<p>A new design requires <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/organizational-change">change management</a> to make more efficient workflows, along with the potential need for new business processes that are a better fit with the soon-to-be implemented ERP system. It’s important to have a team within the organization dedicated to this design step and determining an appropriate plan.</p>



 Steps to configure the ERP system: 



 
 Create an organizational structure by defining all the necessary aspects of your business, such as the chart of accounts, cost centers and business units. 



 Customize your ERP software so that it aligns with the existing workflows in place and set up the modules you think your organization will need, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management</a> (CRM), human resources and supply chain management. 



 Set the parameters for user roles and permissions so that you can control everyone’s access across the system and make sure data controls are put in place. 



 Integrate ERP software with other existing systems within your organization like accounting software, inventory management and e-commerce platforms if they apply. 
 



 3.&nbsp;Migrate and development 



<p>Once the design requirements have been established, the development phase can begin. This involves the customization of the software so that the redesign can occur. The development, or preparation, stage is vital and can be a daunting task; but if done properly, it could help your ERP system function for the long-term.</p>



<p>You have established a redesign, now it’s time to clean and format the current system’s data so that it’s compatible with the new system. In this step, an organization will need to assess and prepare all existing data into a compatible format that fits your new ERP software. Once loaded into the new system and formatted correctly, your first ERP test can be performed. In this step you should also monitor and note the key metrics of your business operation, including any disruptions.</p>



 Ways to plan and prepare your data for migration: 



 
 Complete a data audit of all existing legacy systems and applications to have a clear picture going into the data migration. 



 Categorize the types of data you need to migrate and identify any redundancy by combing through the data and cleaning for accuracy. 



 Define what data transfer method you want to use and test it to be sure it is the right migration process. 



 Make a backup plan and a recovery plan in case errors occur or data is lost. 



 Create a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data governance</a> policy and put protocols in place. 
 



 4.&nbsp;Test the ERP system 



<p>All the preemptive steps have been taken and now it’s time to do some system testing before you go-live. In this stage, development might still occur and that is normal. The testing of one ERP module may occur and fixes or adjustments might need to be made, while other modules are being tested simultaneously. Team members should be put through user training and key stakeholders should be involved in this testing process as well.</p>



<p>It is vital to test the entire system and ensure its functioning properly and running data accurately. This is the most important phase because it will ensure all system applications and processes are running as they should before the ERP software is officially up and running.</p>



 Things to remember during the testing phase: 



 
 Keep track of user acceptance criteria and document the information. 



 Test the system for functionality from start to finish and validate all migrated data for accuracy purposes. 



 Check for user accessibility by conducting reviews and reviewing feedback. 



 Conduct all necessary tests prior to deploying the ERP software, such as testing automation processes, workflows and system security. 



 Ensure the ERP system is compatible with the other existing systems and applications in place. 



 Make sure all employees are trained on the system; consider implementing ERP software in stages before going company-wide. 
 



 5.&nbsp;Deliver a successfully implemented ERP system 



<p>If the steps above have all been taken, then great news, your organization is ready to launch its new ERP system. Assuming all employees have been properly trained on the software, it’s now time to roll out the new ERP solution.</p>



<p>The project team that started the implementation process should be at the ready in case employees are confused or other potential issues arise. Be prepared for issues and have contingency plans in place if there is a serious malfunction. All ERP modules can be deployed concurrently but can be done in stages as well. Some organizations might choose to prioritize certain modules and add others as they go, which is completely normal.</p>



<p>No two organizations are alike and deploying an ERP software can differ greatly but remember to make the ERP solution accessible to all employees and make sure automated processes are activated.</p>



 What to look for once implementation occurs: 



 
 Is the data accurate and functioning properly? 



 Do all users have real-time accessibility without issue? 



 Are security protocols in place and functioning? 



 Is the workflow in place and processing as it should? 
 



 6. Manage your ERP solution 



<p>Now, assuming the implementation is complete, it’s important to create a protocol for ongoing maintenance for your ERP system. Your organization should be performing regular maintenance checks and upgrading software periodically. Creating a team or having a professional in place to maintain the health of your ERP system is key to the longevity of the solution.</p>



<p>The ERP vendor you select should be available for any questions and ongoing maintenance or updates needed. Best practices for this implementation process should include a well-managed team and strong communication between the organization, its employees and key stakeholders to ensure the ERP solution is working effectively and efficiently.</p>



 Best practices for managing your new ERP system: 



 
 Listen to user and client feedback often. 



 On-premises ERP systems will require periodic software updates and sometimes hardware updates as well, while cloud-based ERP will update automatically. 



 Create standard operating procedures (SOP) to ensure common issues can be addressed quickly.

<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 is the latest iteration of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, released on March 31, 2022, and is currently in effect. The previous version, PCI DSS version 3.2.1, will remain active until March 31, 2024, to give organizations time to adopt the latest version of the standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is an information security standard designed to reduce payment card fraud by increasing security controls around cardholder data. The standard was created in 2004 by five major credit card companies: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB, and American Express. The primary goal of PCI DSS is to safeguard and optimize the security of sensitive cardholder data, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.</p>
<p>The standard’s security controls help businesses minimize the risk of data breaches, fraud, and identity theft. Compliance with PCI DSS also ensures that businesses adhere to industry best practices when processing, storing, and transmitting credit card data. The standard applies to all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. The standard is not a law but is enforced through contracts between merchants, acquiring banks that process payment card transactions, and the payment brands.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the PCI DSS – version 4.0 – was released at the end of March 2022. The standard provides specific, actionable guidance on protecting payment card data, which can be applied to organizations of any size or type that use any method of processing or storing data.</p>
<p>Let’s review some of the key differences between PCI DSS version 4.0 and the previous version:</p>
 
 Compensating Controls: PCI DSS 4.0 replaces the concept of compensating controls with customized implementations, which provides organizations greater flexibility in how they meet the standards. 
 Security Needs: PCI DSS 4.0 aims to address developing threats and technologies, facilitate more effective ways to combat new threats to cardholder information, boost payment flexibility, and improve business procedures to meet security needs. 
 Continuous Security Processes: PCI DSS 4.0 focuses more on maintaining continuous security processes. 
 Validation Methods and Procedures: PCI DSS 4.0 enhances validation methods and procedures. 
 Flexibility: PCI DSS 4.0 adds flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 addresses emerging threats and technologies by focusing on four core goals:</p>
 
 Ensuring that the standard meets the security needs of an evolving payment industry. 
 Promoting continuous security processes. 
 Enhancing validation methods and procedures. 
 Adding flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, PCI DSS 4.0 introduces new requirements and modifies existing ones to address potential vulnerabilities and reinforce the security posture of organizations. Some of the changes include:</p>
 
 Detection and protection against phishing attacks. 
 More stringent password requirements. 
 Multi-factor authentication. 
 All vendor and third-party accounts must only be used when needed and continuously monitored for vulnerabilities and security risks. 
 
<p>PCI DSS 4.0 also places greater emphasis on security results, giving businesses greater flexibility to select the security technologies and methods that are suitable for their particular environment. The standard aims to continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the payment card industry and the new technologies being implemented daily.</p>
<p>1Kosmos can help you meet these new requirements specifically, the MFA and password requirements PCI DSS 4.0 requires. The new and more stringent authentication requirements are designed to improve the security of cardholder data by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access systems and networks.</p>
<p>The following are the key authentication requirements for PCI DSS 4.0:</p>
 
 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all remote access to the cardholder data environment (CDE), as well as for all non-console administrative access to the CDE from within the entity’s network. MFA is also required for all access to the CDE from cloud-based or hosted systems. 
 Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused. 
 Account lockout must be implemented to prevent brute-force attacks. After a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users must be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means. 
 Strong authentication mechanisms must be used for all privileged accounts. This includes using MFA and/or complex passwords. 
 
<p>The approach we follow here at 1Kosmos ensures organizations can meet these requirements out of the box. Our elegant self-service KYC workflow is an innovative identity proofing and authentication solution designed to remove friction during onboarding to accelerate customer acquisition. We then give those customers a convenient digital wallet that eliminates account takeover and financial fraud and matches the authentication method to the risk associated with the activity.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos organizations will authenticate users via any of our methods depending on the business need, the risk profile of the activity, and the security requirement for each access request. These methods include:&nbsp; a phishing-proof real biometric – LiveID and device biometrics plus, push message, email/SMS/Token, 3rd party hardware token, Windows Hello, and Mac TouchID.</p>
<p>All user data is encrypted, and (for the highest level of security) stored in a distributed ledger compliant to the W3C DID standard. As such, they are accessible only via a FIDO2 certified public/private key pair secured in the TPM/Secure Enclave of a device and under sole control of the user, typically via their live biometric selfie, made possible by our innovative LiveID feature. The distributed ledger also provides immutable audit logs to prove every transaction.&nbsp;</p>

				  Unlocking the Power of Ecosystem Governance: Insights from Darrell O’Donnell  
			  
				
				
				
				
				  Building and governing ecosystems can be both challenging and rewarding for organizations. In his recent presentation to the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/EFWG+2023-09-14+Meeting+-+Continuum+Loop">Ecosystem Foundry Working Group</a> at the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a>, Darrell O’Donnell shared valuable insights into the intricate world of ecosystem governance.

				  The Essence of Ecosystems 
<p>Ecosystems aren’t just about a collection of apps and platforms; they’re about the roles and activities within that ecosystem. Ecosystem governance dictates what’s encouraged, what’s allowed, and what’s forbidden. It’s the set of rules that govern how different players interact, collaborate, and contribute value to the ecosystem.</p>
 Beyond Platforms: Ecosystems vs. Platforms 
<p>Darrell made a clear distinction between ecosystems and platforms. While platforms may be a component of an ecosystem, they are not enough to define an ecosystem. Platforms primarily focus on technical interactions, such as how things work and data flow. However, ecosystems encompass a broader scope, including governance, compliance, liability, and more. The actual value of ecosystems lies in the business and governance aspects.</p>
 Minimum Viable Ecosystem vs. Minimum Viable Product 
<p>We often hear about Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) in the agile world. An MVP is a learning, exploring, and prototyping tool, but it’s not the final product. On the other hand, a Minimum Viable Ecosystem (MVE) is about delivering a real value proposition. It’s not about exploration but about having tangible value. MVEs aim to attract and align partners within the ecosystem to fulfill different roles and activities, as no single company can do it all.</p>
 Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Ecosystems can be complex, and their governance is crucial. Darrell emphasized the importance of ecosystem governance frameworks, which help organizations understand where they fit, what value they add, and where opportunities lie. These frameworks also highlight gaps in the ecosystem that require new roles or partners to fill. Governance frameworks address compliance, liability, and other governance issues that drive value within ecosystems.</p>
 The Trust Continuum™: Tools for Ecosystem Governance 
<p>Darrell introduced the Trust Continuum™ Tools, a toolbox designed in-house to assist organizations in navigating the complexities of ecosystem governance. These tools are not only useful for governance but can also be applied in various scenarios:</p>
 
 Product and Platform Design 
 Product Strategy&nbsp; 
 Interoperability and Conformance Testing 
 
<p>These powerful resources will support your journey in building successful Minimum Viable Ecosystems and establishing effective Ecosystem Governance Frameworks. You can access the entire Trust Continuum™ Toolbox <a href="https://mailchi.mp/continuumloop/tctools">here</a>.</p>
 Influence over Control 
<p>The mantra of “Control only what you must, influence the rest” underscores the importance of understanding where strict governance is needed and where influence can lead to positive outcomes. By applying the Trust Continuum™ tools and principles, organizations can navigate the intricate world of ecosystems and drive value in this dynamic landscape.</p>
 <p>Control only what you must - influence the rest<br><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp3XwXg-Tgg&amp;text=Control%20only%20what%20you%20must%20-%20influence%20the%20rest&amp;via=continuumloop&amp;related=continuumloop">Click To Tweet</a><br></p> 
<p>Darrell’s presentation sheds light on the critical aspects of ecosystem governance and provides practical tools for organizations to navigate and excel in this complex arena. Ecosystems are the future of business, and understanding how to govern them effectively is essential for success. With the right knowledge and tools, organizations can unlock the power of ecosystems and thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>

  <p>We‘ve repeatedly emphasized the importance of multifactor authentication (MFA) and emphasized that not all MFA is equal – the Authenticator is much more secure than phone authentication (so hang up!). Through the implementation of number matching, we've successfully thwarted criminals engaging in MFA fatigue attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this has been very effective, attackers attempting these methods can still annoy users, and Authenticator prompts—while extremely helpful when a user is trying to log in—can provide a “hook” for social phishing when triggered by a hacker. In response to this, we took additional steps to keep users happy and secure by suppressing Authenticator pop-up notifications when a request is anomalous. The rollout of these changes was completed at the end of September, and we’ve successfully reduced the number of otherwise unworthy notifications. We've prevented more than 6 million passwordless and MFA notifications since the deployment began. By the vast majority, these were hacker-initiated notifications serving no value to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Suppressing Risky Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the deployment of this feature, we now suppress Authenticator notifications when a request displays potential risks, such as when it originates from an unfamiliar location or is exhibiting other anomalies. This approach significantly reduces user inconvenience by eliminating irrelevant authentication prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When everything looks acceptable, users receive notifications on their mobile devices as depicted below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the event of a login request that looks risky to us, the standard notification will not be sent to the user. Instead, they’ll be given the following instructions: “Open your Authenticator app and enter the number shown to sign in,” with no corresponding notification displayed on the user's phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens their Authenticator app, it will present the request, allowing the user to take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens the Authenticator App, the request will be available for the user:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Retrieving Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the notifications are not deleted. They’re simply suppressed and can still be accessed by the user within the Authenticator App. If a user encounters a genuine request from an unusual source, they can retrieve the notification by accessing their authenticator app. The app serves as a repository for all authenticator notifications, ensuring users have a convenient way to retrieve any missed requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation of this feature has led to a smoother and more secure experience for users. As technology evolves, enhancing user convenience while also enhancing security is crucial, and this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app">new approach</a> is a great example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FATF Travel Rule makes it mandatory for VASPs, including crypto exchanges, digital wallets, custodial services, etc., to exchange specific customer data when transacting crypto assets above a predefined threshold.</p><p>As more countries implement the Travel Rule, the onus is on VASPs to adopt solutions that adeptly manage detailed customer information exchanges — without slowing down transactions or infringing on user privacy. It’s a delicate balance, and the right solution must navigate these requirements deftly.</p><p>This article will unpack the core attributes these solutions should have to equip VASPs for compliance in a way that aligns with the fast-moving nature of the digital asset industry.</p> Easy Integration <p>Travel Rule solutions must have a straightforward integration process within the diverse technological setups of VASPs. They should offer plug-and-play capabilities that require minimal adjustments to existing infrastructure, ensuring that different data formats, tech stacks, or protocols are harmonized effortlessly. Their aim should be to help VASPs meet their compliance obligations without the burden of significant system overhauls or operational downtime.</p> Highest Security and Encryption Standards <p>Travel Rule Compliance Solutions must empower VASPs to efficiently manage transactions with counterparts, in line with FATF Recommendation 16. These solutions must protect sensitive exchanged information with the highest security standards, prioritizing data&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Robust data security and encryption protocols are not just beneficial but essential to prevent breaches. Secure data transmission channels are equally crucial to safeguard user information from unauthorized access.</p><p>This is why leading Travel Rule Solutions incorporate stringent security practices, including sophisticated encryption and secure data transmission channels. They equip users with robust control over data exchanges, allowing for the approval or denial of transfer requests, thereby safeguarding customer data with the highest level of security.</p> Interoperability <p>There are several Travel Rule Protocols worldwide, with differing approaches to collecting Originator and Beneficiary information and how they handle transactions with self-hosted wallets. Interoperability within Travel Rule Compliance Solutions is essential in bridging these differences, enabling secure and efficient information exchange.</p><p>That’s where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> comes into the picture, as its approach to interoperability directly addresses the fragmented nature of global Travel Rule Protocols. By integrating with various Travel Rule Solutions and blockchain analytics providers, Shyft Veriscope creates a network that supports diverse fund-transfer thresholds and the intricate requirements for Originator and Beneficiary information.</p> Automated <p>Automation is a critical component of an effective Travel Rule solution. It streamlines processes, reduces the potential for human error, and speeds up the identification and verification of VASPs at an entity level. An automated system supports real-time discovery and confirmation of counterparty entities, essential for maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities exemplify this automated approach. By utilizing just the crypto wallet address, Shyft Veriscope’s system can automatically detect counterparty VASPs in real time, negating the need for manual entry of additional information or the publication of wallet addresses by VASPs. This not only simplifies the process but also enhances security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, Shyft Veriscope’s automated address proofing validates the accuracy of the VASP identified, mitigating the risk of data breaches due to incorrect data sharing. This system provides a reliable framework for the identification of counterparties, respecting both legal entity and jurisdictional considerations.</p> Dealing With Sunrise Issues Effectively <p>The “Sunrise Issue” refers to the staggered global implementation of the Travel Rule. Since countries adopt the FATF’s Travel Rule at different times, VASPs in jurisdictions where the rule is already enforced may need to exchange information with VASPs in places where it’s not required yet. This time lag creates a challenge: how to ensure compliance when not all parties are subject to the same regulations at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope addresses the Sunrise Issue with its innovative “historic look back” capability. This feature allows VASPs to comply retroactively by obtaining transaction information even if it occurred before the counterparty had implemented a Travel Rule solution. When a new VASP joins Veriscope, it can respond to past information requests, thus ensuring compliance continuity.

<p>In May of this year, Deloitte announced the integration of KILT for creating new markets with reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) digital credentials. The first Deloitte credentials are now&nbsp;live!</p><p>KYC/KYB credentials are increasingly required for regulatory reasons to verify the identity of an individual or existence of a business. Typically, these credentials are paper-based and single-use. Deloitte has now harnessed the power of the KILT blockchain to reimagine the process of issuing KYC and KYB credentials, making it more efficient and giving the user sovereignty over their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Deloitte used solutions “Built on KILT” that mean it could create a service built on blockchain without having to deal with cryptocurrencies or needing blockchain experience.</p><p>The Enterprise Service, provided by KILT partner <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/">BTE BOTLabs Trusted Entity</a>, enables enterprises to pay in advance via bank transfer for a large volume of blockchain transactions, which can then be processed over time as needed. No cryptocurrency is needed by the enterprise or their customers.</p><p>Applications that interact with the blockchain can be <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-kilt-suite-introducing-opendid-and-the-ctype-hub-dbe5bc769560">built without blockchain knowledge</a> using the TypeScript software development kit (SDK) and code examples, or by adapting existing open source applications. Deloitte created its own digital wallet for managing credentials based on the KILT Sporran wallet (a browser extension).</p><p>Users can follow the Deloitte process to get a decentralized identifier (DID; a string of letters and numbers unique to that user) which forms the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">core of their identity</a>. Once the information provided for KYC/KYB is approved, the credential is attested by Deloitte, linked to that DID. To maintain privacy, the user always retains control of their DID and credential in their personal wallet on their own&nbsp;device.</p><p>This reduces the need for centralized storage of credentials and puts the user in charge of their own data. The user decides who they share the credential with and how much information in the credential they share (selective disclosure). Only a hash representing the data is stored on the blockchain, keeping the information private. The credential can later be revoked using this hash when the information is no longer&nbsp;valid.</p><p>We are delighted to see credentials “Built on KILT” in action. The <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">first use case</a> has already been announced, with more to follow shortly.

 Run AI-powered prediction bots and earn. 37,000 OCEAN weekly ongoing + 100,000 ROSE weekly for first 4&nbsp;weeks  Contents<br>1. <a>Introduction</a><br>2. <a>Predictoor DF Timing</a><br>3. <a>Predictoor DF Reward Amounts</a><br>4. <a>How to Earn $ Via Predictoor DF</a><br>5. <a>How to Earn More $ Via Passive DF &amp; Volume DF</a><br>6. <a>Conclusion</a><br><a>Appendix: Updates to Challenge DF</a>  Summary <p>Predictoor Data Farming is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$21K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1]. This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> data feeds predict whether BTC, ETH etc will rise or fall 5min or 1h into the future. Such feeds are alpha to traders. These feeds are crowdsourced by “predictoors”: people running AI-powered prediction bots. Predictoors earn from sales of the feeds (to traders) and from stake reshuffling ($ going from incorrect predictoors to correct ones). Predictoor’s longer-term vision is 10,000 feeds, going beyond finance to weather, agriculture, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Predictoor is a product built by <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> core team. Predictoor smart contracts run on <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a>, the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production. The Ocean and Oasis core teams collaborate closely&nbsp;❤️.</p><p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean’s incentive program. It rewards OCEAN to participants who lock OCEAN into veOCEAN, curate data, or make predictions — all in the name of driving data consume volume (DCV). DF is organized into two streams: Passive DF and Active DF. Passive DF allows for passive earning potential. Active DF requires more engagement; it has several substreams.</p><p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> is a new substream of Active Data Farming. It amplifies existing predictoors’ earnings based on their accuracy and stake. It does so by basically contributing extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> 2. Predictoor DF&nbsp;Timing <p>Predictoor DF starts counting on Nov 9, 2023, at the beginning of Data Farming Round 62 (DF62). It runs indefinitely.</p> 3. Predictoor DF Reward&nbsp;Amounts <p>Predictoor DF has two components: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token">OCEAN</a> rewards and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">Oasis ROSE</a> rewards. Here are&nbsp;details:</p>  OCEAN payouts of 37,000 OCEAN/week, ongoing. <br> — A special “DF buyer” bot purchases Predictoor feeds. It starts operating on Nov 9. Every day, it spends 1/7 of the weekly Predictoor OCEAN budget for another 24h subscription. It spends an equal amount per feed. (Currently there are 20 feeds: 10 x 5min, 10 x 1h.) <br> — The OCEAN comes from the Ocean DF budget, as part of the 75,000 OCEAN/week for Active DF. The Volume DF budget has been adjusted to 37,000 OCEAN/week, and Challenge DF to 1,000 OCEAN/week. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#a171">Here</a> are&nbsp;details.  ROSE payouts of 100,000 ROSE/week for the first 4 weeks. <br> — Payout is at the end of the DF round. Therefore there will be payouts at the end of DF62, DF63, DF64, and DF65. Payout for a given predictoor is pro-rata to the net earnings of that predictoor over that DF round, specifically (total sales $ to the predictoor) minus (predictoor stake slashed due to being wrong). <br> — The ROSE comes from a generous contribution of <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol Foundation</a> 👪🙏.  <p>For further details about DF more generally, including DF stream budgets, see <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Data Farming docs</a> and “<a href="http://Here%20are%20details.">Ocean Data Farming Main is Here</a>” blog&nbsp;post.</p> 4. How to Earn $ Via Predictoor DF  4.1 How to become a predictoor <p>Simple, run your own prediction bot!&nbsp;🤖</p>  Play with the dapp: <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a>  Then follow <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-earn">Predictoor usage guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs  Or, go straight to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">the quickstart README</a>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;🏎️   4.2 On OCEAN Rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: ongoing  To be eligible: predictoors are automatically eligible&nbsp;🧘  To claim: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4.3 On $ROSE rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: Runs 4 DF rounds — DF62, DF63, DF64, DF65. Limited&nbsp;time!  ⚠️ To be eligible for a given DF round: you MUST run Predictoor $OCEAN payout script &lt;= 4 days after the round ends, i.e. between Thu 00:00 UTC &amp; Sun 11:59 PM&nbsp;UTC  To claim: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs   5. How to Earn More $ Via Passive DF &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Predictoor DF makes Active DF more attractive, and in turn Passive DF. Let’s zoom&nbsp;in.</p><p>First, we review Passive DF and Volume DF (details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>):</p>  Passive DF has 75K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate, one locks OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. Rewards to a user are pro-rata to the user’s veOCEAN holdings.  Volume DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate in Volume DF, one allocates veOCEAN towards data assets. Rewards to a user are higher for more veOCEAN allocated, and for more DCV on the data asset that’s allocated to (DCV = Data Consume&nbsp;Volume).  <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo, because the volume-based bounds on weekly rewards trends tend to be qualitatively higher for prediction feeds. (See the Appendix for details.)</p><p>Curating is straightforward. Ocean assets with high DCV are easy to identify: it’s the 20 OPF-published prediction feeds. This makes the choice of veOCEAN allocation easy: point to those 20 assets&nbsp;[2].</p><p>Doing Volume DF gives Passive DF rewards too, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>The net result: Predictoor DF means earnings potential from Predictoor DF, Volume DF, and Passive&nbsp;DF.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>A “predictoor” runs AI-powered prediction bots in the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. They onboard <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">here</a>. They earn $ from sales of prediction feeds; higher accuracy and higher stake mean higher&nbsp;$.</p><p>Predictoor DF is a new incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Predictoor DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards (ongoing) and 100K ROSE rewards (first 4&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>The higher baseline sales makes Volume DF and Passive more attractive.</p><p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon; the Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p> Appendix: Updates to Challenge DF <p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon. Here are&nbsp;details.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Challenge DF was introduced &amp; shipped</a> in July 2023 in DF Round 48 (DF48). It was always conceived as an onboarding mechanism to becoming a predictoor, ie someone who runs a bot predicting ETH and more within the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. Since Predictoor was introduced, predictoor onboarding has greatly improved. It’s no longer worth doing Challenge DF first. So let’s simplify:)</p><p>Therefore, since the launch of Challenge DF, there are two important updates.</p>  Reduced payouts. As of DF62, Challenge DF payouts are reduced from 5000 OCEAN / week to 1000 OCEAN / week. DF62 counting starts on Nov 9, 2023 and concludes on Nov 16, 2023. (Predictoor DF is introduced in DF62.) The Active DF budget is 37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  Wind-down. DF65 is the final round for Challenge DF. Starting in DF65, the 1000 OCEAN / week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF. The Active DF budget will37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  <p>For further details, see the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> post, which includes “Predictoor DF” posts and other DF posts, all in chronological order.</p> Appendix: On DCV Bounds of Prediction Feeds <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo. Active DF’s rewards are bounded by DCV_bound which in turn is bound by sales volume and fees. In Predictoor DF, both those factors are raised; which raises the bounding in Volume DF; this in turn means higher earning potential. Let's elaborate.</p><p>At one time, Volume DF had a “wash consume” problem, where people published and consumed their own datasets. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">DF9</a> onwards address this, by putting a bounds on weekly&nbsp;rewards:</p><blockquote>DCV_bound = DCV *&nbsp;m</blockquote><p>Where m = DCV_bounding_multiplier = Ocean community fee (0.1%) + publish market&nbsp;fee.</p><p>This stopped wash consume because it became unprofitable to do wash consume: fees eat up all potential profits.</p><p>A low DCV (data consume volume) or a low m (publish market fee) mean low DCV_bound.</p><p>Predictoor DF makes both DCV and m&nbsp;higher!</p>  DCV is higher: the 37K OCEAN/week counts as consume&nbsp;volume  m is higher: publish market fee is 20% for prediction feeds  <p>Therefore DCV_bound is higher. Specifically: DCV_bound = 37000 * (0.001 + 0.20) = 7437 OCEAN.

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  Reference Wallet  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   OpenID and Reference Wallet <p>We are working on implementations of OID4VCI and OID4VP and have recently refactored them to match the latest version of the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vci-rs/pull/10?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vci-rs#10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vp-rs/pull/3?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vp-rs#3</a>)</p><p>Work is underway to update our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/wallet?ref=blog.spruceid.com">reference wallet</a> (formerly known as Credible Wallet) and refactor it as a collection of our mobile-related technologies which include credentials and keys management but also the OID4VCI protocols.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Merged an initial implementation of SD-JWT (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/529?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#529</a>)  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   Rebase&nbsp;   Rebase was refactored to support multiple async runtimes, this allows developers to use Rebase in popular Rust async runtimes like Tokio. Before, it only supported WASM.  Rebase is being refactored to support witness flows without issuance. All previous issuance work will still be available, but developers will be able to use the witness flows to simply determine if a fact is true and no longer have to issue a credential at the conclusion of the flow. This supports more flexible implementations in apps that call Rebase libraries.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID lets users control their data across the web. SpruceID provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods and Windows Hello for Business</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpasskeys.dev%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fterms%2F%23device-bound-passkey&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BLpGtZFtGXHPKMbnR5ifT8fFFrl0nOCa3L4K87QgoQk%3D&amp;reserved=0">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences to support this preview release. For your organization to opt-in to this preview, you will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhowto-authentication-passwordless-security-key&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ac9DQ7dxszepy0kftYRCNrGS4hqqwUq46SMrAPagpgc%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>

<p>Currently, Authenticator Lite is only available to organizations who manage Microsoft Authenticator in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fconcept-authentication-methods-manage%23authentication-methods-policy&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=xRuXa6iKsZ92fRhu2QzLGrM6vrQf1Rk2mxs%2B6J22vyI%3D&amp;reserved=0">modern authentication methods policy</a>.

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations with users in the listed countries that don't want their users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp will need to disable text messages as an authentication method in their tenant(s). Depending on where they manage their authentication methods this means they need to disable "Text message to phone" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com%2FUserManagement%2FMfaSettings.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2wENNOj7suQmnsgX%2BErw3SzyGW2dKlEjo7%2BZ7GumgTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per-user MFA policy</a>&nbsp;and / or "SMS" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_IAM%2FAuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade%2F~%2FAdminAuthMethods%2FfromNav%2FIdentity&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347428104%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=47wDN5b8%2FVhKNbOlUc4UEyXhEtBhR9tBKn9kWBe1gac%3D&amp;reserved=0">Authentication methods policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups.

<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Government organizations with significant technical debt require modern approaches for delivering services. Deploying services using DevOps techniques and a DevOps-enabled identity and access management (IAM) platform can improve application performance, availability, and scalability, while reducing maintenance and deployment costs.</p>

 Why DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, communication, and efficiency in delivering software applications.</p>

<p>Docker and Kubernetes are two foundational technologies that can be used for any deployment methodology — not just cloud computing — because they support building applications that can run on any modern operating system, and in any environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> is a tool designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create, deploy, and run applications at scale and in any environment by using containers. Containers allow a developer to bundle an application with all of the parts it needs — such as libraries, code, and other dependences — and deploy it as one package.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

<p>Together, Docker and Kubernetes enable developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the systems that it will be running on. The combination enables them to orchestrate and deliver faster services with flexible deployment options, whether they are to run in an on-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud environment.</p>

 The benefits of DevOps-based IAM 

<p>Time is of the essence when developing and deploying capabilities that support the growing need for digital government services or for mission-critical applications used in denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to speed deployment, scale for peak demand, and increase efficiency and security is by using a modern, comprehensive IAM solution that supports a multi-cloud DevOps deployment model with Docker and Kubernetes-based containerization and orchestration technologies. With the cloud now a top government strategic priority and more workloads shifting to cloud platforms every year, it's imperative to protect these workloads, no matter where they reside.</p>

<p>Large government agencies and organizations that are using older, on-premises IAM systems can't deliver the scale and security needed for digital government services for constituents or mission-critical applications used in intelligence and defense. Traditional IAM solutions are often complex and difficult to deploy, lacking the scalability and flexibility needed for quickly rolling out new services, upgrades, or releases.</p>

<p>In contrast, DevOps-friendly IAM solutions are designed to support automated and continuous delivery requirements, which are essential for DevOps practices across any environment.<br>
By containerizing IAM using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, government agencies can achieve greater flexibility when deploying IAM solutions.</p>

 Comparing DevOps-based IAM with legacy and cloud-only solutions 

<p>ForgeRock fully supports DevOps-based IAM and offers several advantages over legacy, monolithic IAM solutions and cloud-only IAM:</p>

  Deploy anywhere, online or offline: DevOps-based IAM can be deployed in any environment: on-premises, in private or public cloud, and in offline access scenarios such as on military vessels with intermittent internet connectivity. Our Cloud Deployment Model (CDM) adheres to the DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design for deployment in a containerized environment. 
	 Best of both worlds: The comprehensive ForgeRock IAM platform provides the features, capabilities, and customization you need, without the hassle of maintaining a monolithic IAM system. Cloud-only IAM solutions offer agility and scalability, but they may not be suitable for government agencies and organizations that are managing complex use cases or DDIL low-bandwidth and offline requirements. 
	 Up-to-date security: Unlike a monolithic IAM solution, DevOps-based IAM can be patched quickly for security updates and new features without taking the entire solution offline. 
  The ForgeOps deployment methodology 

<p>Customers that use the ForgeRock DevOps deployment model called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.4/cdm/intro.html">ForgeOps</a> have accelerated projects by three to six months, saving 25% on implementation costs. Agencies can deploy updates between their containerized applications and ForgeRock with the ability to test, QA, and deploy ForgeRock into Kubernetes clusters in minutes by running a simple command. And they can choose the operating system that meets their needs.</p>

<p>Government agencies requiring high security often choose OpenShift, an on-premises platform-as-a-service Kubernetes implementation that supports public cloud, on-premises, hybrid cloud, or edge architectures. The ForgeOps-provided Kubernetes scripts can be modified to support an OpenShift deployment.</p>

<p>With the right identity solution, organizations can easily protect workloads in any cloud; support millions of identities of any type; enable rapid solution development in a repeatable way; and conduct fast, simple, and highly available deployments — all without sacrificing rich features and extensibility. This ultimately leads to immediate business benefits, including accelerated time to market, increased flexibility in rolling out new services, availability and scalability, and time savings.</p>

 The ForgeRock difference 

<p>By making it easy to utilize Docker and Kubernetes technology, ForgeRock provides the fastest and most flexible multi-cloud IAM deployment options. Our cloud deployment model removes complexity and can help you accelerate development, making it easy to deploy millions of identities in minutes, on any cloud – whether it's a private cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>You can validate deployment options against ForgeRock benchmark results and analyze the most cost-effective cloud solution based on multiple factors so that your organization can reduce costs and ensure optimal performance, availability, and reliability to meet customer demand quickly.</p>

<p>YeshID is now <a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliant</a>! 🎉 Not sure why this is important? In an increasingly digital world, safeguarding sensitive information, especially during <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">employee IT onboarding and offboarding</a>, is of critical importance. SOC II compliance represents a major commitment to data security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to share this news with you for two reasons:</p>
 
 To help deepen your trust in YeshID as your tool of choice for secure onboarding and offboarding.&nbsp; 
 You might want to achieve SOC II compliance for your growing company one day too! We’re hoping our journey can help you with yours.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore what SOC II compliance means, its significance for YeshID, and how it benefits your organization.</p>
 What is SOC II compliance? 
<p>SOC II, or Service Organization Control 2, is a rigorous auditing process that evaluates a company’s controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. Achieving SOC II compliance demonstrates that YeshID has undergone thorough assessments and meets high industry standards in data security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SOC II compliance is usually conducted by a third-party assessor that measures the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security: Assesses measures in place to protect the organization’s systems, data centers, networks, access controls, and more from unauthorized access, physical and otherwise 
 Availability: Examines downtime, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning to assess the reliability of systems and services as agreed upon with customers 
 Processing integrity: Evaluates if data is processed accurately, completely, and in a timely manner&nbsp; 
 Confidentiality: Assesses access controls, encryption, and data privacy measures to focus on the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure 
 Privacy: Assesses the management of personal information and its compliance with relevant data privacy regulations 
 
<p>There are companies that help you achieve SOC II compliance. For example, YeshID worked with <a href="https://www.vanta.com/products/soc-2">Vanta to help automate the SOC II process</a> and find a vetted third-party auditor.</p>
 Why does SOC II compliance matter? 
<p>SOC II compliance ensures that any company undergoing the process has implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive information. This is particularly essential for YeshID because during employee onboarding and offboarding, personal and confidential data is frequently exchanged. Achieving SOC II compliance shows our strong commitment to data security and privacy.</p>
<p>SOC II compliance helps reduce potential risks and vulnerabilities in your data management processes. It safeguards your organization against data breaches and regulatory fines. It also sends a signal to your customers, investors, partners, and stakeholders that data privacy and access management is a top priority for your company.</p>
 SOC II-compliant IT onboarding and offboarding with YeshID 
<p><a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliance</a> is a milestone that strengthens our commitment to data security and privacy. By choosing YeshID, you can trust that your sensitive information is in safe hands during employee onboarding and offboarding processes and that you are complying with the highest data protection standards. This means that you are that much closer to achieving SOC II compliance by using a SOC II-compliant onboarding and offboarding provider.</p>
<p>In an age where data breaches and privacy concerns are ever-present, SOC II compliance is your assurance that YeshID is dedicated to maintaining the utmost standards of data security. Let us help you <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">unlock a new era of security and efficiency in your organization’s processes</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The result of this meeting was “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">The Bletchley Declaration</a>”, an international agreement signed by 29 countries, including the US, EU, and China, to confirm their shared commitment for future AI developments that “should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible”.</p>
<p>Sounds promising, right? Experts have been talking about the dangers of uncontrolled AI proliferation for years. James Cameron warned us about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">AI gaining self-awareness</a> forty years ago! Elon Musk has been <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">calling for a pause in AI development</a>, citing grave dangers for our society. On a slightly more serious note, our own KuppingerCole analysts have published numerous articles on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/iantorno/the-triple-threat-ai-ethics-bias-and-deepfakes-in-cybersecurity">AI risks and challenges</a> as well, including those in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/ai-and-cybersecurity-a-new-hope-for-cyber-defenders">the field of cybersecurity</a>. And yet, major world superpowers have been engaged in an AI arms race in recent years, and just a week ago, the US president has issued a landmark <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order on trustworthy development and use of AI</a> to strengthen his country’s position in this race.</p>
<p>So, why such a sudden demonstration of unity amidst an ongoing global conflict? British prime minister Rishi Sunak called the Bletchley declaration “a landmark achievement… helping ensure the long-term future of our children and grandchildren”, but can we really expect any substance from this claim, or should we treat this paper as a mere symbolic gesture?</p>
<p>After all, the entire summit was full of overt symbolism. Bletchley Park, the location of the event, is, of course, the historic site where during the World War II, top British experts worked to break the secret communications of the Axis powers, especially the notorious German Enigma machine. And of course, this valiant work was led by none other than Alan Turing, the same guy that later proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">eponymous test</a> to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m well aware of the fact that the actual cracking of the Enigma code was mostly done by Polish mathematicians years before, as well as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">appalling treatment of Turing himself</a> by the British authorities that led to his suicide, and this alone makes the entire symbolism a bit too shallow for me. But even if we ignore the history and only focus on the Turing test itself, we should keep in mind that it was a ground-breaking (and highly controversial) philosophical concept back then, but it bears very little relevance to the modern AI developments that the declaration is supposed to regulate.</p>
<p>Does it really matter if a chatbot can fool you into thinking that you’re communicating with a human? There are much more urgent and practical technological, cultural, and moral problems that need to be addressed soon: for example, who is responsible if a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car_liability">driverless car runs over a pedestrian</a>? Or a multitude of much smaller but equally critically important issues like dealing with bias and prejudice, ethical consequences of AI tools making carrier-defining decisions for humans, deepfakes, etc., etc. Or defending against threat actors wielding their own AI tools…</p>
<p>Surely, all these issues must be addressed, and regulation is the most efficient way to do that. But there is an important distinction between regulating AI usage and its development. The latter is simply meaningless, especially around technologies that can be easily weaponized. No matter how many times governments agree not to create “killer robots”, then will continue developing them anyway because having killer robots at your army’s disposal is much better than not having them, especially if your country is planning another war.</p>
<p>So no, I do not consider this declaration a landmark achievement. It was merely an empty gesture to make British politicians feel a bit more important than they perhaps deserve. An imitation game, if you will. Or, more likely, a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult</a>. And of course, the AI battle between the US and China will continue. And nobody will voluntarily give up productivity tools like ChatGPT and surely, the black market of AI-based threats and exploits will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>But perhaps sometime in the future, when AI safety summits are attended by industry experts and not politicians, we will see more practical developments tailored to specific issues in certain fields or geographies. Until then, we will have to defend against the evil AIs ourselves. And a great place to discuss your immediate risks and challenges is the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference, which opens next week in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as online. Will we see you there?</p>

Because the systems in place to stop it are slow, outdated, or unintuitive. In this article we’ll explain how verifiable credentials can fix the issue.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Systems to prevent fraud and scams are in place across every industry; and yet, the FTC reports <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">fraud increased by 30%</a> from 2021 to 2022. Some may point to the number of chances that bad actors have: the US averages <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">1,739 credit cards swiped per second,</a> with the average card holder making <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">210 credit transactions per year.</a> Surely, with that many transactions systems can’t catch everything. Maybe not. But it is troubling that even as security technology advances, fraud is trending ever upward.</p>
<p>2023 saw many technological advances, with one of the most noteworthy being <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT,</a> an artificial intelligence program that generates “human-like text.” Almost immediately, it was misused: a study by SlashNext found a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">1,265% increase in general phishing</a> attempts since ChatGPT launched in November of 2022, and a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">967% increase in credential phishing</a> attempts. And with ChatGPT built on open-source code, it wasn’t long before malicious actors began making their own programs to do even more damage, leading to the creation of <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/">WormGPT and FraudGPT.</a></p>
<p>Instead of playing “spot the scam,” against a background of ever more complex scams, we need a better way of knowing for sure who we are interacting with. This is where verifiable credentials come in. Someone once described verifiable credentials to me as “multi-factor authentication for life.” Imagine a world where before you even opened the email you could be certain who it was from because there was an authentication process built into the sending.</p>
<p>Today, if you get an important-looking email from the government or your bank, the onus is on you to verify it. Some people might call to double check (and get that second point of authentication), but many might just respond, or worse yet click on links they shouldn’t and&nbsp; provide personal information. The extra step to verify is time consuming. People want convenience, and, frankly, the main line of defense against phishing and other cyber scams shouldn’t be to inconvenience them. We need a fast, easy to use, technical answer.</p>
<p>Indicio believes that verifiable credentials are this answer because we’ve seen them work across a variety of use cases for different customers. With a simple scan of a QR code you can be sure of who you are interacting with and who has issued their credential. Think of your bank issuing you a verifiable credential for your bank account. Every time you connect with your bank, it knows you’re the person it issued the credential to, automatically. Similarly, you know you are interacting with your bank and not some fake version of it. And this all occurs before any data is shared. Combine this with the way parties can prove that information shared from a credential hasn’t been tampered with, the use cases are innumerable. Trust is foundational to all business and social activity, and now we have a way to trust each other and what we share online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see how fast and easy verifiable credentials make accessing something like your bank account you can see a demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We recognize the unique skills, experience, and dedication that veterans bring to the table. As such, we actively seek veterans to join our team and contribute to our mission to secure our ever-changing world. In this blog post, we share the story of one of our Veterans Alliance members, Mark Joynes, CD, and highlight the parallel between his military experience and the rewarding career opportunities he has built at Entrust over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>The Road to PKI</p>
<p>Mark embarked on his career in the Canadian military in 1976. He started as a ground and air-to-ground photographer and spent eight years serving in Canada and West Germany during the Cold War era. However, his true transformation began when he was commissioned from the ranks and trained in the Security Branch. In his last four years, he served in the Computer Security Shop of Defense Headquarters, diving into the very early days of computer security (and before any thought of Zero Trust technologies).</p>
<p>Mark’s exposure to computer security continued in 1985 when he attended a secure systems design course at NCSC in Baltimore. He was later assigned as a Lieutenant to the Computer Security Shop, highlighting the military’s recognition of his abilities and potential in cybersecurity. Soon after leaving the military, Mark was with Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) as the Canadian government deployed the Canadian PKI root. This experience laid the foundation for his now 30-year expertise with PKI (public key infrastructure), a pivotal technology that has shaped data security.</p>
<p>PKI and Mark’s Contributions</p>
<p>Mark’s journey in the military led him to become a PKI Product Marketing Director at Entrust, where he plays a crucial role in driving the commercialization of our comprehensive ePassport PKI architecture. Leveraging his extensive experience, Mark was instrumental in deploying CSCAs (Country Signing Certification Authorities) and signers in the UK, US, and Singapore. His ambitious vision also led to the development of the EAC (Extended Access Control) based PKI investment for 2nd generation ePassports, setting new standards in the European market.</p>
<p>As a result of Mark’s contributions, Entrust now provides the trust architecture for over 40 countries worldwide. In fact, approximately 50% of the ePassports in circulation feature the signed booklets from Entrust PKI, a testament to the trust and confidence placed in our technology.</p>
<p>Why Veterans Make a Great Fit for Our Company</p>
<p>We understand that the military instills exceptional qualities in individuals, including agility, empowerment, and a sense of urgency. These traits, combined with a “can-do” attitude and a passion for security, align perfectly with the opportunities available at Entrust.</p>
<p>In addition to appreciating the valuable skills veterans bring, we also recognize the importance of fostering capability and supporting individuals in realizing their ambitions. Our company culture emphasizes leadership development and personal growth, ensuring that each team member can contribute to our collective goals while fulfilling their own aspirations.</p>

  <p>The healthcare industry has long grappled with the challenge of delivering the retail-like consumer experiences that patients and members demand. According to a Harris Poll, 67% of patients described every healthcare step as a chore, and 62% believed the system was inherently confusing<a>1</a>. Yet, in the pursuit to improve healthcare experiences, both payers and providers face a host of challenges that are often at odds:</p>

  Provide streamlined experiences across the growing digital health ecosystem (including third parties) – yet avoid fraud, account takeover (ATO), ransomware, and breaches. 
	 Meet the demands for innovative patient- and member-facing services – but not at the expense of compliance with HIPAA, CCPA, and other stringent regulations. 
	 Create operational efficiency and achieve cost savings – while simultaneously looking for ways to improve consumer satisfaction and increase revenue. 
 <p>The remedy to these seemingly conflicting challenges lies in an enterprise-grade identity and access management (IAM) platform that provides the foundation for delivering consumer experiences to keep patients and members coming back for more. The following are a few examples of how healthcare leaders are using digital identity to revolutionize healthcare experiences that acquire and retain consumers, and drive profitability.</p>

  Build Personalized, Secure, Seamless Experiences: Use a no-code approach to build consumer journey experiences with features such as progressive profiling, passwordless authentication, and AI-informed threat detection. 
	 Give Consumers Control with Self-Service: Drive engagement while reducing operational costs by giving patients and members control over their profile, login, and data sharing preferences with self-service functions. 
	 Get A Single View of Your Consumer: Get a single, organization-wide view of a patient or member to facilitate personalized, omnichannel experiences and drive customized services across all lines of business. 
	 Add Speed to Digital Services: Accelerate the retrieval of identity-related information across all legacy and modern solutions to deliver improved application performance and user experiences. 
	 Gain Privacy Protection and Anti-Fraud Capabilities: Enhance consumer interactions, brand loyalty, and cost-savings through privacy protection, compliance features, and AI-powered anti-fraud capabilities. 
	 Achieve Interoperability and Build Secure Partner Services: Bridge the gaps in your hybrid IT environments, unlock siloed data, and safely expand your digital ecosystem to partners for value-added services that boost revenue. 
 <p>Adopting ForgeRock's robust digital identity platform is your gateway to today's era of consumer-centric healthcare experiences.</p>

   ICC DSI’s recently published Key Trade Documents and Data Elements kicks off with this beautiful diagram: Figure 1: ICC DSI’s beautiful diagram.

<p>ICC DSI’s recently published <a href="https://www.dsi.iccwbo.org/_files/ugd/8e49a6_2d93b2f219cf404ab91bafd028e31fcc.pdf">Key Trade Documents and Data Elements</a> kicks off with this beautiful diagram:</p>Figure 1: ICC DSI’s beautiful diagram.<p>The diagram displays the data elements, many of which are duplicated, that belong to seven major global trade documents. The red and green circles at the bottom denote the trade parties responsible for exchanging the documents.</p><p>From a modern technology perspective, the top row screams Linked Data. The bottom part maps equally well to Verifiable Credentials’ digital signatures issuance and downstream verification.</p><p>We will explore this further based on this sample implementation:</p>Figure 2: Sample implementation: two issuers, carrier and seller respectively issue and present BL and PL to a shipper, which in turn presents both documents to&nbsp;customs. Actors <p>On the ICC DSI diagram, Packing Lists are exchanged from Seller/Exporter to Buyer/Importer. While true, this is not the full story; for example, Customs also require Packing List documentation.</p>Figure 3: The Three Party Model. Source: <a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/WhitePaper_VerifiableCredentials-CrossBorderTrade_September2022.pdf">UN/CEFACT</a>.<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials data model</a> maps perfectly to how trade documents are actually passed through multiple parties along the supply chain. Throughout the entirety of the supply chain, data can be verified, cryptographically tying back to the original&nbsp;issuer.</p> Relationships <p>The top row of ICC DSI’s diagram lists numerous relationships, which can be broadly categorized as Collections, Repetition, and Relationships.</p> Document Pouches <p>Documents are often presented to the same actor at once, in a “pouch.” A pouch of documents is expected to be related in customs and trade finance use&nbsp;cases.</p>Figure 4: A data graph representing a Packing List and a Bill of Lading Verifiable Credentials, joined together as part of the same Document&nbsp;Pouch.<p>Above, two credentials are joined by the same <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#workflow-instance">Workflow Instance</a>, explicitly indicating relation across multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>.</p> Inter-Document References <p>Documents typically carry identifiers and reference each other. For example, a Commercial Invoice typically references a Purchase Order, usually with a Purchase Order number, which is unique to the two organizations’ business relationship.</p>Figure 5: Expanding data graph elements, illustrating common nodes and repeated data elements.<p>As you can see on figure 5, both the Packing List and the Bill of Lading references the same Unique Resource Identifier (the yellow&nbsp;node).</p><p>Note that the trade parties are also represented by the same green nodes, referenced from both documents. “Seller Inc.” is the Issuer, Seller and Ship From party on the Packing List, and the consignor on the Bill of Lading. This is because the documents reference URIs, in this case Decentralized Identifiers.</p> Repeating Elements <p>Non-identified values are usually just repeated on the documents where they are required. For example, a weight measurement is typically not identified (although it could be), so the values are repeated whenever required. For example, a shipment’s product Gross Weight is listed both the Packing List and the Commercial Invoice.</p><p>Also shown on figure 5, the goods weights and measurements are repeated on the Packing List and the Bill of Lading. Automating a consistency check to confirm that the documents represent the same shipment is trivial when the data comes with strong semantics in this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>I wrote this article based on a quick implementation of ICC DSI’s model using prevalent, modern web technologies. This was quickly done using the open source for example these <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#PackingListCredential">PL</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#MultiModalBillOfLadingCredential">BL</a> schemas, and our Verifiable Data Platform for credentials management and constructing the corresponding <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/adapters/urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j">data&nbsp;graphs</a>.</p><p>The intention of this article has been to present a direction, from the ICC DSI model towards a scalable, interoperable implementation model.</p><p>Similarly, talking about Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers in the abstract can be rather alienating. But as we have seen, they address some very tangible elements of global trade, beautifully introduced by the ICC&nbsp;DSI.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project and author of the W3C Traceability Vocabulary specification.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>Sign up for free on Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/digital-trade-document-relationships-2f263b410e3">Digital Trade Document Relationships</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The holiday season is a time of gift-giving and therefore increased online shopping, which naturally increases the risk of cyber threats. As we shop for presents online, we expose our digital identities to potential risks. Cybercriminals are always looking for opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. In this blog, I’ll provide essential tips for keeping your digital identity safe while holiday shopping.</p>
 Use Strong, Unique Passwords 
<p>One of the most basic yet crucial steps in safeguarding your digital identity is using strong, unique passwords for each online account. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like “123456” or “password”. Instead, create complex passwords that include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<p>To manage these passwords and encourage the use of strong passwords, consider using a trusted password manager, which can generate and store them securely.</p>
 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your online accounts. An example of this is Two-Factor Authentication which typically involves something you know (your password) and something you have (e.g. a code sent to your mobile device). The other option is something you are, which generally means biometric authentication – such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Enabling MFA can significantly reduce the chances of unauthorised access to your accounts, even if someone obtains your password.</p>
 Shop from Secure Websites 
<p>When holiday shopping online, always make sure you are on a secure website before providing any personal or financial information. Look for “https://” in the URL and pay attention to trust badges or seals from reputable security providers. Be cautious when dealing with unfamiliar or suspicious websites. And remember, even familiar websites may be duplicated to phish your login details.</p>
 Avoid Public Wi-Fi 
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks may be convenient, but they are often not secure. Avoid making online purchases or accessing sensitive information while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you need to shop online while on the go, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and add an extra layer of security.</p>
 Be Wary of Phishing Scams 
<p>Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to trick people into revealing sensitive information. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or links, especially if they seem too good to be true. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Always verify the sender’s authenticity before sharing any personal data.</p>
 Monitor Your Accounts 
<p>Frequently monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorised transactions. Set up account alerts to notify you of any unusual activity. The sooner you catch any fraudulent charges, the easier it is to resolve the issue and prevent further damage to your digital identity.</p>
 Keep Software Updated 
<p>Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and antivirus software to patch any security vulnerabilities. Outdated software can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain access to your device or personal information.</p>
 Use a Protected Payment Method for Online Purchases 
<p>Protected payment methods offer better protection against fraudulent charges than standard debit cards, for example. When making online purchases, consider using a protected payment methods such as a credit cards or payment apps, especially with MFA setup, which reduces your risk of hackers being able to access your details and account.</p>
 Educate Yourself 
<p>Staying informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices is essential. Educate yourself and your family members on the risks and preventive measures to ensure a safe online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Holiday shopping online offers convenience and access to a vast array of products, but it also exposes your digital identity to potential risks. By following these essential tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of falling victim to cyberattacks and protect your sensitive information. Stay vigilant, use secure practices, and enjoy a safe and joyful online shopping experience during the holiday season.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In their constant quest for keeping organizations secure, cybersecurity professionals always need to look into the future in order to assess the likelihood of potential attacks. They need to combine their knowledge of the past and the present with their evaluation of the development of prominent attack vectors and come to a risk assessment for their work in the future.</p>
<p>In his discussion with our CEO Berthold Kerl, Jonathan Blanchard Smith, Director and Fellow at SAMI Consulting, suggests that “foresight consulting is explicitly not looking into the crystal ball”. Instead, when he and his team created the SAFIRE scenarios for the European Commission, they focused on the fact that there is not just one possible future but many. Hence, you need not only prepare for the future, but for several futures.</p>
<p>Tune in to Jonathan’s cyberfile today and take a glimpse into his two-part workshop on future scenario analysis which he will give at cyberevolution 2023 on Tuesday, November 14. Join us in Frankfurt or online.</p>
<p>Part one “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5650/1">Shaping the cybersecurity landscape of the future using the SAFIRE Scenarios</a>” deals with exploring the intricacies of future scenario analysis using the cutting-edge SAFIRE methodology and decoding the interplay of societal, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors that shape our digital future.</p>
<p>Part two “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5653/1">SAFIRE Scenarios – four Futures for the world (continued)</a>” is all about enriching your strategic thinking and scenario-building skills with the SAFIRE approach.</p>

<p>Fission is the lead organizer for IPFS Connect Istanbul. During the event, we are thrilled to be putting on our own workshop showcasing IPVM. </p><p>IPVM, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, aims to be the easiest, fastest, most secure, and open way to run WebAssembly functions anywhere.</p><p>Using content-addressed data, public key infrastructure (PKI), and capabilities, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on pre-negotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p><p>If you've been following our work at Fission, you'll note that IPVM has been our vision from day one. But we knew that before we could get to distributed compute, we had to build the auth and data layers first. Now that <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> are done, we're ready to launch <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>. </p><p>The IPVM workshop will be the first-ever interactive workshop. You can get hands-on without having to go to the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">repo</a>. Here are the details:</p><p>IPVM Workshop: Running WebAssembly Workflows with IPFS</p><p>November 16th, 1:30 - 3:30 PM</p><p>Join the Fission team in a live workshop about the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM), an open protocol for decentralized computation.</p><p>We'll be walking through how to set up and install a Homestar node, an IPVM reference implementation written in Rust optimized for running WebAssembly (Wasm) functions in workflows. </p><p>Workshop participants should bring their laptops. We'll walk through the following experiences:</p>  Install a Homestar node  Connect to Homestar node peers in the workshop  Run example workflows  Share results of computation between local peers  Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions   <p>Let's break each of these experiences down:</p><p>Install a Homestar node and connect to Homestar node peers - Homestar is Fission's Rust + Wasm implementation of IPVM. During the workshop, users will be able to install Homestar on their machines and connect to other Homestar nodes </p><p>Sneak Peak at the Homestar Mascot!</p>Homestar Mascot designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>Run Example Workflows - A workflow is a series of individual tasks (also known as a step function) wired together. In the IPVM Workshop, we will demonstrate a couple of workflows to showcase some of the capabilities of IPVM. </p><p>There will also be a control panel that will serve as the UI where the user can track their activity, view the receipts they are outputting, review pre-deployed WebAssembly tasks, and more.</p><p>Share results of computation between local peers - This is a fun one! One of the impressive features of IPVM is the more IPVM is used, the more efficient it is! That’s because every time a task is run, the output is saved in the network as a CID and is used in future computations. Think of it like global caching! The technical term for this is memoization. Homestar keeps a table (like a spreadsheet) of the ID for the function, its arguments, and its result. It allows the user to skip running the task and substitute the result. Just like IPFS's table that associates hashes to data to let anyone find and download the content, this does the same for function results. During the workshop, we will see this play out in real-time as we run computations and share those results with our fellow workshop attendees/node peers.</p><p>Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions - Once attendees start getting comfortable with IPVM, they can begin to play with workflows, tweak parameters, and even bring their own Wasm functions.</p> <p>Who should attend this workshop?</p><p>IPVM is for Front End Web Developers</p><p>Anything you would normally need a backend for, IPVM can do for you. For example, IPVM can help you resize images. If you need to parse a large text document and it's too big to do locally on your machine, give it to IPVM. IPVM can pull data off of IPFS so you can operate on it and generate a new CID to pass around. You can even build map tiling. OpenStreetMap, for example, utilizes too much data for your phone or browser to work with, but you could parallelize that work across many machines and have them send you back the rendered map.</p><p>IPVM is an excellent serverless computing option. Whether you want to use the cloud, someone else's machine, your own machine, or a mix, IPVM is the solution you've been looking for.</p><p>IPVM is for Web3 Developers</p><p>Similar to a computation rollup, but instead of needing to be on-chain, it also extends off-chain. Imagine if you need to call something out in the real world, like Twitter, Bluesky, or an email server. You want to talk to external systems. </p><p>For example, say you want to take your NFT and make it gray-scaled. </p><p>Option 1: Do the image manipulation on-chain. The problem with this is the cost of gas would be prohibitively high. As in thousands and thousands of dollars. </p><p>Option 2: Run a server. This would work, but now you're no longer Web3 and paying money to a centralized cloud provider. </p><p>Option 3: IPVM. You get the benefits of decentralization, but the functions can run off-chain, saving you money and compute resources. </p><p>In the same way that IPFS saves developers from storing their NFTs on-chain, IPVM saves developers from having to run computations on-chain.</p><p>IPVM is for ETHGlobal Hackathon Participants</p><p>For those participating in the <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul">ETHGlobal Istanbul Hackathon</a>, IPVM is a great tool to have in your toolkit. You'll probably do some computations locally, but if they slow your machine down, you can always push them to the hosted IPVM node to do the heavy lifting. Unlike centralized cloud platforms that require users to go through the network for everything, IPVM lets you choose where you want to do your computations, so you are always in control of how you allocate your resources.</p> <p>In conclusion, we're so excited for you to get your hands on Homestar. This is an early version for folks to experience and learn how decentralized compute with content addressing can work. Run it yourself and get ready to plug into a larger network of function writers and node providers. </p><p>Sign up for the IPVM Workshop by purchasing a ticket to <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect Istanbul</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/kr5UedcVEcdnnYdi7">letting us know which of the workshops you'll be attending</a>, including options from our friends at Iroh and Web3 Storage + Saturn (you can attend all three!)</p><p> Can't make it to the event?

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), compliance with the FATF Travel Rule isn’t just about adhering to regulations — it’s also a significant operational consideration that impacts the bottom&nbsp;line.</p><p>Travel Rule solutions come with a variety of pricing models, each with its distinct advantages and challenges. To simplify it, we have prepared this comprehensive guide that demystifies these models, providing VASPs with the insights needed to make informed decisions that balance cost with compliance.</p> Sign-up Fee + Annual Fee&nbsp;Model <p>In the sign-up fee plus annual fee model, VASPs pay an initial fee to gain access to the Travel Rule compliance service. After this initial payment, they are charged recurring annual fees that cover ongoing access to the service, including regular updates and customer&nbsp;support.</p><p>Sygna Bridge, for instance, follows this model. It requires VASPs to pay an upfront fee for integration into their network, followed by an annual fee that provides ongoing compliance support and secure information exchange capabilities.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Predictable annual budgeting due to fixed&nbsp;costs.  Continuous access to compliance updates and&nbsp;support.  Potentially lower costs for VASPs with high transaction volumes due to spreading the fee across numerous transactions.  <p>Cons:</p>  High initial sign-up costs can be a barrier to entry for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Annual fees apply regardless of actual usage, which may not be cost-effective during periods of low activity.  Less flexibility to scale costs with the business’s transactional demands.   Monthly Charge&nbsp;Model <p>The monthly charge model entails a regular monthly fee that covers the operational costs of the compliance solution. This cost often becomes more economical as more members join, thanks to shared expenses.</p><p>An example of this is TRUST by Coinbase, which allocates operational costs across its members on a monthly basis, with the cost per member potentially decreasing as more join the initiative.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Consistent monthly expenses make financial planning straightforward.  As more members join, individual costs can decrease due to shared operational expenses.  No large upfront payments are required.  <p>Cons:</p>  Costs may be relatively higher for smaller VASPs with fewer transactions.  Monthly fees accrue regardless of service usage, which can be inefficient for intermittent compliance needs.  Possible overpayment during slower business&nbsp;months.   Two-Tiered Pricing&nbsp;Model <p>A two-tiered pricing model offers a base service tier at a fixed cost and an advanced tier with more features, which may have customized pricing.</p><p>Notabene, for example, provides a ‘SafeTransact-Rise’ plan for basic compliance requirements and a ‘Full-Feature’ platform that caters to more complex needs, with specific pricing determined following a product demonstration.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Offers a choice between basic and advanced services to match different compliance needs.  Lower tier may provide an affordable entry point for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Higher tier can be customized, potentially offering a better fit for larger VASPs with complex&nbsp;needs.  <p>Cons:</p>  The basic tier may not be sufficient for all compliance requirements, leading to eventual upgrade&nbsp;costs.  Customization in the higher tier can be more expensive and time-consuming to negotiate.  VASPs may end up paying for unused features in the tiered structure.   Free Trial and Premium Plan&nbsp;Model <p>This model offers a complimentary trial period with fundamental service access, after which users can opt for premium plans that provide a wider range of services for a&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Sumsub exemplifies this model by giving VASPs a six-month free trial for their compliance services, after which there are options to upgrade to more comprehensive premium or enterprise plans.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Free trial period allows for testing the service without financial commitment.  Opportunity to evaluate the solution’s effectiveness before investing in a premium&nbsp;plan.  <p>Cons:</p>  After the trial, VASPs must commit to premium plans, which can be&nbsp;costly.  Transitioning from free to paid service may require budget reallocation.  Premium plans may include features that some VASPs don’t need but still pay&nbsp;for.   Membership Fee&nbsp;Model <p>With a membership fee model, organizations pay an annual fee based on the company’s size and type, which grants them access to the service network and its resources.</p><p>Open VASP, for example, uses this model where the fee structure varies based on the size and type of the company, catering to both VASPs and non-VASPs.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Annual membership provides clarity on yearly expenses.  Access to a network of compliance solutions and peers in the industry.  Fees can be tailored to company size, making it fairer for smaller organizations.  <p>Cons:</p>  Fees are due regardless of the level of service utilization.  Membership costs can be substantial, especially for larger&nbsp;VASPs.  Additional costs may arise for services not covered by the membership fee.   Pay-as-you-go Model <p>The pay-as-you-go approach is flexible and cost-efficient, particularly suitable for entities with fluctuating service needs, where they pay solely for the services utilized.</p><p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers this model, allowing VASPs to pay in alignment with their transaction volumes, avoiding upfront costs, and ensuring the scalability of the compliance solution.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Ultimate flexibility with payments aligned to actual service&nbsp;usage.  Ideal for VASPs with fluctuating transaction volumes.  No upfront costs, allowing better cash flow management.  <p>Cons:</p>  Can become expensive, in general, if transaction volumes are consistently high.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The diverse pricing models of Travel Rule solutions, as we have explored, cater to the varied needs and capabilities of VASPs — ranging from startups to established financial institutions.</p><p>Each model presents a distinct approach to cost management, from the predictability of sign-up and annual fees to the flexibility of pay-as-you-go options, such as the one offered by Veriscope. This particular model is designed to adapt organically to the VASP’s activity levels, providing a cost-effective solution for those with fluctuating transaction volumes.</p><p>VASPs must weigh these options carefully, considering both short-term financial implications and long-term compliance strategies. Whether seeking a trial to test the waters, a simple membership to join a community of peers, or a comprehensive service plan for extensive transaction needs, the key lies in selecting a model that aligns with the organization’s transaction patterns, size, and growth trajectory.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is a testament to a VASP’s commitment to not only meet the regulatory standards but to embrace the evolving digital asset landscape with a forward-thinking approach to compliance and operational excellence. The pay-as-you-go model exemplifies this commitment, offering an agile and scalable financial framework that stands as a testament to Veriscope’s understanding of the sector’s dynamic&nbsp;nature.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			<p>6th November 2023, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terazo.network/">Terazo</a>, a groundbreaking private market investment platform in India, has joined forces with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform, to spearhead the first regulated tokenized real estate asset in India under the regulatory sandbox framework established by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (<a href="https://www.ifsca.gov.in/">IFSCA</a>). IFSCA is a dynamic and forward-thinking regulator committed to driving India’s fintech innovation and propelling the nation to the forefront of the global financial services landscape</p>
<p>Terazo’s involvement and authorization to operate within the sandbox strengthens investor confidence and enables the platform to present premium private assets to a broader range of investors.

<p>Oryx, a ~USD 50 million greenfield development, is the first regulated tokenized real estate project in India.

The ~8,50,000 sq ft Grade A Commercial Property located in the heart of GIFT SEZ, India’s first global financial services hub, and is positioned as the first step to revolutionize the real estate investment landscape in India.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Tokeny, Terazo has utilized its SaaS tokenization platform to seamlessly issue and administer asset backed tokens on the Polygon blockchain. Leveraging Tokeny’s infrastructure and the open-source <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 protocol</a>, Terazo can seamlessly incorporate compliance measures and automate ownership transfers, simplifying asset management for investors.</p>
<p>This partnership also ensures fully traceable and unalterable cap tables on the blockchain, granting investors unmediated ownership and transparency. Furthermore, Terazo can effortlessly carry out real-time procedures, including the distribution and token recovery tool of tokens to investors.</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to launch a blockchain-based marketplace, starting from tokenization of real estate assets in India. Our vision is to democratize access to high-quality private assets such as real estate, private equity, venture capital and improve liquidity in the market. With Tokeny's expertise and technology, we are confident that we can deliver a world-class solution for investors.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-zaveri-6a35a737/">Shaan Zaveri</a>Partner at Terazo       We're excited to support Terazo's mission to democratize private market investment from India.

  November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada – Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.

<p>November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing efforts to maximize available corporate resources, the Company continues to dedicate efforts to its Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Aftermath Islands Metaverse programs. However, given the difficult market conditions, changes in government’s dedicated efforts with digital identity, changing market demands for new fintech services including financial card products, and despite the continuing efforts of Management and the Board of Directors, the Company continues to find itself having difficulty meeting its required capital objectives to further its program development and execution.</p>



<p>On August 21, 2023, the Company announced that it had received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; The offer was contingent on financing amounts and terms to be agreed between the Companies. The proposed buyer has been unsuccessful in its efforts to raise the requisite financing.&nbsp; The Company remains on cordial terms with the proposed buyer, but the non-binding offer has now expired, and it is not expected to be renewed at this time.</p>



<p>An ongoing result of these difficulties resulted in a cease trade order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 5, 2023.&nbsp; The Company cannot raise capital directly into Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. at this time due to both the cease trade order and its inability to file the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 2022 and its subsequent quarters. The Company anticipates upon raising capital that it will have sufficient resources to file the necessary statements to apply for the removal, in part, or in whole of the cease trade order.&nbsp; However, currently, the Company does not envisage, at least in the foreseeable short term, a revocation of the current cease trade order under the current circumstances.</p>



<p>On June 30, 2023, the Company filed Form 51-102F6V, Statement of Director and Named Executive Officer Compensation.&nbsp; This statement reflected the compensation earned by each member of management and outlined the outstanding unpaid compensation owed to each as of December 31, 2022.&nbsp; No compensation has been paid to management from the date of that filing and accrued compensation now dates back from April 1, 2022, for each member of management.&nbsp; Additional compensation has also been accrued and is outstanding to other employees, consultants, and vendors. Despite the Company’s inability to provide compensation, management, employees and select vendors have largely continued to support the Company’s efforts, including some members of management, on a priority basis, have provided limited loans to the Company for certain critical expenses, which are deemed a related party transaction.</p>



<p>The Company would like to report the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer, Craig McCannell, effective November 1, 2023.&nbsp; Mr. McCannell has offered to make himself available as time allows to support the Company in any future requests related to his former position and / or transition efforts, and we thank him for his years of service to the Company and wish him success in his future endeavors. Management intends to work with the Board of Directors, in due course, to create a selection committee for a new CFO.</p>



<p>“Even under these most difficulty circumstances, the team is working to resolve the current challenges that we are facing as an organization.&nbsp; Further, we believe that the public markets for small and micro-cap markets have greatly suffered under the current market conditions, which may include naked and short selling that has occurred across North America.&nbsp; It is the Company’s belief that it has been the victim of these manipulative trading practices, negatively impacting the Company and our shareholders.&nbsp; We believe that this process has greatly affected the Company’s share price contributing to the Company’s inability to raise the necessary funds to proceed with normal operations, including the regulatory requirements for the Company’s listing on the CSE and compensating its management, employees, and other partners.&nbsp; However, we remain resolved, to the best of our ability, to work to right the ship and continue to move forward,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies. </p>



<p>The Company continues to dedicate efforts to Aftermath Islands and its complementary programs including Lost Kingdom of T’Sara (LKoT), its play to earn (P2E) platform.&nbsp; In its first year, LKoT users generated over 9.2 million Resource Pack NFTs.&nbsp; The Aftermath Islands metaverse platform has continued to operate in Beta having achieved approximately US$3 Million in gross sales, and subject to further funding by Aftermath Islands, the Company expects Aftermath Islands to continue to develop the platform.</p>



<p>As part of the AIM Creator program (originally Meta Hero Project) Meta Karaoke, an online AI powered Avatar performance platform, was acquired by Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited, as originally announced on August 3, 2022, from Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited, a related party of the Company.&nbsp; Further to this agreement, given the current economic and changing market conditions, Aftermath Islands has not fulfilled its agreed upon obligations to pay the appropriate fees for program sales under the terms of the agreement as well as to continue to fund the further development of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;The parties have agreed that rather than terminating the agreement, the matter will be settled by transferring back up to 80% ownership of the Meta Karaoke program, which is currently in a development stage, to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited and Oasis Digital Studios will retain a combined initial minority equity interest in the new entity of approximately 20%.&nbsp; Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”), the transfer back to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited constitutes a “related party transaction”.&nbsp; The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Company’s Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the assets being transferred back do not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101).&nbsp; A material change report will not be filed by the Company as the transfer does not constitute a material change.</p>

  <p>Thousands of customers have tested or deployed Microsoft Entra ID Governance since it launched on July 1, 2023, seeing the value in governing the identities of their workforce. Many of those customers have asked about extending this governance to the identities of their business guests—contractors, partners, and external collaborators—to more fully follow least privilege access principles while still enabling seamless collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're helping organizations to more easily manage this situation by creating a new ID Governance license for business guests. This license will operate on a monthly active usage (MAU) model. Customers will be able to acquire licenses matching their anticipated business guest MAU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our customers expand least privilege access to their business guests, ID Governance for business guest licenses will be priced at $0.75 per MAU, and we anticipate making them available in spring 2024. In the interim, organizations that govern the identities of their employees with ID Governance can govern the identities of their business guests for no additional cost.&nbsp;Existing Azure AD External ID customers are grandfathered to continue using the subset of identity governance features that are included in Entra ID P1 and P2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why govern the identities of business guests?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business guests are external collaborators who need access to an organization’s resources and applications for a specific purpose and duration. Examples of business guests include contractors, consultants, vendors, or partners. Business guests pose unique challenges for identity governance, as they often have dynamic and unpredictable access needs, and they may not follow internal policies and standards. Without proper governance, business guests can introduce access risks, such as over-privileged accounts, orphaned accounts, or unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance helps address these challenges by enabling you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Define and enforce access policies for business guests, such as requiring sponsorship, approval, and attestation.&nbsp; 
 Automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of business guest accounts, based on their project or contract duration.&nbsp; 
 Monitor and audit the access activities and behaviors of business guests and detect and remediate any anomalies or violations.&nbsp; 
 Provide a method for internal sponsors to review and approve their requests.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this step, our customers can ensure that all identities in their organization are governed.&nbsp;Thank you for partnering with us to help protect your digital estates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge was set to provide insights into a pressing geographic location in Africa, Marsabit, Kenya. The ecological well-being of Marsabit has hung in a delicate equilibrium in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Climate fluctuations and human undertakings sway the volatility of the general climate in Marsabit, Kenya. This challenge was designed to challenge participants in making accurate, dependable forecasts that could have a profound impact on risk mitigation, insurance pricing, and crop prediction in the region. Data scientists participating in this challenge had the potential to steer the adoption of sustainable practices within the region, as well as have their model and insights shared with decision-makers tackling this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Ocean was fortunate to host this data challenge in collaboration with <a href="https://shamba.network/">Shamba Network</a>, a leader in monitoring and reporting verification leveraging blockchain technology. Shamba fueled this competition with relevant data sets to conduct our assessment. The data sets provided included:</p>  eVIIRS-NDVI Historical data  Dynamic GeoAPI&nbsp;data  geoJSON coordinates of Marsabit county in&nbsp;Kenya  <p>We received a basket of in-depth reports about this subject. After thorough grading and review by an evaluation committee of experts, we awarded three winners to be compensated for their efforts. The winning reports are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize) <p>Nicolas’ report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59</a></p><p>A highlight of this report is Nicolas’ fantastic demonstration of walking readers through the NDVI historical data. As&nbsp;follows:</p><p>“This is in the form of 808&nbsp;.tif images. Each contains 912 by 882 pixels, which have a value between 0 and 255, corresponding to the NDVI value at each&nbsp;point.</p><p>The file name gives us an indication of the year the data is from; for example, ea1207_COG.tif is the 7th&nbsp;.tif picture of 2012. We have the tif starting from this one, ea1207_COG, to ea2316_COG, and then six of them are in the form ea2317m_COG and seem to be negatives/acquired through another&nbsp;process.</p><p>Except for 2012, which starts at 07, and 2023, which stops at 16 or 23m, for each year, we have 72&nbsp;.tif pictures that contain the NDVI value on each&nbsp;point.</p><p>From this 0 to 255 pixel value, it is easy to get the NDVI value at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>You want first to convert the pixel values of each&nbsp;.tif file using the&nbsp;formula:</p><p>NDVI = Pixel value-100100</p><p>The dynamic GeoAPI data asset (for the last 1 month, with 10 days lag) of eVIIRS-NDVI for Marsabit county of Kenya (updated).”</p><p>Nicolas had the highest accuracy metrics overall, which indicated the model created in this report was the best fit. However, one thing that stood out to the scoring committee from a qualitative point of view is that Nicolas’ model only predicted 5 days in advance (i.e., one data point since the data has a 5-day granularity.)</p><p>For this and a stellar presentation layout, Nicolas has been awarded 1st place for this data challenge.</p> 2nd place — Andrey Bessalov ($1500&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540</a></p><p>Andrey’s model predicted a season in advance, differentiating this report from other contestants. This seasonal prediction is longer term, hence more useful for taking action (e.g., providing anticipatory aid). So, Andrey’s model had lower accuracy than the winning report (MAE of 0.027 vs. 0.01), but it’s more useful given its longer time&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>Andrey’s preprocessing of the data for time series analysis, particularly testing and handling of stationarity, was a more rigorous approach relative to other reports submitted in this challenge. This could be down to the fact that Andrey used SARIMA while other podium finishing reports used linear regression, and the latter model is not as affected by stationarity in the data as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Pulled from Andrey’s report, the image below shows the average NDVI values with the addition of peak points highlighted as green and orange (max and min), calculated using the scipy.signal.find_peaks() function.</p><p>We see a clear seasonal structure of the graph with different amplitudes of fluctuations. We can also see that the frequency of fluctuations varies slightly from season to season, but in general, the spread of these values is&nbsp;small.</p><p>We have two seasons per&nbsp;year:</p><p>First season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Feb&nbsp;25  Reaches peak value on May 12 (76 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Aug 22 (178 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Second season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Aug&nbsp;22  Reaches peak value on Nov 29 (99 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Feb 25 (187 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Andrey used more sophisticated models (SARIMA and XGBOOST), while alternative reports only used regression models. While sophisticated models are only sometimes better than simpler ones, our scoring committee thought Andrey explored models more commonly used in time series modeling. This report was also able to show the difference in performance between the two different types of models and thus had a more comprehensive analytical process. Based on these highlights, second place has been awarded to Andrey’s&nbsp;report.</p> 3rd place — Mint ($1000&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4</a></p><p>Mint was awarded a 3rd place finish amongst the participants in this data challenge. Mint’s report provided great detail and insights into the transformation &amp; feature creation portion of this challenge. The two-legged task of data transformation and feature creation included the following scoring sections:</p>  Transformation &amp; Imputation: Address any missing values, outliers, or skewed distributions in the dataset. Justify your chosen methodologies.  Feature Creation: Generate new features that enhance the model’s predictive capability. This could include calculating rolling averages, seasonality components, or other relevant&nbsp;metrics.  <p>To showcase this terrific showcase of data science skills, we can see below from Mint’s report that details Time-Related Feature Engineering:</p><p>In the realm of time-related feature engineering, the goal is often to encapsulate the inherent cycles and periodicities within the data. However, simply throwing raw Ordinal time-related features in the mix is unlikely to yield optimal results. Why? Because These raw features do not inherently understand the cyclical nature of time. For example, a raw month feature would treat December and January as vastly different, not recognizing the seamless transition between the end of one year and the start of the&nbsp;next.</p><p>The image above shows&nbsp;us:</p><p>● Ordinal Features: The chart highlights the limitations of using raw ordinal time-related features, which fail to capture the cyclical nature of time. For example, the transition from December to January appears as a discontinuity.</p><p>● Trigonometric Features: Sine and cosine transformations are depicted to capture the cyclic behavior of time, peaking, and troughing in line with natural cycles. However, they may not capture month-specific nuances effectively.</p><p>● Periodic Spline-Based Features: The graph illustrates the power of using splines, which allow the model to focus on specific months. Using the “periodic” extrapolation parameter ensures a smooth transition between December and January, effectively tackling the discontinuity issue.</p><p>Mint’s ability to visualize the data provided, offer insights &amp; takeaways from the issue, and present these findings in business-ready format were key characteristics that awarded this report a podium&nbsp;finish.</p> Summary <p>This challenge showed a great experiment testing machine learning tactics applied to a real-world issue &amp; a changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>Can other regions globally benefit from predictive analytics from a data challenge with Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Reach out to us in our discord <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">#data-science-hub</a> channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4</a></p><p>To see past, current, and future data challenges sponsored by Ocean, please visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Jürgen Schulze</a></p><p>The side effects of (re)generative AI impacting cyber security</p>
<p>Professionally paranoids can't but look at ChatGPT and its siblings from a risk perspective. Well, at least initially. We tend to think in risk vectors, threat actors and alike. Leaving all innovative benefits of the technology aside, there are sensitive elements that require attention. This is how we currently deal with this kind of innovation: Impulse driven …</p>
<p>In a first "impulse", we try to fit what we see into the simple equation where risk equals probability times damage. As a result, we get nervous as, looking at ChatGPT and its siblings, we can do the math neither on probability nor on the potential damage that the use of this technology could bear for us. The deeper we drill, the more questions we get. Scientifically sound answers drip through the tickers only at a slow pace since many of those require research time prior to assessing the effects. And that does not happen over night.</p>
<p>In a second "impulse", we focus on the obvious: the elements, that we are familiar with and which resonate the most in public perception. I.e. those clickbaits which constantly make headlines. This can be the result of a first, publicly prominent traumatic experience in adopting a new technology. It can also be intelligent marketing where our expectations are repetitively framed in order to overshadow those risks, that are not within the "cozy" technology coloured framework of the cyber community.</p>
<p>In a third "impulse", we call for regulation and put the responsibility on the shoulders of the lawmakers as we're lacking all means of dealing with what we can't combat in the very moment. Interestingly enough, that typically does not lead to short term solutions but to a reputation disaster of the cyber community where the classic perception of us hindering innovation is taking over the public discourse. Regulation, on top, is perceived as evil. Even more than the targets of the regulatory efforts. Whoever they are.</p>
<p>In a fourth "impulse", and in absence of any progress in dealing with the tangible and intangible risks, we'll blame what will inevitably go wrong, to those who are putting this new technology to the practice and, in absence of protective measures, awareness and training, unavoidably hit wrong buttons on the way. I call that the "Lieschen Mueller-effect". The blame goes to the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>After all those impulses, we'll realize that we wasted time, efforts and money fighting the genie who is irreversibly out of the bottle rather than understanding the various risk factors, what they entail, their interdependence and which experts to consult, in dealing with those and, ultimately, mitigating their impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5394">In our workshop</a>, I'll share with you some of my findings of my book and invite you to jointly revisit a selection of those factors that detrimentally impact our cyber security infrastructure such as:&nbsp;Trust, Credibility, Identity, Authenticity, Context, Value, Bias, Control, Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Convenience, Liability, Ethics, Integrity.</p>
<p>We'll go beyond the obvious and get a better understanding on how to consciously and responsibly put new technology to action. All of that while increasing the security awareness around the use of (re)gen AI.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>I recently had the privilege to spend some time with Kumar and Pallavi to dive into the heart of the <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI)</a> Project, a pioneering initiative that stands as a testament to Bhutan’s leadership in digital trust.</p>
<p>The origins of Bhutan’s digital program were particularly fascinating for two primary reasons. Firstly, it stemmed from the necessity to empower citizens, especially those in rural areas, with access to essential financial and governmental services. A question of citizen empowerment.. Secondly, the Bhutanese leadership consciously prioritized privacy as a fundamental right for its people. What stands out in this narrative is the clear identification of needs that were not dictated by a technology-first approach. Instead, it was the requirements of empowerment and privacy that naturally led to the adoption of a digital solution, encompassing digital wallets and credentials within privacy-centric frameworks.</p>
<p>This project is not just a technological leap forward but a holistic approach that intertwines the legal, business, and technological threads to weave a robust digital identity framework. I chose to approach our discussion through the lenses of business, legal, and technology, with a deliberate focus on legal aspects first. Why? Because the legal framework is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of digital identity is built. It’s the underpinning that ensures the rights, privacy, and trust of citizens are not just considered but enshrined.</p>
<p>From there, we transitioned to the business perspective—how this digital identity initiative could catalyze growth, inclusion, and opportunity for all stakeholders. And finally, we touched on technology, the enabler, yet intentionally saved for last. In the grand scheme of things, technology is the tool, not the master; it’s the least important aspect when it comes to the values and impact on the citizens’ lives.</p>
 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Kumar, Pallavi and myself in this podcast include:<br>
<br><br>
</p> 
 
 
 
 Background on the Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI) Project&nbsp; 
<p>Project Goals and Context – What were the overall goals of the Bhutan NDI project, and how do they relate to the specific context and needs of Bhutan? Seeking to understand the project’s objectives and their alignment with the country’s unique circumstances, particularly in terms of accessibility for rural populations.</p>
<p>Financial Inclusion and Digital Identity – How does focusing on financial inclusion as a starting point influence the approach to digital identity in Bhutan? Exploring the decision to prioritize financial inclusion and how this focus shaped the development of the digital identity solution.</p>

<p>Small businesses face special challenges in managing their employee onboarding and offboarding processes with limited resources. Without a fully staffed IT or HR department, there’s often just one person covering “operations” for the whole organization. And in some companies, someone with a totally unrelated job ends up running these functions.</p>
<p>We’re like that, actually. <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">As a startup</a>, YeshID has a small staff. In addition to my founder duties, I’m the one to handle IT employee onboarding and offboarding for our team. And that’s the way we want it for now — we’re keeping overhead low so we can concentrate on building the best product. But that doesn’t mean we want to skimp on laying a good foundation for tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, efficiency and simplicity are so important. It’s not just about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-non-technical-guide-how-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-in-google-workspace/">providing an email address for new employees</a>. You have to add them to the correct organizations and groups in your Google Workspace; keep track of who has permissions for what applications; track the number and cost of app and software licenses, keep up with which teams own which services, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can help you streamline, templatize, and automate your user onboarding and offboarding procedures. In this post, I’ll talk about what to look for in a tool.</p>
 User-friendly IT onboarding and offboarding 
<p>The first thing you should consider when evaluating an onboarding solution is its user-friendliness. You need a tool that is easy for both administrators (aka you) and users to navigate. The last thing you want on your already overloaded calendar is extensive training for a complicated system. Look for a solution with an intuitive interface and a straightforward setup process.</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of a user-friendly onboarding solution is its ability to templatize and automate repetitive tasks. Look for a solution that offers customizable templates, task assignments, and email notifications. This not only saves time but also minimizes the chances of errors. You’ll also want to make sure the tool lets your employees request access to the apps they need — and that access is routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
 A secure and compliant employee onboarding and offboarding tool 
<p>Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Look for features like passwordless encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Ensure that the onboarding solution aligns with these requirements. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs.</p>
 New employee onboarding and offboarding that grows with you 
<p>Your business may be small today, but tomorrow’s looking bright! Consider whether the onboarding solution can grow with you. It should be able to accommodate a growing number of users without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that you won’t outgrow your onboarding tool as your business expands. And with the right tools, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Beware the SSO tax</a> on this one though. Some access management solutions require you to advance your engineering practices far beyond what most small- to medium-sized businesses need. Don’t settle for a solution that requires you to jump over unnecessary hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
 Cost-effective IT onboarding solutions 
<p>Until someone invents the money tree, it’s essential to consider the overall cost of the tool in relation to the value it provides. This includes licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance. Make sure you’re getting the features and support you need without breaking your budget. A cost-effective solution should offer a good balance between functionality and affordability.</p>
<p>The flip side of this one is to make sure you’re not signing up for a solution that you’ll have to grow into fast. Many of the options in this space are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
 The best onboarding and offboarding for small businesses 
<p>Identity and access management in the 21st century means digital onboarding, provisioning of the hundred-and-one software apps your org uses, plus traditional hardware setup. It’s become complex (and often frustrating) for both managers and employees. Finding the right onboarding solution for your small business can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your onboarding and offboarding processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed.

  Solving Technical Challenges

<p>Holochain is a framework that can augment the powers of blockchains by offering control, trust, and transparency in a local, private network — while also being able to reference a specific transaction, action, or other data on a public blockchain. </p><p>In a Holochain application every action is validated and has a cryptographically signed provenance. This validation does not require consensus, making it hyper scalable. It does this by using a mix of technologies from BitTorrent, git, and GNUPG. </p><p>The Fractal Tribute game is a Holochain application designed to address several technical challenges that groups and applications often encounter when looking for ways to deliver NFT content that is both dynamic and decentralized. It also addresses the challenge of bridging state across decentralized systems, in this case from Holochain to an EVM blockchain. Those technical challenges are solved in Fractal Tribute which enables permissionless minting of dynamic content, facilitates the distribution of raised funds based on player activity, all whilst ensuring compatibility with existing NFT metadata consumers, like OpenSea.</p> Permissionless Minting of Content <p>Although there is growing popularity for entirely on-chain NFTs, for the most part NFT content is stored somewhere off-chain for reasons of scalability. It is prohibitively expensive to store content on a blockchain. So, the usual approaches to this would be to either store the content on a network like IPFS or Arweave, or put it behind a centralized API. The former is obviously the preferable option, however if you’d like the content to be dynamic you’re still left with a problem as both IPFS and Arweave only store static assets.&nbsp;</p><p>This problem is solved in Fractal Tribute. Players are able to create artwork with each other in a fully peer-to-peer decentralized Holochain app, then permissionlessly mint it on-chain. The solution involves creating a unique ID for each NFT that combines the content and your wallet address (ID = hash(content + wallet)). This ID is generated within the EVM smart contract and a matching reference is created on the Holochain app. Because it is partly generated from the wallet doing the minting, it makes it impossible for anyone else to create the same ID. A binding between your Holochain agent and EVM wallet is established, ensuring that only you can mint NFTs for your content on both networks.</p> Making the Game Compatible with OpenSea <p>To ensure that content from the Holochain app can be seamlessly integrated with platforms like OpenSea, the project utilizes Holo gateways. These gateways are hosted on Holo, a distributed hosting platform for Holochain apps, and can request content for a specific token ID from the app and generate the necessary metadata in JSON format.</p><p>Going forward, this approach has the potential to be applied in various scenarios where tokenization of events or assets on a peer-to-peer Holochain network is desirable, including identity solutions for private Holochain networks, audits, or backing for real-world assets on-chain.</p> Distribution of Funds <p>The challenge is to fairly distribute funds raised in the minting of the limited open edition NFTs based on a percentage of contribution to the artwork produced in the game. So far, the only link between Holochain and the NFT contract is by ID. The blockchain has no awareness of player contributions in the Holochain app. To address this, a "game steward" concept is introduced. This steward, a participant in the Holochain app, calculates each participant's contributions at the end of the game and signs the percentage claim of the fund pool with their EVM private key. The smart contract on the EVM side only accepts data signed by the game steward, allowing individuals to make their claims. While this system depends on the honesty of the steward, the transparency of the process and the ability to hold the steward accountable mitigate risks.The result? All players of the game will receive a percentage of the sale of any NFT minted during the game.</p> New Utility <p>Three primary technical challenges have limited the ability of NFTs to be both dynamic and decentralized in the current ecosystem. These can be solved by bridging between a Holochain app and an EVM. The NFT is effectively minted on both networks by the binding of a Holochain agent and an EVM wallet that results in a single NFT ID. This demonstration provides significant, new utility to the NFT space and broader Web3 ecosystem.</p>

<p>Demands by residents for contactless services have accelerated the need for digital government services, but rampant identity fraud is impeding digital transformation and costing taxpayers millions. Stopping fraud means blocking synthetic and stolen identities during the application process and securing resident accounts from phishing and social engineering attacks aimed at account takeover.. At 1Kosmos, we’ve made it our mission to fortify digital identities and empower both government agencies and citizens for a secure and seamless digital future.</p>
 The Power of Credential Service Providers (CSPs) 
<p>A Credential Service Provider (CSP) conducts identity verification during enrollment and subsequently validates identity during each access attempt. This streamlines the allocation of limited resources for organizations, allowing them to efficiently provide online services to eligible individuals. By expediting identity verification procedures and ensuring the security and convenience users anticipate, agencies expedite the delivery of accessible services to genuine residents.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP managed service offers a contemporary, user-friendly approach to self-service identity verification (e.g., IAL2) and authentication (e.g., AAL2) that works seamlessly on any device, at any time, with a remarkable accuracy rate exceeding 99%. Equipped with an identity-backed, reusable credential, residents gain effortless access to multiple websites, applications, and services. They also gain control over and securely manage the sharing of their personal information, simplifying both privacy and compliance management.</p>
<p>Leveraging a IAL2 certified Full <a>CSP</a> enables organizations to sidestep the constant arms race of security challenges. With 1Kosmos CSP managed services, the burden of staying ahead of the latest security threats, relationships with bureaus, and deep fake mitigation is shouldered by us. Government agencies and organizations can focus on delivering efficient online services to legitimate residents, confident in the knowledge that their security needs are expertly managed.</p>
 The Role of 1Kosmos in Strengthening Digital Identities 
<p>1Kosmos BlockID has emerged as a true game-changer in the realm of <a>identity verification</a> and authentication. Our platform matches users’ real biometrics with their government issued IDs to prove their identities each time they access government services. Through its intuitive, user-friendly interface, residents can seamlessly access various sites, applications, and services with a reusable, secure credential in hand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By automating manual identity and credential verification processes, our platform guarantees a secure, rules-based workflow that significantly minimizes errors. With its adherence to the rigorous NIST 800-63-3 standards and verifiable data registries, government agencies can conduct stringent Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) verification, issuing digitally signed Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credentials. This process lays the foundation for a secure digital environment, fostering a relationship of trust between citizens and the government.</p>
<p>In the face of increasing threats like phishing and cyber-attacks, 1Kosmos BlockID further enhances security measures through its support for biometric passwordless multi-factor authentication, leveraging a flexible offering of phishing-resistant authenticators to suit many different types of users. Our flexible identity proofing mechanism allows for adaptable levels of identity assertion, catering to the evolving needs of both government agencies and customers. With a comprehensive suite of identification methods, including device biometrics and LiveID, we ensure that every access request is met with the appropriate balance of security and convenience.</p>
 1Kosmos Digital Wallet: The Ultimate Secure Platform 
<p>Moreover, 1Kosmos BlockID’s digital wallet serves as the ultimate secure platform, enabling users to verify their identities in a private and convenient manner. With the assurance that the digital wallet remains securely in the hands of the rightful user, government agencies can streamline management across multiple online services seamlessly. The platform supports an unlimited number of personas or accounts, binding user biometrics via the IAL2 workflow to FIDO2 certified credentials, effectively eliminating the need for usernames or passwords. This advancement empowers users and governments alike, facilitating a smooth transition to a more comprehensive array of online services and offerings.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we take immense pride in being at the forefront of digital identity and security solutions. Our mission is to empower government agencies to navigate the challenges of the digital era with unwavering confidence.

 An economic stroke of genius or a death knell to a thriving community? IDnow investigates how the Brazilian gambling community feels about the upcoming regulations. 



 



<p>While Brazilian gambling operators eagerly await the approval of online gambling regulations, and the resulting new revenue streams, Brazilian players have rather mixed feelings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;July 2023, an <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/legislacao/2023/07/26/regulamentacao-das-apostas-esportivas-6-em-cada-10-brasileiros-acreditam-que-sera-positiva/">opinion poll on upcoming Brazilian gambling regulation</a> revealed that only 64% of Brazilians&nbsp;thought that regulating sports betting in Brazil would have a positive impact on the country. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The top benefit of the regulation, according to 45% of respondents, was that the regulation would help reduce fraud. Other benefits mentioned were more security for bettors, and transparency of information offered by bookmakers, at 40% and 39% respectively. Around half of respondents said they would continue to bet with the same regularity as before, but 31% believed that they would bet less because of the regulation.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on players? 



<p>While there are clear economic opportunities for Brazilian operators and the government, there are also concerns in the betting community that the new rules, which would require operators to have an office in Brazil, could drive international operators away, which in turn would affect sponsorship opportunities in, for example, the Brazilian football league. An incredible <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2023/3/30/betting-sites-dominate-brazilian-serie-and-sponsoring-39-teams-36411.html">39 out of 40 football teams</a> in the nation’s top two leagues are sponsored by international betting sites. One of the possible consequences of the regulation is a withdrawal of sponsorship, which would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12brzcq/clubes_se_posicionam_sobre_regulamenta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_das/">negatively affect the competitiveness of Brazilian clubs.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players are also showing their opposition to the way in which they will be taxed. As the proposals aim to only tax&nbsp;profits, and not factor in a player’s history of losses, players are pointing out that as most gamblers lose money most of the time, the few times they will win, they will be taxed, which they believe is unfair. The <a href="https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/vida-e-cidadania/como-sites-apostas-esportivas-contornam-lei-antijogo-pais/">rate payable is 30% (withheld by operators),</a> and players must declare winnings when filing income tax.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, some Brazilian players believe that some of the higher spending and professional bettors will simply utilize VPN services to continue playing on international sites.</p>



 What effect will Brazilian gambling regulation have on operators? 



<p>One of Brazilian operator’s chief objections to the new regulation is the cost (BR$30 million) of a Brazilian gambling license (read more about the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazliian gambling license structure here</a>), which they say is too much, especially when compared to other markets, such as <a href="https://brazilian.report/tech/2021/09/03/online-gambling-disabilities-venture-capital/">Malta (5%), Greece (5%) and the United Kingdom (15%),</a> which all arguably offer more attractive regulatory environments. However, the UK is itself going through considerable changes to its regulatory environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read more about the plans being undertaken by the United Kingdom Gambling Commission in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">‘From government paper to UKGC Plans: What’s next for the UK’s gambling sector.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many operators and players are also understandably wary as to where exactly the 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue tax will be generated. Many players have expressed concerns that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/futebol/comments/12q8yd8/apostas_esportivas_ganhador_ter%C3%A1_de_pagar_30_de/?rdt=33846">operators may opt for extra fees, such as account maintenance fees and withdrawal fees</a>.</p>



 A nation ready to risk it all. 



<p>It’s clear to see that&nbsp;while the general population, and of course, the Brazilian gambling industry is in favor of regulating sports betting, due to the anticipated positive impact on the country’s economy, the view from the Brazilian betting community is mostly negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is widespread fear that new restrictions could affect the competitiveness of the sector, resulting in fewer active operators, a deterioration in odds, the appearance of additional fees on platforms and even a decline in the quality of national football. Of course, it could also result in players simply deciding to flee to foreign platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as the Brazilian government expects&nbsp;to receive between BR$6 billion to BR$12 billion per year when the regulated market is operational, it appears to be a risk it’s prepared to take.</p>



 Play on. 



<p>Identity proofing and fraud protection are two areas that will become paramount in the new era of Brazilian gambling.</p>

  <p>In the first post of this three-part series, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/harness-power-your-identity-data">Harness the Power of Your Identity Data</a>, we talked about the importance and potential power of using identity data to grow your business by providing tailored digital experiences. In our second post, we took a closer look at two of the three steps you can take to grow your business with identity data. The first step is to get connected to all of your various and siloed identity data sources. The second step is to leverage the built-in ForgeRock relationship model so that your data is arranged in a way that best supports your specific business needs. Read the details of steps one and two <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/grow-your-business-identity-data">here</a>. And now let's explore the third step.</p>

 Step 3: Scale Your Operations 

<p>Connecting your data silos and designing the desired relationships among different types of identity data lays a strong foundation for a converged identity and access management (IAM) platform. This concept can hold all of your identities in a single system while catering to the unique needs of different identity populations: customers, brands, partners, suppliers, employees, and devices. However, the benefits of bringing everything together under one roof can also introduce new complexity issues if you don't have a scalable way for your IT staff to manage ongoing operations and maintenance.</p>

<p>The identity management capabilities of the ForgeRock Identity Cloud include a feature known as the Organization Model, or Org Model for short. The Org Model is what helps you bring everything together to operationalize your identity data in a way that scales across your IT teams. The Org Model is an out-of-the-box identity object that has pre-defined relationships with other identity objects, such as users, roles, and applications. It empowers you to quickly create a hierarchy of "organizations," each with their own unique identity and attributes that support the tailored experiences you need to deliver for different populations of identities.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The easiest way to understand the Org Model is to imagine the organizational chart of any large company. Visualize interconnected boxes arranged in a top-down hierarchy. The CEO at the top maintains overall control and responsibility for the company, but also delegates specific responsibilities to leaders in finance, HR, legal, marketing, and other functional areas. Those leaders have specific autonomy to define the boxes in their organizations and the people within them. In the same way, our Org Model empowers you to define any kind of hierarchical identity structure that represents the reality of your business. And just like the company's organizational structure, our identity Org Model enables delegation so that the IT administrators that are closest to a given identity population can be put in charge of managing the organization, the users in it, and all the granular permissions and customizations required by that group of identities. This is the first half of how you scale your identity management operations.</p>

<p>With the ability to implement a scalable span of control through delegated administration, the Org Model is similar to how a company's organizational structure scales as it grows and changes over time. Let's look at one more analogy to understand the second half of scaling your identity management operations: inheritance.</p>

<p>Imagine an organization with many franchises around the country or even the world. Whether the franchise is a fast food chain, or an automotive dealership, certain policies and multi-brand experiences need to remain consistent. Other facets of the business need to be flexible to accommodate different supply chains, partners, and local government policies. This is why inheritance capabilities are so important. With the ForgeRock Org Model, changes made to the top-level organization, such as new access policies or authentication requirements, can automatically get pushed down to the sub-Orgs without requiring administrative intervention. And where required, separate organizational structures can maintain distinct policies, all subject to the requirements of the business.</p>

<p>Take the example of an automotive manufacturer looking to manage all of its independent dealerships and you giving them the flexibility to manage their business while maintaining a certain level of central visibility and control. The top CEO box in the manufacturer's Org Model gives the company this level of control in their world of digital identity. Next, the company creates Level 2 boxes, or "Orgs," for each of their defined regions in the U.S. This gives regional managers a level of control over the dealerships in their territory. The Level 2 boxes are connected and roll up to the Level 1 CEO box, just as in a company's organizational chart</p>

<p>At the third level, new Org boxes are created, which also have their own unique identity, relationships in the identity hierarchy, and the ability to have custom attributes. These Orgs are created to represent each dealership. And the owner of each dealership is given the authority (delegation) to manage certain aspects of the user experience. These could be different multifactor authentication (MFA) enrollment choices, for example. Then there's the inheritance factor, which dictates certain configuration consistencies across the entirety of the organization–maybe in this case a password length and complexity policy.</p>

 Using Identity Data to Drive the Runtime User Experience 

<p>Now that your identity data is organized according to your business needs and you have a scalable process for managing the maintenance and dynamic changes that are the reality of your business, it's time to put the data to work on the front lines.</p>

<p>This is where identity data meets access orchestration. With the right data at your disposal and an access management system with dynamic orchestration capabilities, each user's experience can be tailored to their specific needs. In one moment, a customer of yours enters their account name and, based on the data retrieved and fed into the orchestration workflow, this customer experiences a low-friction, passwordless login that is personalized. At the very same moment, one of your suppliers enters their account name into a different application and receives a tailored MFA experience based on the security negotiated between your company and the supplier's company. For this supplier, union rules prevent management from requiring their users to authenticate on their personal mobile phones. So based on your identity data, including this supplier's Org Model affiliation, the user receives a sign-in link by email. When the user clicks on the link from the computer, the user signs in with a passwordless experience that doesn't require the use of a phone.</p>

 We sit down with the Head of Compliance at Hero to discuss money laundering trends, Russians and real estate, and how companies can protect their business and customers from fraud. 



 



 What are some of the new trends you have seen in money laundering in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, the landscape of money laundering has shifted significantly, with the emergence of new methods and the adaptation of old ones. One of the most striking trends is the increasing use of cryptocurrencies. The anonymity provided by these currencies allows scammers to transfer significant funds without detection. In 2022,&nbsp;<a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/crypto-fraud-in-2023-how-can-security-teams-fight/">hackers stole $4.3 billion</a>&nbsp;worth of cryptocurrency, marking a 37% increase from 2021. Most of these scams were carried out through social media, highlighting the need for stricter regulation in this area.</p>



<p>Furthermore, real estate remains a favored sector for money laundering. The high value of properties and the ability to transact in cash make it an attractive tool. For instance, in February 2022, Transparency International revealed that Russians linked to corruption charges had invested&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-money-laundering-stats-russia-suspicious-wealth">£1.5 billion in the UK real estate market</a>. This trend underscores the importance of implementing stricter regulations to monitor and regulate real estate transactions.</p>



 Is there a noticeable difference in the money laundering techniques deployed in different countries, for example in France, compared to the UK? 



<p>While the basic techniques of money laundering are universal, each country has its nuances based on its regulation, economy, and culture. In France, for instance, the regulation is quite stringent, with bodies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/glossaire/acpr/">Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution&nbsp;(ACPR)</a>&nbsp;closely monitoring financial activities. This might push criminals to adopt more sophisticated methods or use intermediaries to launder money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, with a broader financial market and a significant presence of international finance, techniques might be more varied, ranging from shell companies to complex real estate transactions. Moreover, Brexit might have created new opportunities for money launderers due to changes in information-sharing and oversight agreements.</p>



 In France, the regulatory landscape for identity verification has changed dramatically with the introduction of PVID. Do you think PVID, and other government-approved Trust frameworks make a difference in rates of fraud and money laundering? How do you see PVID changing in the coming years? 



<p>The PVID is a tangible example of how regulation can adapt to the modern challenges of identity verification. By combining document verification with facial recognition, it provides an added layer of security, thereby reducing the risk of identity theft. This has a direct impact on fraud and money laundering rates, as it’s more challenging for criminals to deceive this system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as with any technology, it’s crucial to remain vigilant and adapt to new methods that criminals might develop to bypass these measures. In the future, I anticipate PVID to incorporate newer technologies and verification methods as they become available, while strengthening existing protocols.</p>



 What role does technology play in the proliferation of fraud and money laundering? Are there any new uses that are particular causes for concern for you? 



<p>Technology has always been a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud and money laundering. On one hand, it provides innovative tools to enhance fraud detection and prevention like advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, which can help pinpoint suspicious transaction patterns that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, technology also gives fraudsters new means to impersonate or deceive individuals. Deepfakes, for instance, can be used to fraudulently open accounts or extort money. Moreover, with the rise of cryptocurrencies, criminals have found new ways to launder money outside of traditional financial systems.</p>



 Besides adhering to regulation, what else can companies do to protect their business and customers from fraud? 



<p>Beyond mere regulatory compliance, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to protect their operations and clients. This involves investing in cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence and data analytics, to detect and prevent fraud in real-time. Utilizing public and private databases can also assist in verifying the authenticity of clients and transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, data pooling among financial institutions can provide a holistic view of suspicious activities. Lastly, continuous training of employees on the latest fraud techniques and prevention best practices is paramount. Companies must also foster a culture of compliance, where every employee understands their role in fraud prevention.</p>



 What regulations/obligations should different sectors, including the crypto, gambling and financial sectors, expect in the coming years? What changes would you like to see implemented? 



<p>The rapid evolution of technology and financial markets means that regulation must adapt accordingly. In the cryptocurrency sector, we can expect increased regulation, especially in countries that have yet to adopt robust regulatory frameworks for digital assets. This might include stricter KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the gambling sector, regulation might focus more on preventing gambling addiction and ensuring operators aren’t taking advantage of vulnerable individuals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, for the traditional financial sector, data pooling and increased use of artificial intelligence might be encouraged to detect and prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>



 Are there different types of fraud risks that a traditional financial service needs to be aware of compared to a fintech? 



<p>Fintechs and traditional financial institutions face unique challenges when it comes to fraud. Fintechs, especially in their early stages, might have limited resources and feel pressure to quickly onboard clients, potentially making them less vigilant. It’s a delicate balance between risk exposure and the need for growth. However, fintechs also have the advantage of being agile and can quickly adopt new technologies to combat fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, large financial institutions, while having significant resources for staffing, tools, and training, have to deal with massive transaction and onboarding volumes. This can make detecting individual fraudulent transactions more challenging. However, the future looks promising with the prospect of data pooling among financial institutions and increased use of AI for real-time fraud detection.</p>

<p>Fractal Tribute is a collaborative art game built on Holochain and inspired by r/place.&nbsp;</p><p>In this real time game, players make “moves” by placing pixels on a shared canvas, building upon all previous moves, and thus coordinating to draw new patterns and art. Each player is limited in the number of pixels they can place at one time, requiring them to work with other players to shape the canvas into particular designs. It’s a game of community building, artistic expression, and collaborative play.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can also take snapshots of the collaborative art after they make their moves. These snapshots are simultaneously minted as limited open edition NFTs on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in this case, using the Polygon network.</p> The Tech Stack <p>The game is built on the Holochain application framework, which manages app networking, data validity, and databasing in a peer-to-peer system without need for a central server. The application runs locally on players computers and is networked between them for collaboration.</p><p>When users sign into the game, they are required to bind an ERC-20 wallet to their instance of Fractal Tribute. It is this binding between Holochain private keys and the crypto wallet private keys that enables full validation of both the art itself and the NFT.&nbsp;</p><p>The Holo hosting network is used as a gateway to the Fractal Tribute application so that anyone can fetch validated content directly from the peer-to-peer game using HTTPS. These always-on nodes provide an easy, low-friction way for players and non-players to view NFT payloads — allowing a marketplace like OpenSea to make them available for purchase.&nbsp;</p> Why Connect Holochain and Blockchain? <p>Fractal Tribute was built as a demonstration of the possibilities opened by combining Holochain and Blockchain. But it is just one possible arrangement of application rules and smart contracts.</p><p>In Fractal Tribute:&nbsp;</p>  Only the original creator of the asset can mint the NFT.&nbsp;  Holochain lets you audit an accountable history of all interactions with the underlying asset. This ensures data provenance.&nbsp;  Storage of the NFT asset is distributed.  Blockchain validates the token in a public space, Holochain validates the underlying asset created in a private application.  A single, shared NFT ID referenceable in both spaces.  <p>Essentially Holochain enables unforgeable NFTs because owners can prove ownership of the NFT on a blockchain, and they can trace back to the digital asset and confirm that the NFT was minted by the creator and owner of the underlying asset.</p><p>When an artist takes a snapshot, they create an immutable bundle of actions that is cryptographically signed within the app directly. Because every move or brushstroke is signed with a private key, every artist involved in the game can audit who did what and when.&nbsp;</p><p>The snapshot is simultaneously minted as a limited open edition NFT on the Polygon network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of a URL that points to the artwork on a centralized server, which may be taken down or otherwise controlled by someone with admin privileges, NFT payloads created in Fractal Tribute are held in the distributed Holochain application where they were created, which is then bridged by a gateway node running on the distributed Holo hosting network for public visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain’s data storage isn’t just decentralized, it’s distributed. This means that as a player you will always hold a verifiable copy of your own data, at the same time as it is backed up across the network. With accountable histories, data hashing, and distributed storage, Holochain provides a high level of security in comparison to IPFS and traditional client-server models.</p> What’s Next? <p>Fractal Tribute is a proof of concept, showing the ways that blockchain wallets and Holochain agents can be bound together and what possibilities that binding enables. The interaction between a fully distributed application for collaborative art and an NFT marketplace built on blockchain is just one possible arrangement where we can see the multiplier effects of these technologies working together.&nbsp;</p><p>How will this pattern be used? We see the possibility for creator economies not based around centralized platforms, we see value creation which doesn’t require consensus, we see games where players control their identity and data, we see new ways to create trust and provenance on the web.&nbsp;</p><p>What possibilities do you see?</p>

  <p>In today's digital landscape, the threat of malicious bots and botnets looms large over the retail industry. Manipulated by cybercriminals, these devices and networks can wreak havoc on your e-commerce platform and disrupt your customers' experience.</p>

<p>Bots and botnets are able to vigilantly monitor your inventory for must-have items, pretend to be customers, and swiftly buy up your inventory (before your actual customers have a chance to) — often reselling the items at inflated prices on third-party websites.</p>

<p>Botnets are everywhere, and this type of activity happens all the time. This practice not only impacts your sales, but it also creates a negative customer experience for customers who are eager to buy the latest and greatest item, only to find that it is already sold out. Retailers are not only left to deal with frustrated customers, but often also find themselves processing numerous returns if the bad actors fail to resell the items. The only people who benefit from this trend are the cybercriminals.</p>

 The Crucial Role Digital Identity Plays In Combating Botnets 

<p>The key to fighting back against bots and botnets is to quickly identify and authenticate those behind online activities. For example, retailers must quickly discern whether their products are being purchased by a legitimate, loyal customer who has been eagerly waiting for a new product release — or by an impersonal, automated bot from the darknet.</p>

<p>To do this, you need the ability to examine contextual identity information and use it to make informed decisions. At the same time, rather than burdening your legitimate customers with onerous authentication steps, you need to make sure the process is invisible. This involves striking a careful balance between customer experience and security.</p>

 Beating the Bots With Identity and Access Management (IAM) 

<p>ForgeRock's enterprise-grade digital identity platform enables you to identify and stop bots and botnets without driving away your real customers. With <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Authentication</a>, you can use AI-driven threat detection, plus a range of environmental, contextual, and behavioral factors, to make authentication and authorization decisions in real time — unmasking the bots. Intelligent Access also adapts login and checkout journeys to make them more challenging and complicated when there's a suspected bot. Adversely, legitimate, authenticated customers are able to check out without any hurdles whatsoever.</p>

<p>Don't let retail bots and botnets ruin your customers' experiences or your bottom line. Get an in-depth examination of how a retail bot works and how you can leverage ForgeRock to defend against bots today and as they evolve in the future by reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/block-bots-keep-your-customers-coming-back">Block the Bots to Keep Your Customers Coming Back</a>.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>HYPR is expanding its original mission to take a more comprehensive approach to Identity Assurance. We have introduced two cutting-edge products, HYPR Adapt and HYPR Affirm that round out the HYPR platform.</p> 
<p>We grew from a small team around a table to a multi-team organization with a range of talented specialists. Arriving at this milestone after many lessons learnt, we took a pause and looked at what worked over the last 5 years, and how we could apply them going forward.</p> 
 Exciting New Changes  
<p>As part of these changes, we are excited to announce that <a href="mailto:baljeet.sandhu@hypr.com">Baljeet Sandhu</a>, formerly our Chief Architect has been promoted to CTO. Baljeet joined us several years ago and his contributions have been invaluable to the business around too many areas to count. Robert Panebianco, is promoted to the chief architect position after many great years of service here at HYPR. Rob has been our resident cryptography expert and has done amazing things in our efforts to build a highly scalable and secure SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><a href="mailto:shaun.gerner@hypr.com">Shaun Gerner</a>, who was one of our first engineering hires and first mobile engineer many years ago has been promoted to VP of Engineering. He is now responsible for running the various feature teams at HYPR who have been working with Shaun shoulder to shoulder to deliver the amazing products our customers use today.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>We’re also happy to announce that Sal Rizzari is now our official VP of Infrastructure. Sal’s ability to organize a team to automate and deploy HYPR at scale has been a force multiplier for our development teams as well as our customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Our Engineering Philosophy&nbsp;  
 Solving a Problem&nbsp;  
<p>Building software is, at its core, an exercise in solving a problem for your customers; understanding the things that matter to them. As we grow we want to preserve HYPR’s traditional cycle of working with customers, delivering the next iteration, listening and refining.</p> 
<p>With this in mind, we organized around delivery-oriented feature teams. Each team includes the complete set of specialists needed to deliver the solution — developers, QA, Product and DevOps. The team takes on a customer problem and owns solutioning through delivery. They build, own and operate. It's a close group which relies on each member operating with a high context and owning their role in the team delivery. Working with a high context and problem solving mindset is fun!</p> 
 Iterating Fast  
<p>We believe that software is a process of continuous refinement and ideation. This can only happen if we move forward quickly, in small steps. We love showing our early work to feature partners and gathering feedback. Some of our best ideas have in fact, come from our customers! However, this needs to be balanced with the stability needs of a critical platform like HYPR. We facilitate this by releasing all of our features in alpha, beta and GA cycles. The expectations and guardrails in each of these are well-defined internally. Most of the iteration happens in alpha and starts tapering off as we approach GA. At GA, change control and release compatibility guidelines kick in.</p> 
 Using the Best Tools  
<p>The best available tools are necessary to enable our teams. HYPR’s tech stack uses proven platforms, like JDK, .Net and Node. We upgrade aggressively and are on the latest stable within a few months of release. Being techies at heart, we continuously watch and experiment with a wide variety of new tech. Native images for Java, Flutter for mobile UIs, WebAssembly in browsers, are just a few of the things we evaluated in 2023. Experimentation usually starts on non-critical utilities and moves gradually to core if proven successful.&nbsp;</p> 
 Baking Security In  
<p>We take a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-security-company-with-a-security-first-approach">security-first approach</a>, baking it into the design at all stages. Security design is vetted by our in-house experts. During build, automated checks in our CI pipeline continuously run static and dynamic analysis. Additionally, separate scans continuously look for CVE vulnerabilities in our libraries. We take CVEs seriously. A CVE trip will break the build at HYPR. During the testing phase, our in-house experts try to compromise the solution. The findings are reviewed with the feature team. But we don’t stop there — we invite even deeper scrutiny through our public HackerOne program.&nbsp;</p> 
 Automation Everywhere  
<p>Running a successful SaaS platform needs fast testing feedback and consistency in deployments. HYPR got this right early on. We treat our test automation code with the same standards as our production code and it lives alongside in code repositories. Highly recommend it! Our DevOps team brings similar discipline to the job. Manual configuration is for experiments only. For everything else there is Infra As Code (IAC).</p> 
 Doing More With Less  
<p>At HYPR we have always taken a pragmatic approach to building software. We choose good tools and keep the number of frameworks limited. We endeavor to apply these uniformly across teams. This gives us an advantage of being able to move people between teams and get up to speed quickly. On a new team, engineers can focus on the difference in product; the tech is already familiar.</p> 
 Our Team and the Work Ahead  
<p>HYPR aims to be the best place for engineers to work. We highly value all team members and are committed to individual empowerment aligned around not just our engineering philosophy but shared values of transparency, collaboration, impact and adaptability. I am extremely excited for our engineering voyage ahead.</p>

				  Indicio NoDe—Node on Demand—makes setting up decentralized ecosystems and networks easy, helping businesses to quickly realize the benefits from verifiable data and identity.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE/ Nov 1, 2023–Indicio, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, announced today the availability of <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-node-ubuntu-20?project=sunlit-apricot-360315">Indicio Node on Demand 20.04</a> (Indicio NoDe 20.04) for deployment in the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/find-a-partner/partner/indicio">Google Cloud.</a> Indicio NoDe 20.04 is the newest offering in Indicio’s catalog of products that enable customers to add verifiable credential technology to their existing data systems and applications to reduce fraud, create seamless and secure access and authentication, scalable to any use case, and realized cost savings from seamless operational efficiency. Google Cloud Marketplace makes it easy to set up and manage these solutions in just a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio NoDe 20.04 is the first quick-to-deploy release of the latest <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> open source code designed to run on Ubuntu 20.0. It can be used to create a network node that can be added to an existing Hyperledger Indy Network or used to build a new distributed ledger network. Enterprises, businesses, and organizations are taking advantage of these types of networks to develop and deploy verifiable credential ecosystems to increase trust and loyalty with their customers, partners, and workforce.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In a world where speed and scale matter, we’re making it easy and cost effective for developers, companies, and organizations to embrace digital transformation and build seamless processes with verifiable data,” said Heather Dahl, co-founder and CEO of Indicio. “We’re seeing enterprises and governments digging into this technology to deliver better products and services and better customer experiences. Products like NoDe help them do that by allowing them to do what they do best: create value and deliver value. We’re making transformative technology simple to integrate and use.”</p>
<p>Hyperledger Indy is an open-source distributed ledger that supports the use of verifiable credentials to create Trusted Digital Ecosystems. This type of enterprise blockchain allows public-facing identity information, including Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), revocation registries, and schema information to be written, for verifiable credential issuance and then read across multiple organizations simultaneously, for credential verification.</p>

<p>With more and more countries implementing the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, it has become crucial to be prepared and choose <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-ultimate-explainer-on-the-travel-rule-solution#:~:text=Shyft%20Veriscope%3A%20A%20Seamless%20%26%20Privacy,data%20retention%20features%20stand%20out.">a Travel Rule Solution</a> that can meet all your needs. But that is easier said than done, as there are several Travel Rule Solutions available in the market today, each with its specific set of features and functionalities.</p><p>In this analysis, we will juxtapose Veriscope’s features against other notable solutions in the market to provide a clearer picture of where each stands in addressing the challenges and needs of VASPs concerning Travel Rule compliance.</p> Decentralization <p>While Veriscope, Sygna, and TRUST all champion a decentralized approach, it’s Veriscope’s commitment to decentralization that truly stands out. By ensuring that its operations aren’t tied to a single point, Veriscope minimizes vulnerabilities and ensures data integrity.</p><p>This decentralized foundation, when combined with its other robust features, positions Veriscope as a holistic solution in a decentralized ecosystem.</p> No Centralized Storage of&nbsp;PII <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, VerifyVasp, TRP, TransactID, and Trust, places a high emphasis on user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>After all, in a world where data is the new gold, the decentralized storage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) becomes pivotal. And by ensuring PII isn’t stored centrally, Veriscope greatly reduces the risks of data breaches, guaranteeing users a safer environment for their&nbsp;data.</p> Open Source <p>Veriscope and TransactID have embraced the open-source model, a testament to their commitment to transparency and innovation.</p><p>This makes a big difference, as open-source platforms invite collective intelligence, allowing a community of developers to contribute, detect vulnerabilities, and enhance the system. It also ensures the platform remains up-to-date and robust against evolving&nbsp;threats.</p> Automatic Counterparty VASP Discovery <p>Veriscope and TRUST take user experience up a notch with their automatic counterparty VASP discovery feature.</p><p>This automation simplifies processes, reducing the need for manual lookups. For businesses and individuals, this means faster, more efficient transactions without the hassle of manual interventions.</p> Secure P2P PII Transmission <p>Among the available Travel Rule Solutions, Veriscope, VerifyVasp, and TransactID prioritize the secure transmission of PII between peers. This is vital in ensuring that personal data remains confidential during transit and is not vulnerable to malicious interceptions or unauthorized access.</p> Robust Counterparty Due Diligence <p>Both Veriscope and TRUST excel in performing thorough due diligence on counterparties. This rigorous process ensures that interactions are made with verified entities, minimizing the risks of fraud and enhancing the overall security of transactions.</p> Pay-as-you-go Model <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers a pay-as-you-go model, a feature that is both cost-effective and flexible. Instead of being tied down to long-term commitments, VASPs have the flexibility to pay for only what they use, making it an economical choice.</p> Interoperability <p>Veriscope, along with OpenVASP, NotaBene, Sygna, and TRISA, emphasizes interoperability.</p><p>In an industry where systems need to communicate and integrate seamlessly, this feature ensures that Veriscope can work in tandem with various other platforms, ensuring flexibility and broader usability.</p> Historic Transaction Lookback <p>Veriscope’s historic transaction lookback feature is the only one of its kind among the Travel Rule Solutions.</p><p>This is how it works: when VASPs integrate with the Veriscope network, they are not only positioned to receive current but also historical Travel Rule requests. This ensures that VASPs maintain continuous compliance, regardless of when their partnering VASPs began complying with the FATF Travel Rule or their location globally.</p><p>As such, it confirms transactions right from the beginning and provides VASPs with the opportunity to produce any required records afterward, ensuring everyone adheres to the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> User Signing (Non-Custodial Wallet Signing): <p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers user signing for non-custodial wallets. This feature positions Veriscope as the definitive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Address Proofs (Custodial Wallets): <p>Veriscope stands out with its address proofs for custodial wallets. This feature confirms that VASPs truly control the crypto addresses they claim, ensuring accurate data exchange for Travel Rule compliance. It shows that Veriscope emphasizes both user security and operational efficiency.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The ultimate choice isn’t about simply selecting the Travel Rule Solution with the most features, but rather, one that aligns with specific VASP needs — whether it’s decentralization, secure PII storage, or flexible payment models. As this analysis has highlighted, understanding each solution’s nuances can guide VASPs toward making informed decisions.</p><p>The right Travel Rule solution will allow VASPs to satisfy regulatory obligations while operating effectively within their unique constraints. With the regulatory landscape continuing to evolve, taking the time now to thoroughly assess and identify the optimal Travel Rule solution will establish a strong foundation for success in the approaching compliant future.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Confused over which crypto regulations are applicable in the UK? Read on to discover all about the Travel Rule, MiCA, and the UK’s proposed regulatory regime. 



 



<p>The release of the UK government’s <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">‘Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets: Response to the consultation and call for evidence’ </a> signifies yet another significant step on the UK’s road toward crypto regulation.</p>



<p>In February 2023, in perhaps the clearest sign to date that the UK government was finally taking the challenges and opportunities of the crypto industry seriously, HM Treasury released a consultation paper on the proposed regulatory regime, which is billed by many as the UK’s answer to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>.</p>



<p>The 77-page document featured information on the current regulatory landscape for cryptoassets, definitions of different types of cryptoassets, and geographic scope of cryptoasset activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As well as more general guidelines regarding cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management, the paper set out a proposed policy approach to bringing cryptoasset activities into the UK regulatory perimeter.</p>



 Call for evidence on UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime. 



<p>From February to the end of April 2023, the public and private sector, and those inside and outside Parliament were invited to provide feedback on the proposed policies and legislations. IDnow’s crypto regulatory experts, Rayissa Armata and Jason Tucker-Feltham pored over the consultation paper, and along with 130 other respondents and institutions, provided detailed feedback and analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October 2023 <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">HM Treasury published its response to the consultation</a>. In the foreword, Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>The learnings gathered from our engagement have been invaluable for further informing our approach. With the future regulatory framework now taking clear shape and the Financial Services and Markets Act now passed, the UK is the obvious choice for starting and scaling a crypto asset business.</p>Andrew Griffith MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury.&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>While the vast majority (80%) of respondents were positive about the proposals, 10% had mixed feedback, and 10% were “largely critical” about the proposals. The main objections were from those who fundamentally disagreed with bringing cryptoassets within the financial services’ regulatory perimeter. Objections fell into three camps: crypto should be banned; crypto should treated in line with gambling regulation; crypto should be regulated on assets, not activities.</p>



 Feedback on UK’s proposed crypto regulations. 



<p>Feedback was collected from a mixture of industry associations, crypto native firms and FinTechs, legal and consulting firms, traditional financial services, and members of public and academia. Twenty themes and topics were identified that need to be addressed:</p>


 
 
 
 1. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) &amp; utility tokens 
 

<p>Clarify proposed treatment of NFTs and utility tokens – especially on what constitutes a financial services use case.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Geographic scope 
 

<p>Give further consideration to the treatment of overseas firms, including making clear the applicability (or not) of the Overseas Persons Exclusion (OPE), reverse solicitation, and intra-group exemptions.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Phase 1 vs phase 2 
 

<p>Delineate phase 1 and phase 2 activities in more detail, and give further consideration to potential challenges for firms and consumers.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Wholesale vs retail 
 

<p>Make stronger distinctions between services provided to professional / sophisticated investors versus retail consumers (e.g. lending, venue disclosures).</p>

 
 
 
 5. Timelines 
 

<p>Provide more clarity on timelines for phase 1 and phase 2, and seek to accelerate the overall implementation programme.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Security tokens 
 

<p>Make clear the proposed treatment of security tokens, and ensure overlapping regimes are avoided (e.g. through an explicit carve-out).</p>

 
 
 
 7. Token scope 
 

<p>Ensure cryptoasset definition used in secondary legislation is not too broad (e.g. make sure it excludes e-money, loyalty schemes, in-game money),</p>

 
 
 
 8. Staking 
 

<p>Provide clarity on the definition and future treatment of staking and consider accelerating legislation process. Consider carve-out from the scope of the collective investment scheme (CIS) regime.</p>

 
 
 
 9. Disclosures liability 
 

<p>Ensure liability framework for disclosures is proportionate –especially for tokens without an identifiable issuer.</p>

 
 
 
 10. Market abuse (cross-venue) 
 

<p>Consider a phased implementation approach toward market abuse surveillance obligations, recognizing issues associated with cross-venue information sharing.</p>

 
 
 
 11. FSMA authorization process 
 

<p>Streamline authorization process – in particular, consider appropriate transition pathways for firms registered with the FCA under its AML regime and/or already authorised under Part 4A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).</p>

 
 
 
 12. Custody scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated cryptoasset custody activities, especially with regards to self-hosted wallets and third-party arrangements.</p>

 
 
 
 13. Investment advice 
 

<p>Reconsider sequencing of cryptoasset investment advice and portfolio management activities, and ensure these are included in the perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 14. SMEs 
 

<p>Take steps to minimize barriers to entry for smaller firms – e.g. through careful design of prudential requirements and issuance requirements.</p>

 
 
 
 15. Cross-border enforcement 
 

<p>Clarify how cross-border enforcement can work in practice to ensure fair and level playing field for UK-regulated firms.</p>

 
 
 
 16. Permissionless blockchains 
 

<p>Ensure the regulatory framework appropriately reflects the risks associated with permissionless (public) vs permissioned (private) blockchains.</p>

 
 
 
 17. Trading platform scope 
 

<p>Clarify definition and scope for future regulated trading platform activities, e.g. with regards to airdrops and decentralized exchanges.</p>

 
 
 
 18. Banning crypto 
 

<p>Ban certain cryptoassets from retail consumer use – or treat them akin to gambling rather than bringing them into the financial services regulatory perimeter.</p>

 
 
 
 19. Transitional disclosure arrangements 
 

<p>Consider transitional disclosure arrangements for well-established tokens (e.g. Bitcoin) to differentiate them from recently issued tokens.</p>

 
 
 
 20. International coordination on DeFi 
 

<p>Avoid front-running international work on DeFi by imposing a prescriptive domestic framework.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>In light of the above, HM Treasury has pledged it will be setting out ‘modifications’ to the original proposals to provide further clarity on key areas of interest. The government’s aim is for secondary legislation to be laid in 2024, subject to Parliamentary time.</p>



<p>“It is important that the regime’s credibility be seen as robust rather than light touch, so I welcome the decision by the UK government to take the feedback from invested parties very seriously,” said Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</p>



<blockquote><p>A balanced and well thought out regulatory framework will likely lay the foundations in support of the UK becoming a major global crypto hub.&nbsp;The latest developments are music to the ears of traditional financial institutions, as clear rules for conducting crypto business in and out of the UK provides a level of certainty not yet demonstrated by the jurisdiction.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of FinTech and Crypto at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What should crypto firms do while they await crypto regulations?&nbsp; 



<p>While firms await rules outlined in the UK’s proposed crypto regulatory regime, crypto firms that wish to operate in the UK must register with the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk">Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)</a>, and therefore comply with the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (including the FATF guideline amendments). Only firms with appropriate <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20means%20“Know%20Your%20Customer,KYC%20ebook%20for%20more%20insights">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> processes, source of funds checks, and proof of funds checks, can be registered to ensure no illicit money is coming through the system.</p>



<p>At the beginning of 2023, out of 300 applications to the FCA, only 41 had become registered. FCA spokesperson, Charles Randell, Chair of the FCA and PSR said that more than 80% of crypto firms that had begun the process to become registered had either withdrawn their applications or been rejected. The most common reasons for not passing were that they did not meet the required AML standards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the UK no longer being legally required to follow the rules outlined in the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> (5AMLD), the UK did decide to transpose the cryptocurrency regulation criteria from 5AMLD and 6AMLD into domestic legislation.&nbsp;Other relevant rules include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps22-10-strengthening-our-financial-promotion-rules-high-risk-investments-firms-approving-financial-promotions">Financial Promotions Regime</a>, which is currently under consultation, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647zxame68p5gagy3uo/devil-is-in-the-detail-for-uk-stablecoin-plans">Financial Services and Markets Bill</a><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-law-to-protect-access-to-cash-announced-in-queens-speech">,</a>&nbsp;which includes stablecoin regulation.</p>



<p>In October 2023, the FCA officially launched its financial promotions restrictions for the UK’s crypto industry. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/financial-promotions-uk-crypto/">Read more about the UK’s financial promotions regime here.</a></p>



 What is the UK’s ‘Travel Rule’?&nbsp; 



<p>From September 1, 2023, crypto firms operating in the UK will be required to store, verify, and&nbsp;share all information regarding crypto transfers, as per <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">the ‘Travel Rule’</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although well established among traditional financial service providers, the Travel Rule was extended to incorporate crypto activities in the revised Transfer of Funds regulation, which alongside MiCA, was officially officially published in the European Official Journal on June 9, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force (FATF)</a>, regarded as the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, recently acknowledged the challenges associated with setting adoption and enforcement timelines across different juristictions and regions. Each FATF member state is currently madating travel rule compliance.</p>



<p>In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined what it expects from firms:&nbsp;</p>



  Take all reasonable steps and exercise all due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule.&nbsp;

				  In a world of scammers attempting to separate people from their hard-earned money, the next step in security is to be able to automatically verify who you are talking to before you tell them anything.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>As of 2022, Forbes reports that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/banking-trends-and-statistics/#:~:text=The%20tides%20have%20shifted%2C%20and,prefer%20to%20bank%20in%20person.">78% of American adults</a> prefer to do their banking digitally through an app or a website. It’s not hard to see why: it’s a quick and easy way to manage your money. Unfortunately, it also provides a new way for bad actors to try to gain access to accounts by pretending to be your bank, usually through text or email. This technique, sometimes known as <a href="https://www.bancosantander.es/en/glosario/spoofing#:~:text=This%20technique%20involves%20sending%20an,or%20any%20other%20criminal%20act.">bank spoofing,</a> can be very convincing, with scammers able to edit the messages to look like they are coming from a legitimate source.</p>
<p>While most consumers will not respond to a message out of nowhere, a small percentage will respond by providing their personal information to sort out whatever problem they’ve been told is happening with their account. The result is devastating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks have numerous ways to verify their customers online, but customers have no way to verify their banks.</p>
<p>Currently, if a customer tries to access their bank account online they will need to provide their account name and password, and hopefully either some sort of multifactor authentication tied to their phone or a set of security questions. This provides a degree of security and confidence that only the correct person gets access to the account.</p>
<p>But, if the direction of interaction is reversed, and a customer receives a communication from their bank, they have three options:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Independently verify the message by logging in to their bank portal or showing up in person. (This requires additional time and energy, resulting in poor customer experience.) 
 Ignore it, assuming it is a scam. (It’s never good to have customers dismiss messages by default, particularly if the message is legitimate and urgent.) 
 Do what the message says. (Risk being scammed.) 
 
<p>So how do we tackle this problem?</p>
<p>The answer would seem to be: give banks a way to prove who they are to the customers. But our current systems simply aren’t set up for that. Would we give banks a username and password for them to use when getting in touch with a customer? That leaves the customer needing to remember two passwords, and what if the customer forgets that password? Then we’re back where we started with just having to trust the bank’s outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity offers a simpler and much more effective way for customers and banks to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any information. It allows both parties to cryptographically verify that they are who they say they are and to do so automatically and before sharing any data.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This ability is impossible to spoof and by connecting customers and banks this way, not only can you eliminate the need for passwords and MFA, which can be lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised, the customer can verify that they are indeed interacting with the bank.</p>
<p>According to BioCatch, scams now account for <a href="https://www.biocatch.com/resources/white-paper/digital-banking-fraud-trends-apac-2023">54% of cybercrime</a> across the APAC region, with a 200% surge in voice scams from 2022 to 2023. There is an inherent lack of certainty in knowing who we are communicating with online, which is enabling these criminals. Fraud&nbsp; losses across banks amounted to <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> in 2022. Adopting these new systems will save financial institutions real money, improve your customer’s experience, confidence, and retention, and save time and energy combating fraud.</p>
<p>This communications channel can be used for so much more than verification. Once the connection is established, you can be confident in who is on the other end, enabling secure messaging between parties (from both sides the bank can send the customer updates, and the customer can ask questions or send their own messages back), banking functionality such as payments or transfers can be accessed through APIs, and much more.</p>
<p>This article is not to say how we think “oh this would be nice…” or “in a perfect world…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This technology is here. Now. And it is ready to be used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As society becomes more reliant on technology, the protection of confidential data increases. One innovative way organizations are keeping information safe is through fingerprint biometrics. In this article, we will explore the science of fingerprint biometrics and highlight its potential for security. We will analyze how security biometrics can be utilized and how this technology shapes our present and future security landscapes.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Fingerprint Uniqueness: The patterns of an individual’s fingerprints are uniquely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. They serve as an effective and dependable identification method. 
 Scanner Diversity: Different fingerprint scanners (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, and thermal) address diverse security requirements. These scanners differ in cost, accuracy, durability, and spoofing resistance. 
 Biometrics Future: Despite the powerful security advantages of fingerprint biometrics, issues like potential data theft and privacy violations demand continuous technological evolution and robust legal safeguards. Future prospects for the field include 3D fingerprint imaging, AI integration, and advanced anti-spoofing techniques. 
 
 What Are Fingerprint Biometrics? 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics is the systematic study and application of unique physical attributes inherent in an individual’s fingerprints. Representing a more dependable identification method than traditional passwords or identity cards, fingerprint biometrics eliminates the issues of misplacement, forgetfulness, or theft. The distinctive nature of each person’s fingerprint ensures a robust barrier against unauthorized access to secure data.</p>
 The Science of Uniqueness: Fingerprints Origins 
<p>Fingerprints are nature’s signature of a person’s identity. Using fingerprints as a biometric identification tool dates back to ancient Babylon and has roots in our evolutionary biology. The friction ridges on our fingertips that comprise these prints have been crucial to human survival, helping us grip and touch objects.</p>
 Genetics and Environmental Factors: The Roots of Fingerprint Uniqueness 
<p>Fingerprints are formed during the embryonic stage and remain unaltered throughout an individual’s life. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprint. The basis for this uniqueness can be traced back to the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of fingerprints.</p>
<p>Aspects of fingerprints that are analyzed include:</p>
 
 Patterns: The general pattern or type of fingerprint (arch, loop, or whorl) is inherited through genetics. 
 Minutiae: The precise details of the ridges, known as minutiae, are influenced by random and unpredictable factors such as pressure, blood flow, and position in the womb during development. 
 Ridges: Each ridge in a fingerprint contains several minutiae points, which can be bifurcations (where one ridge splits into two) or ridge endings. 
 
<p>The distribution and layout of minutiae points vary in every individual, contributing to the specific characteristics of each fingerprint. It is these characteristics that biometric systems analyze when comparing and matching fingerprints.</p>
 Behind the Screen: How Fingerprint Biometrics Work 
<p>Fingerprint recognition is achieved through three steps.</p>
 
 A fingerprint scanner captures the fingerprint, converting the physical pattern into a digital format. 
 The automated recognition system then processes this image to extract distinctive features, forming a unique pattern-matching template. 
 Finally, the facial recognition system matches this template against stored identification or identity verification templates. 
 
<p>Depending on the exact type of fingerprint scanner a business uses, the scanner may use optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, or thermal technologies. Each fingerprint technology has its strengths and weaknesses and will vary in cost, accuracy, and durability.</p>
<p>While the efficacy of biometric scanners is unquestionable, questions about their safety often arise. Potential challenges of fingerprint and facial recognition systems include false acceptance or rejection and biometric data theft.</p>
<p>Although rare, false acceptance of biometric technology can lead to unauthorized access, while false rejection can deny access to legitimate users. Furthermore, if biometric data is compromised, the repercussions can be severe, given that fingerprints cannot be changed, unlike passwords.</p>
<p>However, continuous technological advancements aim to mitigate these risks. Enhanced encryption techniques, anti-spoofing measures, identity verification, and continuous authentication are ways technology addresses these concerns. Together, these enhancements can improve the reliability and security of fingerprint biometrics.</p>
 In-depth Look at Fingerprint Scanners: Optical vs. Capacitive vs. Ultrasonic vs. Thermal 
<p>There are various types of fingerprint scanners, each with strengths and weaknesses.</p>
 Optical scanners 
<p>Optical scanners are the most traditional type. They take a digital fingerprint picture using a light source and a photodiode (a device that turns light into electrical current). Optical scanners are simple to use but can be easily fooled with a good-quality fingerprint image.</p>
 Capacitive scanners 
<p>Commonly found in smartphones, capacitive scanners use electrical current to sense and map the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. They offer higher resolution and security than optical scanners but can be sensitive to temperature and electrostatic discharge.</p>
 Ultrasonic scanners 
<p>Ultrasonic scanners are considered more secure than optical and capacitive scanners. They use high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. This allows them to capture both the surface and sub-surface features of the skin. This information helps form a 3D image of the fingerprint and makes the scanner less prone to spoofing.</p>
 Thermal scanners 
<p>This type of scanner is the least common of the four. Thermal scanners detect minutiae based on the temperature differences of the contact surface. However, their high costs and sensitivity to ambient temperature make them less popular choices.</p>
 Protecting Biometric Identities: Emerging Methods 
<p>As different biometric authentication technologies become more prevalent, safeguarding these identifiers from data breaches has become increasingly crucial. Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be reset or altered like a traditional password, making its protection paramount.</p>
<p>One of the most cost-effective methods for protecting biometric identities is liveness detection. This technology helps differentiate between a live biometric sample from a synthetic or forged one. These systems can differentiate between a live finger and a spoof by analyzing properties of live skin, such as sweat pores and micro-texture.</p>
<p>By detecting bodily responses or using AI to analyze input data for anomalies, liveness detection can add another layer of security to our biometric identification systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage methods, such as blockchain technology, are another avenue for safeguarding biometric data. Instead of storing the data in a central database, it’s dispersed across multiple nodes. These numerous locations make it nearly impossible for hackers to access the entire dataset. While this technology is promising, it’s still nascent and faces scalability and energy efficiency issues.</p>
 Potential Issues with Fingerprint Biometrics and Solutions 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics has its challenges; a common issue users face is the quality of the scanned fingerprint. Poor-quality images can deny legitimate users access to facilities, databases, or other secure locations.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect a person’s fingerprint quality include:</p>
 
 A person’s age 
 Substances on an individual’s hand 
 Skin conditions like dermatitis 
 Manual labor 
 
<p>Furthermore, some systems can be fooled by artificial fingerprints made from various materials like silicone or gelatin, a practice known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication, which requires more than one form of identification, is an increasingly used method to enhance security.</p>
 Securing Biometric Data: Ethical and Legal Considerations 
<p>While biometric authentication offers many significant benefits, it presents unprecedented privacy and data security challenges. Biometric data, unlike other forms of personal data, is intimately tied to our physical bodies. This makes its theft or misuse potentially more invasive and damaging.</p>
<p>The legal landscape for biometric data is still evolving. In many jurisdictions, existing privacy laws may not be sufficient to cover biometric data. This leaves gaps in protection. Stricter regulations and law enforcement may be necessary to ensure that all biometric information is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individual privacy.</p>
<p>Biometric data security isn’t just about preventing unauthorized access to biometric identifiers. It also involves ensuring that the biometric data, once collected, isn’t used for purposes beyond what was initially agreed. This could include selling the data to third parties or using it for surveillance.</p>
 Fingerprint Biometrics in Action: Real-world Applications and Impact 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics extends beyond personal devices and is a cornerstone of modern security across various sectors.</p>
<p>Fingerprints provide irrefutable evidence for law enforcement and forensics teams by helping identify and track suspects. Moreover, businesses and institutions leverage fingerprint biometrics for physical access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter certain premises.</p>
<p>The advent of smartphones equipped with fingerprint sensors has furthered the customer experience and fortified personal device security. Users can unlock their phones, authenticate payments, and secure apps by simply touching a sensor. This biometric authentication offers convenient access control and security while remaining cost effective.</p>
<p>Smart ID cards incorporating fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used in various sectors</p>
 
 Not surprisingly, government and military operations make frequent use of this type of biometric security. 
 However, an automated fingerprint identification system can also be employed in the healthcare industry to allow individuals to gain access to restricted areas. 
 Employees in the education sector can use fingerprint biometrics to enter schools and universities. 
 The corporate world can use this technology to prevent identity theft. 
 Financial systems also integrate fingerprint biometrics, adding a layer of protection over transactions and access to financial services. It helps reduce fraud and ensure customer trust, making it a valuable tool in banking and financial security. 
 
<p>As these real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations of fingerprint identification and other security biometrics. These include visa applications and the distribution of government benefits. Whether securing a company’s computer systems and premises or identifying criminals, fingerprint biometrics have proven their value and substantially impacted security.</p>
 Beyond the Horizon: Future Trends and Innovations in Fingerprint Biometrics 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics, like all technologies, continues to evolve. Several trends and innovations promise to enhance the capabilities and applicability of this technology.</p>
<p>The most recent advancements include 3D fingerprint imaging, which provides a more detailed fingerprint representation that enhances accuracy. Anti-spoofing techniques are also being developed to combat attempts at tricking fingerprint sensors with fake digital fingerprints too.</p>
<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers immense possibilities. These technologies can help improve voice recognition algorithms, making them more highly accurate and adaptable.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, it’s essential to acknowledge that striking a balance between security and privacy with fingerprint technologies remains challenging. As biometric techniques evolve, unfortunately, so will privacy concerns.</p>
 Diversifying Biometric Security: Face and Iris Recognition 
<p>While fingerprints are common biometric security, they aren’t the only biometric technology method available. For instance, facial recognition technology and iris scanning add more layers of protection.</p>
 Facial recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features. This technology has seen an increase in use in recent years, especially in surveillance systems and mobile devices. Despite concerns about privacy and misuse, facial recognition is undeniably a powerful tool in biometrics and homeland security.</p>
 Iris scanning 
<p>Another form of biometric identification is iris scanning. This technique scans a person’s irises using infrared technology and analyzes their individual patterns. Iris scans offer a higher level of security due to the iris’s complex structure, which remains stable throughout an individual’s life. However, it can be more expensive and more complicated to implement than other forms of biometrics.</p>
<p>Integrating these methods with fingerprint biometrics can create a multi-modal biometric system, providing businesses with businesses more reliable and robust security.</p>

 Towards radical transparency — between liveability, affordability, and polycrisis <p>This 2nd blogpost of the series marks the next milestone in the collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB), to increase transparency regarding the largest urban landowners in four European cities (see: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/urban-land-ownership-mapping-towards-a-just-transition-of-europes-built-environment-1-72ff315fefff?source=collection_tagged---------0----------------------------">Blog 1</a> explaining the project purpose). This study mapped land ownership in Copenhagen (as of August, 2023) aiming to reveal the largest land owners, patterns in management of land, and resulting power dynamics in city space production.</p><p>Through these findings, we also suggest initial ways forward with regards to city space production and ownership transparency. We would love to hear your&nbsp;views.</p> Summary (short&nbsp;read) <p>Transparency is a cross-cutting human rights principle, which helps to strengthen decision-making to enable better outcomes for people. <a href="http://ihrb.org">IHRB </a>is partnering with <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> to identify the largest owners of urban land in four European cities, as part of its project <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/focus-areas/built-environment/building-for-today-and-the-future">Building for Today and the Future</a>. This recognizes that knowledge of who owns space within a city is one important step (in tandem with many others) to strengthen decision-making, as well as social and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Copenhagen is known for its high quality of living, deeply rooted culture of public welfare and participation, resistance to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/sep/29/blackstone-rebellion-how-one-country-worlds-biggest-commercial-landlord-denmark">speculative foreign investments</a> as well as rich urban planning and architectural scene: it is often held up as an example of equitable space production and a “liveable” city. However, in the recent decades, the d<a href="https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/architectures-dismantling-and-restructuring">ismantling and restructuring of the Danish Welfare State</a> and private-led urban development patterns have contributed to Copenhagen’s high levels of unaffordability, as well as spatial disparity and <a href="https://www.justiceinitiative.org/voices/q-and-a-my-fight-to-save-my-home-under-denmarks-harsh-ghetto-plan">discrimination</a>. Across Danish cities, the housing cost overburden (reflecting housing cost as a share in disposable income) is the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">second highest</a> in Europe (see also the <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/26">Right to Dwell — Un-liveability Trends, KADK&nbsp;2018</a>).</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/digpub/housing/vis/02_02_01/index.html">Housing in Europe: Housing cost overburden: cities or rural area - Compare your country</a></p><blockquote>→ Data transparency and accessibility in Copenhagen set an example for other cities, as this information is relatively easy to access. However, from our research it is clear that, in contexts such as this, the understanding of the wider city political dynamics, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the static accessible ownership data registers.</blockquote><p>One might therefore want to call for an additional set of tools to increase the transparency and accountability for decision-making. Tools which unlock greater insights into areas such&nbsp;as:</p>  the reasons for value appreciation of land and properties (e.g. through public infrastructure development — see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">A Smart Commons</a>);  real estate transactions; and;  their main beneficiaries.  <p>As this might sound complex… the data, at least for Copenhagen, is largely&nbsp;there.</p><p>Accessibility to static <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/706756/bpfg/bbr/bygning/856a5e15-195a-4570-b387-68ef85bcf408">datasets</a> (or <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/map/706756/bpfg">map</a> interfaces — as the Little Mermaid fortunately resting on the municipal soil) sets a good ground for basic analysis of who owns what, which is still an impossible task in most&nbsp;cities.</p><p>However, extending the sensing infrastructures (civic and public) might render a possibility of updating the predominantly debt-driven land-value capture model → (see: <a href="https://www.oecd.org/cfe/cities/land-value-capture.htm">OECD</a>, 2022 &amp; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cities+for+free&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_deDE1034DE1034&amp;oq=cities+for+free&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBggAEEUYOzIGCAAQRRg7MggIARAAGBYYHjIICAIQABgWGB4yCAgDEAAYFhgeMgoIBBAAGIYDGIoFMgYIBRBFGD3SAQgyMzgxajBqOagCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#">Cities for Free</a>) to better serve the greater public and environmental good in the long-term.</p> The blog that follows&nbsp;shares: <blockquote>1.

Analogously, yet in contrast, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">IHRB</a>, we looked at the set of policies, interventions &amp; approaches that have defined urban land management in Copenhagen. Through this approach we can point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities required to update the way city space is produced in Copenhagen.</p><p>The purpose was not merely to complain or point fingers but to point towards a set of missing institutional and civic capacities necessary to update the way city space of Copenhagen is produced.</p> C1.

Lynetteholmen — New Municipal Land, Mega Projects &amp; Potentials for City-Region Coordination Capacity <p>To further understand the reasons behind the push for developments described by many as risky, environmentally, and socially questionable one needs to zoom out and look at the Copenhagen Metropolitan Area as a whole, which includes 34 municipalities.</p><p>The famous Finger Plan once aimed to ensure the ecological diversity and functionality of the landscape by incorporated green belts with green wedges for recreational and environmental purposes, as well as a strategy for metropolitan expansion along 5 fingers in multiple municipalities. T he plan has been recognized as one of Europe’s best examples of far-sighted and long-term sustainable urban planning.</p><p>In 2015, the responsibility for the FP was handed over from the Ministry of Environment to the Ministry of Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, indicating economic growth as the main function of spatial planning&nbsp;. Apart from the city population growth and political pressures rooted in economic agendas, the green wedges and the structure of the Finger Plan have been challenged by the administrative division of power and interests of the neighbouring municipalities.</p><p>An emblematic example of the regional competition, rather than coordination in the Copenhagen Region can be another island development — Avedøre Holme, promoted by the Hvidovre Municipality, as Europe’s largest business district.</p> C3. Tingbjerg — Non-profit Land, Socio-economic Indicators &amp; Potentials for New Definition of Liveability Fig. top right. Snapshot from <a href="https://tingbjerghusene.dk/find-bolig/">Tingbjerg Husene website</a> — offering purchase of private houses on a former non-profit land in between existing buildings in the area listed as “<a href="https://www.kk.dk/sites/default/files/agenda/74024d70-9be0-4c3e-9c23-88b3b59bca03/2001eab6-4fc1-46aa-8300-b9488900dfc9-bilag-10.pdf">hard Ghetto</a>” (when the term was still in use) where the amount of non-profit housing needs to be reduced to 40% by executive order. Conclusion <p>Some of the key reflections include:</p>  One of the key insights from studying land ownership in Copenhagen — a place where data transparency and availability is exemplar, is that understanding the processes, institutional changes, and local actors’ strategic moves are as important, if not more, than the accessible ownership data registers.  Despite some of the aforementioned trends, Copenhagen still remains a city with large amounts of land owned by the municipality and non-profit associations. This provides lots of scope for change in face of unaffordability and future cascading crises incl. the need for climate adaptation. Here, an update to the land-value capture model where climate risks are accounted for might be of&nbsp;value.  The celebrated land-value capture model with multiplicity of its sub-mechanisms (infrastructure levy, developer obligations etc.) needs to be analyzed in its nuance. There are multiple forms of capturing value uplift and some might contribute to progressing unaffordability. For example unbalanced sale (by e.g. provision of affordable housing in the same area) of land to the highest bidder to repay infrastructure loans is still based on economic principles inadequate for the ultra-long term planning horizons cities need to look at in face of the cost of living crisis and climate adaptation necessities (see DML’s upcoming report with the Scottish Land Commission (link upcoming)).  - The attempt of fixing spatial segregation issues with neoliberal means (via the sale of non-profit land, or commodification of non-profit housing) has proven to achieve the opposite, exacerbating city-scale spatial inequalities. Dissolution of the vulnerable neighbourhoods with the goal to create a “<a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/usc">blended city</a>” in the context of decreasing affordability indicators (Fig 1. are going down) may contribute to a) pushing the “problem” to other locations b) contributing to other forms of spatial segregation and c) nimbyism.  Recognition of lack of institutional capacities to host alternative city and <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">housing development models</a>. The dominant debt-driven logic of the city and its infrastructure development which privileges premium price housing units is not only caused by the widely presumed single-mindedness of politicians or greed of developers. How the wider systemic context is structured sets a fertile pre-condition for this pattern: the financing sector, insurance, education and skills within municipalities or capacities to imagine alternative futures are just some of&nbsp;them.  European, and global mobilization for sustainable, affordable and liveable cities. Copenhagen is a great city and one could argue if it became more inclusive and more affordable in the current globalized context, it would face even harsher population increases which eventually would prevent affordability.  Lack of a long-term perspective — the greatness of Copenhagen is dictated not by the upscale starchitecture developments. It is the welfare state heydays stemming commons: the bikes, the open libraries with baby worlds, the work-life balance, the time to enjoy the good quality public spaces, the scale of the city, access to water, or Christiania neighbourhood in the middle of the&nbsp;city.  <p>Finally, several complex questions which require further consideration came out of this initial investigation:</p><p>In addition to relatively transparent ownership &amp; transaction <a href="https://nyt.ois.dk/search/100060818/sfe">databases</a>:</p>  How can we increase political, societal sensing and sense-making capacities that allow us to foresee the socio-economic futures of the city based on ongoing developments e.g. on models such as land-value capture?  <p>Responding to findings around Almene boliger / Tingbjerg</p>  What institutional infrastructures can be built to make citizens resilient to gradual institutional changes that may undermine their democratic mandate? (referring to Almene&nbsp;boliger)  <p>Reflecting on the dominance of land value capture&nbsp;logic</p>  What other types of more equitable <a href="https://issuu.com/katlotz/docs/rtd_book_single_pages__final/92">development models can be employed</a>, if the neoliberal paradigm is a contributor rather than a cure to socio-economic urban issues (incl. spatial segregation)&nbsp;?  How can local and national policy, regulation, spatial planning &amp; institutional capacities efficiently support and create favourable context for these alternative models to be efficiently deployed?  <p>Some ways forward to explore — context specific (broked down&nbsp;above)</p>  Radical, dynamic land-value uplif transparency  Capacity for new modes of governance of whole city-region land governance  Capacity to sense policy and econmic activity effects on socio-economic indicators  <p>Further, basing on DML, UNDP collaboration “<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58727b5a9de4bbf0b38db631/t/5f12f01c4eab05002211f4a0/1595076643699/ExO+A+Way+Forward_System+Transformation+v07+2.pdf">A way Forward</a>”:</p>  New national statistical offices (<a href="https://pat-kane-xcjl.squarespace.com/s/ExO-A-Way-Forward_System-Transformation-v07-2.pdf">see p.&nbsp;32</a>)  New, and radically trasparent digital infrastructures that enable “<a href="https://nowthenmagazine.com/articles/verbs-not-nouns-how-language-can-shape-alternate-worldviews-giyu-tjauvaljian-yu-chieh-wu">noun to verb</a>” planning.

 The Unified Investor App is Coming… 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in October 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>At Tokeny, we’re thrilled to introduce the new white-label&nbsp;Unified Investor App, an all-in-one platform for&nbsp;issuers&nbsp;to provide their investors with a seamless experience to explore, subscribe, and manage digital securities.</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;distributors&nbsp;(including broker-dealers, marketplaces, exchanges, etc) can leverage this app as well to streamline operations with a fully digital experience. Distributors will now be able to effectively offer more capabilities and features for their clients to expand reach and easily handle a high volume of activities.</p>
<p>We’ve integrated the entire investor experience into one streamlined web application without needing to go to different links with all needed integrations (e.g., e-signing and liveness KYC solutions, etc.).&nbsp;Investors can now do everything with their digital securities in one place, from onboarding, searching for suitable investment opportunities, and managing their portfolio; thereby, merging the three.</p>
 The Three Features That are Consolidating: 
<p>Discover tokenized securities:&nbsp;The Invest section consists of opportunities that are available to eligible users directly on your platform.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Qualifying/subscribing:&nbsp;This part of the investor process pertains to KYC/AML checks, document signing, and payments.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			<p>Manage and trade tokenized securities:&nbsp;A dashboard for the investors to visually organize and see in real-time their portfolio, and to conduct peer-to-peer transfers, as well as to access secondary solutions such as Billboard and exchanges.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 This consolidation offers several advantages: 
 
 All-in-one UX:&nbsp;A complete and fully digital dashboard simplifying the investor’s journey. It leverages the blockchain infrastructure to make actions possible directly on the buy-side: get qualified, find opportunities, invest, redeem, trade, access asset data, etc. 
 Easier access to liquidity:&nbsp;Investors can access liquidity solutions such as centralized exchanges that issuers authorized,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">T-REX billboard</a>&nbsp;(our white-label secondary market solution for digital securities), or even DeFi protocols. 
 Secure and scalable: The cloud-based platform doesn’t require any maintenance from the operator. It is secure and scalable thanks to Tokeny’s scalable infrastructure. 
 
 How do Issuers and Distributors Benefit? 
<p>Beyond elevating the investor experience, our white-label enterprise platform significantly benefits issuers and distributors alike.</p>
<p>Issuers:&nbsp;From the issuer’s perspective, the platform seamlessly integrates the entire investor journey to reduce investors’ drop rate due to redundant processes and attract more digital-first investors, from onboarding to transferability options.</p>
<p>Distributors: The Unified Investor App is white-label, offering these distributors the opportunity to provide a branded all-in-one distribution platform to their investors. They can list carefully curated digital securities, enabling their audience to subscribe. They can qualify investors, and validate transfers with the same workflows as traditional methods, but with the added benefit of a fully digital and real-time experience.</p>
 Currently in Beta Testing 
<p>The Unified Investor Application is set to launch its first version in November, introducing a groundbreaking technological workflow that allows&nbsp;investors, issuers, and distributors to manage and navigate everything seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No longer will investors have to use separate dedicated landing pages for utilizing all of these different features, it will all happen in one place.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for our beta set to go live in the near future. We can’t wait for you to experience the convenience and seamless benefits.</p>
<p>Interested in being a beta tester, please contact us&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/contact/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--erKLTEKUWtOo_kuIOhCTreB70d4vEcyXFIWVkhInQ6fpqku7RQ6HNNNTzvl-FPtXkFZ9g">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, stay tuned for next month’s edition!</p>

<p>Many crypto wallets are out on the market, but they don't all have the same capabilities. They may be specific to a particular ecosystem or lack dapp functionality. But what if there were a way to expand a wallet's abilities to surpass these limitations? </p><p>The Filecoin network has only a few native wallet clients. How can we increase the adoption of the Filecoin network so developers and users can access the ecosystem while also integrating the benefits of the EVM? <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">Metamask's Snaps</a> are one way to add custom functionality to a widely used wallet.</p> Understanding Filecoin Wallet Addresses <p>First, for clarity, let's review some <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/wallet-stack/">wallet terminology</a>. Wallets can contain multiple accounts. Each account has an address. Think of it like a bank account with a checking account number. </p><p>Getting more technical, wallets have Secret Recovery Phrases. Accounts are derived from SRPs, creating private keys that control the account. Addresses are public and are tied to the transactions executed over the blockchain.</p><p>Filecoin has five types of addresses. The ones we'll focus on are F1 and F4. F1 is the Filecoin native address for transactions done solely over the Filecoin network. F4 is the FEVM address. FEVM, or the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, allows developers to port any existing EVM-based smart contracts straight onto the FVM. The F4 address is a translation layer to the EVM ecosystem. &nbsp;</p><p>EVM-compatible wallets support native Ethereum addresses (Ox) and F4 addresses. But what if you want to send Filecoin from a native F1 address to an F4 or Ox address to take advantage of the FEVM ecosystem? And what if that same wallet could support native FIL transactions?</p> Introducing Filsnap <p>Filsnap is a MetaMask plugin, or <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">snap</a>, that adds support for Filecoin native accounts and functionality. MetaMask only supports the EVM ecosystem, so Fission's plugin enables users to utilize MetaMask as a Filecoin wallet.</p><p>Filecoin native wallet: Filsnap can send transactions and receive assets using F1 addresses.</p><p>F1 to F4: Say a person has a wallet supporting only Filecoin native F1 addresses. The user could send their assets to Filsnap and, from there, send assets to F4 addresses. The same goes for exchanges like Coinbase, which doesn't support F4 addresses yet. </p><p>F4 to F1: Say a user wants to withdraw yield from a liquidity pool and put it in cold storage. They can send assets from an F4 address in the Filsnap wallet to the cold wallet that supports F1 addresses via a FilForwarder smart contract. This contract translates from FEVM to native.</p> The Filsnap Library <p>Although Filecoin JS libraries were already available, we chose not to reuse them for a few reasons. First, MetaMask is constantly changing, and we wanted to ensure the code was as up-to-date as possible. Second, the existing libraries are big and weighed down by many dependencies. A lightweight wallet client is preferred for a better user experience when working with the blockchain. Third, because we take security so seriously, we had all of the cryptography dependencies in our library independently audited for peace of mind.</p><p>The new <a href="https://github.com/hugomrdias/iso-repo/tree/main/packages/iso-filecoin">Filecoin JavaScript Library - iso-filecoin</a> is the foundation for three packages - Filsnap, Filsnap Adapter, and Filsnap Adapter React. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/snap">Filsnap</a> is the snap installed in the MetaMask extension. <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter">Filsnap Adapter</a> enables developers to interact with Filsnap from a dapp. Finally, <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/tree/master/packages/adapter-react">Filsnap Adapter React</a> includes React-specific hooks for dapp integration. &nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, there are few native Filecoin wallets, and the existing ones don't expose their functionality to dapps. Filsnap, however, has an API for transactions on the native layer, enabling developers to build apps with native Filecoin functionality! </p> The Filsnap Demo <p>The Filsnap demo supports Filecoin native and FEVM transactions using either Filsnap for native or Metamask for EVM. As mentioned above, it's a great way to manage your assets despite the current technical limitations in wallets and exchanges. <a href="https://filecointldr.io/article/guide-how-to-transfer-fil-from-coinbase-to-a-metamask-wallet-0x">It used to be much more complicated</a>, but now you can do it all in the Filsnap demo app.</p><p>Another benefit of using the Filsnap demo app is security through verifiability. Anyone can verify the snap installed in Metamask through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/filsnap/v/0.3.2#user-content-provenance">NPM Provenance</a> and the app code using <a href="https://bafybeihevfatvsypn35ywbloc4vrjpjpk5akhqv7yi4d7mrahzaaatcmp4.ipfs.dweb.link/">IPFS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap/actions/runs/5984204522/attempts/1#summary-16235152758">GitHub</a>.</p>Release Information: https://filsnap.fission.app/<p>Every app release and git tag is published to IPFS using <a href="https://guide.fission.codes/developers/cli/working-with-apps">Fission apps</a> and can be cloned/forked from <a href="https://github.com/filecoin-project/filsnap">GitHub</a> if a user wishes to self-host or verify integrity using content addressing.</p> Getting Started <p>The Filsnap package has been audited, and the <a href="https://metamask.io/snaps/">MetaMask Snaps are now in open beta</a>.</p><p>The Fission team, lead by Hugo Dias, implemented the audited Filsnap as part of a contract with Protocol Labs.

 Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design&nbsp;Guide <p>We are excited to introduce the “Project Polaris: Navigating Offline Payments with CBDC — A High-Level Design Guide,” the fourth installment in the groundbreaking Project Polaris series by the BIS Innovation Hub. This report is a culmination of collaboration, research, and expertise, and it offers a profound exploration into the intricate world of offline payments with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). SWN Global has been an active participant in this endeavor, joining forces with prominent organizations like BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA to contribute to this comprehensive guide.</p><p>Key Highlights:</p><p>Complexity of Offline Payments: Designing offline payments with CBDC is a complex challenge, marked by intricate trade-offs and unique requirements for each central bank. The report acknowledges that some challenges are not easily resolved, given the diversity of central banks’&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Deepening Knowledge: Building on the foundational insights provided by the earlier handbook, the guide’s primary goal is to deepen the understanding of central banks regarding the underlying technology of offline payments with&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>Workshop Insights: The report draws on the knowledge and wisdom gathered through a series of workshops conducted between May and September 2023. These workshops, in collaboration with 12 solution vendors and 6 observing central banks, reinforced and expanded upon the conclusions of the earlier handbook.</p><p>Key Conclusions: The guide reinforces the importance of offline payments with CBDC for central banks and underlines the need to consider design choices that encompass the entire solution. It acknowledges the presence of trade-offs between various requirements and suggests that an iterative approach to design is essential.</p><p>Evolving Solutions: Recognizing that solutions for offline payments with CBDC are still in an evolutionary phase, the guide notes that very few are production-ready or operating at scale in live environments. However, it highlights the existence of several mature&nbsp;pilots.</p><p>Collaboration and Innovation: Central banks are positioned to be driving forces for collaboration and innovation in the CBDC ecosystem. The report encourages central banks to engage with solution vendors and other potential participants in the CBDC landscape.</p><p>Comprehensive Coverage: The guide provides in-depth coverage of the current solution and technology landscape, outlines the critical design choices that shape offline solutions, and offers practical examples for central banks to tailor their designs to their unique needs. It touches on essential aspects, including resilience, inclusion, privacy, risk management, device security, and&nbsp;limits.</p><p>The insights and knowledge contained within this guide extend beyond offline payments and can also be applied to address issues related to identity, payments with commercial bank money, wallets, and infrastructure for regulated stablecoins.</p><p>Our company is proud to have actively participated in the deep dive event that led to the creation of this report, alongside distinguished partners such as BitMint, Crunchfish, FIS Global, M10 Networks, Giesecke+Devrient, Google, IBM, and IDEMIA.
