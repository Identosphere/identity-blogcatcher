<p>In the increasingly modular world of Web3, crypto bridges have emerged as vital infrastructure, allowing not just digital assets but also data to flow across otherwise siloed blockchains. As decentralized applications and user bases grow across chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, and others, bridges enable cross-chain functionality, improve liquidity distribution, and facilitate multi-chain user experiences.</p><p>But how do these bridges work, what risks do they carry, and how are projects like HPP (House Party Protocol) approaching them in a more secure and purpose-driven way?</p> What Is a Crypto&nbsp;Bridge? <p>A crypto bridge is a set of smart contracts and messaging infrastructure that allows users to move tokens or data from one blockchain to another. Users commonly “lock” assets on a source chain and receive a “wrapped” version on the destination chain. When they want to move back, the wrapped asset is burned, and the original is released.</p><p>Importantly, modern bridges are evolving to support not just tokens, but cross-chain data validation, state updates, and messaging, enabling a broader spectrum of interoperable applications.</p> Why Bridges&nbsp;Matter <p>Without bridges, liquidity and utility are locked within individual chains. That leads to fragmentation, inefficiency, and user friction. Crypto bridges solve this&nbsp;by:</p>  Enabling users to move assets freely across ecosystems  Allowing developers to tap into liquidity from other&nbsp;chains  Supporting cross-chain DeFi, gaming, NFT, and data-sharing applications  Reducing reliance on centralized exchanges  Facilitating cross-chain communication and AI agent orchestration  <p>Bridges are especially crucial in the Layer 2 and modular blockchain landscape, where chains are built for specialized functions (e.g., speed, privacy, compliance) but still need to interoperate.</p> HPP’s Approach to&nbsp;Bridging <p>As Aergo transitions to HPP, a Layer 2 network built on either Arbitrum Orbit or OP Stack depending on strategic and technical considerations, bridging becomes a central component of the roadmap. Aergo tokens exist on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum (ERC-20). In the future, HPP tokens will be launched on the selected Layer 2 platform, and official bridges will be established to support a secure transition and enable seamless cross-chain interactions.</p><p>In the initial stage, the bridge will serve primarily as a secure and convenient method for converting assets between chains. However, as development progresses, this infrastructure will evolve into the core of HPP’s cross-chain architecture, enabling interaction between the Aergo mainnet (L1) and HPP ETH (L2). It will also serve as the foundation for AI-related features, facilitating the orchestration of agents, datasets, and verified compute across multiple environments.</p><p>While the initial focus is on the Aergo-ETH-HPP triad, the team will continue developing additional bridge features based on demand and the evolution of the ecosystem.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Crypto bridges are essential as they represent the frontier of blockchain scalability, data coordination, and user access. Bridges are not just a ‘token swapper’ — they will be the conductor of an AI-purpose network, orchestrating AI agents, datasets, and more. Let’s see how bridges will evolve in the coming age of&nbsp;AI.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-4-understanding-crypto-bridges-6c78937fe5f1">BC 101 #4: Understanding Crypto Bridges</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>On May 8th, 2025, we held our sixth weekly AMA. And for the first time, we hosted it on <a href="https://x.com/i/spaces/1OyJALokBMNGb">X/Twitter Spaces.</a> The session with hosts Ben and Raph covered everything from HPP’s roadmap and token migration to AI, ecosystem partnerships, and more. Here’s a numbered recap of the key questions and insights&nbsp;shared:</p>  Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for HPP?<br>HPP (House Party Protocol) is the next evolution of the Aergo public blockchain. Backed by a team with over a decade in Web3, HPP represents a pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. It builds on Aergo’s strong enterprise foundation to support more adaptive, intelligent, and data-driven applications.  When will HPP launch?<br>HPP is targeting a launch in Q3 2025, which is when the current Aergo chain will transition into the HPP network. Until then, users can follow the project through its living roadmap and community channels like Twitter, Telegram, and Medium. Development updates, branding efforts, and offline appearances are ongoing in preparation for the official&nbsp;launch.  How will the token swap from AERGO to HPP work?<br>The AERGO to HPP token swap will happen at a 1:1 ratio. The process will depend on where the tokens are held. Most exchanges are expected to handle the swap automatically. A bridge may be required for self-custodied tokens. Official instructions will be provided ahead of the swap. Users are advised to stay vigilant and only trust verified channels.  Are there any Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains like BNB or Solana?<br>No. AERGO currently exists only on the Aergo mainnet and Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. If anyone is offering Aergo or HPP tokens on other chains (e.g., BNB or Solana), it is a scam. The only safe way to move tokens is through the official bridge provided by the&nbsp;project.  Is staking available for AERGO tokens?<br>Yes. AERGO staking is available on the Aergo mainnet. Community members regularly share updated staking options in the Telegram chat, which is the best place to learn more and get involved.  What is the relationship between Aergo and Blocko?<br>Aergo and Blocko are separate entities, although they share early founders. Blocko serves as a long-term technology partner and contributes development and infrastructure support to the Aergo ecosystem. Blocko also works with major enterprise clients and remains a trusted blockchain solution provider.  Why is HPP focused on AI?<br>AI is no longer just a trend; it is becoming a foundational layer of modern digital applications. HPP is designed to address AI accountability, data validation, and agent verification. The goal is to support both innovative AI use cases and safeguards against misuse by providing a secure blockchain environment for data and agent integrity.  What is VaaSBlock’s role in the HPP ecosystem?<br>VaasBlock is an independent company that focuses on Web3 accountability tools. It is closely aligned with Aergo and contributes to the HPP ecosystem through W3DB — a decentralized registry for datasets and AI agents. While separate, the collaboration is strong, and team members often work side-by-side.  Any updates on Binance spot listing?<br>Currently, Aergo is listed on Binance Futures. The team would like to see a Binance Spot listing but has no control over Binance’s listing decisions. The focus remains on building real products and delivering value through the HPP ecosystem in hopes of earning broader listings over&nbsp;time.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/hpp-ama-6-recap-from-aergo-to-hpp-ai-and-whats-coming-next-3f9f865549a2">HPP AMA #6 Recap: From Aergo to HPP, AI, and What’s Coming Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How Decentralized Digital Identity Is Revolutionizing Data Security in Universities 



<p>HiHigher-ed institutions handle millions of sensitive records—transcripts, diplomas, research files, financial aid documents—but still rely on emails, paper forms, and siloed databases. The result?</p>



 
 $600 M+ lost annually to fake credentials 



 5–14 days per manual verification 



 Under 50% of universities enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) on critical systems 
 



<p>This article shows how decentralized digital identity (SSI) and Extrimian’s solutions solve these problems with real metrics, clear steps, and a roadmap for modernizing your campus.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Key Takeaways</p>



 
 SSI cuts verification from days to minutes. 



 Cryptographic credentials eliminate all fraud. 



 Extrimian’s <a>Digital Credential Wallet</a>, <a>ID Connect API</a> and <a href="https://extrimian.io/academy/">Academy</a> deliver end-to-end support. 



 ROI: 98% time saved, 100% MFA adoption, near-zero fraud. 
 



<p></p>
</blockquote>



 



 1. Challenges and Barriers in Higher Education 



 1.1 Credential Fraud 



 
 $600 M+ lost every year to forged diplomas and transcripts 



 30% of job applicants lie about academic qualifications 
 



 1.2 Slow, Manual Processes 



 
 5–14 days per document for traditional verification 



 $20–$30 cost per manual check 
 



 1.3 Security Gaps 



 
 Only 45% of institutions enforce MFA consistently (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024/cyber-security-breaches-survey-2024-education-institutions-annex">UK Cyber Survey 2024</a>) 



 Ransomware groups like HIVE and Vice Society have shut down campuses (e.g., Munster Technological University, 2023)

				  Portable identity is changing the way we prove who we are—making it faster, safer, and way more user-friendly. When people store their digital credentials directly on their phones, we get faster systems, stronger privacy, and a smoother experience for both users and businesses. In this blog, we’ll break down how portable identity works—and why it’s becoming a game-changer for organizations looking to cut costs, boost efficiency, and build trust.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Traditional identity verification and access management systems represent a huge cost and headache for organizations. <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/former-pangiam-managing-partner-and-chief-investment-officer-tom-plofchan-joins-indicio-as-a-strategic-advisor-to-guide-decentralized-digital-identity-strategy/">Indicio Strategic Advisor Tom Plofchan</a> put it best in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJCTzM-w96g">Indicio Meetup</a>, “Identity verification systems today are disparate. They’re not interoperable across hardware systems. On the software side, they’re not privacy by design, meaning that they aren’t built to be able to erase personally identifiable information and protect PII and, as a result, civil liberties. They inherently require the use of a centralized either repository or a centralized authority in order to provide, ultimately, the verification. This has a number of risks for the companies that have to take and store that data. Data breaches, hacks, etc.”</p>
<p>Today’s identity verification systems are a complex and costly solution to an ultimately simple problem: You need to know who your employees are, who your customers are, and who is accessing your systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Portable identity turns the control of the data over to the user. Organizations can lower operational costs from manual onboarding and authorization systems for employees and customers with efficient automation of identity checks, either in person or online, using the information issued as a tamper-proof Verifiable Credential. This method can turn what was a large cost for organizations into a business driver by allowing customers and partner organizations to interact quickly, simply, and securely with your systems without the need for complex integrations.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  The business benefits 
<p>Businesses can cut costs across the board. This is even true for organizations that rely on a SaaS identity provider that still want to reduce liability, storage costs, and maintenance costs. Indicio Advisor Will Groah explains, “While some enterprises like the SaaS model because they know exactly what their costs are going to be, and that is certainly very important, what portable identity does is allow a digital transformation from that SaaS model that most players are using towards a transaction model. Inherent in that is the ability for institutions who are adopting this technology to be on a path to reduce their costs over time.”</p>
<p>Don’t integrate–interoperate</p>
<p>Businesses can also save time and effort by reducing the need to set up complex integrations between partners, teams, and databases. When customer information can be easily shared to anyone with the verification software, any part of your organization can verify a portable identity and instantly authenticate without checking in with a centralized server. More importantly, partner organizations can use the same credentials to verify your customers and offer them discounts or incentives without needing to reach out to confirm with your systems.</p>
<p>Portable identity evens the playing field for small and medium sized businesses too. Often these organizations don’t have the time, money, or bandwidth to set up a large identity system but still want to drive good customer experiences. As Plofchan commented, “You could be a small company, and effectively, you’re priced out of leveraging digital identity as it currently exists, for all the reasons we said, not interoperable, too many choke points, too much integration work, too much regulatory concern.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials allow any company, regardless of size, to leverage powerful identity systems, and simplify the entire process by issuing trustable digital identities, and providing access with a quick automated verification.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  The user benefits too 
<p>The biggest win for users? You control your digital identity and can use it anywhere it’s accepted, not just with whoever gave it to you. Say your bank gives you a credential, you can take it to a partner insurance company to verify your information, making things faster and maybe even unlocking perks. It’s kind of like “Login with Google,” but you stay in control– and it works in real life, not just online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no faster, or more convenient user experience than a portable identity. These credentials completely replace the need for passwords, multi factor authentication, security questions, or any other time consuming annoying verification process. You can scan a QR code, prove your identity instantly, and be on your way.</p>
<p>Portable identities also offer much more enhanced security than today’s centralized systems ever could. Any large system today can have hundreds of thousands of people’s identities and acts as a honeypot for bad actors. One breach and everyone’s data is compromised. With portable identities your data is secure on your mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, users of portable identities can be certain of who they are interacting with online. There is currently no way to remove all uncertainty from digital interactions, and scammers are increasingly adept at impersonation attacks or simply creating false information. Indicio VP of Communications and Governance Trevor Butterworth nailed it when he said, “The question is, have we reached a tipping point where we need a new transformational technology to deal with the noise and uncertainty that runs rampant in our digital interactions? Let’s face it, our entire communication system is largely digital, and that noise is fundamentally not knowing who you’re talking to, and you don’t really know whether the information has been altered during the course of its exchange.”</p>

<p>On today’s episode we spoke to Rebekah Johnson, Founder &amp; CEO of Numeracle. This was a fascinating conversation about Rebekah’s journey starting Numeracle in 2016 to bring trust back to business communications by tackling robocalling and spam in the telecom ecosystem.</p><p>We talk about how Numeracle became an early identity issuer in telecom through the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN protocols which have now rolled out to subscribers of carriers like T-Mobile and how she overcame the classic chicken-and-egg problem of launching before carriers were ready. We also discuss how the business identity ecosystem compares to consumer digital identity, and what companies should do when they know a new standard is coming (like eIDAS 2.0), but it’s not here yet.</p><p>We finish by exploring modern AI's impact on communications, including how to preserve trust when automated agents or AI-powered voice calls are part of the conversation.</p><p>You can learn more about Numeracle at <a href="https://www.numeracle.com/">numeracle.com</a> and connect with Rebekah on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bekajohnson/">LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>“What if the real innovation is not centralization vs decentralization, but the ability to shift between them?”</p>



<p>That question has been rattling around in my brain lately, and I keep coming back to it. Not because I have a clever answer—goodness knows I’m not an identity architect, nor can I play one on TV—but because it changes the shape of the conversation I’m used to hearing. It stops being about camps or philosophies—centralized vs decentralized—and starts being about resilience. Adaptability. Survivability. Malleability. The real stuff that makes or breaks systems under pressure.</p>



<p>Whether you realize it or not, most of us are already living in the murky middle. Even the most rigorously centralized enterprise setup has had to grapple with siloed systems from acquisitions, third-party integrations that can’t be wrangled into compliance, or regional requirements that throw a wrench into the “single source of truth” fantasy.</p>



<p>On the consumer side, it’s no simpler. Many apps build their entire onboarding flow around third-party login, such as Sign in with Google, Facebook, Apple, only to realize later they can’t get out. Apple tweaks its policies, Google changes branding or scopes, and suddenly your user flow is broken. Or worse, your legal team is panicking about data access that was never fully under your control.</p>



<p>So maybe the goal shouldn’t be to “pick a side.” Maybe the goal is to build something that can move.</p>



 We’ve Been Here Before 



<p>I remember when the phrase “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” first started making the rounds. It was a wake-up call for how data was being monetized, especially in consumer tech. But in enterprise settings, it’s always been more complicated. Control over employee and operational data is often treated as sacred… until an M&amp;A event hits, or an offboarding workflow depends on access to a different tenant’s system, or someone discovers the only copy of a critical record lives on a spreadsheet maintained by a single team in Ukraine.</p>



<p>Even the executives who believe they have centralized control are often just looking at a well-behaved abstraction. Under the surface, the architecture is often more federated (or fragmented) than anyone wants to admit.</p>



<p>So: centralized in theory, decentralized in reality. And that’s (probably) fine, if you plan for it.</p>

 Centralized vs Decentralized is the Wrong Question 



<p>The wrong question is, “Should we centralize everything or decentralize everything?” Because you’re never going to have a clean answer to that. Business needs shift. Systems fail. Teams grow faster than governance can keep up. Which means sometimes, decentralization isn’t just a compromise, it’s a strategic advantage.</p>



<p>Take employee authentication. It’s easy to default to a centralized IdP for control and visibility. But control doesn’t always mean centralization. In some cases, like high-assurance access to sensitive systems, decentralized approaches like verifiable digital credentials might offer more resilient and efficient ways to meet your risk and compliance goals. (I’ve written about this in more detail <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/25/digital-credentials-in-the-enterprise/">over here</a>.)</p>



<p>So instead of asking “which architecture is best?” the real question is:</p>



<p>How do we build for mobility between them?</p>



 Shift Zones: A Mental Model 



<p>Here’s how I think about it. Your architecture probably has at least three layers:</p>



 
 Core systems that demand high assurance, strong governance, and low tolerance for error. These might initially seem like candidates for centralization, but in practice, decentralized approaches (like verifiable credentials) can reduce exposure, improve auditability, and allow more precise access controls. Think about systems managing employee benefits, third-party entitlements, or financial approvals that span org boundaries. 



 Edge systems where decentralization improves speed, autonomy, or user experience. Think mobile app login, partner ecosystems, or field service platforms. 



 Bridge systems that help you manage both ends: identity brokers, API gateways, credential verifiers. These are your control points. They don’t need to be perfect, but they do need to be swappable. 
 



 This Isn’t About Complexity. It’s About Control. 



<p>There’s a reflexive fear that anything outside your central architecture introduces risk. But lock-in is its own kind of risk. What happens when:</p>



 
 The cloud provider you bet everything on has a region-wide outage? 



 Your go-to identity vendor starts charging for what used to be free? 



 A new privacy law forces you to isolate user records by country? 
 



<p>If your systems can’t move, your strategy can’t either.</p>



<p>Which brings us to an uncomfortable truth: flexibility isn’t a feature you tack on later. It’s an investment in survivability. And yes, that includes your DR/BC planning. If your recovery plan assumes the architecture will look the same when you need to recover—same vendors, same identity flows, same regional rules—you’re about to have a Really Bad Day.</p>



<p>Systems don’t fail in isolation. They fail in ways that expose your hidden dependencies. The real risk is that the thing you need next won’t work the way it used to or, more to the point, the way you’ve planned for come recovery time. If your plan can’t flex, it can’t recover. To put it another way: rigid design is brittle, so avoid it if you can.</p>



 Trends That Make This Urgent (Not Just Interesting) 



<p>Still on the fence about needing this kind of mobility? Here’s what’s already pushing organizations in that direction:</p>



 
 Regulations that require data residency or mandate new consent flows 



 Cloud concentration risk, made worse by geopolitical volatility 



 AI deployment that needs decentralized access to proprietary or regional datasets 



 Identity policy changes (looking at you, browsers) that upend previously stable auth flows 
 



<p>None of these trends are waiting for you to clean up your architecture.</p>



 Pop Quiz! 



<p>If you’re a CIO, architect, or planner, ask yourself:</p>



<p>Can your systems…</p>



<blockquote>
 
 …switch to a new identity provider or trust a new authority within 48 hours if they have to 



 …segment authorization policy by region or user group without rewriting everything? 



 …keep functioning when a key vendor changes terms or disappears? 



 …pivot to a new compliance boundary without a year of re-architecture? 
 
</blockquote>



<p>If not, it might be time to rethink what “flexibility” really means in your environment.</p>



 Final Thought: Don’t Confuse Control with Stability 



<p>Centralization often feels like control. Decentralization often feels like chaos. But both are illusions if you haven’t built for change. The real strength comes not from sticking to one approach, but from designing your systems to flex across time zones, use cases, org charts, and crises.</p>



<p>So next time someone in the boardroom or the architecture review committee asks, “Should we [de-]centralize this?” maybe try responding with:</p>



<p>“There are pros and cons, but first, let’s make sure we build in an ability to change our minds later.”</p>

 Thales subsidiary, Thales Defense &amp; Security, Inc. (TDSI) received an order from the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) for Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) retrofit kits to support U.S. Air Force (USAF) F-16 HMD modernization. 
 The Scorpion HMD kits provide a modern digital platform allowing for enhanced pilot situational awareness with full color symbology and a single display for both day and night operations. The Scorpion HMD kits will replace the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and allow the USAF a common Scorpion HMD solution across Air Force, Air National Guard and USAF Reserve F-16s. 
 Thales Visionix, a division of Thales Defense &amp; Security, Inc., a world leader in the development and integration of advanced optics, motion tracking and symbology for fixed and rotary wing HMDs, will manage the contract.<br>

<p>Thales subsidiary, Thales Defense &amp; Security, Inc. (TDSI), received an order under an existing framework contract with NSPA in support of the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for Scorpion Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) retrofit kits to enhance F-16 pilot visualization and situational awareness. The award supports modernization of HMDs for active duty F-16 block 40 and 50 aircraft by Thales Visionix, a division of TDSI.</p>
<p>The Scorpion HMD kits will replace the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) and allow the USAF a standardized Scorpion HMD solution across Air Force, Air National Guard and USAF Reserve F-16s. Scorpion provides a modern digital platform allowing for enhanced pilot situational awareness with full color symbology and a single display for both day and night operations. Tracking accuracy is also markedly improved, as Scorpion is baselined with Visionix’s precision HObIT (Hybrid Optically based Inertial Tracker) tracker. The HObIT system provides precise tracking through a fusion of inertial-optical technology.</p>
 “Modernization efforts around helmet-mounted displays for aircraft are essential to pilots as they provide critical real-time information directly in their line of sight, enhancing situational awareness, decision-making, and operational efficiency while reducing the need to divert attention from the aircraft’s instruments and environment,” said Jim Geraghty, Vice President of Visionix, Thales. “Already supporting F-16 Air National Guard pilots with superior awareness and tracking capability, Scorpion kits will now enhance holistic USAF air dominance.” 
<p>This order, issued by NSPA supporting USAF F-16 modernization efforts, is the first of several anticipated delivery orders. The contract arrangement also allows a procurement option for any F-16 NATO partner to modernize with Scorpion kit capability with similarly configured aircraft. Initial kits are anticipated to be delivered to the USAF in late-2025.</p>

<p>As a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, maintaining robust Know Your Customer (KYC), Know Your Business (KYB), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows is essential to comply with regulatory requirements and safeguard your firm against financial crimes.</p>



<p>Below is a checklist to help ensure your compliance programs align with FINRA rules:</p>



 1. Know Your Customer (KYC) 



 
 Customer Identification Program (CIP):
 
 Collect and verify essential customer information:
 
 Full name 



 Date of birth 



 Address 



 Identification number 
 
 



 Maintain records of the identification information and verification methods used. 
 
 



 Customer Due Diligence (CDD):
 
 Understand the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop a risk profile. 



 Conduct ongoing monitoring to identify and report suspicious activities. 
 
 



 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD):
 
 Apply additional scrutiny to high-risk customers, such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) or those from high-risk jurisdictions. 



 Gather information on the source of funds and wealth. 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Rule:</p>



 
 FINRA Rule 2090 – Know Your Customer: Requires firms to use reasonable diligence to know and retain essential facts concerning every customer. <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/2090?utm_source=chatgpt.com">FINRA</a> 
 



 2. Know Your Business (KYB) 



 
 Business Entity Verification:
 
 Verify the legal status and ownership structure of corporate clients. 



 Identify and verify beneficial owners with a 25% or more ownership stake. 
 
 



 Risk Assessment:
 
 Assess the nature of the business, its products, services, and customer base to determine risk levels. 
 
 



 Ongoing Monitoring:
 
 Continuously monitor business accounts for unusual or suspicious activities. 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Guidance:</p>



 
 While FINRA does not have a specific rule titled “KYB,” the principles of customer due diligence and AML compliance extend to business entities. 
 



 3. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance 



 
 Written AML Program:
 
 Develop and implement a written AML program approved by senior management. 



 Ensure the program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and its implementing regulations. 
 
 



 Independent Testing:
 
 Conduct independent testing of the AML program at least annually to assess its effectiveness. 
 
 



 Designated AML Compliance Officer:
 
 Appoint a qualified individual responsible for overseeing AML compliance. 
 
 



 Ongoing Training:
 
 Provide ongoing training for appropriate personnel to ensure awareness of AML responsibilities. 
 
 



 Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR):
 
 Establish procedures for detecting and reporting suspicious transactions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). 
 
 
 



<p>Relevant FINRA Rule:</p>



 
 FINRA Rule 3310 – Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program: Sets forth minimum standards for AML compliance programs, including the requirements mentioned above. <a href="https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/3310?utm_source=chatgpt.com">FINRA</a> 
 



 Additional Considerations 



 
 Recordkeeping:
 
 Maintain comprehensive records of all customer information, transaction reports, and compliance efforts as required by FINRA and the BSA. 
 
 



 Risk-Based Approach:
 
 Implement a risk-based approach to AML compliance, allocating resources commensurate with the level of risk identified. 
 
 



 Regulatory Updates:
 
 Stay informed about updates to FINRA rules and federal regulations to ensure ongoing compliance. 
 
 
 



<p>By adhering to this checklist and the associated FINRA rules, your firm can establish robust KYC, KYB, and AML workflows that not only comply with regulatory requirements but also protect against financial crimes and enhance overall operational integrity.</p>

Take a look at parts <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/proven-for-ai-verifiable-credentials-enable-ai-agents-to-perform-efficiently-effectively/">one</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/digital-banking-is-painful-ai-agents-backed-by-verifiable-credentials-can-help/">two</a> where we provide an overview about the intersection between these two groundbreaking technologies.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly moving beyond buzzword status in financial services to a business imperative and for good reason. The ability to “reason” autonomously makes it a much more powerful problem-solving technology than traditional AI, and this elevates its capacity to transform customer engagement. For an industry known for cautious, incremental change, this kind of intelligent autonomy represents one of the most profound shifts in decades.</p>
<p>But this transformation isn’t just about your bank upgrading its tech stack. It’s a new, bold redesign around the customer’s needs, and combining the data, and the infrastructure needed to support that ambition.</p>
<p>That’s the perspective of i2c CEO Amir Wain. In a recent conversation with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/this-week-in-ai-visa-mastercard-and-paypal-go-all-in-on-agentic-commerce/">Wain laid out the critical components</a> needed for a successful agentic AI strategy. His central message? The tools are ready; the institutions aren’t.</p>
 What’s holding back financial services from adopting AI? 
<p>According to Wain, financial institutions have been exploring AI for years, which has led to mature use cases like fraud detection, product recommendations, and back-office automation. But the real breakthrough, he argues, lies in automating entire decision workflows—particularly in fraud response, where AI doesn’t just detect anomalies, but acts on them in real time.</p>
<p>What’s holding this potential back isn’t a lack of innovation, it’s outdated infrastructure. Most banks still operate with fragmented systems: each product line in its own silo, each customer interaction governed by a different identity framework. Data remains locked in legacy environments, making real-time access difficult and integration across services nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Without a single, dynamic view of the customer—spanning loans, credit, deposits, and more—AI systems are left piecing together partial information, making assumptions based on incomplete or inconsistent data. Agentic AI demands the opposite: vast, contextual, high-quality information to operate autonomously and intelligently.</p>
<p>Wain’s message is clear: to unlock the full power of agentic AI, institutions must design around the idea of “one unified customer.” That means eliminating redundant onboarding, unifying data across touchpoints, and embedding trusted identity into every interaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If I still want to interact the same way that I did,” he said, “then I’m really not maximizing the capabilities of agentic AI.”</p>
 The missing link: Verifiable Credentials 
<p>What’s missing from this new, seamless financial world is identity: the customer’s, the AI agent’s. <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/digital-banking-is-painful-ai-agents-backed-by-verifiable-credentials-can-help/">As we noted in a previous article in this series,</a> for the dream of agentic AI to work, it has to navigate the challenges of privacy and security and their combined existential threat to the customer (or from regulators).</p>
<p>This is why a unified view of the customer can only begin with a trusted, verifiable identity using a single, reusable credential that can authenticate a person securely across systems, services, and product lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Wain’s ideal model, an AI system can seamlessly cross-reference data across accounts, evaluate risk in real time, and generate personalized offers, without forcing the customer through a maze of redundant verification steps.</p>
<p>This level of intelligent automation is only possible when identity and access permissions are embedded directly into the workflow—andthat’s exactly what Verifiable Credentials provide.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials act as a force multiplier for financial services, supplying a reliable identity foundation that enables intelligent, automated decision-making from seamless, secure authentication and permissioned data access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this infrastructure in place, financial institutions can finally move beyond siloed data and fragmented processes toward something radically better: a self-sovereign, permissioned identity layer. This enables real-time personalization, proactive risk assessment, and seamless fraud prevention—all without compromising privacy or compliance.</p>
<p>A reusable, portable digital credential allows AI systems to instantly understand who the customer is, what permissions they’ve granted, and which data can be used—all in real time.</p>
<p>The result? Concierge-level service at scale: dynamic credit decisions, proactive support, and personalized offers—not just for high-net-worth clients, but for everyone. Because agentic AI doesn’t pause—and with the right trust layer, it doesn’t guess.</p>
 The time to build is now 
<p>Wain’s message was clear: the organizations that win with agentic AI will be the ones with strong leadership, modern infrastructure, and real-time data access. And that includes verifiable identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“People see the power of AI,” Wain said. “And they’re willing to pay for it.”</p>
<p>To seize this opportunity, financial services must act decisively:</p>
 
 Architect for customer-centricity 
 Modernize data systems 
 Embed verifiable credentials and identity workflows 
 And embrace agentic AI as a core capability—not a bolt-on feature 
 
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven </a>makes this real. Built on open standards for Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity, Proven allows financial institutions to issue, verify, and use trusted digital credentials across their entire ecosystem.</p>

<p>The European Union just dropped a regulatory bombshell: by 2027, anonymous crypto accounts and privacy coins like Monero, Zcash, and Dash will be banned under sweeping new anti-money laundering rules.</p><p>The debate around crypto regulation has officially shifted. The question is no longer if crypto will comply with traditional financial regulations — it’s whether there will be any space left for privacy at all. And if not, what exactly are we building?</p> The Regulatory Reality <p>Starting July 2027, EU’s Anti-Money Laundering Regulation will:</p>  Ban any cryptocurrency designed to provide transaction anonymity  Require full KYC for all users of crypto platforms  Mandate identity verification for transactions over&nbsp;€1,000  Create a new authority (AMLA) to enforce these standards  <p>This represents the most aggressive regulatory stance against privacy in crypto to date, effectively erasing the anonymity that was once fundamental to the crypto&nbsp;ethos.</p> The Philosophical Dilemma <p>If blockchain technology becomes merely a more efficient version of our existing financial system — with the same surveillance, the same identity requirements, and the same centralized oversight — have we lost the&nbsp;plot?</p><p>Crypto was born as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, offering an alternative to centralized banking. Now, as it’s forced to mirror those same systems, we must ask: what value does it still&nbsp;offer?</p> The Privacy&nbsp;Paradox <p>The tension between regulation and privacy reveals a fundamental paradox: financial systems require trust, yet the original promise of crypto was to eliminate the need for trust through code. When we reintroduce centralized trust requirements via regulation, we fundamentally alter the value proposition.</p><p>Consider what’s lost when privacy disappears:</p>  Financial sovereignty — The ability to control your assets without surveillance  Protection from discrimination — Prevention of selective financial exclusion based on patterns of&nbsp;spending  Business confidentiality — Companies’ ability to keep competitive financial strategies private  Personal security — Protection from targeting based on visible&nbsp;wealth  <p>The irony is striking: in the name of security and consumer protection, we may be creating systems more vulnerable to both governmental overreach and targeted&nbsp;attacks.</p> Beyond Compliance: Technical Responses <p>The crypto industry now faces a crossroads. Several approaches are emerging:</p> 1. Compliance-Forward Architectures <p>Some platforms are embracing full regulatory compliance, building KYC/AML directly into protocol layers. This “surveillance-by-design” approach prioritizes regulatory acceptance over&nbsp;privacy.</p> 2. Boundary-Layer Solutions <p>Others are developing systems where privacy exists conditionally — allowing private transactions within regulatory boundaries while enabling compliance at critical junctures. Zero-knowledge proofs offer possibilities for selective disclosure without complete transparency.</p> 3. Jurisdictional Arbitrage <p>We’re likely to see geography-based fragmentation, with privacy coins and anonymous protocols flourishing outside the EU while compliant systems dominate within regulated territories.</p> 4. Decentralized Identity <p>Perhaps most promising are approaches that separate identification from surveillance, allowing for regulatory compliance without wholesale privacy sacrifice through selective disclosure mechanisms.</p> The New North&nbsp;Star <p>As the industry adapts to this regulatory reality, perhaps we need a new guiding principle — one that recognizes both the necessity of some regulation and the fundamental human right to&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The most innovative projects won’t be those that simply evade regulation nor those that surrender completely to surveillance capitalism. They’ll be the ones that thread the needle, finding technical and governance approaches that satisfy regulatory requirements while preserving the core value of individual financial autonomy.</p><p>Because if crypto becomes indistinguishable from the banking system it sought to reform — just with better technology — then we’ve built nothing revolutionary at all. We’ve merely digitized the status&nbsp;quo.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust. It is a public protocol designed to drive data discoverability and compliance into blockchain while preserving privacy and sovereignty. SHFT is its native token and fuel of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Shyft Network facilitates the transfer of verifiable data between centralized and decentralized ecosystems. It sets the highest crypto compliance standard and provides the only frictionless Crypto Travel Rule compliance solution while protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Visit<a href="https://www.shyft.network/"> our website</a> to read more, and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">X (Formerly Twitter)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://bb.linkedin.com/company/shyftnetwork">LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork"> </a><a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>,<a href="https://medium.com/@shyftnetwork"> Medium</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shyftnetwork7362/videos"> YouTube</a>.<a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe"> Sign up for our newsletter</a> to keep up-to-date on all things privacy and compliance.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-death-of-privacy-in-crypto-eus-2027-ban-raises-existential-questions-9e85b5f1123f">The Death of Privacy in Crypto: EU’s 2027 Ban Raises Existential Questions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs is searching for partners to help us promote safe use of the internet and support at-risk people who have a specific need for privacy and security in their life.</p>



<p>We’re inviting interested organizations to sign up as advocates of our Sudo Safe initiative and help us spread the word about a reliable way at-risk people can interact with others without giving away their phone number, email address, and other personal details.</p>



<p>Sudo Safe Advocates would help us share the important message about safe communication and offer their employees or members a 60-day free trial* of <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo all-in-one privacy app</a> which gives users real, alternative phone numbers and email addresses (and more) to use instead of their own.</p>



<p>In today’s highly connected world, we are all asked to share our phone and email everywhere we go online and in real life. But a person’s phone number and email are easy access points for a potential stalker or attacker.</p>



<p>A stalker or attacker can use those personal details to contact their victim directly, send them threatening texts, hack their email and socials, and use <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">other tech</a> to track their movements, for example.</p>



<p>Using a separate phone and email is a useful safety strategy. MySudo allows users to manage up to 9 separate phone numbers and email addresses to use for their personal privacy and safety.</p>



<p>The phone and email are built into <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, secure digital identities that can be set up for specific purposes and <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020176373-How-do-I-delete-a-Sudo-profile">deleted</a> or <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055670913-How-do-I-Mute-Notifications-for-a-Sudo-Profile">muted</a> at any time to cut off tech access to any person who has the Sudo details.</p>



<p>What’s more, each Sudo has the option for a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">virtual card</a> to use instead of a personal credit or debit card. Card charges appear only as ‘MySudo Transaction’ on the user’s bank statement. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, each Sudo’s <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a> allows the user to search the internet ad and tracker free, help to break the user’s data trail and make it more difficult to correlate their movements online.<br><br>A Sudo Safe Advocate could be any organization that works with survivors or those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse, or any organization that strives to help protect the personal safety of its employees or members, such as universities and colleges, hospitals and health care agencies, and government agencies.<br><br>To join the Sudo Safe Advocates program or find out more, head to this <a href="https://anonyome.com/sudo-safe-initiative/#advocate">link</a>. Once there, simply complete the short online form and we will send you our digital safe communication toolkit plus the promo code for the 60-day free trial* of MySudo to share with your employees or members.</p>



<p>If your organization is interested in discussing other ways to partner with Anonyome Labs’ Sudo Safe initiative, please email us at <a href="mailto:sudosafe@anonyome.com">sudosafe@anonyome.com</a>&nbsp;and we’ll reach out to you.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs empowers people to be able to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We provide survivors and those at risk of harassment, violence and abuse with real and effective tools for protecting their name, email, phone number and more. Talk to us today about how we can work together.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is also a proud partner of the&nbsp;<a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>,&nbsp;a global working group uniting advocacy groups, software developers, security firms, victims and survivors in the fight to protect consumers against stalkerware and to eliminate abusive technology and software.</p>



<p>*Each advocate receives a promo code to offers its employees or members a 60-day free trial of the MySudo <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">SudoPro</a> plan.</p>

<p>The UK is aiming to join the growing number of nations introducing forms of digital identity that, if done right, could empower citizens to protect their privacy like never before.</p>
<p>In 2023, the British government released a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework (DITF)</a> that provided a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in any future digital identity-based initiatives in an effort to boost the country’s <a href="https://ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CCIA_State-of-the-UK-Digital-Economy.pdf">$150 billion</a> digital economy. The idea: enable smoother, more secure online transactions and align more closely to the secure route taken by much of Europe when it comes to digital identity.</p>
 What Exactly Is Digital Identity? 
<p>Identity verification and proofing are essential to functioning societies. It enables individuals to prove their identity to take out loans, make purchases, receive entitlements, access services, manage finances, and more. Verifying that identity in digital channels has been tougher, accomplished mainly through usernames, passwords, and rudimentary forms of multifactor authentication. Thanks to never-ending phishing scams and data breaches, the result has been a <a href="https://www.virtasant.com/ai-today/cybercrime-costs-skyrocket-to-10-5-trillion-ai-in-cybersecurity-fights-back#:~:text=The%20annual%20cost%20of%20cybercrime,exceed%20$10.5%20trillion%20by%202025.">$10.5 trillion-a-year</a> global cybercrime economy.</p>
<p>New forms of digital identity are generally validated digital attributes and credentials designed primarily, but not exclusively, for the digital world that are verified by cross-referenced government-issued physical world credentials. Birth credentials, driver’s license, passports—those kinds of things. They also increasingly include biometric information, like a fingerprint or face scan.</p>
<p>For national identification purposes, digital identity can be connected to, and even contained in, biometric-enabled ID cards, though a growing number of countries, including Singapore, India, Estonia, Sweden and Spain, are also launching mobile apps and digital wallets for keeping this and other credentials for accessing medical care, educational services, and other information that may be used for interactions and information exchange between government, universities, banks and lenders, employers, and businesses.</p>
<p>Benefits include convenience—citizens don’t need to manage multiple usernames and passwords for different services or transactions. Instead, they grant permission to banks, health care providers, government agencies, and businesses to retrieve personal information to simplify account enrollment and verification. In the UK’s case, it’s estimated that digital identity can generate an additional $800 million to the UK economy every year. But there are more than a few challenges ahead.</p>
 Identity Proof Is in the Pudding 
<p>According to the 2025 Cyber Security Breaches Survey from the UK’s Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, 43% of UK businesses experienced a <a href="https://cybermagazine.com/cyber-security/inside-the-uk-governments-cyber-security-breaches-survey">cyberattack or breach</a> in the past year. That’s actually down from recent years, thanks to heightened cybersecurity—but still quite troubling. Phishing played a role in 85% of the successful breaches or attacks. The financial impact of successful breaches is significant—an average of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$4.5 million</a> per incident, before any lawsuits or regulatory fines. When personal information is breached, it can take years to rebuild public trust.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202407/uk-govt-introduces-new-digital-identity-verification-services-bill">Provisions</a> in the Digital Information and Smart Data Bill introduced in 2024 are designed to address data privacy concerns. This includes specially-certified third-party digital identity services that follow strict government guidelines for helping people set up digital identities while “reducing costs, time, and data leakage.” It also includes attribute providers that share attributes—specific elements of an individual’s full identity—with organizations or individuals needing to verify identity, but only with the individual’s consent. The official list of such services was launched on <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/uk-register-of-digital-identity-and-attribute-services-launches-in-beta">April 16</a>. For the record, it’s also worth pointing out that the government ruled out a mandatory digital identity.</p>
<p>The government has also announced the introduction of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348641/uk-government-digital-id-app-ios-android-launch">Gov.uk digital wallet</a>. This mobile app gives users the ability to store and manage their identity information, and is expected to drive significant growth in adoption of digital identity among UK residents. <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-portugal/">Portugal</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-singapore/">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-thailand/">Thailand</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-spotlight-india/">India</a>, and other nations are seeing tremendous uptake of digital identity through such apps. And Juniper Research estimates that <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/gov-uk-to-grow-while-private-sector-digital-id-app-adoption-flattens-juniper">6.9 million people</a> will adopt the app this year, climbing to 25.5 million by 2029.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to believe this is overly optimistic. Surveys have shown that more than <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/uk-digital-identity-scheme-needs-to-consider-commercial-viability-panel-says">40% of people</a> have “little to no trust” in the government managing their personal information through such systems. They trust businesses <a href="https://www.careful.industries/digital-identity-in-the-uk">even less.</a></p>
 What Kind of Digital Identity Makes All the Difference 
<p>For digital identity systems to work, individuals must control who has access to their data. These systems must also lower barriers to participation. In the UK, <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2021/05/more-three-million-uk-voters-have-no-form-photo-id">8% of the population</a> doesn’t have even traditional forms of identification. Voting, driving, working, borrowing, and even commerce can be difficult without an ID.</p>
<p>Digital identity can change that. It can also reduce bias by enabling only pertinent information to be used, so that personal data vulnerable to discrimination doesn’t come into play. These systems can also reduce fraud by cryptographically protecting and locking with specific multifactor authentication methods.</p>
<p>The UK’s digital identity initiative is a significant step in the right direction. But it might also be a sign of the post-Brexit world we live in that, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/traceyfollows/2024/07/17/will-the-new-uk-government-introduce-a-new-digital-identity-system/">Forbes points out</a>, the UK is pursuing a different strategy for digital identity than the European Union. And that may matter in a couple of significant ways.</p>
<p>Under EU law, users remain in control of the digital credentials in their wallets to ensure that they can decide what information they share and with whom, and they can use verifiable credentials to prove certain attributes without revealing their personal data at all. A standardized digital identity solution is used via wallets across all member states under the EU’s Electronic Identification, Authentication, and Trust (EIDAS) regulations. Governance oversight is maintained by public sector institutions in each member state.</p>
<p>Under the UK strategy, attribute service providers give users the ability to share just the information they want with specific organizations or individuals needing to verify identity. This includes combining, say, identity information with birthdate information to verify an individual is old enough to enter a bar or example. But approved private sector providers centrally store and govern digital identity information under the DITF guidelines. As a practical matter, the utility of digital identities is also limited because of its lack of interoperability with EU systems.</p>
<p>In other words, citizens must use digital identity managed by a private sector it trusts less than the government and won’t be able to even use it with the organizations with which millions transact and interact each day. But there are steps the UK can take to mitigate these issues.</p>
 Building an Infrastructure of Trust: What Should Come Next 
<p>Yes, moving toward EIDAS standards could significantly improve the UK’s ability to conduct business with its neighbors in the EU. But either way, following some of the steps the EU is taking in distributed ledger-based identity systems can benefit the utility and adoption of digital identity no matter the framework the UK employs.</p>
<p>Both frameworks make use of digital wallets. And both frameworks grant users a measure of control over with whom their personal information is shared. But several EU countries are ahead of the curve in moving toward far more decentralized forms of identity that give users even more control over personal data—while dramatically reducing the chances of it getting hacked.</p>
<p>With distributed ledger-based systems, users are authenticated without requiring personal data to be stored centrally on servers belonging to public or private organizations such as the UK’s attribute service providers, where it can be hacked, ransomed, or otherwise exploited to commit fraud. Instead, individual users maintain full ownership and control of their digital identities without relying on a third party at all. They control what information they share, for what purpose, and for how long.</p>
<p>Germany, Italy, Estonia, and Poland have <a href="https://identityweek.net/what-are-the-repercussions-of-eu-member-states-not-proactively-embracing-eidas2/">pilots in place</a> for this kind of system as part of<a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/"> EIDAS 2</a>, an ambitious update to the original EIDAS framework. There’s no reason the UK couldn’t embrace its own flavor of this kind of “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alastairjohnson/2024/08/07/self-sovereign-decentralized-identity-is-key-to-retail-cbdc-adoption/">self-sovereign identity.</a>”</p>
<p>Even within its current framework, digital identity wallets should also comply with <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST-</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2-</a>, and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79520.html">ISO/IEC</a> biometrics-based standards that leverage <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">liveness tests</a> capable of defeating virtually any attempt at identity spoofing or unauthorized access to accounts in a process that’s nearly effortless for users. The architecture for this kind of functional, practical digital identity is available today. In fact, it’s baked into the solution we offer at 1Kosmos. In light of distrust in government and business stemming from non-stop threats to personal data and privacy, it’s the kind of digital identity anyone would welcome.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to a new digital frontier: AI agents are no longer science fiction but a rapidly emerging force in commerce and enterprise infrastructure. Recent moves from Visa and Mastercard have opened the floodgates for intelligent agents to participate in real-world economic activities. These agents will browse the web and buy, book, negotiate, and interact on behalf of users or organizations.</p><p>Visa’s launch of “<a href="https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html">Visa Intelligent Commerce</a>” and Mastercard’s rollout of “<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2025/april/mastercard-unveils-agent-pay-pioneering-agentic-payments-technology-to-power-commerce-in-the-age-of-ai/">Agent Pay</a>” mark a pivotal moment. AI agents are being handed the keys to payment networks — tokenized credentials, real-time transaction controls, and even spend-data-based personalization are now being integrated at the heart of legacy finance systems. These centralized moves, while powerful, only scratch the surface of what’s possible.</p><p>Through Visa and Mastercard’s AI commerce initiatives, we can clearly see not only the growing importance of AI agents in real-world systems but also the critical need for robust verification measures at every step of the process. From tokenized identities to real-time transaction monitoring, today’s standards will define how trust is built in autonomous systems.</p> The Centralized Push: Making AI Agents&nbsp;Real <p>Visa is working with OpenAI, Anthropic, IBM, Microsoft, and Stripe to scale AI commerce securely. Mastercard is embedding payments into AI-powered conversational flows. Both companies are enabling AI agents&nbsp;to:</p>  Transact via tokenized, AI-ready digital&nbsp;cards  Act within customizable user permissions  Leverage spend data (with consent) for personalization  Dispute and resolve transactions in real-time  <p>This represents a significant step forward. The financial system has historically been too rigid to allow fully autonomous software agents. Now, we’re beginning to see what happens when that friction is&nbsp;reduced.</p> A Glimpse of What’s&nbsp;Possible <p>While these systems operate within a permissioned framework today, their experimentation sets a powerful precedent. If Visa and Mastercard’s approach successfully brings AI agents to the mainstream securely and intuitively, imagine what becomes possible when these same capabilities are extended into open, composable ecosystems.</p><p>Rather than framing these developments as a competition, it’s more productive to see them as complementary. Legacy finance systems are proving their feasibility; permissionless crypto can extend their potential.</p> Enter HPP: The House Party&nbsp;Protocol <p>The House Party Protocol (HPP), Aergo’s new AI-first Layer 2 blockchain, is being designed precisely for this future. Built on Aergo’s proven enterprise blockchain legacy — powering large enterprises, Korean government agencies, and beyond — HPP will introduce a smarter, more adaptable stack tailored to AI-driven applications.</p><p>While Visa and Mastercard’s implementation of AI agents represents a significant breakthrough, it is currently limited to commerce and B2C environments. HPP, on the other hand, will be purpose-built to unlock broader use cases across both B2C and B2B sectors — from logistics and finance to procurement, compliance, and supply chain coordination.</p><p>Here’s how HPP contributes to the evolution:</p><p>1. AI-Ready Infrastructure<br>HPP provides a foundational layer where trust and intelligence are embedded directly into the infrastructure. Data within the HPP ecosystem is machine-readable, independently verified, and continuously assessed for reliability, ensuring high-quality inputs for any on-chain decision-making. AI-driven logic is designed to be transparent and explainable, with built-in mechanisms for on-chain accountability.</p><p>2. AI-Oracles for Real-Time Adaptation<br>HPP will integrate native AI-oracle functionality, allowing agents to make real-time decisions based on verified off-chain data streams. This will enhance adaptive automation and enable predictive, context-aware interactions across applications.</p><p>3. Verified Computation and Data Trust<br>HPP leverages external verification frameworks like VaaSBlock, a decentralized validation network that crowdsources verification tasks and scores credibility through reputation-based staking. Combined with Booost, which provides human-authenticated signals and real-world identity attestations to combat synthetic manipulation, HPP ensures that agent decisions and data sources are transparently validated, verifiable, and resistant to tampering.</p><p>4. Enterprise-Grade Implementation and Maintenance<br>Through mature integration pathways and support for hybrid on/off-chain data models, HPP makes it easier for enterprises to build, deploy, and maintain blockchain-based AI systems. This bridges the gap between traditional enterprise infrastructure and emerging AI-native services.</p> Looking Ahead: AI Agents + Crypto Infrastructure <p>The enterprise world is just beginning to explore what AI agents can do. The potential is enormous, from procurement bots to dynamic pricing, from customer service automation to decentralized governance participation.</p><p>Legacy finance systems like Visa are making the concept real. But decentralized, AI-native environments like HPP will give these agents freedom to&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>In short, if Visa is the on-ramp for AI agents, HPP will be the autobahn.</p><p>Enterprise adoption of autonomous agents is coming. And with HPP, we’re building the rails for them to run&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/the-rise-of-ai-agents-in-enterprise-why-hpp-is-key-to-what-comes-next-588a09ff7e42">The Rise of AI Agents in Enterprise: Why HPP is Key to What Comes Next</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In this week’s AMA, Aergo Advisors Raph and Ben led a conversation covering recent progress within the Aergo ecosystem, the ongoing transition to the House Party Protocol (HPP), and emerging efforts in Layer 2 development and AI integration. Below is a summary of the key points discussed.</p> 1. What’s the point of these weekly AMA sessions? <p>These sessions are about staying transparent and accountable. Each week, we gather real questions from the community, often via Telegram or social channels, and do our best to answer them directly. Not every answer will be popular, but that’s part of building an honest dialogue. The intent is to help the community understand what’s happening behind the scenes and to get people excited about what’s&nbsp;coming.</p> 2. Can you give us a clear elevator pitch for&nbsp;HPP? <p>The House Party Protocol (HPP) is the next chapter of the Aergo public blockchain. It’s more than a token swap — it represents a strategic pivot to an AI-first Layer 2 chain. Aergo has a strong enterprise track record, and HPP builds on that by creating a smarter, more adaptive environment for AI-driven use cases. The internal team has been working on HPP for over 14 months, and it was approved through three governance votes earlier this&nbsp;year.</p><p>HPP will replace AERGO trading pairs on exchanges, and its ecosystem is designed from the ground up to support intelligent automation and Web3 applications. It’s a calculated shift that puts Aergo in a position to lead in a world increasingly shaped by&nbsp;AI.</p> 3. What is the Living Roadmap, and how does it&nbsp;work? <p>The Living Roadmap is a live document that is regularly updated by various team members, providing a transparent view into technical development, partnerships, and strategic efforts. It’s not updated on a fixed schedule, but always reflects real-time progress, making it one of the best places to track what’s happening behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> 4. When will AIP-21 voting rewards be distributed? <p>Rewards for those who participated in the AIP-21 vote will be distributed once the HPP token is live and trading pairs are switched on exchanges. The rewards are set to be vested on a monthly basis. Since the token hasn’t been launched yet, there’s nothing to distribute at the moment. The current target for this is the third&nbsp;quarter.</p> 5. What’s the current status of Aergo’s AI&nbsp;work? <p>AI is central to HPP’s purpose. From AI-powered oracles to data validation tools like W3DB, the focus is on leveraging machine intelligence to expand the possibilities of smart contracts. There are ongoing experiments and integrations across the ecosystem, including incentive models to reward users for helping train models and verify&nbsp;data.</p><p>While not every workflow is publicly documented, the overall direction is clear: HPP is being designed to natively support AI applications in areas like compliance, identity, and automated decision-making.</p> 6. Is Aergo a real&nbsp;project? <p>Yes. Aergo has been operating since 2019, with a live mainnet and real enterprise use cases. It has worked with both public and private sector partners, maintaining a stable, long-term team. The claim that Aergo is a “scam” is factually incorrect and dismissive of years of product development and delivery.</p> 7. So what’s happening with Aergo Mainnet, HPP Layer 2, and the existing&nbsp;tokens? <p>Upon the launch of HPP, all AERGO trading pairs will be replaced by HPP trading pairs. For the average user, this will appear as a rebranding on their favorite exchanges.</p><p>Aergo Layer 1 (the current mainnet) will remain operational and continue to serve enterprise clients. These deployments are typically permissioned and don’t rely on public token liquidity. The public brand, however, is being streamlined — Aergo will now refer solely to the enterprise blockchain, while HPP becomes the identity for the public AI-native chain.</p><p>This separation enhances clarity and enables each arm of the ecosystem, the enterprise and public sectors, to grow independently.</p> 8. What about the price speculation in the&nbsp;chat? <p>Price speculation is common, but building long-term value requires more than watching charts. The project focuses on delivery and creating meaningful use cases, rather than hype. While market activity is important, it is not the foundation of strategy. Moderators are also managing speculative chatter to keep community spaces constructive.</p> 9. What about Binance? Will HPP or Aergo be listed on&nbsp;spot? <p>There is currently no spot listing on Binance, and no guarantees are available. The team does not work at Binance and is not in control of listing decisions. While Binance is a desirable exchange, listing is not what it once was, as many projects have experienced volatility even after being&nbsp;listed.</p><p>Aergo is already available on multiple reputable exchanges, and the team’s focus remains on building product value and strengthening the ecosystem. If Binance or other major listings occur, it will be a bonus, not the end&nbsp;goal.</p> 10. Final thoughts on community feedback and speculation <p>The team encourages thoughtful opinions and tough questions. However, unproductive speculation about price or unfounded accusations do not contribute to progress. The moderators are working to maintain high chat quality, and the community is encouraged to focus on the fundamentals being established.</p><p>Aergo is a real project with a long track record, enterprise deployments, and a full-time team. It’s not driven by hype, but by infrastructure and&nbsp;vision.</p> 11. What’s&nbsp;next? <p>The HPP token is still on track for a Q3 release. The team is actively coordinating technical deployment, partnerships, and infrastructure in preparation for the launch. HPP is more than a rebrand — it’s the cornerstone of a smarter, more adaptive ecosystem built to support AI-native applications.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-5-recap-hpp-progress-ai-vision-and-community-transparency-bd8f56075a6b">AMA #5 Recap: HPP Progress, AI Vision, and Community Transparency</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

									 How to Choose the Right Marketing Channels for Your Business <p>Welcome to Week 2 of “Be Your Own Business” with Dr. Business. Today we’re diving into channel-brand alignment—a crucial step after you’ve defined what your business is about and who you’re selling to.</p> Why Channel Selection Matters <p>Once you’ve determined your business focus and target audience, you need to start communicating with potential customers. The right channels help you:</p>  Validate your assumptions about your product or service  Develop effective sales and marketing pathways  Build audience awareness of your offerings  Convert prospects into paying customers  <p>Remember, the whole point of being your own business is to make money while controlling your work life. When you work for yourself, you can set your own boundaries and work in ways that align with your strengths. That’s incredibly rewarding—it enables you to work how you work best.</p> Understanding the Four Channel Types <p>Before choosing your channels, it’s important to understand these four main categories:</p> 1. Owned Channels <p>These are platforms where you control the relationship with your audience:</p>  Your website or app  Email newsletters  SMS messaging  Customer databases/CRM systems   2. Earned Channels <p>This is when others talk about your business:</p>  Media coverage  Being listed on competitor pages  Reviews and testimonials  Industry recognition  <p>Some “earned” media can be strategically influenced through PR efforts. For example, during the NFT boom, my PR team pitched me as an expert to local networks in San Francisco, Oklahoma, and New Orleans.</p> 3. Social Channels <p>These platforms help you build audience and engagement:</p>  LinkedIn (especially for B2B)  Instagram (visual products and services)  TikTok (short-form video content)  Facebook (community building)  Twitter/X (thought leadership)  YouTube (educational content)  Pinterest (visual discovery)   4. Paid Channels <p>These require financial investment:</p>  Social media advertising  Google/Bing search ads  Digital billboards  Trade desk buys  Retargeting campaigns  Influencer partnerships   The Must-Have Channels for New Businesses <p>When you’re just starting out, focus on these four essential channel types:</p> 1. Email Newsletter <p>This is one of your most valuable owned channels. Why? Because:</p>  You have direct communication with interested prospects  You own this relationship and data  It’s relatively inexpensive to maintain  It demonstrates your expertise  <p>Pro Tip: Share your expertise freely in newsletters. While it might seem counterintuitive to educate people on processes they could do themselves, most don’t have the capacity, time, or desire to DIY. By teaching, you establish yourself as a thought leader. When people eventually need professional help, they’ll remember who taught them.</p> 2. Website or Landing Page <p>Every business needs a digital home base because:</p>  It establishes credibility  You own your data (when properly set up)  It provides a central hub for customer interactions  It allows you to implement analytics  <p>Even a simple one-page website from Wix or Squarespace with Google Analytics meets the minimum requirements. Just remember that these providers technically host your data, so consider exporting it regularly to truly maintain ownership.</p> 3. Strategic Social Accounts <p>Choose 2-3 social platforms strategically based on your business type and communication strengths:</p> Your Business Type:   B2B Services/SaaS: LinkedIn is crucial, potentially Reddit for niche cases  Local B2C (like restaurants): Google Business Profile, Instagram, and either Facebook or TikTok with a focus on local discovery  Consumer Products/Services: Platforms that best showcase your offerings visually   Your Personal Strengths:   Strong writer? Consider Twitter/X, LinkedIn articles, or Bluesky  Visual communicator? Instagram, Pinterest, or YouTube  Comfortable on camera? TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts  Prefer longer discussions? YouTube, podcasts, or Vimeo   4. Targeted Paid Channels <p>While most new businesses should focus on organic growth first, having a strategic paid channel approach is essential for when you’re ready to scale:</p>  Start small with experiments to test messaging  Focus on channels where you already have organic traction  Set clear attribution and conversion tracking  Establish specific ROI metrics before scaling investment   Your Business Type:   B2B Services/SaaS: LinkedIn is crucial, potentially Reddit for niche cases  Local B2C (like restaurants): Google Business Profile, Instagram, and either Facebook or TikTok with a focus on local discovery  Consumer Products/Services: Platforms that best showcase your offerings visually   Your Personal Strengths:   Strong writer? Consider Twitter/X, LinkedIn articles, or Bluesky  Visual communicator? Instagram, Pinterest, or YouTube  Comfortable on camera? TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts  Prefer longer discussions? YouTube, podcasts, or Vimeo   How to Choose Your Channels <p>Ask yourself these key questions:</p>  <p>Where do your target customers hang out?</p>  B2B decision-makers are often on LinkedIn  Local consumers use Google search and visual platforms  Different demographics prefer different platforms    <p>Where do you already have a presence?</p>  Leverage existing channels where you’re comfortable  Consider both visibility and your enjoyment of the platform    <p>What’s your natural communication style?</p>  Written: Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky  Visual: Instagram, Pinterest  Video: TikTok, YouTube  Design-focused? Consider Pinterest for inspiration and visibility    <p>Remember that your personal brand will platform your business brand, especially in the beginning. Start with your personal social accounts and gradually evolve them to represent your business.</p> Why Not to Start with Paid Channels <p>Most new businesses shouldn’t immediately invest in paid media because:</p>  It’s better to develop your audience organically first  Building your contact list is a more valuable long-term asset  You’ll get better ROI on paid media once people recognize your brand  Your messaging needs refinement before amplification   Final Thoughts <p>The key to successful channel selection is authenticity and strategic focus. Don’t spread yourself too thin across too many platforms. Instead, choose channels that:</p>  Align with your business type and goals  Match your natural communication strengths  Reach your specific target audience effectively  <p>Stay tuned for next week when we’ll dive deeper into quickly setting up a website to build your social presence and take ownership of your audience.</p><p>This article is part of the BYOB (Be Your Own Business) series.

			 Thaddee Bousselin is Implementation Engineer, he joined the company in 2022. 
 Reflecting on the 3-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company for three years, as an implementation engineer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Working at Tokeny for the past three years has been an incredible journey. The company has supported my evolution by offering diverse learning opportunities and, more importantly, by entrusting me with a variety of responsibilities. This has sharpened both my technical and strategic skills.</p>
<p>The combination of support from a super smart team and the autonomy I’ve been given has been instrumental in my professional growth.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>When I first joined, we had that typical early-stage startup energy – everyone wore multiple hats and decisions happened quickly. As we’ve grown, we’ve maintained our core values but added more structure where needed. The culture has matured rather than fundamentally changed.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “While we’ve become more process-oriented out of necessity, we’ve worked hard to keep bureaucracy minimal and preserve that innovative spirit that attracted me initially.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “While we’ve become more process-oriented out of necessity, we’ve worked hard to keep bureaucracy minimal and preserve that innovative spirit that attracted me initially.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>I’ve grown in ways I hadn’t anticipated. From a technical standpoint, I’ve significantly expanded my expertise across various areas, including tokenization and blockchain implementation. I’ve also improved my ability to manage client relationships and explain complex topics clearly to different audiences. I’ve learned to balance perfectionism with practicality and to prioritize tasks effectively in a fast-paced environment.</p>

		 
	 
                           
	 
		 
			 “I’ve gained confidence in tackling complex challenges, which are prevalent in our high-tech, high-stakes, and rapidly changing industry.”

 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you appreciated the creativity and boldness the company encourages. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team took a bold approach, and how it was received? 
<p>Last year, we helped launch an STO for a sustainability-focused investment closely aligned with my personal values. The initiative enabled investors to finance sustainable agriculture and earn returns from crop sales and carbon credits. Throughout the project, I was fortunate to work alongside my exceptional team whose genuine enthusiasm, proactive approach, and ability to navigate complex requirements made a strong impression on the client. The successful offering launch and seeing investors benefit financially while making a tangible environmental impact was particularly rewarding.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>I’d tell myself to worry less about knowing everything right away. The blockchain and tech space evolves so rapidly that continuous learning is part of the job – and nobody expects you to have all the answers. In fact, today, I proactively search for and ask “naive questions,” as they might challenge assumptions, open the door to better solutions, help clarify my own understanding or at the very least, reveal how others perceive a topic.</p>
 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>I believe we’re nearing a tipping point where tokenization shifts from being an innovative approach to becoming the default logical choice in financial markets. Over the next five years, I see Tokeny consolidating its position as a global market leader, partnering with major financial institutions and establishing our technologies and standards as industry benchmarks. Increasing regulatory clarity will accelerate adoption, and we’re ideally placed to leverage this momentum.</p>
<p>As for my role, I hope to grow with the company by taking on more strategic responsibilities while maintaining hands-on involvement in implementation. I’m particularly interested in developing our approach to solving for advanced use cases.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “The challenges will evolve as we keep scaling, and I’ll be here to help navigate those changes.” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “The challenges will evolve as we keep scaling, and I’ll be here to help navigate those changes.” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for traveling and riding your motorbikes. Do any learnings or skills from these hobbies translate into your work at Tokeny? 
<p>Definitely. Skills and experiences from all my interests enhance my work at Tokeny. Likewise, professional insights often enrich my personal pursuits. I believe in living a holistic life, where all aspects are interconnected and should not be overly compartmentalized.</p>
<p>Motorcycle riding and racing has taught me risk assessment and staying calm under pressure – skills I use daily when dealing with critical implementations. You need to make quick decisions while remaining level-headed.</p>
<p>Travel broadens your perspective, enabling you to collaborate more effectively with diverse teams and clients from around the globe. It fosters openness to different viewpoints. Plus, let’s not forget the bonus of trying great food!</p>
<p>Both motorcycling and traveling require a balance between planning and adaptability – essential qualities in blockchain, where innovative ideas must align with practical execution to consistently deliver the excellence we strive to provide our growing customer base.</p>

  Thales and the UK Digital Twin Centre: shaping a future beyond simulation  
      Language
        English

            <p>Nicole Kay is a Training and Simulation Engineering Delivery Manager with Thales in the UK, and is leading the engineering delivery for Thales’ programme at the UK Digital Twin Centre, which opens its doors on 1 May in Belfast. Here, Nicole explains why digital twins matter, how the new centre will act as a capability accelerator, and what Thales is doing to shape the future of this cutting-edge technology.</p>
 For those unfamiliar, what is a “digital twin” and how does it differ from a traditional simulation or model? 
<p>A digital twin is much more than just a virtual model – it’s a dynamic, digital replica of a physical system or process, linked through a two-way data exchange. This means the model doesn’t just mirror the physical asset – it evolves with it. At Thales, we might take data from an actual drone flight and feed that into the simulation so that the digital twin flies, not like a generic model, but like that exact drone in that exact environment. We can also go the other way – simulate conditions using real time data and use that insight to improve the physical system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This extreme level of accuracy and feedback loop is what sets digital twins apart from traditional models or simulators.</p>
 Why is digital Twin technology such an important area of focus for Thales? 
<p>It offers enormous potential across a product lifecycle – from early concept development to design, testing, operations, and through-life support. Our work with digital twins also helps our customers achieve their sustainability goals and dramatically improving efficiencies. For instance, reducing reliance on live trials by shifting a proportion of testing into virtual environments lowers carbon emissions and costs. It also enhances confidence in design decisions, streamlines development, and accelerates innovation. In short, it's transforming how we design, build, and operate complex systems.</p>
 What makes Thales’ approach so unique in this space? 
<p>A lot of digital twin work to date has focused on industrial processes – for example, twins of manufacturing lines. Thales is one of the few organisations tackling digital twins at an environmental scale. We’re modelling large, multi-domain operations – think of interactions between air, land, surface and sub-surface over an entire region – rather than just one isolated component on a production line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thales’ background in advanced training and simulation has given us the tools to replicate entire operational environments with realism, interactivity, and live data fusion.&nbsp;</p>
 Can you tell us more about the UK Digital Twin Centre and its role with industry? 
<p>The UK Digital Twin Centre is a £15 million initiative funded by Innovate UK and match-funded by industry, designed to accelerate the development and adoption of digital twin technology across the UK. Based in Belfast, the centre is being run by Digital Catapult, in partnership with Thales, Artemis Technologies, and Spirit AeroSystems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a change from traditional research and innovation centres, this centre aims remove the key barriers that businesses face in adopting digital twin technology. &nbsp;It will do so by providing access to cutting-edge technologies, lowering the cost of developing digital twins, and building digital skills across the workforce. The centre also offers a collaborative space for our growing number of partners in industry, academia, and the public sector, to foster cross-sector innovation and knowledge-sharing within the digital twin ecosystem.</p>
 What will you be showing at the launch? 
<p>As partners in the new centre, Thales, Artemis Technologies, and Spirit AeroSystems are each contributing real-world use cases to demonstrate what digital twins can do. Thales is delivering three, including our headline tool: the Air and Space Operating Environment Digital Twin (AOEDT). It’s a cloud-deployable, scenario-based simulation platform that enables mission planning and operational analysis, blending real-time data with immersive 3D environments.</p>
<p>Our AOEDT demo will showcase a counter-drone scenario set in an accurate simulated UK environment. It uses real drone flight data to replicate realistic drone behaviour and includes live data streams – from civilian air traffic to maritime and satellite tracking. It’s a fantastic example of how we can visualise and test critical infrastructure threats, or use the twin to train AI models, simulate “what if” scenarios, and analyse responses in near real-time and near real-world environments.&nbsp;</p>
 How is Thales helping smaller businesses access and benefit from this technology? 
<p>A major goal of the UK Digital Twin Centre is accessibility, but Thales is going even further in lowering the barriers for SMEs by making accessible Digital Crucible: our suite of reusable software and tools, built on a modular, scalable architecture, that supports the development of digital twins. The platform integrates Thales’ NUADA product for discovery and orchestration, alongside TrustNest, our secure, sovereign cloud platform designed to host sensitive data and applications.</p>
<p>Combined with support through the UK Digital Twin Centre, SMEs will be able to explore how digital twins could help them solve challenges, prototype solutions, or test new business models without the prohibitive upfront investment.</p>
 This is a real cross-sector effort. Why is collaboration between government, industry, and academia so important in this space? 
<p>Collaboration drives innovation. Thales brings decades of expertise across defence, security and identity markets, as well as in the disciplines of systems engineering and simulation, but we also learn a huge amount from our partners. Artemis and Spirit AeroSystems, for example, bring maritime and civil aviation perspectives. Digital Catapult and Innovate UK help to bridge our work with academia and other industries. By working together, we can better understand wider market needs and develop technology that’s more widely applicable. Government investment, meanwhile, signals long-term confidence and de-risks our own investment in the innovation journey – encouraging businesses like Thales to push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
 Looking forward, how does Thales see digital twins evolving – and what role will the centre play in that journey? 
<p>We see digital twins becoming integral to how organisations across every sector plan, operate and innovate. Whether it’s for infrastructure management, sustainable mobility, space operations, or smart cities, the technology will become increasingly essential. The UK Digital Twin Centre will accelerate that trajectory. It’ll enable us to better collaborate, experiment, and refine our offerings with direct feedback from a diverse community. Over time, we expect digital twin solutions to move from R&amp;D into scalable, fully commercial offerings.</p>
<p>The future is about building trusted, flexible, and data-rich ecosystems, and Thales is positioning itself at the heart of that transformation.<br>

<p>Microcredentials are rapidly gaining momentum as a new value to students in higher education. These short, focused learning opportunities teach students targeted skills and offer a way to stand out in the evolving workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At <a href="https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/online-degrees/microcredentials/">Oregon State University (OSU),</a> microcredentials are “a series of courses that culminate in a digital badge from an accredited university.” Here are some of the microcredentials offered by OSU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Semiconductor Production Process Planning&nbsp; 



 Business of Viral Content Creation&nbsp; 



 Medical Spanish 



 Retail Management Fundamentals&nbsp; 



 Supply Chain Logistics Management and Procurement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 What are Microcredentials in Education? 



<p>Microcredentials are skills-based learning programs that target specific areas of expertise. They take much less time than a full degree but maintain academic rigor and credibility. Designed for flexibility, they’re often available online or in hybrid formats, making them ideal for traditional students and working professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The momentum around microcredentials began building in the early 2010s. Deakin University in Australia led the charge in 2014 by issuing digital badges to recognize specific skill achievements. Shortly after, MIT launched its MITx MicroMasters program in 2015, providing learners with industry-relevant credentials through online education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over a decade later, we see microcredentials being offered at universities worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



 The Value of Microcredentials for Universities 



<p>Higher education leaders can bring a new way of learning to their institution that benefits students, schools, and future employers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering modular, skills-based learning, universities can:</p>



 
 Expand student access by serving non-traditional learners, including working adults and part-time students.&nbsp; 



 Boost enrollment by attracting new learners with flexible, low-commitment programs.&nbsp; 



 Show a commitment to students by aligning programs with real-world job skills demanded by today’s employers.&nbsp; 



 Create new revenue opportunities by monetizing short-term learning experiences and establishing employer partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>It’s a win-win for students, schools, and employers who need talent with real-world expertise.</p>



 Digital Badges and Verifiability 



<p>Unlike paper certificates, digital credentials provide a secure and verifiable way to prove skills and education. Partners, like <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/education-industry/">Anonyome Labs</a>, provide secure credentialing systems to institutions for full degrees and microcredentialing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Verifiable credential technology ensures that each credential is:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Authenticated and tamper-proof&nbsp; 



 Easily verified by employers and other institutions 



 Showcase students accomplishment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 Implementing Microcredentials at your Institution 



<p>As microcredentials gain momentum, higher education institutions have a unique opportunity to expand access, increase relevance, and better align with workforce expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some best practices for implementing microcredentials:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Explore multiple formats&nbsp; 



<p>Microcredentials don’t have to follow a single model. Institutions can offer standalone badges, modular courses, or even stackable options that build toward a certificate or degree.</p>



 Use the right technology&nbsp; 



<p>Digital credentialing platforms play a significant role in issuing, verifying, and managing credentials. Look for tools that are secure, scalable, and easy for students and employers to use.</p>



 Align content with the job market&nbsp; 



<p>Work with local employers and tap into labor market insights to design programs that teach relevant, in-demand skills.&nbsp;</p>



 Make learning accessible&nbsp; 



<p>Flexible formats, like online delivery or self-paced learning, can help reach more learners, especially working professionals or those juggling other responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>



 Offer student support&nbsp; 



<p>Just because a program is short or online doesn’t mean students don’t need help. Access to advising, tutoring, and tech support is still essential.&nbsp;</p>



 Measure impact&nbsp; 



<p>Track student progress, career outcomes, and employer feedback to assess what’s working—and continuously improve your offerings.&nbsp;</p>



 The Time is Now for Microcredentials&nbsp; 



<p>Microcredentials are reshaping the future of higher education. These short, skill-based programs create new learning opportunities that benefit students and universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

									  Is the Crypto Renaissance Here?   <p>With major AI earnings reports exceeding expectations, the TradFi world took another baby step toward stability this week. But on the other side of the spectrum, DeFi is barreling forward, in what some insiders are calling the “Crypto Renaissance”.</p>  <p>Bitcoin has surged past $90,000, institutional giants are diving headfirst into blockchain integration, and regulatory frameworks are crystallizing. In other words, Mona Lisa wen?</p>  <p>At the heart of this trend are new players and partnerships. Brandon Lutnick, son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is spearheading a $3 billion Bitcoin acquisition vehicle alongside SoftBank&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SFTBY?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$SFTBY ( ▲ 0.16% )</a>, Tether&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/USDT.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$USDT.X ( ▼ 0.0% )</a>, and Bitfinex. Meanwhile, firms like Upexi&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/UPXI?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$UPXI ( ▲ 9.69% )</a>&nbsp;are raising $100 million to accumulate Solana, mirroring Strategy’s&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MSTR?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$MSTR ( ▲ 0.39% )</a>, well, strategy.</p>  <p>Meanwhile, the SEC is no longer the industry’s antagonist. Under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the agency dropped lawsuits against Coinbase&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/COIN?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$COIN ( ▼ 0.78% )</a>, Binance&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BNB.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$BNB.X ( ▼ 0.03% )</a>, Kraken&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/KRAKEN.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$KRAKEN.X ( ▲ 0.83% )</a>, and Ripple&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/XRP.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$XRP.X ( ▲ 1.07% )</a>, rescinded the controversial SAB 121 rule (which forced firms to list crypto holdings as liabilities), and launched a Crypto Task Force to foster dialogue with stakeholders. Uyeda’s tenure marked a stark departure from the Gensler era, emphasizing collaboration over retroactive enforcement.</p>  <p>Now, with Paul S. Atkins sworn in as SEC Chairman — a figure known for his crypto-friendly stance — the industry anticipates even greater momentum. Atkins’ leadership is expected to solidify regulatory clarity, enabling institutions like ING&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ING?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$ING ( ▼ 0.41% )</a>&nbsp;and U.S. Bank&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/USB?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$USB ( ▲ 0.4% )</a>&nbsp;to advance stablecoin projects and real-time settlement platforms like Lynq Network.</p>  <p>FOMO is driving traditional finance into crypto’s arms. Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, and Tether are collaborating on a multi-billion-dollar Bitcoin treasury vehicle, while Arca Labs and tZERO are modernizing settlement systems to handle programmable, yield-bearing assets. As Dan Boyle of Boies Schiller Flexner noted: “If my competitor is tokenizing assets, am I missing out?”</p>  <p>Elsewhere, stablecoins continue to crawl toward the promise of being crypto’s “killer app”. Partnerships like CompoSecure and MoneyGram are bridging gaps by enabling cash-to-crypto conversions at thousands of global locations. Circle’s new stablecoin orchestration layer aims to make cross-border transactions “invisible,” integrating crypto into everyday finance.</p>  <p>However, despite progress, stablecoins still struggle at the checkout counter. Regulatory uncertainty, technical hurdles, and user experience gaps persist. Yet, Visa&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/V?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$V ( ▼ 0.88% )</a>, Mastercard&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MA?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$MA ( ▼ 0.26% )</a>, and JPMorgan&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/JPM?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$JPM ( ▲ 0.93% )</a>&nbsp;are betting big on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), from real estate to corporate treasuries.</p>  <p>Across the board, the crypto ecosystem is maturing into a hybrid of “casino” and “capital market”. Michael Saylor, whose firm Strategy now holds more than 550,000 BTC, captured the moment: “Bitcoin is the only asset the U.S. government won’t sell if seized. Wall Street, banks, and DC all embrace it — this is the entry point.”</p>  <p>Regulatory harmonization, institutional participation, and user-friendly innovation will determine whether crypto delivers on its promise of a faster, fairer financial system. As SEC Commissioner Uyeda reflected: “Life comes full circle.” The Wild West era is fading, replaced by a fusion of decentralized ethos and mainstream rigor. If the Crypto Renaissance isn’t here, it may well be around the corner.</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Bitcoin Party KC   <p>This past weekend was the 5th Annual Bitcoin Party KC, hosted by the KC Bitcoiners and their fearless public champion, Chris Wenske. Now I’ve only attended the latest few years of the event, because that’s the length of my tenure here in Kansas City, but this year was by far the largest and most engaged turnout I’ve seen.</p>  <p>The event features live music, delicious barbecue, an artist/vendors area with exchanges settling in Sats (aka Satoshis, the smallest unit of the bitcoin&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BTC.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$BTC.X ( ▲ 2.16% )</a>&nbsp;currency), and, of course, plenty of thought leadership and education from local luminaries.</p>  <p><a href="https://value4value.info/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">Value4Value</a>&nbsp;(V4V), a bitcoin advisory and media group, provided a presentation on setting up your own node on the Bitcoin lighting network and opening up channels to other nodes to make it easier to settle transactions. That was something of a theme for this year’s event,&nbsp;as well as the area’s latest monthly open market meetup at Keystone Collab in the city’s Crossroads East district: to participate in a Bitcoin native circular economy.</p>  <p>We were then treated to a second presentation from the event’s sponsor,&nbsp;<a href="https://mannabase.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">Manna Wallet</a>, whose sleek interface and wallet feature abstractions have made buying, selling, organizing, and accounting for Sats about as seamless as you could dream of in a self-custodied software wallet. While in slight contradiction to the V4V message of managing your own node — to truly own the value of transacting with your Sats without paying middle men for the average transaction — I believe the practical endstate for most users looks much closer to what Manna is building.</p>  <p>V4V has all the resources to support your journey running your own node. (Including incredible SEO to boot.) Nevertheless, we project true, node running self-custody is probably a generational change away from being universally pervasive. Realistically, it feels extreme to extend Bitcoin’s use case this way.</p>  <p>As long as there’s energy flowing across computer networks, Bitcoin will be the hardest money around, without a doubt. But in practical cases like gold, you’re exchanging it for the medium of exchange, not using it to transact. Gold has silver and copper —&nbsp;the metals that make a gold standard work for the average person.</p>  <p>Solana&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SOL.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=mona-lisa-wen">$SOL.X ( ▲ 2.14% )</a>&nbsp;is neither silver, nor copper. Despite remaining the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it’s not concerned with money, but rather, being the world’s fastest decentralized computer. And if I know anything about technology adoption, that’s a great north star to shoot for.</p>  <p>I do wish bitcoiners would open their perspective to the technology revolution their financial tool enacted. As important as securing financial transactions is, so is the ability to interact with digital systems. And we should have the right to secure out digital identity on Layer 1, with the best technology available.</p>  <p>But grievances about petty technology positional nuances aside, the event was another great example of the community coming together and celebrating the impact that Bitcoin is having on the heartland and world.</p>  <p>And special shout-out to RJ’s BBQ, most gracious hosts with great sauces and vibes.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>

There is a system in place to check for fraud and it’s doing its job. However, the process to have my card unflagged and pay (on a deadline) is painful and slow.</p>
<p>The problem is that it’s hard to digitally prove your identity when digital identity fraud is easy to do —&nbsp;and getting even easier with AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is banks requiring a tangle of security solutions that are inefficient in terms of resources and cost, and time consuming and annoying for customers.</p>
<p>AI and AI-agents are being touted as the next gen solution, and they offer a simple way to fix the problem —&nbsp;but they can only work as effectively and efficiently as the identification processes they are tied to.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity technology provides the simplest, most secure way to prove identity while maintaining complete control for the user. I’ll explain:</p>
 Step 1: Proving your identity&nbsp; 
<p>Every day, banks are inundated by fraudsters trying to gain access to accounts that aren’t theirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone can call in pretending to be you as long as they have the right information, which unfortunately scammers are <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/money/scams-fraud/scammers-are-stealing-billions-from-americans-bank-accounts-a9798061056/">very adept at getting.</a> In 2024, the Federal Trade Commission reported that these imposter scams cost Americans <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/03/new-ftc-data-show-big-jump-reported-losses-fraud-125-billion-2024#:~:text=Newly%20released%20Federal%20Trade%20Commission,Image">$2.95 billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>How do we change this in a way that’s simple to deploy for banks and simple for customers to use?</p>
<p>The answer is decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials for bank and financial —&nbsp;or really any kind of customer —&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p>Think of a <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credential</a> as a digital container that seals the information it contains. Attempt to tamper with the information, the seal breaks. Each container is bound to its point of origin, so you always know who issued the information inside. If you trust the issuer, you can trust the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when a bank onboards a customer, having gone through its identity assurance and compliance checks, it sends the customer a digital credential containing that information, which the customer stores securely in a digital wallet application.</p>
<p>The customer can then scan a QR code and immediately access their account. No usernames, logins, passwords, multifactor authentication or any other kind of friction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The account credential can’t be shared and it can’t be stolen. A scammer can’t phish a person’s credential information because the identity of any relying party must be cryptographically established before data can be shared. And if the customer were to lose their phone the credential can be easily revoked and reissued.</p>
 Step 2: Add biometrics 
<p>This all gets even more powerful when we incorporate authenticated biometrics into the account credential or pair the account credential with a credential that contains an authenticated biometric — such as a digital passport.</p>
<p>Once paired, a bank call center can use the biometric data presented in an account credential to compare with an online liveness check to provide an extra layer of verification — without having to store any customer biometric data to perform the verification.</p>
<p>This is a game changer for call centers afflicted with biometric identity fraud, but it also is a way to provide the strong assurance required for mobile payments — without the infrastructural and compliance challenge of storing biometric data.</p>
<p>Now that we can quickly prove who we are cryptographically and biometrically, the stage is set for agentic AI.</p>
 Step 3: Identity and access permission for AI 
<p>The next step in customer experience is smarter, more capable AI, no more being passed between departments to find the right person or the right service to help me. By pairing these strong decentralized identity systems with AI agents — meaning they can be verified by the user, and they can verify that the user is a legitimate customer or account holder — we can unlock automation and convenience for the consumer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unblocking a credit card is a good starting point that can free up time for the support team, but AI can easily perform more complex tasks, such as setting up wire transfers, applying for loans, or setting up savings programs.</p>
<p>By issuing AI agents their own Verifiable Credentials for identification, the customer can be sure they are interacting with a legitimate agent of the bank and can trust the agent with access to their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the grander vision for agentic AI is that with access to sufficient customer data, the agent will be able to “reason” its way to quickly delivering services and solving their problems. Siloed departments can now be easily integrated into a unified customer experience.</p>
<p>This works if — and only if:</p>
 
 The AI agent can be certain that the customer is a real customer 
 The customer can be certain that the AI agent is their bank’s AI agent&nbsp; 
 The customer can give clear consent to the AI agent accessing their data 
 
<p>Agentic AI in banking and finance promises to be a game changer in customer experience and business efficiency, but as we continue to innovate it is important to keep in mind that security, compliance, and privacy concerns are significant blockers. With Verifiable Credentials the benefits of agentic AI become feasible.</p>

<p>It’s almost poetic, isn’t it? Here we are, marking World Password Day 2025—an occasion originally invented to encourage better password practices—yet what we really need now is to move beyond passwords entirely. With escalating digital attacks and adversarial AI, traditional passwords have transformed from protectors of access to the weakest link in the security chain. Instead of celebrating passwords, it’s time we recognize their obsolescence and chart a course toward a passwordless future.</p>

			<p>1st May –&nbsp;Selected members of the <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 association</a>, together with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, <a href="https://layerzero.network/">LayerZero</a>, <a href="https://www.fasanara.com/">Fasanara Capital</a>, and <a href="https://www.abnamro.com/">ABN AMRO</a>, have launched a cross-chain Delivery-vs-Payment (DvP) solution for regulated tokenized assets. The solution enables atomic settlement between ERC-3643-based security tokens and cash-equivalent tokens across the <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a> and <a href="https://www.base.org/">Base</a> networks.</p>
<p>Initiated within the non-profit ERC3643 Association, the solution demonstrates how on-chain securities and cash-equivalent tokens can be securely settled across two blockchains, without requiring counterparties to bridge assets across chains. This removes a major friction point and addresses the institutional need to operate the cash and security legs on separate networks.</p>
<p>The system showcases a concrete and real-time proof of concept use case: Fasanara issued ERC-3643-based security tokens on Polygon using Tokeny’s onchain finance platform, while ABN AMRO issued cash tokens on Base. A decentralized application (dApp), developed by Labrys, orchestrates the cross-chain DvP process using LayerZero’s messaging infrastructure.</p>
<p>This use case demonstrated that the ERC-3643-based security tokens and payment tokens can be exchanged across chains with real-time settlement.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 How Cross-Chain DvP Works 
 
 Create DvP Agreement: The seller creates a DvP position specifying the tokens to lock, the tokens to receive, and the buyer’s address. 
 Lock Assets: The seller locks their specified tokens in the escrow contract on the source chain. 
 Cross-Chain Notification: LayerZero relays the DvP details to the destination chain, notifying the buyer. 
 Payment: The buyer pays the agreed amount on the destination chain to fulfill their part of the agreement. 
 Release Assets: Upon payment confirmation, the locked assets are automatically released to the buyer, completing the swap. 
 
 Solving a Critical Industry Bottleneck 
<p>As asset tokenization gains traction, institutions face a major challenge: having the cash leg onchain. Most current processes rely on traditional payment rails, resulting in long settlement cycles, high operational costs, and increased counterparty risk.</p>
<p>To meet privacy requirements, some institutions prefer using payment tokens on private blockchains. This initiative demonstrates how DvP settlements can take place across two separate chains, enabling the asset and cash legs to operate independently while settling atomically, without any counterparty risk.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>This lock-and-release mechanism ensures settlement is secure, synchronized, and risk-free.</p>

		 
	 
    Institutions want to go onchain but need flexibility, control, and compliance. This project proves they can issue securities and trade them compliantly, with instant settlement, regardless of the underlying blockchain infrastructure. We’re proud to work with LayerZero, Fasanara, and ABN AMRO to deliver this real-world application.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       This is exactly the kind of use case LayerZero was built for. Bringing financial infrastructure onto crypto rails, connecting it across chains, and enabling secure applications. This project shows how cross-chain messaging can support regulated finance by combining identity, compliance, and atomic settlement, while improving capital efficiency and settlement performance across the system.  Bryan PellegrinoCo-founder of LayerZero       As an asset manager focused on innovation, we see tokenization as the future of finance. With Tokeny’s compliance infrastructure and this cross-chain setup with LayerZero and ABN AMRO, we can issue fully regulated digital securities and enable a near‑real‑time settlement experience, even when the security leg and cash leg are on different blockchains.  David VatchevHead of Tokenization of Fasanara Capital       This project demonstrates the real-world potential of blockchain in regulated markets. Issuing cash tokens onchain and settling instantly with digital securities is a big step forward, and we’re excited to help shape this future.  Martijn SiebrandDigital Assets Program Manager at ABN AMRO    
	 
		 
			<p>This achievement marks a significant leap for institutions looking to adopt digital asset infrastructure while maintaining control, compliance, and operational efficiency. The ERC-3643 standard, combined with cross-chain technology, brings the vision of interoperable and institutional-grade onchain finance to life.</p>

We both see the future as one where everyone gains by being able to securely control their biometrics, their data, their identity. Decentralized identity is the catalyst for a new era in data, one where trust is portable and scalable to deliver new and better digital experiences.”</p>
<p>Soulverse’s flagship product, the Soul Super Wallet, is a secure, self-sovereign vault that unifies verifiable credentials, digital assets, and fiat currency, all accessible through seamless biometric authentication. Through integration with the Indicio Network, the Soul Super Wallet has a global foundation for supporting the issuance, exchange, and verification of credentials.</p>
<p>“Indicio offers more than a network—it offers the expertise and support to help us scale digital identity in a way that is future-ready,” said Kavitha Kanaparthi, CEO of Soulverse. “Becoming a Network Partner gives us the infrastructure we need to deliver on our vision of an identity that moves with you, securely and seamlessly.”</p>
<p>Indicio’s growing community of network partners are deploying real-world solutions that prioritize interoperability, user agency, and security. Soulverse’s deployment using the Indicio network shows what’s possible when decentralized identity is more than just theroy—it’s an operational reality.</p>
<p>The future of identity is already here—and it runs on Indicio.<br>

 You've been at HYPR for six years. Why is now the right time for this expanded role and for HYPR's next chapter?  
<p>Doug: Timing is everything. It's the one thing you can't manufacture in this industry. You’re either too early, too late, or you catch the market exactly when it's ready. Right now, the timing for HYPR Affirm couldn't be better.</p>  
<p>We’re seeing a massive shift across the security landscape. Identity-based attacks are skyrocketing, and emerging threats like AI-generated forgeries and deepfake-driven fraud are exposing how vulnerable traditional authentication systems have become. Nearly 40% of organizations faced a GenAI-related security incident in the past year, and 95% encountered some form of deepfake attack.</p> 
<p>At the same time, old models of probabilistic security, where you're "pretty sure" the right person is signing in, are breaking down. Organizations need definitive, real-time identity verification that's built for today's threats, not yesterday's.</p> 
<p>That’s where HYPR Affirm comes in, and why I’m so excited about where we’re headed. We're solving the right problem at the right time, and helping organizations secure their workforce with confidence.</p>  
 You've been closely involved in some of HYPR’s largest wins. What stands out to you most from those experiences?  
<p>Doug: Every major win had one thing in common: complexity.</p> 
<p>These are highly regulated industries with legacy systems, shifting compliance requirements, and a lot of risk on the line.</p> 
<p>The real standout for me is when you’re able to cut through all the noise, work alongside the customer’s teams, and actually move the needle, modernizing their identity security without disrupting their business.</p> 
<p>It’s never just about the technology. It’s about how you deliver it.</p> 
<p>At HYPR, our project management, solution architecture, and customer success teams treat every deployment like a partnership, not a handoff. Customers get white-glove support from day one through full rollout, and it shows - it's a big reason we were awarded Best Support by G2.</p> 
<p>Those are the wins that stick with you, because they’re built on trust and execution.</p>  
 How has HYPR changed the most since you first joined?  
<p>Doug: When I first joined, "passwordless" was still a foreign concept to most organizations. It was an uphill battle just explaining why eliminating passwords mattered.</p> 
<p>Now, thanks to years of education, market shifts, and the momentum behind FIDO passkeys, we’re at a historic inflection point. According to our latest report, passkeys and hardware keys are on track to become the dominant authentication method by 2027. That’s a massive change.</p> 
<p>HYPR has evolved right alongside that shift. We're not just helping organizations remove passwords anymore. We’re helping them achieve full identity assurance, even against the most advanced AI-driven threats.</p>  
 Most memorable moment in your career (so far)?  
<p>Doug: It’s the moments you realize, after months or years of work, that you helped a customer make a change they didn’t think was possible.</p> 
<p>This is a tough industry. Wins are rarely clean. But when you earn trust through persistence and honesty, those are the ones you remember.</p>  
 Biggest challenge you've faced with a customer, and how you overcame it?  
<p>Doug: The biggest challenge is driving real change across an entire organization.</p> 
<p>When you're talking about identity security, you're not just swapping out technology, you're asking people to rethink how they trust, access, and interact with critical systems every day.</p> 
<p>That’s a big shift, and it doesn’t happen overnight.</p> 
<p>The key is meeting customers where they are, keeping it practical, and helping them build momentum until the change sticks. It’s why having the right team behind you makes such a difference. You’re not just delivering a product. You’re helping guide a transformation.</p>  
 What are you most excited for moving forward?  
<p>Doug: Affirm is a game-changer for the industry. It’s built for this exact moment, when organizations are recognizing that identity assurance is their frontline defense.</p> 
<p>I'm excited to help more customers realize they don't have to settle for legacy technology and practices anymore. It’s time for something better, and we’re ready to deliver it.</p>  
 Bonus question! If you could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, who would it be?  
<p>Doug: I think it’d have to be someone like Tom Hanks.</p> 
<p>Down to earth, a million stories, and you know it wouldn’t be a boring lunch.</p>  
<p>Congratulations, Doug! We’re excited to have your leadership guiding HYPR into this next chapter.</p> 
<p>Ready to experience a new standard in identity assurance?</p>

 How Liveness Face Detection Prevents Fraud in Biometric&nbsp; 
<p>In this world, where fraud has become a common game played by criminals, biometric authentication has become the cornerstone of our lives. Whether you go to a bank, an educational institute, or any other financial institution, it is used to secure an individual’s information and assets.</p>
<p>However, many users still think that fingerprint or other traditional methods are enough for securing the systems. It is too funny……..</p>
<p>If we look at this security system comprehensively, we will witness innovations that will astonish us. If you don’t trust us, we can provide you with an example of Liveness Face Detection.</p>
<p>Here, you will wonder, what is this? We never heard about it. Right? Don’t worry, we have brought this comprehensive blog post for you, in which we have discussed it from A to Z.</p>
<p>In this guide, you will get an opportunity to learn how liveness face detection prevents fraud in biometrics.</p>
<p>Are you interested in reviewing this? If yes, buckle up and stay connected with us till the end.</p>
 What Is Liveness Face Detection: A Brief Overview 
<p>When we introduce this term in front of users, they gain a hint about it after hearing the name. Human Intelligence after Artificial Intelligence…..</p>
<p>Basically, this liveness detection for face recognition is all about an innovative technology that is concerned with the prevention of fraud. It prevents the spoofing of fake images and documents used by criminals. By and large, this technology is gaining huge popularity all over the world day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Liveness Face Detection Enhances Biometric Security? 
<p>This is an interesting question often asked by many users: How does the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> prevent fraud? Are you also here with the same question? If yes, we are here with you with a detailed answer.</p>
 1. Active And Passive Liveness Detection 
<p>Facial liveness detection has been categorized into two branches: active and passive liveness <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">face liveness detection SDK</a>. These two types work together to enhance the biometric system. We can explain them one after one in detail.</p>
 
 
 Active Facial Liveness Detection 
 
 
<p>In this type of face recognition SDK, users who come to financial or other institutions are said to perform some specific functions. Try to understand, criminals mainly come with fake images and videos, and behave as real account holders. They are ordered to smile, blink their eyes, and move their heads. Now, you will say, such movements can never be achieved by such images, and criminals will be caught. We are also trying to make you understand the same thing.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 Passive Facial Liveness Detection 
 
 
<p>In this type of face recognition detection, users are checked by their skin color, texture analysis, and blood flow. Even this detection can also be done by recording the criminal’s heartbeat. It’s a little bit funny. Here, can you ever expect such facial texture from the images or even from live videos? We don’t think so……</p>
<p>Here, we will say one special line to tribute this system: “Not only can a fake human not pass, but even a fake sparrow can’t take the exam.”</p>
<p></p>
 2. Real-Time Detection 
<p>On one side, with such strict checking, the other side has real-time checking. Amazing……..</p>
<p>Sometimes, cyber criminals can try to manipulate the systems with pre-recorded and newly captured images. Such videos and images can easily destroy the whole system. However,&nbsp; once again, liveness detection for face recognition shows its unbelievable role.</p>
<p>The real-time detection can easily distinguish between real and fake persons. This is because criminals attempt to commit fraud at any time of the day. However, this facial liveness detection ensures that the person is physically present and has no fake documents. Such crimes are monitored 24/7 in each institute.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 3. AI-Supported Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention 
<p>AI-supported multi-layered fraud prevention enhances the security of the biometric system by combining multiple other technologies. AI’s and ML’s sophisticated algorithms are trained to monitor the actions taken by criminals in both online and remote environments.</p>
<p>As discussed previously, the real-time detection is as important as oxygen and water for human beings. AI makes the facial liveness detection stronger and stronger to detect what’s happening in multiple institutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, ML with its algorithms is also integrated with a detection system to perform the passive liveness detection. In short, we can say, there is no chance of committing fraud even by an expert criminal.</p>
<p></p>
 Where to Find Facial Liveness Detection Services? 
<p>After reviewing such a post guide, this innovation will surely brainstorm your mind, where to find its services. There are multiple websites and online platforms that provide users with the same services. However, we have brought an innovative solution for you that is superior to others. Our solution will be here with all those characteristics that have been discussed in the previous section. The solution is called Recognito.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/">RECOGNITO</a> is a top provider in identity checking, focusing on advanced face recognition technology, liveness detection to verify real-time identity, and ID document checking to confirm authenticity. The company’s solutions are well-known for their accuracy and dependability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Their technology is acknowledged by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT </a>as one of the best in face recognition. By using the latest methods, they help guarantee that identities are verified safely and effectively, providing a high level of trust and safety for users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Wrapping Up 
<p>Security, security, and only security across financial and educational institutions. It is considered the top priority. However, it is a digital period, where criminals have multiple manipulative techniques to destroy the systems. However, as we all know, each virus has an antivirus.</p>
<p>Such an antivirus we have discussed in this blog guide is facial liveness detection. It is a technology innovation that prevents the fraud often committed by criminals using fake images and videos.</p>
<p>After hearing about it, many users ask for a possible solution to achieve such services. To solve their issue, we have gifted them Recognito. This platform is the top in providing face liveness detection recognition. If you also want prevention against such spoofing fraud, never forget to gain help with this innovative source.</p>

<p>The TACTIS centre is uniquely capable of interconnecting up to 76 simulators simultaneously, allowing for mission rehearsals with up to 200 crew members. This synergy is further enhanced by the integration of up to 2,500 virtual entities known as “Computer-Generated Forces”, enabling force members to conduct exercises in a combined arms environment.</p>
<p>The contract will fully modernise the TACTIS centre for the Royal Netherlands Army. This modernisation will include the simulation of more than 20 new types of vehicles, including the new generation of combat vehicle, the CV90 MkIV. Thales will cooperate with BAE Hägglunds, the vehicle manufacturer, to deliver high-fidelity simulations. The modernized training centre will also offer the ability to integrate future weapon systems that will be deployed within the Royal Netherlands Army, such as the LEO2A8 main battle tank. </p>
<p>The virtual environment will also reflect the new threats emerging on the battlefield including urban warfare. The level of immersion will be enhanced through the use of Unreal Engine 5, the world’s most open and advanced real-time 3D tool, allowing for the creation of ultra-realistic, high-quality training environments. This cutting-edge technology not only ensures effective learning but also simulates realistic combat conditions, enabling forces to prepare more effectively for contemporary challenges. Thanks to TACTIS, team training is optimised to effectively meet the demands of new operational theatres. </p>
<blockquote><p>“The Netherlands Ministry of Defence has always been a step ahead when it comes to training their forces using simulation. We are honoured that they have renewed their trust in Thales through the modernization of their armoured fighting vehicle training centre 'TACTIS'. It remains a world-class reference recognised by NATO member countries in Europe. This mid-life upgrade will incorporate Thales's latest generation of simulation capabilities, offering unmatched immersion and realism to ensure force readiness for increasingly complex missions. This new contract is a testament to the strong and enduring partnership between the Netherlands Ministry of Defence and Thales, reinforcing our continued commitment to safeguarding the security and sovereignty of European nations” said Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice-President, Avionics, Thales.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meet Jamie—a compliance officer at a U.S. financial services firm regulated by FinCEN, FINRA, and the SEC. Jamie knows the stakes: missing adverse media about a potential client could lead to fines, reputational damage, or worse. But performing these checks manually often feels like searching for a needle in a haystack. Here’s how Jamie’s experience shifts when using iComply’s AML solution.</p>



<p></p>



 Manual Adverse Media Screening: A Complex Process 



<p>To comply with regulatory expectations, Jamie manually searches online articles, government reports, and social media for red flags like fraud, money laundering, or corruption. Each platform requires tweaking keywords and combing through endless irrelevant hits.</p>



 
 Overwhelming Data: Vast amounts of news, blogs, and public records make it easy to miss critical insights. 



 Time-Consuming Tasks: Cross-referencing names with sanctions lists, PEP databases, and legal filings means hours—sometimes days—of effort. 



 Risk of Outdated Info: By the time Jamie compiles findings, new updates might surface, requiring a re-check. 
 



<p>Even after all that, Jamie still has to organize the findings into an audit-ready report for internal review and potential regulatory inspections.</p>



<p></p>



 Adverse Media Screening with iComply: A Seamless Workflow 



<p>With iComply’s AML platform, Jamie’s adverse media screening becomes faster and more reliable:</p>



 
 Real-Time Data Collection: iComply automatically pulls global news, blogs, and regulatory announcements in seconds—including U.S. and international media sources. 



 AI-Driven Precision: Advanced machine learning filters out irrelevant results, significantly reducing false positives while prioritizing high-risk alerts. 



 Automated Cross-Checks: The system compares findings against global watchlists, sanctions databases, and adverse media archives automatically—no manual entry needed. 



 Instant Reports: With one click, Jamie generates a comprehensive, audit-ready report with risk scores, dates, and classifications. 
 



<p>This streamlined process helps Jamie stay compliant with FinCEN’s AML rules, FINRA’s due diligence standards, and the SEC’s anti-fraud requirements—all without the manual guesswork.</p>



<p></p>



 The iComply Advantage 



<p>For Jamie, manually compiling adverse media reports used to take hours and left room for human error. With iComply, it takes minutes. The result? Faster compliance checks, reduced risks, and more time for strategic oversight.</p>



<p>Is your compliance team ready to simplify adverse media screening? iComply’s AML solution empowers financial institutions to meet FinCEN, FINRA, and SEC standards while making compliance faster, smarter, and more secure. Let’s make it happen.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>For a long time, logging into a website was (perhaps still is) a bit of a mess. There’s definitely been many efforts to fix it, and though OAuth buttons and SSO integrations tried to clean things up, under the hood, “Sign in with…” is mostly a best-effort dance. You can authenticate a user, maybe even grab some claims about them, and with luck, stitch together a tolerable user experience.</p>



<p>How depressing that our best efforts result in “tolerable.”</p>



<p>Now contrast that with what happens when you click “Buy now.” That’s not best-effort. That’s a minefield of regulatory compliance, industry standards, liability frameworks, and expectations that money, actual money, will safely and instantly change hands. There’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard">PCI-DSS</a>. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure">3-D Secure</a> requirements. There’s the awkward but necessary dance of tokenization, fraud detection, and chargeback management.</p>



<p>When it comes to payments, the web grew up and started paying a mortgage a long time ago. When it comes to identity, we’re still pondering what it means to adult.</p>



<p>Times, however, they are a-changin’. The walls between the identity folks and the payments folks are getting thinner. In some cases, those walls are coming down entirely. And it’s not just because of technological convergence, though that’s part of it. It’s because users are demanding better experiences, regulators are demanding more assurance, and vendors are realizing there’s more money to be made (and saved) when you stop pretending these are two separate problems.</p>



 The silos are collapsing 



<p>Historically, the digital identity people worked over here and the payments people worked over there, each with their own browser APIs, working groups, and acronyms. It was a live-and-let-live scenario, with the occasional “You should talk to Bob in the Payments WG about that…” tossed across the W3C aisle.</p>



<p>That’s changing. Why?</p>



<p>I’m going to blame digital wallets.</p>



<p>Today’s digital wallets don’t just store payment cards; they also store verifiable credentials. Credentials like your driver’s license, your airplane tickets, and whatever will serve as an “I swear I’m over 18” age claim. All of these are coming together in a single UX surface, often right in the browser.</p>



<p>That means the web needs a new kind of interface. One where your browser can show you the secure thing you’re allowed to use at the right time, whether that’s a credit card, a credential, or some clever combination of the two.</p>



 Where the work is happening 



<p>At the W3C, two groups are particularly active in this convergence: the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid">Federated Identity Working Group (FedID WG)</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/payments">Web Payments Working Group (WPWG)</a>. They’ve mostly stayed in their own lanes, but I think that’s going to change. Lines of communication are definitely about to get stronger.</p>



<p>Interested in learning more about how standards development works and how your organization might take advantage of early knowledge? I have a service for that: <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">Inform the Standards in Digital Identity</a>.</p>



 Federated Identity Working Group 



<p>On the FedID side, two APIs are reshaping browser-based identity:</p>



 
 FedCM (Federated Credential Management): Designed to reimagine the “Sign in with…” experience for a world without third-party cookies. It gives users a native browser dialog for account selection, keeping identity flows first-party and privacy-friendly. It’s going to (hopefully) make life a lot better for anyone who uses the web for social connection or as a consumer. 



 Digital Credentials API (DC API): This is the plumbing that lets browsers relay secure information between a site, the OS, and whatever wallet is installed. Think of it as the missing piece that both enables and protects the exchange of your personal information with whatever site is asking for it. 
 



 Web Payments Working Group 



<p>Over in WPWG territory, you’ll find APIs like:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/secure-payment-confirmation/">Secure Payment Confirmation</a>: A way to prompt users for strong authentication using platform authenticators (read: WebAuthn) as part of a payment flow. 



 <a href="https://www.emvco.com/emv-technologies/secure-remote-commerce/">Secure Remote Commerce</a> (SRC): The “Click to Pay” system championed by major card networks. It’s not quite a wallet, but it is a federation-like model: the user chooses a card stored elsewhere and completes the transaction with fewer redirects and less friction. 
 



<p>Now here’s the fun bit, at least from my perspective: these lines between all these APIs are starting to blur. Could FedCM be used to show a list of saved payment cards, each tied to a user identity, during checkout? Could DC API help determine whether a credentialed identity has an associated payment method?</p>



<p>Some of the payment players were skeptical at first (standardization! browsers in the mix! scary!). But they’re warming up, especially as they realize a smoother, privacy-preserving, first-party login experience could give them something they’ve been missing: recognition of returning users without third-party cookies.</p>



 Shared problems, shared future 



<p>What’s driving this convergence? Three shared goals:</p>



 
 Returning user recognition: If you’ve ever run a checkout funnel, you know: drop-off is death. Being able to recognize a returning user, without tracking cookies or forcing a login, is gold. 



 Fraud mitigation: Whether you’re managing identity theft or card-not-present attacks, you need risk signals, device binding, and good authentication. That’s why FIDO device-bound credentials and biometric authenticators are popping up on both sides of the aisle. 



 Strong authentication: Regulators (looking at you, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/memo_17_4961">PSD2</a>) and developers alike are embracing strong, phishing-resistant authentication. FIDO2 and WebAuthn aren’t just for logins anymore; they’re showing up in payment confirmations and credential exchanges. 
 



<p>But payments are also dragging identity into some new territory. Think of age-gated purchases or proof-of-residency for tax calculations. These aren’t traditional payment concerns, but they’re becoming essential parts of modern transactions. And that means they’re becoming browser problems.</p>



 So who’s in charge? 



<p>Well, no one. Or maybe it’s lots of someones. It’s hard to tell, and that’s both good news and bad news.</p>



<p>The newly launched <a href="https://fidoalliance.org">FIDO Alliance Payments Working Group</a> isn’t trying to create a new standard. Instead, it’s focused on identifying what’s missing, what payments need from the rest of the stack, and finding the right home for those requirements. That could mean new work in the W3C’s Web Payments WG, or tighter coordination with the FedID WG. Or maybe something new entirely.</p>



<p>It’s definitely the definition of “interesting times.” It’s a time when the people who design your login experience and the people who design your checkout flow have to start talking. Not just because it’s polite, but because they’re building for the same end user, solving the same problems, and being constrained by the same browser platforms.</p>



 What to watch 



<p>If you’re building anything that touches identity or payments on the web, now’s a good time to pay attention to:</p>



 
 The FedCM API, which is rolling out in Chrome and being discussed across browser vendors. 



 The DC API, which is gaining traction in wallet-based workflows. 



 The future of Secure Payment Confirmation, which might just become the go-to method for confirming both logins and purchases. 



 And the user experience expectations that come with digital wallets. Because the bar is no longer “functional.” It’s “frictionless.” 
 



 Final thought 



<p>We’re moving from a world where identity and payments were treated as separate UX problems to one where they’re deeply entwined. That’s going to be messy, yes, but also incredibly powerful.</p>



<p>Because when your browser can recognize you, verify you, and let you pay, all without handing your life story to a dozen trackers or to the browser maintainer, that’s not just good UX. That’s what the web experience should have been all along.</p>



<p>I’m so glad to be a part of getting that much closer to something better than just tolerable.</p>

 In a world where identity fraud represents a critical vulnerability for citizens and societies, Thales is leading the transformation of civil identity into a secure and citizen-first service. 
 Through its advanced Civil Identity Suite, Thales enables governments worldwide to protect their citizens, ensuring protection at every stage of the identity journey and for the entire identity chain. 
 Supporting more than 300 national identity programmes and having enrolled over 500 million people, Thales is uniquely positioned to deliver secure and responsible identity solutions. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Each year, Thales powers one in three smart civil IDs (official electronic documents) issued worldwide, highlighting the company’s key role in shaping the future of identities and helping governments and citizens transition smoothly to digital. With its <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/civil-id-suite">Civil Identity Suite</a>, Thales enables the issuance and management of both physical and digital identities, as well as all means of enrolling citizens and enabling seamless ID verification for access to services, both in-person and online.</p>
<p>Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies and #1 global leader in ID documents, has recently earned the new title of #1 provider of Digital ID solutions as recognized by Juniper Research (2024). With unmatched experience and scale, Thales empowers governments to modernise their identity systems, ensuring they meet the demands of 21st-century citizens with trust and reliability. </p>
<p>Holistic security for the entire identity chain</p>
<p>At a time when identity theft is a real threat, providing a trusted and easy-to-use identity solution is more critical than ever. In response, Thales’s Civil Identity Suite integrates advanced cybersecurity across the entire identity lifecycle. Real-time threat detection, vulnerability management, and automated incident response protect sensitive citizen data from cyberattacks. AI-powered biometric authentication, with embedded liveness detection, strengthens fraud resistance by ensuring that only genuine individuals can access services. Both physical and digital credentials are secured with tamper-proof technologies, guaranteeing trust at every step of the identity journey.</p>
<p>Simplifying identity access for citizens everywhere</p>
<p>Identity should be seamless, inclusive, and accessible. Thales Civil Identity Suite offers citizens a convenient experience, enabling them to enrol biometrically in seconds and use their identity easily both online and in person. Citizens can store and access their identity documents digitally, ensuring secure interactions with both government and private sector services. Indeed, Thales also enables banks and mobile operators to remotely enrol customers through a secure, government-grade ID verification process. To enable such a seamless way for people to prove who they are - even from their smartphone - the Civil Identity Suite is built on a fully interoperable, modular architecture. It allows governments to scale and integrate new capabilities seamlessly, while enabling private sector entities to expand their digital services leveraging a trusted, verified ID.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In today’s digital world, identity is more than just a credential—it’s the key to secure seamless access to essential services. At Thales, we are committed to providing trusted identity solutions that empower citizens with security, convenience, and control over their personal data. By combining physical and digital identity with cutting-edge security, we help governments build robust and sustainable identity ecosystems that enhance public trust, streamline services, and drive digital inclusion", said Nathalie Gosset, VP Identity &amp; Biometric Solutions at Thales. </p></blockquote>

<p>With enterprise browsers serving as the new gateways to critical business applications and data, organizations must incorporate high levels of identity assurance to mitigate the rising risk of cyberattacks and data breaches.<br><br>HYPR, the leader in passwordless and identity verification solutions, has joined forces with Microsoft Edge for Business, the secure enterprise browser renowned for its security and productivity features. This integration provides unparalleled visibility, detects modern threats, and enforces real-time security policies at the moment of access.</p> 
By correlating signals across browsers, workstations, and mobile devices, HYPR Adapt helps organizations spot anomalies, block unauthorized access, and reduce risk – before threats escalate. The result? A stronger security posture, better compliance, and a safer workplace. 
 The Urgent Demand for Enhanced Enterprise Browser Security  
<p>The modern workforce operates across various devices and locations, making the enterprise browser a critical control point for security. In today’s world, traditional security measures often fall short. AI-driven attacks, phishing campaigns, and social engineering tactics pose significant risks to sensitive data and systems. Organizations need a security strategy that not only protects against known threats but also adapts to new and emerging risks. This is where the HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business integration makes a significant difference.</p> 
 Key Benefits of HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business Integration  
<p>This integration offers a range of powerful benefits designed to boost enterprise security and streamline user experience:</p> 
  
  Unmatched Visibility: Gain comprehensive insights into user behavior and potential threats from signals from browsers and devices. HYPR’s integration delivers in-depth visibility into user activities, suspicious patterns, and potential security breaches. This visibility is vital for proactive security management and incident response.  
  Proactive Threat Detection: Recognize and mitigate potential threats more effectively with advanced analysis of signals from all endpoints. HYPR's intelligent risk policy engine detects anomalies and security risks in real-time, enabling you to take swift action and stop breaches before they happen.  
  Real-Time Security Enforcement: Enforce security policies instantly based on your customizable rules. HYPR Adapt enables immediate and automated response actions when potential threats are detected, significantly reducing the window of vulnerability and preventing security incidents. Such actions include requiring step-up authentication, identity re-verification, or denial of access.  
  Unified Security Posture: Establish a consistent security posture across all devices, minimizing vulnerabilities and strengthening your overall defense. HYPR Adapt ensures that security policies are applied uniformly, regardless of the device or platform, providing full environment protection.  
  
 How the Integration Works: Deep Dive into HYPR Adapt and Microsoft Edge for Business  
<p>HYPR Adapt, the policy risk engine at the core of HYPR's platform, integrates seamlessly with Microsoft Edge for Business to provide enhanced security and data protection. This integration leverages a sophisticated process to analyze user behavior and enforce security policies.</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
 Integration Workflow: Step-by-Step  
  
   <p>IdP Workflow: The user initiates the login process with their Identity Provider (IdP) and is redirected to HYPR for authentication.</p>   
   <p>Edge for Business Interaction: The user's enterprise browser detects a policy-configured URL and communicates its Device Trust capabilities.</p>   
   <p>HYPR Adapt Analysis: HYPR recognizes the browser's Device Trust intent and initiates a challenge-response exchange with the Microsoft Device Trust API and the user's browser.</p>   
   <p>Microsoft Device Trust API: The service responds by providing device trust signals from the user's browser and device.</p>   
   <p>Policy Decision and Enforcement: HYPR Adapt analyzes the Device Trust signals and makes an informed policy decision. This decision can result in several actions:</p> 
    
     <p>Allowing seamless desktop single sign-on (SSO) for a frictionless user experience.</p>   
     <p>Enforcing phishing-resistant authentication to prevent credential theft.</p>   
     <p>Requiring re-verification of user identity through HYPR Affirm for enhanced security in high-risk scenarios.</p>   
     <p>Denying access to prevent unauthorized entry.</p>   
      
   <p>Access Granted: If the policy allows and the user successfully completes the required authentication steps, they are granted secure access to their enterprise applications.</p>   
  
<p>The HYPR + Microsoft Edge for Business integration represents a significant advancement in enterprise browser security. By combining HYPR Adapt's advanced signal collection and analysis with Microsoft Edge for Business's robust platform, organizations can achieve deep insights into user behavior, proactively detect threats, and enforce real-time security policies.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>28th April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading onchain operating system for compliant asset tokenization, has announced a strategic partnership with the <a href="https://www.hbarfoundation.org/">HBAR Foundation</a> to bring compliant Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization to the <a href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera</a> network. This collaboration marks a major milestone in advancing institutional adoption of blockchain technology for regulated financial products. They’re already collaborating through the non-profit <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC-3643 Association</a> working group to drive progress in RWA tokenization.</p>
<p>As institutions look to tokenize assets, from funds and equities to real estate and debt instruments, the demand for enterprise-grade solutions is accelerating. Tokeny provides proven solutions built around the ERC-3643 standard, offering financial institutions the ability to issue, manage, and distribute tokenized assets in a fully compliant and interoperable way.</p>
<p>By partnering with the HBAR Foundation, Tokeny expands to the Hedera network, an enterprise-grade, carbon-negative ledger governed by the <a href="https://hedera.com/council">world’s largest organizations</a>. Hedera offers 2.9-second finality, $0.0001 fixed fee transaction costs, and over 70 billion transactions processed. Its hashgraph consensus is the most energy-efficient globally, <a href="https://hedera.com/ucl-blockchain-energy">as proven</a> by University College London (UCL), using 0.000003 kWh per transaction, hundreds to thousands of times less than other networks, making it a natural fit for institutions bringing regulated assets onchain at scale.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokeny’s technology was designed from the start to meet the needs of institutions. Building on Hedera unlocks a powerful combination with enterprise-grade tokenization infrastructure on a network built for speed, security, and sustainability.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>The HBAR Foundation, which supports innovation and growth on the Hedera network, plays a key role in scaling tokenized finance use cases. By working together, Tokeny and the HBAR Foundation aim to accelerate the adoption of tokenized financial products and bring new levels of efficiency, transparency, and compliance to capital markets.</p>

		 
	 
    We are thrilled to partner with Tokeny, whose solutions have already powered billions of dollars in tokenized assets. This collaboration reinforces Hedera’s position as a leader for compliant digital finance and opens the door for institutions to confidently launch tokenization strategies onchain.  Sabrina TachdjianDirector of Fintech &amp; Payments at The HBAR Foundation    
	 
		 
			<p>With this partnership, institutions can now bring assets onto Hedera in just a few weeks using Tokeny’s white-label tokenization platform, or seamlessly integrate onchain finance APIs into their existing systems without the need for costly and time-consuming development. This partnership is driving the acceleration of institutional adoption of tokenization.</p>

 Open House — Conversation with Aergo’s CTO Shaping the&nbsp;Future <blockquote>In this article, we would like to share what we’ve been working on, where we’re headed, and how each step ties into our broader vision. From new developments in Layer 2 technology to ecosystem expansions and strategic partnerships, our focus remains clear: building real value, step by step. Whether you’re new to our journey or have been with us from the start, this update is for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><p>This time, we sat down with <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/introducing-our-cto-head-of-ai-labs-168a51546448">Matt Seo, CTO of Aergo</a>, to discuss the future direction of Aergo and the upcoming launch of the House Party Protocol (HPP). In this conversation, Matt outlines the vision for Layer 2 and explains how Aergo Mainnet (L1) and the new HPP ETH Layer 2 (L2) will operate in parallel, ensuring a seamless transition for enterprise partners while creating new opportunities across the broader blockchain ecosystem.</p> Q1: What broader possibilities does the L2 expansion unlock for&nbsp;Aergo? <p>Matt Seo: One of the most exciting possibilities unlocked through this L2 expansion is the integration of intelligent data flow via AI oracles. As it stands, traditional oracles function purely as passive data relays. They deliver external information onto the blockchain without interpreting its meaning or assessing its relevance. As a result, smart contracts today are often limited to simple, static, trigger-based logic.</p> Q2: How do AI oracles change the future of smart contracts? <p>Matt Seo: AI oracles fundamentally shift the way smart contracts interact with external information. By preprocessing, parsing, and contextualizing external data before it is written on-chain, we enable smart contracts to respond dynamically to real-world conditions. This unlocks a new class of context-aware and purpose-specific smart contracts that don’t just execute predefined rules but adapt intelligently based on nuanced, real-time inputs.</p><p>It’s a necessary step if we want blockchain systems to engage meaningfully with complex external environments. Layer 2 is not just about scalability — it’s about expanding the intelligence and applicability of blockchain technology itself.</p> Q3: Will Aergo Mainnet continue to operate after the launch of HPP&nbsp;L2? <p>Matt Seo: Yes, absolutely. Aergo Mainnet will remain fully operational even after the introduction of the HPP token and the Layer 2 expansion. It will continue to support existing Aergo Enterprise (private/on-premise) clients without any disruption. The AERGO token will still function as a payment token on Aergo Mainnet. However, moving forward, most new public use cases and general user activity will transition away from Aergo Mainnet. Once HPP is listed on exchanges, the AERGO token may no longer be tradable for general users on those platforms.</p> Q4: What role will HPP ETH L2 play in the ecosystem? <p>Matt Seo: HPP ETH L2 will serve as the primary network for both new and current users, including enterprises seeking AI-native blockchain features and broader Web3 participants. The HPP token will serve as the primary currency for transactions, data operations, and governance within this ecosystem. It will also become the primary tradable asset listed on supporting exchanges going&nbsp;forward.</p> Q5: How will users move between Aergo Mainnet and HPP ETH&nbsp;L2? <p>Matt Seo: To ensure flexibility and user continuity, we are introducing a bridge between Aergo Mainnet and HPP ETH L2. This bridge will enable seamless migration of both data and tokens between the two networks. Our goal is to provide maximum flexibility, especially for enterprises that require a robust and adaptable infrastructure.</p> Q6: What is the process for AERGO token holders to migrate to&nbsp;HPP? <p>Matt Seo: First, holders of AERGO tokens, whether native tokens or ERC-20 versions, will be able to convert them to HPP tokens through the official bridge. Second, for tokens held on exchanges, the conversion will happen automatically once the exchange finalizes its integration and supports the&nbsp;swap.</p><p>Importantly, the conversion process will only begin after the successful launch of key technical milestones, ensuring that all stakeholders, including exchanges, enterprise partners, and the broader community, are fully aligned and&nbsp;ready.</p> Q7: How is this transition being managed to maintain user confidence? <p>Matt Seo: We are taking a very careful and methodical approach. Every step — from bridge deployment to token swap coordination — is being developed with security, usability, and operational continuity as top priorities. To ensure transparency, we have released a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w71t9vvrE-M65THn4ZM0W2fmtsBEsnibi3bESgrr0CQ/edit?gid=1840204549#gid=1840204549">Living Calendar</a> that outlines key milestones, and we have published the <a href="https://www.hpp.io/static/media/HousePartyProtocol_Whitepaper.1a5894913eea21bb0a72.pdf">HPP whitepaper</a> to provide a comprehensive view of the transition. We will continue to share further technical details, clear timelines, and instructions as we progress.</p><blockquote>“From static contracts to adaptive intelligence, L2 and AI oracles are shaping the future of blockchain.”<br> — Matt Seo, CTO of&nbsp;Aergo</blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/open-house-conversation-with-aergos-cto-shaping-the-future-cdecf5e3d7be">Open House — Conversation with Aergo’s CTO Shaping the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 What is Bitcoin Mining? 



<p>Bitcoin mining is the process through which new bitcoins are created and transactions are verified. Unlike gold mining, Bitcoin mining involves using specialized hardware to solve complex mathematical algorithms. These algorithms help verify transactions and add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. In return, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin. Understanding this process is key to starting your own mining journey.</p>

 4 Most Effective Methods to Mine Bitcoin in 2025 



<p>While there are several ways to mine Bitcoin, not all of them are equally efficient or profitable. Below, we highlight the four most effective methods for 2025:</p>



 Mining Bitcoin with ASIC Hardware 



<p>ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners are specifically designed to mine Bitcoin. They offer the highest processing power and energy efficiency, making them the best option for maximizing profits. However, the initial investment is quite high, which may be a barrier for some. Popular ASIC miners like the Antminer S19 Pro can deliver outstanding performance.</p>


 
 


 Mining Bitcoin with GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) 



<p>Using GPU mining is a more affordable alternative to ASIC mining. While it offers lower processing power, GPUs are versatile and can also be used for mining other cryptocurrencies. This option is ideal for beginners or those with limited budgets, though it is becoming less profitable as Bitcoin’s mining difficulty increases.</p>



 Mining Bitcoin via Cloud Mining 



<p>Cloud mining allows users to mine Bitcoin without investing in physical hardware. Instead, you lease mining power from a third-party provider. This method eliminates the need for managing hardware or worrying about energy costs. However, the tradeoff is that the profits tend to be lower, and you must share them with the service provider.</p>


 
 


 Pool Mining 



<p>Pool mining is the process of collaborating with other miners to pool resources and increase your chances of solving mining algorithms. Rewards are distributed based on the amount of computational power each participant contributes. This is a great way to earn Bitcoin consistently without requiring significant investment in hardware.</p>



 Choosing the Right Bitcoin Mining Hardware and Software 



<p>To get the best results, you’ll need to carefully select both your mining hardware and software.</p>



 
 Hardware: If you have the financial resources, ASIC hardware is the best option for maximizing mining efficiency. For those on a tighter budget, GPU mining can still be effective for getting started.<br> 



 Software: The software you use is just as important as the hardware. Popular mining software such as CGMiner, BFGMiner, and NiceHash help optimize your mining efforts by connecting you to mining pools and ensuring your hardware is running at peak efficiency. 
 



 How to Maximize Profits When Mining Bitcoin 



<p>Maximizing your profits from Bitcoin mining involves more than just having the right hardware. Here are some key strategies to consider:</p>



 Reducing Electricity Costs 



<p>Electricity costs are one of the largest expenses when mining Bitcoin. To reduce costs, consider mining in areas with lower electricity rates, using energy-efficient ASIC miners, or even exploring renewable energy options like solar power.</p>



 Increasing Computational Power 



<p>The more computational power you have, the more likely you are to solve mining puzzles and earn rewards. Upgrading your hardware to more powerful ASIC miners can significantly improve your mining capacity and profitability.</p>



 Monitoring Market Trends and Profitability 



<p>Bitcoin’s price and mining difficulty fluctuate constantly, so staying informed is essential. Use mining profitability calculators to assess whether your current setup is still effective or if adjustments are necessary to maximize your returns.</p>

 Challenges in Bitcoin Mining 



<p>While mining Bitcoin can be lucrative, there are several challenges that miners must overcome:</p>



 
 High Initial Investment: The cost of ASIC miners and other specialized hardware can be prohibitively expensive, particularly for beginners. 



 Electricity Costs: The energy required to mine Bitcoin is substantial, and electricity costs can eat into your profits if not carefully managed. 



 Bitcoin Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be volatile, meaning that fluctuations in the market can affect your mining profitability. 



 Increasing Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network, the difficulty of mining increases. This means that more powerful hardware is required to remain competitive. 



 Competition with Large-Scale Miners: Large mining farms with access to cheap electricity and state-of-the-art equipment can often outperform smaller individual miners. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Mining Bitcoin in 2025 can still be profitable, but it requires careful planning and the right approach. Whether you choose ASIC mining, GPU mining, or cloud mining, each method has its benefits and challenges. By selecting the right hardware and software, optimizing electricity costs, and staying informed about market trends, you can maximize your chances of success in the competitive world of Bitcoin mining.</p>

<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-youtube-adblock-5-easy-methods/">How to Block Ads on YouTube: 5 Easy Methods</a></p>



 What are Pop-Up Ads? 



<p><a href="https://blog.herond.org/how-to-stop-pop-up-ads/">Pop-up ads</a> are intrusive advertisements that appear in a new window or tab when you’re browsing the web or using an app. These ads come in many forms, such as banners, videos, or pop-ups, and are designed to grab your attention. While they may serve the advertiser’s purpose, they often disrupt the user experience and can pose potential security risks, like malware or tracking scripts.</p>


 
 


 How to Block Pop-Up Ads on Android and iPhone in 2025 



<p>To enjoy a smoother browsing experience, here are some effective ways to block pop-up ads on your phone.</p>



 Use Trusted Web Browsers with Built-in Ad Blockers 



<p>One of the simplest ways to block pop-up ads on Android and iPhone is by using web browsers that come with built-in ad-blocking features.</p>



 <a href="https://herond.org/en">Herond Browser</a> 



<p>Herond Browser provides an excellent browsing experience with powerful ad-blocking capabilities. It blocks pop-ups and banners, while also protecting you from online threats with advanced security technologies. In addition, Herond integrates a secure wallet, so you can manage digital assets directly from the browser without the need for additional apps.</p>


 
 


 <a href="https://www.opera.com/">Opera Browser</a> 



<p>Opera is known for being fast, secure, and capable of blocking pop-up ads effectively. It includes a free built-in VPN to ensure privacy and protects your data by blocking third-party trackers. If you’re looking for a quick, safe, and ad-free browsing experience, Opera is a great choice.</p>



 <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> 



<p>Firefox is another excellent option for blocking ads on your phone. It supports powerful extensions like uBlock Origin and AdBlock Plus, which can remove pop-ups, banners, and other unwanted ads. Additionally, Firefox prioritizes privacy, blocking trackers and ensuring secure browsing with SSL certificates.</p>



 Install Dedicated Ad-Blocking Apps 



<p>Beyond using browsers, installing dedicated ad-blocking apps is another effective way to block pop-up ads on your phone.</p>



 AdBlock (Android &amp; iOS) 



<p>AdBlock is a popular app available for both Android and iOS that helps block pop-ups and video ads while browsing or using apps. It offers an easy solution to remove unwanted ads and ensure a smooth, interruption-free experience.</p>



 1Blocker (iOS)

 Update Your Browser and Apps Regularly 



<p>Keeping your browser and apps up to date is crucial for optimal ad-blocking performance. Updates improve speed, fix bugs, and enhance security by addressing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious ads. Regular updates ensure your browser’s ad-blocking features are effective and protect your device from new threats.</p>

 Malware: Some ads trick users into downloading harmful software that can damage your device or steal sensitive data. 



 Tracking Scripts: Pop-up ads often include scripts that track your browsing habits, collecting personal information to target you with more ads. These scripts can compromise your privacy and expose you to data breaches. 
 



<p>By blocking pop-up ads, you effectively reduce the chances of encountering malware and prevent third parties from tracking your online activity. This keeps your personal information safe and helps maintain your online privacy.</p>



 A Clean, Distraction-Free Browsing Experience 



<p>One of the key reasons for blocking pop-up ads is to improve the overall quality of your browsing experience:</p>



 
 No More Interruptions: Pop-up ads often disrupt the flow of reading, watching videos, or browsing, creating frustration. Blocking them ensures that you can enjoy content without constant interruptions. 



 A Cleaner Interface: With pop-ups removed, your screen will be less cluttered, making it easier to focus on the content that matters most to you. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Blocking pop-up ads on your phone is essential for a more secure, faster, and enjoyable browsing experience. By using trusted web browsers with built-in ad blockers, installing dedicated ad-blocking apps, and regularly updating your apps, you can keep unwanted ads at bay. Start using these methods today to block ads on your phone and enjoy a seamless, uninterrupted browsing experience.</p>

 Pros and Cons of Using Coinbase 



<p>Before diving into how to use Coinbase, it’s important to understand both the advantages and limitations of the platform.</p>



 Pros of Coinbase 



 
 User-friendly Interface<br> Coinbase is designed to be easy for beginners to navigate. The platform’s layout is simple, allowing users to quickly buy, sell, and track their cryptocurrencies. This makes it ideal for those new to crypto trading. 



 Strong Security Features<br> Coinbase offers strong security measures to protect user assets. With two-factor authentication (2FA) and encryption, Coinbase ensures your account and funds remain safe from unauthorized access. 



 Wide Range of Cryptocurrencies<br> Coinbase supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and more. This makes it easy for users to diversify their portfolios and store different types of digital assets all in one place. 



 Educational Resources<br> Coinbase offers comprehensive tutorials and resources to help new users understand the basics of cryptocurrency, trading, and how to use the platform effectively. 
 



 Cons of Coinbase 



 
 High Transaction Fees<br> One of the main drawbacks of Coinbase is its relatively high transaction fees. Compared to other platforms, the fees can add up, especially if you’re making frequent small transactions. 



 Complex for New Users<br> While the interface is user-friendly, some of Coinbase’s more advanced features, such as Coinbase Pro, can be confusing for beginners. It may take some time to get used to advanced trading options. 



 Limited Country Support<br> Coinbase is not available in all countries, and some features may not be accessible in certain regions, limiting its global reach. 
 


 
 


 Exploring Coinbase Features 



<p>Coinbase offers a range of features designed to meet the needs of both beginner and advanced cryptocurrency users. Let’s take a closer look at two key features: Coinbase Wallet and Coinbase Pro.</p>



 Coinbase Wallet: Store Your Crypto Safely 



 Overview of Coinbase Wallet (Non-Custodial, Supports Multiple Coins) 



<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/wallet">Coinbase Wallet is a non-custodial wallet</a>, which basically means you’re in full control of your crypto. Unlike the Coinbase exchange, where they hold the keys to your assets, Coinbase Wallet lets you manage your own private keys and funds. This is perfect for anyone who wants to take charge of their digital assets and not rely on a third party. Plus, it’s not just about Bitcoin – Coinbase Wallet supports a bunch of cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Litecoin, and ERC-20 tokens, and it lets you dive into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs with ease.</p>



 How to Set Up and Use the Wallet for DeFi and NFTs 



<p>Setting up Coinbase Wallet is simple and user-friendly:</p>



 
 Download the Coinbase Wallet App: Begin by downloading the Coinbase Wallet app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). Alternatively, you can use the browser extension for desktop use. 



 Create a Wallet: Open the app and follow the prompts to create a new wallet. You’ll be asked to write down your recovery phrase — a set of words that will allow you to restore your wallet if you lose access. Make sure you store this recovery phrase securely, as it’s essential for wallet recovery. 



 Fund Your Wallet:&nbsp; Once your wallet is created, you can transfer funds from your Coinbase exchange account (or other exchanges) into your Coinbase Wallet. You can send cryptocurrencies to your wallet by copying your wallet’s address and pasting it into the sending platform’s withdrawal section. 



 Interacting with DeFi Platforms: Coinbase Wallet makes it easy to interact with various DeFi platforms. You can connect your wallet to decentralized applications like Uniswap (a decentralized exchange) or Compound (a lending platform). From within the wallet app, you can directly access these platforms, swap tokens, provide liquidity, or participate in yield farming. 



 Buying and Storing NFTs: Coinbase Wallet also supports NFTs, allowing you to buy, store, and display digital collectibles. You can connect your wallet to NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea or Rarible to browse, purchase, and store your NFTs securely. Your NFTs will be visible in your wallet’s “Collectibles” section, making it easy to manage your digital art collection. 
 



<p>By using Coinbase Wallet, you have full control over your assets, and you can explore the world of DeFi and NFTs with ease and security.</p>



 Coinbase Pro: Advanced Trading 



<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/BTC-USD">Coinbase Pro is a more advanced version</a> of the Coinbase platform, designed for experienced traders who require more sophisticated tools for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. While Coinbase is perfect for beginners with its simple interface, Coinbase Pro offers additional features and lower fees, making it a suitable choice for those who want to engage in more complex trading strategies.</p>



 Key Features of Coinbase Pro 



 
 Lower Fees: Coinbase Pro offers lower transaction fees than Coinbase, using a maker-taker model where makers pay less than takers, reducing costs for frequent traders. 



 Advanced Charting and Market Data: Coinbase Pro provides real-time charts, technical indicators, and volume data, helping traders analyze market trends more effectively. 



 Limit and Stop Orders: Users can place limit and stop orders on Coinbase Pro, allowing for automated strategies and better trade management. 



 Supported Cryptocurrencies: Coinbase Pro supports more cryptocurrencies, including altcoins not available on Coinbase, catering to advanced traders. 



 API Access: Coinbase Pro offers API access for automated trading and integration with third-party tools, ideal for algorithmic traders. 
 



 How to Use Coinbase Pro 



 
 Sign Up and Link Your Account: To use Coinbase Pro, you first need to create a Coinbase account. Once you have a Coinbase account, you can easily link it to Coinbase Pro. After linking your accounts, you can transfer funds between Coinbase and Coinbase Pro seamlessly. 



 Depositing Funds: Just like with Coinbase, you can deposit funds into Coinbase Pro using various payment methods, including bank transfers and cryptocurrency deposits. 



 Placing Orders: Once your account is funded, you can start placing orders. The interface allows you to choose between market orders (which execute immediately at the best available price), limit orders, and stop orders. You can also set up recurring buys for convenience. 



 Monitoring Your Trades: Coinbase Pro offers real-time monitoring of your trades and account balances. You can track your portfolio’s performance, view open orders, and check your trade history for any past transactions. 
 


 
 


 Is Coinbase safe? Evaluating the Security of Coinbase 



<p>A common concern when using any digital wallet is security. So, is Coinbase safe? The answer is yes. Coinbase is known for its robust security measures to protect your assets from theft. It uses SSL encryption to secure your personal data and transactions. Additionally, two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection when logging into your account.</p>

<p>In this week’s AMA session, Aergo Advisor Raph and Ben discussed recent progress across the Aergo ecosystem, the ongoing transition to the House Party Protocol (HPP), and future-facing efforts including Layer 2 development and AI-focused product integrations. The conversation provided a comprehensive view of where Aergo is today — and where it’s headed in&nbsp;2025.</p><p>1. What’s the latest on Aergo’s transition to HPP and where things stand right&nbsp;now?</p><p>It’s been a productive week. We’re now deep into the development phase of our Layer 2 architecture. Alongside that, we’ve officially released the HPP whitepaper, which outlines the broader vision and technical strategy. There are many moving parts behind the scenes, and our living roadmap remains the best resource for anyone looking to track our ongoing progress. The link to that roadmap is always available in our Telegram&nbsp;chat.</p><p>2. There’s been some confusion in the community regarding the relationship between Aergo and HPP. Can you clarify the distinction?</p><p>Historically, both our public blockchain and enterprise offering shared the name “Aergo,” which was confusing. Moving forward, Aergo Enterprise will continue as the name for our enterprise chain, used by governments and private-sector clients. The public blockchain will now operate under the name HPP, or House Party Protocol.</p><p>This change not only creates brand clarity but also frees the public chain to evolve without the compliance and structural constraints of enterprise use cases. It enables us to pursue more innovation and broader integrations, especially as we leverage AI-native capabilities.</p><p>3. Let’s talk about those broader integrations. What projects are currently part of the HPP ecosystem?</p><p>HPP launches with four founding projects, all of which use AI in meaningful ways and aim to address real-world problems.</p><p>First, there’s Booost, which is tackling the growing challenge of AI-generated identity fraud. Their Proof-of-Humanity system is already live in early form. Next, we have VaaSBlock, which supports coordination across the ecosystem and is behind our upcoming platform, W3DB — a decentralized database for due diligence in&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>There is also Alpha Quark(AQT), a Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization platform that will be merging into the HPP ecosystem. They have already launched their token, and a swap to HPP will occur in due course. These projects are only the beginning. We expect more organizations with strong AI capabilities to join and expand HPP’s&nbsp;reach.</p><p>4. What does this transition mean for existing Aergo token holders? How will the migration work?</p><p>There will be a token transition process, and depending on the exchange, users might see their AERGO tokens automatically swapped to HPP. In other cases, users may need to bridge tokens manually to the new Layer 2 chain. We’ll provide complete details and guidance when we reach that&nbsp;stage.</p><p>My general advice would be: if you’re not closely following every technical update, keeping your tokens on a reputable exchange might be the most straightforward way to complete the swap. However, we will provide transparent instructions to ensure a smooth transition for everyone.</p><p>5. Over the past few weeks, Aergo has seen multiple new listings, including Coinone. What does this mean strategically?</p><p>New listings are always positive from a visibility and accessibility standpoint. We didn’t pay for these or push them. They’ve happened organically, which tells us exchanges are recognizing value in what we’re building.</p><p>That said, listings do not alter our strategic direction. We’re focused on building HPP, developing our AI-integrated infrastructure, and launching real-use products. The community has backed this through governance votes, and we’re committed to delivering on that&nbsp;mandate.</p><p>6. Speaking of exchanges, the Binance delisting raised a lot of questions. Can you walk us through what happened?</p><p>About five weeks ago, Binance delisted us from both spot and futures markets, just minutes before we published an announcement on the HPP transition. We had been flagged for monitoring two weeks prior and were in active communication with their team. At the time, they seemed comfortable with our direction.</p><p>The delisting came as a complete surprise to us and our Binance contacts. However, about two weeks later, Binance relisted Aergo perpetual futures, which was encouraging. We’re not yet back on spot, but we remain hopeful. It’s a reminder of how exchange dynamics can be unpredictable, but our focus remains on building long-term value through ecosystem growth.</p><p>7. Let’s shift back to product updates. What’s new with&nbsp;Booost?</p><p>Booost launched its Proof-of-Humanity feature this week. It’s very early, but it’s already available through the Booost mobile app on both iOS and Android. We’re encouraging the community to test it and share feedback. The idea is to create a KYC solution resistant to AI manipulation — something that is increasingly critical as synthetic identities become more advanced.</p><p>8. And what’s the update on&nbsp;W3DB?</p><p>W3DB is still in development, but we’ve begun integrating some of its scoring endpoints into the VaaSBlock platform for internal testing. These scores will be crucial for use cases such as auditing, reputation scoring, and governance. We plan to launch W3DB after the HPP migration is finalized. Compared to Booost, we’re slightly behind in terms of readiness, but the technical foundation is progressing well.</p><p>9. Final question — what should the community expect over the next six&nbsp;months?</p><p>To put it simply: we’re building. The groundwork we’re laying now across Layer 2, AI integrations, and project collaborations will lead to frequent feature rollouts in the second half of the year. Our ambition is to create a blockchain ecosystem that’s deeply responsive to real-world complexity, and that means doing the hard infrastructure work&nbsp;now.</p><p>The House Party Protocol isn’t just a technical rebrand — it’s a shift in how we think about smart contracts, identity, and intelligence on-chain. Within six months, we expect to announce meaningful advancements on a regular&nbsp;basis.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/ama-4-recap-l2-development-hpp-ecosystem-growth-and-strategic-positioning-for-aergo-28910e8a8d1a">AMA #4 Recap: L2 Development, HPP Ecosystem Growth, and Strategic Positioning for Aergo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Thales and Deloitte form Strategic Alliance to Help Enhance Data Protection and Governance Services
guillaume.cinquin

Fri, 04/25/2025 - 17:39


            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhancing Data Protection and Governance Services Capabilities </p>
<p>This alliance will combine Thales’s advanced encryption and key management technologies with Deloitte’s data protection, security consulting, and implementation knowledge. The collaboration provides organisations with a broad suite of services and solutions designed to help clients address the full spectrum of cloud security needs, tailored to their hybrid and multi-cloud environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting Evolving Data Security and Compliance Needs</p>
<p>The data security landscape is rapidly changing. Technology disruptions, such as the use of generative AI, come with new threats to data confidentiality and integrity.

The acceleration of digital transformation requires the evolution of cyber security strategies to mitigate inconsistent and insufficient policies of data access controls.</p>
<p>According to the &nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-threat-report">2024 Thales Data Threat Report</a>, organisations that maintained compliance were significantly less likely to suffer data breaches. As compliance regulations continue to evolve, customers will be equipped to meet these challenges and thrive in a secure environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By drawing from Thales’s expertise and Deloitte’s extensive experience in data protection and governance strategy, organisations will benefit from broad services and solutions designed to help clients address the complexities of modern cybersecurity and compliance landscapes.</p>
<blockquote><p>For Linda Walsh, Managing Director, Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP: “By combining Deloitte’s Data &amp; Digital Trust Services that assist with client data security and governance challenges with Thales’ cybersecurity solutions, we can provide broad and tailored security responses to our shared clients.Our collaboration provides efficient integration and enhanced security across multi-cloud environments, helping clients drive innovation. Together, we can help organisations transform their cloud security to enhance the value of their cybersecurity programs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>By capitalising on existing strategic alliances with industry leaders in cloud services, Deloitte clients will have access to capabilities that help them achieve robust cloud data protection in various environments. This alliance will help create new business opportunities through incorporation in new and existing comprehensive transformation programmes.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>John Polly, Vice President, Channel &amp; Alliances at Thales, added, “This strategic alliance with Deloitte marks a significant milestone in our mission to help organisations secure their data and all paths to it “According to our Cloud Security Report, cloud resources have become the biggest targets for cyber-attacks, with 44% of organisations having suffered a cloud data breach. By combining our cloud data security technologies with Deloitte’s knowledge in Data &amp; Digital Trust, we are poised to deliver innovative and robust strategies that help address the evolving compliance and security needs of our clients worldwide.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<p>In <a href="https://datarella.com/securing-data-integrity-in-industry-4-0/">part two</a> of the <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> blogpost series, we explained how we use the Secret Network blockchain and a custom Wallet Service to ensure the integrity and privacy of machine-generated data in Industry 4.0 environments. In this final part, we’ll show how we integrated the Wallet Service with live machines from <a href="https://sw-machines.com/">SW</a> and an AI service from <a href="https://www.inovex.de/">inovex</a>. Together, they power a proof-of-concept demonstrator for secure and accurate anomaly detection in machine components.</p>
<p></p>
 Visualizing Sensor Data 
<p>The demonstrator has three core features. First, the data exploration tool lets you visualize sensor data from three different machines. For granularity, you can filter by machine, component, sensor, and the timeframe you want to monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_1.png"></a></p>
 Verification &amp; Anomaly Detection 
<p>Next, the anomaly detection feature, coupled with data integrity verification. Like before, you can filter by machine, component, sensor, and timeframe. Additionally, you choose from three anomaly detection algorithms—Local Outlier Factor (LOF), DBSCAN, and Isolation Forest—and adjust their hyperparameters. After that, once you lock in your configuration and submit the query, the system fetches data from a central time series database. It then converts the data into the standardized format described in our <a href="https://datarella.com/securing-data-integrity-in-industry-4-0/">previous post</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_2.png"></a></p>
<p>To ensure trust, the Wallet Service verifies the dataset by comparing a freshly generated fingerprint to the one anchored on the blockchain. It uses the standardized batchID for this lookup. If the fingerprints match, the AI service proceeds with the anomaly detection. Whenever the number of anomalies exceeds a defined threshold, the system flags the component as worn out. Consequently, it submits an automatic spare part order to the ERP systems of the manufacturer and the customer.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_3.png"></a></p>
 Data Integrity Log 
<p>In this demonstrator, users manually trigger the configuration and execution of the anomaly detection. In contrast, a production system would automate and continuously run these steps. The third feature is a data integrity log to give users better visibility of what is happening. This audit trail has three levels: At the top level, it shows the health status of each machine and the last verified batch used for anomaly detection.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_4.png"></a></p>
<p>Next, it breaks down each machine into components, displaying health statistics for each</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_5.png"></a></p>
<p>Finally, it presents detailed logs of every anomaly detection run and whether the data integrity check succeeded.</p>
<p><a href="https://datarella.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/trusted_anomaly_detection_6.png"></a></p>
<p>As we wrap up this blog post series, what began as a technical experiment has evolved into something much broader. It points toward a future of industrial intelligence that values transparency and built-in trust. By embedding trust directly into machine data and equipping AI with verified information, we do more than detect anomalies. We enable machines to communicate, collaborate, and maintain themselves. Ultimately, this proof of concept is a first step toward an Industry 4.0 landscape that is autonomous, secure, and transparent, where trust is not an afterthought but a foundation.</p>

            <p>Thales has recently published an article in PoliticsHome focusing on the upcoming UK Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and the opportunity it provides to strengthen national security, as well as enhance innovation and resilience across the defence industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is showcasing how fast the nature of warfare is changing, with traditional approaches to defence being forced to adapt to keep up with the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), electronic warfare and drones. This is why it is important we continue to address how the UK must develop and share cutting-edge capabilities, to ensure that defence is recognised as a national priority. To address these challenges, it is essential for the UK to continue investing in sustainable supply chains for defence procurement, support UK industry and strengthen the avenues for international collaboration.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>“In the first quarter of 2025, Thales recorded organic sales growth of nearly 10%, demonstrating the strong momentum of our Defence and Avionics activities, as well as the excellent visibility the Group enjoys.<br>
​Order intake in the first quarter of 2025 was solid, and showed growth compared to the same periods in 2022 and 2023. The decline observed compared to the first quarter of 2024 is explained by a particularly high comparison basis.<br>
​Thanks to the commitment of our teams, we confirm all our annual financial targets for 2025, including a book-to-bill ratio over 1 for the year 2025.” ​<br>
​Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer </p></blockquote>
 Order intake 
<p>Order intake for the first quarter of 2025 amounted to €3,778 million, down -27%&nbsp;at constant scope and exchange rates compared to the first three months of 2024 (-25% on a reported basis) due to a very high comparison base, particularly in the Defence segment. In the first quarter of 2024, Thales had recorded, among other contracts, two contracts with a unit value exceeding €500 million each: the third phase of the contract signed by Indonesia for the acquisition of Rafale aircraft (18 out of a total of 42), as well as an order for an air surveillance system for a military customer in the Middle East. However, the Group is benefiting from a robust commercial momentum in all its activities for this first quarter of 2025, particularly in the Aerospace segment. For reference, order intake amounted to €3,422 million in Q1 2023 and €3,033 million in Q1 2022.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 2025, Thales recorded five large orders worth over €100 million each, for a total of €707 million:</p>
 
 Order from Space Norway, Northern Europe’s leading satellite operator, for the supply of a telecommunications satellite, THOR 8; 
 Order from SKY Perfect JSAT to Thales Alenia Space for JSAT-32, a geostationary telecommunications satellite; 
 Signing of a contract between Thales and the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop Argonaut, a future autonomous and versatile lunar lander designed to deliver cargo and scientific instruments to the Moon; 
 Order from the Dutch Ministry of Defence for the modernisation and support of vehicle tactical simulators; 
 Order from the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) for the development, production, and maintenance of vetronics equipment for various Army vehicles as part of the SCORPION programme.  
 
<p>At €3,071 million, order intake with a unit value of less than €100 million was down -10% compared to the first three months of 2024; meanwhile, those with a unit value of less than €10 million were slightly up in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Geographically4, order intake in mature markets amounted to €2,914&nbsp;million, similar to the first quarter of 2024 (+2% on a reported basis and a decrease of -1% at constant scope and exchange rates). Order intake in emerging markets amounted to €864 million (-61% as of March 31, 2025, in organic terms), affected by a very high comparison basis in these markets from the first quarter of 2024 (contracts for the Rafale in Indonesia and for an air surveillance system for a military customer in the Middle East mentioned previously).</p>
<p>Order intake in the Aerospace segment totaled €1,530 million, compared to €1,003 million in the first three months of 2024 (+45% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Avionics market continued to benefit from strong demand across its various businesses and recorded one large order with a unit value exceeding €100 million in its Training and Simulation business. In addition, Space benefited in the first quarter from favorable phasing of expected 2025 order intake, with the notification of three large orders with a unit value greater than €100 million, two related to the telecommunications business and one to the exploration business.</p>
<p>At €1,302 million (compared to €3,122 million in the first three months of 2024, representing an organic change of -59%), order intake in the Defence segment compared to a very high base in Q1 2024. One large order with a unit value over €100 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2025 compared to four in the same period in 2024. The Group reaffirms its objective of a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1 for the Defence segment in 2025.</p>
<p>At €922&nbsp;million, order intake in the Cyber &amp; Digital segment was structurally very close to sales as most business lines in this segment operate on short sales cycles. The order book is therefore not significant.</p>
 Sales 
<p>Sales for the first quarter of 2025 reached €4,960 million, compared to €4,421 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 9.9%5 at constant scope and exchange rates (up 12.2% on a reported basis).</p>
<p>Geographically6, sales recorded solid growth in both mature markets (+9.7% in organic terms), notably in the United Kingdom (+14.9%) and emerging markets with organic growth of +10.5% during the period.</p>
<p>Sales in the Aerospace segment amounted to €1,342 million, up 13.5% compared to the first quarter of 2024 (+8.4% at constant scope and exchange rates). This growth reflects ongoing robust demand in the Avionics market, leading the business to grow double-digit and achieve a solid performance across all activities as well as in both civil and military domains. Sales in the Space business continue to be impacted by the weak demand observed over the past two years in telecommunications satellites.</p>
<p>Sales in the Defence segment totaled €2,685&nbsp;million, up +16.5% compared to the first quarter of 2024 (+15.0% at constant scope and exchange rates). This growth is observed across all businesses in the Defence segment, notably in land and air systems, which benefitted from production capacity expansion projects being deployed, especially for radars’ production.</p>
<p>Sales in the Cyber &amp; Digital segment stood at €903 million, down -1.5% compared to the first three months of 2024 (-2.1% at constant scope and exchange rates), reflecting contrasting trends:</p>
 
 Cyber businesses were stable in the first quarter of 2025 (+0.2% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 The Cyber Security Products business is recording growth, leveraging Imperva’s complementary offer. The beginning of 2025 is moreover marked by the merger of the Imperva and Thales’ sales teams, a key step in the integration process that will unlock the full potential of the business, though its execution may generate some short-term disturbances; 
 The Cyber Premium Services business was impacted by a soft market demand start this first 2025 quarter, notably in Australia, and reported a decline in sales compared to the first quarter of 2024. For this business, which represents approximately 20% of total Cyber activity, the Group's priority is to standardise operations to improve margins and focus the sales strategy on selective profitable growth segments. 
 
 
 In Digital businesses (down -3.6% at constant scope and exchange rates):<br>
 
 Sales from Payment Services returned to positive growth in the first quarter of 2025, after five consecutive quarters of decline; 
 Sales in Identity and Biometrics solutions declined. This business faced revenues downturn due to COVID in 2020. Post pandemic, an important catch-up effect occurred through to 2024, in the travel documents segment. As a consequence, the comparison effect is not favourable as this business is now normalising to a more usual run rate. 
 
 
 
 Outlook 
<p>Thales continues to benefit from a strong visibility in the vast majority of its businesses and enjoys a robust medium to long-term outlook.</p>
<p>The Group has initiated preliminary work to assess the impacts of the increase in tariffs, as they are stand today. Such analysis takes into account the affected flows on the one hand, and the cases of exemption from tariffs on the other hand (such as in defence activities), along with certain protective contractual conditions in our export contracts (incoterms). Furthermore, Thales is working on mitigation plans in response to these new regulations: use of specific customs programmes such as duty drawback or temporary Importations under Bonds, the redirection of certain production flows, transfer pricing, supply chain adjustments (alternate sourcing), customer surcharging…</p>
<p>These estimates are based on the latest available information on announced tariffs increases and exemptions as known on April 24, 2025, and Thales' estimates to date. At this stage, the Group estimates that the net direct impact from those elements is contained. The potential indirect impact is not known at this stage.</p>
<p>As a result, assuming no new disruptions of the macroeconomic geopolitical context and the evolution of new tariffs, Thales confirms all of its 2025 financial objectives, as listed below:</p>
 
 A book-to-bill ratio above 1; 
 Organic sales growth of between +5% and +6%, corresponding to annual sales in the range of €21.7 billion to €21.9 billion7;  
 An Adjusted EBIT margin between 12.2% and 12.4%. 
 
<p>****</p>
<p>This press release contains certain forward-looking statements. Although Thales believes that its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, actual results may differ significantly from the forward-looking statements due to various risks and uncertainties, as described in the Company's Universal Registration Document, which has been filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF).</p>

 Whitepaper v1.0 Now Live | April&nbsp;2025 <p>The future of Web3 will not be modular. It will be intelligently integrated. That future begins now with the release of the House Party Protocol (HPP) Whitepaper v1.0.</p><p>HPP is a unified, AI-first blockchain and data infrastructure, developed in collaboration with Aergo, Alpha Quark (AQT), Booost, and VaaSBlock. It’s designed to bridge the gap between enterprise-grade systems and decentralized networks, with trusted data, verifiable AI, and real-world scalability at its&nbsp;core.</p><p>Today, we are excited to share the full vision behind HPP with the release of our official whitepaper.</p><p>[📄 <a href="https://paper.aergo.io/HousePartyProtocol_Whitepaper.pdf">Read the Whitepaper</a>]</p> Why HPP? Why&nbsp;Now? <p>Despite major advancements, AI and Web3 continue to evolve in silos — riddled with issues like fragmented data pipelines, unverifiable models, and scalability bottlenecks. HPP directly addresses these challenges through a multi-layered ecosystem that unites AI, identity, compute, and trust into one vertically integrated protocol.</p><p>This isn’t just a technical release. HPP represents a new infrastructure standard for digital economies that demand transparency, auditability, and intelligence by&nbsp;design.</p> What’s Inside the Whitepaper <p>The HPP Whitepaper v1.0 outlines the protocol’s foundational architecture, token utility, governance structure, and business model, including:</p>  AI-Native Bridge Layer: A multi-chain, AI-first environment built across Aergo, Ethereum, and Layer 2&nbsp;networks  Personhood + Data Trust Layers: Leveraging Booost’s Proof-of-Humanity and VaaSBlock’s certification systems  Real-Time AI Services: From model verification to on-chain inference  Enterprise Compatibility: Scalable, compliant infrastructure grounded in real-world deployments (e.g., NHIS, Korea’s public&nbsp;sector)   The HPP Token&nbsp;($HPP) <p>At the heart of the protocol is the HPP token, powering everything from:</p>  Transaction and inference fees  Access to AI tools, datasets, and verification services  Governance and protocol&nbsp;upgrades  Staking for Proof-of-Inference and AI model validation  <p>With $HPP, value flows directly between developers, data contributors, infrastructure providers, and end users — creating a sustainable, transparent economic&nbsp;loop.</p> A Collaborative Alliance <p>Four domain-specialized partners will drive the HPP ecosystem:</p>  Aergo: AI-enhanced smart contracts and enterprise blockchain infrastructure  Alpha Quark (AQT): AI-powered RWA/NFT valuation and financial intelligence  Booost: Human and synthetic data layers, including personhood verification  VaaSBlock (W3DB): Model and dataset certification infrastructure  <p>Together, these partners enable HPP to deliver practical, scalable, and secure services across public and enterprise Web3 networks.</p> Let’s Build Smarter,&nbsp;Together <p>HPP is more than a protocol — it’s a foundation for the next generation of AI-integrated, data-verifiable ecosystems.</p><p>We invite developers, researchers, enterprises, and ecosystem contributors to read the whitepaper and join the movement toward a more intelligent, human-centric Web3.</p><p>[📄 <a href="https://paper.aergo.io/HousePartyProtocol_Whitepaper.pdf">Read the Whitepaper</a>]</p><p>For ongoing updates, follow us on Twitter, Telegram, and GitHub.

 Enables Michelin to focus on development of its industry-leading simulation software  
 Helps drive software-led revenue 
 Allows adaptation of deployment options based on application’s technical context or ecosystem 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p><a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en">Thales</a>, the leading global technology and security provider, has today announced it is working in partnership with tyre manufacturer Michelin to protect its Intellectual Property and deploy its software to customers around the world, with the Sentinel Software Monetization Platform. </p>
<p>Michelin, one of the largest, oldest and most respected tyre manufacturers in the world—known for fitting physical tyres for everything from bicycles to space shuttles—is now transitioning to software-led revenue. <a href="https://simulation.michelin.com/tametire">TameTire</a> is one example of Michelin’s software offer that allows car manufacturers and motorsports teams to simulate real-world tyre performance to a high level of accuracy. </p>
<p>Using complex algorithms, TameTire predicts tyre behaviours in reaction to various forces, torques and temperatures to help manufacturers produce better-handling car models at reduced costs, as well as allowing motorsports teams to test and fine-tune their vehicle setups in a more convenient and safer environment.</p>
<p>TameTire is just one of several simulation products that Michelin deploys and protects using Thales Sentinel. Others include <a href="https://simulation.michelin.com/canopy">Canopy</a>, which provides laptime simulation, vehicle modelling and setup exploration in record time, using the power of cloud computing and a proprietary collocation solver; and <a href="https://chassis-simulation-datasets.michelin.com/">SiMiX</a>, an initiative that provides datasets for vehicle manufacturers, racing teams and automotive supply chain organizations covering components, such as tyres, chassis and suspensions. </p>
<blockquote><p>Damien Bullot, Vice President Software Monetization at Thales commented: “Given that Michelin’s innovative software is complex and proprietary, we recognized their need for an agile licensing platform that was both easy to deploy and able to protect against IP theft. Thales Sentinel manages all Michelin’s software licensing under one solution that is fully compatible with Michelin’s infrastructure. We are pleased to see reported operational efficiencies and revenue growth from this collaboration.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"As an organization whose reputation is based on quality, focusing on quality was essential to us as we expanded our business to software-led offerings. We are the clear market leader for this type of solution, and partnering with Thales ensured we could not only protect this valuable software IP, but also offer a new subscription business model and scale our license-based revenue stream. Relying on the Sentinel platform allows us to focus on further innovating our software and creating value for our customers,” said Pierre-Yves Mauriere, Product Owner for TameTire at Michelin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michelin relies on Sentinel’s ability to license software on premises, in the cloud and any combination of the two. While TameTire is typically deployed offline or in a hybrid environment, Canopy and Simix are deployed exclusively in the cloud, leveraging the Sentinel Cloud License Manager.</p>

<p>Meet Emily—a compliance officer managing KYC processes for an international financial firm. Like many businesses, her firm relies on multiple third-party tools, each with its own subprocessors scattered across various countries. Every time a new customer submits their documents, the data embarks on a long and risky journey—hopping across networks, servers, and regions before returning as a completed KYC profile.</p>



<p>But what if that journey could be shorter, safer, and entirely within the organization’s control? Enter edge computing—a game-changer that keeps sensitive data local, secure, and compliant. Here’s a closer look at the difference it makes.</p>



<p></p>



 The Legacy KYC Data Journey 



<p>Emily’s current KYC process starts with a customer uploading identification documents through a third-party portal. These documents travel to cloud-based services for validation and verification, often crossing borders and passing through international subprocessors.</p>



<p>Each stop introduces new risks:</p>



 
 Data Exposure: Sensitive information is transmitted over multiple networks. 



 Jurisdictional Complexity: Different data privacy regulations apply at each stage. 



 Increased Latency: Every transfer adds time, creating frustrating delays for customers and compliance teams alike. 
 



<p>When regulations like GDPR or U.S. Data Privacy Framework require local data storage, this scattered process becomes a compliance headache—and a potential security vulnerability.</p>



<p></p>



 The Edge Computing KYC Data Journey 



<p>Now imagine the same process using edge computing. When Emily’s customer uploads their documents, something different happens:</p>



 
 Local Processing: The data is encrypted, authenticated, and validated on the customer’s device or a nearby edge node before it leaves the network. 



 Direct Transfer: Once verified, only the necessary data is securely sent to Emily’s local server, staying within jurisdictional boundaries. 



 Faster Decision-Making: No detours through third-party subprocessors or distant cloud servers—just fast, secure compliance processing. 
 



<p>With edge computing, Emily’s KYC process is not only faster but also privacy-focused, meeting data localization laws without added complexity​​.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Benefits of Edge Computing for KYC Compliance 



 
 Data Sovereignty by Design<br>Edge computing keeps customer data within required jurisdictions, making compliance with data localization laws seamless. No international subprocessors, no regulatory gray areas—just clear control over where and how data is handled​. 



 Stronger Security<br>By encrypting and validating documents at the source, edge computing minimizes data exposure during transmission. Sensitive information never travels unsecured through multiple systems, drastically reducing the attack surface​​. 



 Reduced Latency and Costs<br>Processing data locally means faster verification times—often within seconds. This eliminates the lag caused by data bouncing between external servers and cuts cloud storage and transmission costs. 
 



<p></p>



 The Future of Compliance Is Edge-Based 



<p>For Emily’s firm, the switch to edge computing transformed KYC from a risky journey to a secure, streamlined experience. Customers appreciated faster onboarding, while Emily’s team gained confidence in their compliance processes, knowing sensitive data stayed secure and audit-ready.</p>



<p>Are you ready to take control of your compliance data journey? With iComply’s edge computing solutions, you can enhance privacy, reduce risks, and future-proof your compliance strategy. Let’s redefine compliance together.</p>

									  Tariffs, Trade Wars, and Tokenomics   <p>The US-China trade war isn’t just soybeans and semiconductors anymore. It has become a macroeconomic chess match with far-reaching consequences — and yes, even crypto’s starting to feel the ripple effects.</p>  <p>As the Trump administration dials up tariffs on Chinese goods in 2025, and Beijing retaliates in kind, industries on both sides of the Pacific are bracing for impact. But amid the chaos, there’s a rising signal in the noise. Web3 is quietly becoming a pressure valve, and Liquidity Pool Financing (LPF) might just be one of the breakout stars.</p>  <p>New US tariffs on Chinese tech, green energy components, and electric vehicles are reaching 145%. China is countering this with retaliatory tariffs of up to 125% and strategic export controls. Traditional finance (TradFi) is caught in the middle, with cross-border capital flows tightening and investor confidence rattled.</p>  <p>But decentralized finance (DeFi) doesn’t care about borders. On-chain liquidity doesn’t wait for central banks to approve a wire transfer. As global tensions fragment the old financial order, the permissionless nature of DeFi could find itself not just resilient, but essential.</p>  <p>Liquidity pools are the decentralized engine rooms of web3. At their simplest, they’re smart contracts where users deposit assets to enable trading, lending, and yield generation. But zooming out, LPs are a blueprint for programmable capital in a world where cross-border finance is increasingly politicized.</p>  <p>Imagine US-based manufacturers cut off from low-interest Chinese lending. Or Chinese startups blocked from dollar-based VC funding. LPF offers a workaround. Need working capital? Tokenize invoices and collateralize against stablecoins. Want exposure without political baggage? LPs enable pseudonymous lending — no passport checks required. Capital flight? Meet capital fluidity.</p>  <p>DeFi liquidity pools offer three distinct advantages in a tariff-fractured world:</p>    <p>Neutral ground:&nbsp;No SWIFT codes, no sanctions. Just code.</p>  <p>Real-time settlement:&nbsp;Capital moves at block speed, not bank hours.</p>  <p>Global participation:&nbsp;Anyone, anywhere, can LP, borrow, or build.</p>    <p>And the cherry on top? Yields. Unlike TradFi, LPs reward participants with real-time returns, often via governance tokens or LP fees. Access, and upside.</p>  <p>However, it goes without saying that web3 is not immune to its own landmines:</p>    <p>Regulatory uncertainty:&nbsp;The same governments waging tariff wars are still trying to define DeFi in courtrooms.</p>  <p>Smart contract risk:&nbsp;One bad line of code, and your liquidity is toast.</p>  <p>On-chain volatility:&nbsp;Markets move fast, and liquidity can vanish faster.</p>    <p>LPF isn’t a silver bullet — but it might be a bullet train compared to the horse-and-buggy pace of traditional trade finance.</p>  <p>TL;DR: The US-China tariff war is reshaping global finance. But in web3, where code is law and liquidity knows no borders, opportunity is brewing. If the old system is fragmenting, the next one might just be forged on-chain.</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Crypto Got Its Hermes Wings   <p>I’d been anxiously awaiting SUI’s big announcement about “the largest consumer platform in America (later the world)” onboarding. Instead, I get this&nbsp;curveball: the Athens Stock Exchange (ATHEX), Greece’s financial titan, is going full web3 by choosing SUI to power their electronic book building (EBB) system.</p>  <p>Did I read that right? A national stock exchange embracing blockchain? That’s like your grandpa swapping his flip phone for a VR headset.</p>  <p>Let’s break down why this could shake up finance forever.</p>  <p>ATHEX, Greece’s go-to market for stocks and bonds, just teamed up with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mystenlabs.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=l-p-fg">Mysten Labs</a>&nbsp;— the minds behind SUI&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SUI.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=l-p-fg">$SUI.X ( ▼ 6.49% )</a>&nbsp;— to bring their EBB process on-chain. EBB is how companies raise capital (think IPOs or bonds). ATHEX becomes the first national exchange to go public-chain with this. Mysten’s co-founder Adeniyi Abiodun even called it “a new era.”</p>  <p>This move promises faster trades, lower costs, and crystal-clear transparency. No more middlemen. If it works, it’s a billboard to the world that crypto tech can hang with the big dogs — maybe even turn some Wall Street heads.</p>  <p>Imagine trading stocks like tokens on a DEX: seamless, instant, fully on-chain. Tokenized bonds, simplified investing. A SUI blog even dubbed it “a first for on-chain order books.”</p>  <p>Regulations are always trickyn — especially for national exchanges. And SUI will need to prove it can handle ATHEX’s $15–$50M in daily volume. For reference, SUI’s already processed $626M daily with 65 million transactions in a single day. But a structured exchange? That’s a whole new beast. Security’s key, and SUI’s built in Move, one of the safest languages out there.</p>  <p>ATHEX isn’t massive enough to swamp SUI, but it’s no lightweight either. $10B in EBB issuance over five years makes it an ideal proving ground. If SUI thrives here, scaling to even bigger markets is in reach.</p>  <p>SUI’s engineered for speed and scale. Mysten Labs has a $300M+ war chest and ex-Facebook Diem engineers who’ve built for the big leagues. They’re even boots-on-the-ground in Athens, working shoulder-to-shoulder with ATHEX. Their CEO called SUI “uniquely positioned” for this mission.</p>  <p>The final platform, launched April 2025, includes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). That means you can verify things like bids without revealing them — privacy, security, and compliance in one swoop. First fully on-chain stock order book. Huge.</p>  <p>It’s a big day when TradFi and DeFi go from stiff competition to team sport. Yeah, there are hurdles, but if this works, it’s a game-changer. I’m watching like it’s the playoffs. Crypto just got its Hermes wings.</p>  <p>— Branden</p>        								 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Patently Cumbersome   <p>What do NFTs and intellectual property (IP) laws have in common?</p>  <p>I wish I had a good punchline for you, but I’m a data scientist, not a comedian. All I got for you are more buzzwords.<br><br>The answer: they are both governance methods for property that is often hard to own, like a brandmark, an image, a sound, a song, or a systems diagram. It got lost in the “right-click-save” discourse of the 2021 boom, but this is exactly why NFTs came onto the scene in 2018, leveraging the power of smart contracts and distributed recording ledger technology to evolve the worlds of IP.</p>  <p>Like most mass movements, as soon as the majority of the population is in on it, the narrative redirects and the revolutionary momentum is lost. (It’s better to find a band before they’re cool than after they’ve sold out.) Hence why, today, many only view NFTs as a get rich quick ponzi scheme. And, for the vast majority of projects in the collective consciousness, it is effectively just that.</p>  <p>After NFTs exploded into the mainstream in February 2021, headlines very quickly faded from artists like Beeple to con artist collectives like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and DeGods, who’ve swindled the masses out of millions while providing little more than a Walmart Fyre Festival —&nbsp;a mini music festival without any of the actual acts, but all of the intoxicants. And while membership passes are a great primitive use case for NFTs, their real power is in transforming data system architectures like the ones that power most of the websites and apps you interact with every day.</p>  <p>That’s where IP rights come in. Many supporters argue that capitalism, innovation, and our most recent innovation cycles — beginning with the industrial revolution — are all fundamentally tied to the idea of ownership rights. Inventors need to be able to own their products, they say, as a way to incentivize innovation and reward those who create new and useful solutions to everyday problems.</p>  <p>I certainly don’t disagree with the premise of that take, nor the clear impact it’s had. My position is simply that, in the age of AI, those laws are archaic, cumbersome, and a bottleneck to the future of problem solving.</p>  <p>The long and short of it is that AI is Pandora’s Box. Sam Altman, in all his eternal wisdom, opened it. There is no deconstructing the replicant LLMs that have been built off of essentially stolen data. But that is also the nature and requirement of the technology to exist —&nbsp;it needs the corpus of human knowledge in its current best state to be its teacher. So now that the LLM irrevocably does exist, what do property rights look like moving forward?</p>  <p>Think of it this way: AI can see all the existing patents, their supporting research, and the spaces in between. That’s how embeddings work. They are mathematical reductions of a concept, and their output is always novel, in the same way that one painting is always the same but each individual person will describe it differently. In other words, AI takes the concept of patent arms race to stalemate levels, all at the expense of the people who would benefit from the solutions.</p>  <p>So while I love the idea of owning an idea, it’s more likely that our future will look like chain-supported provenance, with individuals receiving a bibliographical citation for inspiring the discovery of the creation, rather than full-on ownership of it. As far as paths to monetization go, I personally believe that citation can be sufficient for building a business moat around being the inventor of something novel, while amplifying the other benefit of IP, creating pressure to innovate and improve to stay ahead of worthy competitors.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>

				  For an AI agent to have agency — to act on data — it must have access to personal data. That means proving that it is a legitimate agent and getting permission to use a person’s data, instantly, seamlessly.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Agentic AI promises to revolutionize digital interaction. Much like a human travel agent (although that may be a concept as familiar to some as a rotary phone), agentic AI gets us where we want to go online by taking our instructions and parameters and delivering solutions instantly.</p>
<p>An AI agent operates autonomously, negotiates multistep workflows, uses a “reasoning engine” to make decisions, adapts to its environment and new information, and interacts with databases and software&nbsp; to achieve its goal — all without being piloted by a human.</p>
<p>If we’re going to use AI agents to achieve our goals, we’re going to need to give the agent permission to use our information. And the organization providing us with access to an AI agent is going to need to know that their agent has authenticated who we are and that the information we’re sharing is authentic and not fake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The alternative is chaos.</p>
<p>However, there is a simple solution to these challenges, one that leverages the rapid evolution in interoperable, decentralized identity technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Let’s start with access:  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>1. When a person uses a Verifiable Credential to login to a web-based AI Agent, Proven checks to see who the credential was issued by. For example, in the case of a Digital Passport Credential issued by an airline, the airline would confirm that it was the issuer of the credential, or that another approved issuer within a given ecosystem had issued the credential.</p>
<p>2. The person doesn’t need to manually enter login data to prove who they are. The person’s digital wallet software (where the credential is stored) creates a presentation that enables seamless authentication (using cryptography).</p>
<p>3. This mutual authentication takes place before any data is shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p></p>
 
 The AI Agent’s host system doesn’t need to store login or password information for users, removing a risk of identity theft from a data breach. 
 The credential is cryptographically bound to the credential issuer, so it can’t be faked. 
 The credential is cryptographically bound to the person it has been issued to, their digital wallet, and their device. It cannot be shared or stolen. 
 Mutual authentication is instant. 
 
 2. Now, the AI agent asks for personal data:  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>1. The AI agent asks for permission to access the data in the credential.</p>
<p>2. The person consents to share their data.</p>
<p>3. The consent can be recorded for auditing.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p></p>
 
 Explicit consent to data sharing is vital to meet the stringent requirements of data regulation on AI, especially in relation to the European Union’ GDPR.&nbsp; 
 The person has control over access to their personal data. They do not have to share it, They can opt out of using the AI agent. This control is vital for public confidence in agentic AI. 
 
 3. The person shares the data in their credential:  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>1. All the data in the credential is digitally signed, so the AI agent (and its host) can be certain it has not been altered.</p>
<p>2. Data can be shared selectively by the person, ensuring the AI agent receives only the necessary information to achieve its goal, meaning it can meet GDPR requirements for data and purpose minimization.</p>
<p>Benefits</p>
 
 The person doesn’t have to manually input the basic information needed for the AI agent to achieve its goal. For example, once permission is granted, the AI Travel Agent can instantly ingest a person’s name, address, loyalty program number, booking reference, flight number, passenger number, whether their passport is valid for at least six months, seat preferences etc. 
 Different data can be combined and ingested from multiple credentials. 
 
 This is just the start of the AI agent’s Verifiable Credential journey 
<p>Verifiable Credentials enable AI agents to perform efficiently and effectively, while delivering state-of the art digital identity privacy and security. These are simple, low cost steps that accelerate usability and provide consumer and regulatory confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we can do more!</p>
<p>In the next blog, we’ll look at how Verifiable Credential workflows can provide a foundation for AI Agents to really flex their intelligence.</p>

<p>Not that long ago, non-human identities (NHIs) were governed by neglect; provisioned manually, tied to a cron job or batch script, maybe mentioned in a change ticket, and rarely touched again. No formal lifecycle, no regular reviews, and certainly no clear ownership. If you remembered to rotate the password once a year, you were ahead of the game.</p>



<p>That kind of ad hoc governance may have been tolerable in the on-prem world, but it doesn’t hold up in today’s environments. NHIs now sit at the heart of everything from cloud orchestration to API transactions. They scale faster than humans, act autonomously, and often outnumber user accounts by orders of magnitude.</p>



<p>Modern systems rely on NHIs—workloads, APIs, containers, data pipelines—to function. They’re created and destroyed in seconds. They make privileged requests across systems. And they rarely show up in traditional access review processes.</p>



<p>So who’s responsible for these identities?</p>



 Governance Models for NHIs 



<p>One of my colleagues takes a hardline view of NHI governance: every NHI should have a named human owner, just like every user account. It’s a familiar model, and it works, up to a point. But as infrastructure gets more complex, ownership becomes less about people and more about systems. Since I’m not convinced human ownership always works for NHIs, I wanted to dig a bit deeper. This blog post is the result.</p>



<p>Here are five governance models I think exist in the world, sometimes combined, sometimes purely their own thing. These are more my notes on the subject rather than a narrative post; I’d love your feedback as to any models I might have missed.</p>

 Human Stewardship: One Bot, One Human 



<p>Core idea: Every NHI is assigned a human owner who is responsible for managing its lifecycle and reviewing its access.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An integration with a payroll vendor uses a service account in your HR system. That account is assigned to the Payroll Manager, who gets pinged during quarterly access reviews to confirm it’s still needed and appropriately scoped.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Fits with existing IAM workflows 



 Clear accountability 



 Easier to audit 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Doesn’t scale for environments with thousands of NHIs 



 Owners often approve access by default, without understanding the technical context 



 Orphaned NHIs become a problem when owners leave 
 



 Functional Ownership: Tied to Role, Not Person 



<p>Core idea: Instead of a specific individual, ownership is assigned to a team or function based on operational responsibility.</p>



<p>Example:<br>Your DevOps team owns a CI/CD pipeline that deploys applications. The workload identity used by that pipeline is assigned to “Platform Engineering” in your IAM system or tagging scheme, not to a specific engineer.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Reflects how teams work today 



 Works well for shared tools or infrastructure 



 Reduces the need to reassign identities when staff change 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Diffuses accountability if the team structure is unclear 



 Requires coordination when multiple teams interact with the same identity 



 Less effective when “function” and “ownership” don’t align 
 



 Autonomous Lifecycle: Let the System Handle It 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are provisioned and deprovisioned automatically based on policies and runtime conditions—no human or team is directly assigned.</p>



<p>Example:<br>A containerized function spins up during an event-driven workflow in your payment processing system. It generates a short-lived identity for that execution context, with permissions scoped to the task. When the function completes, the identity is destroyed.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Extremely scalable 



 Limits exposure by minimizing identity lifespan 



 Reduces human error 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Requires robust automation and observability 



 Tougher to audit, especially for compliance 



 Policy misconfigurations can be hard to detect 
 



 GitOps Ownership: The Code Is the Owner 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are defined in code repositories, and the team that owns the repo is responsible for the identity.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An engineering team defines workload identities in Kubernetes YAML files managed through Git. Any changes to identity permissions must go through a pull request. The team that maintains the repository is responsible for keeping identities secure and aligned with policy.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Aligns with DevSecOps and infrastructure-as-code practices 



 Makes governance auditable and version-controlled 



 Scales with engineering workflows 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Repo ownership doesn’t always reflect operational ownership 



 Policies may drift if teams copy or fork configurations 



 Developers may overlook security settings unless guardrails are in place 
 



 Tag-Driven Governance: Metadata Rules Everything 



<p>Core idea: NHIs are governed through tags or labels that define ownership, sensitivity, environment, and other attributes used to drive policy.</p>



<p>Example:<br>An S3 bucket access role is tagged with <code>env=prod</code>, <code>team=data</code>, and <code>owner=email@example.com</code>. IAM automation tools use those tags to apply access restrictions, retention policies, and monitoring rules. When the <code>owner</code> tag changes, alerts are sent for review.</p>



<p>Strengths:</p>



 
 Enables scalable policy enforcement 



 Supports dynamic environments and multi-cloud deployments 



 Works well with automation frameworks like Terraform or Pulumi 
 



<p>Limitations:</p>



 
 Inconsistent tagging undermines policy enforcement 



 Requires disciplined tagging practices across teams 



 Can be bypassed if not integrated with enforcement mechanisms 
 



 Why NHI Governance Matters 



<p>These models aren’t mutually exclusive. Most organizations end up with a mix:</p>



 
 Human ownership for persistent, high-risk identities 



 Functional or Git-based ownership for shared infrastructure 



 Automated governance for ephemeral workloads 



 Tag-driven policies to tie everything together 
 



<p>That said, there’s a reason I’m researching this: non-human identity governance needs to be more strict than human identity governance. That’s not because machines are less trustworthy: it’s because they’re faster, quieter, and far more prolific. A misconfigured workload identity can do a lot of damage before anyone notices.</p>



<p>Think back to the <a href="https://nhimg.org/beyondtrust-breach-causes-major-incident-at-us-treasury">BeyondTrust breach</a>. A single, static API key—tied to an NHI with no clear governance—led to a major incident. The problem wasn’t just the key. It was the absence of lifecycle controls, automation, and ownership.</p>



 Rethinking IAM from the Ground Up 



<p>Managing NHIs well doesn’t just reduce risk. It also gives us a roadmap for what modern IAM could look like—automated, policy-driven, and flexible enough to work across platforms.</p>



<p>Standards like <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/02/03/securing-the-software-supply-chain/">SPICE, WIMSE, and SCITT</a> are laying the foundation for better tools and better governance models. But even without those in place, there’s work we can do now:</p>



 
 Review your NHI inventory 



 Assign ownership or implement tag-based policies and be consistent about it 



 Identify where automation can reduce standing privilege 



 Align NHI access with actual workflows, not ideals

 Early detection of document fraud is key to prevent serious and irreparable business damage. Thankfully, we run regular training sessions to ensure our customers are kept up to date with the latest fraud terms and techniques. 



 



<p>At IDnow, we take the risks posed by document fraud very seriously. The use of forged and fraudulent documents can massively disrupt operations, leading to reputational harm, loss of customer trust and ultimately cost a <a href="https://datadome.co/learning-center/online-fraud-is-costing-your-business-rsa-2023/">business millions in damages</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why our Security Document Examination and Fraud Detection training program, developed in cooperation with multiple law enforcement agencies, from INTERPOL to the Macedonian police, equips our customers with the tools, knowledge, skills and confidence to detect and respond to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/document-fraud/#:~:text=Avoid%20fraud%20risks%20with%20IDnow,99%25%20of%20identity%20documents%20worldwide!">document fraud</a> effectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After all, if there’s one thing that our diverse customer base shares it’s a common interest in enhancing their capabilities to examine and detect fraudulent documents.</p>



 How we help detect the most common forms of document fraud. &nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-documents/">Document verification</a> and authentication are crucial to ensure that submitted documents are a) genuine and b) presented by the rightful holder. However, with thousands of different identity and travel documents in existence, it can be a significant challenge to differentiate between false and genuine documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are four commonly accepted forms of fraudulent documents: counterfeit, forgery, fraudulently used or obtained travel documents and fantasy or camouflage documents. Here, we share how we train our customers to detect each one.&nbsp;</p>



  Counterfeit documents.  



<p>A counterfeit document is an illegally produced document, such as a passport, that is created to deceive or mislead. This type of document is neither legitimately manufactured nor legitimately issued by the recognized authority. Synthetic documents are also considered counterfeit documents. Counterfeiting is illegal and often associated with criminal activities, such as identity theft, fraud and illegal immigration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We train our customers to detect counterfeit documents by examining security features (watermarks, holograms and microprinting) under different light sources like UV lights and using specialized tools, such as magnifiers to check paper quality and texture for printing inconsistencies.</p>



<p>2. Forged documents.</p>



<p>Forgery is a fraudulent alteration of any part of a genuine document. Alterations are only made to certain elements, such as substituting photographs on the bio-page or altering variable data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number). Tampering may include the removal or addition of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forgeries can be detected by looking out for signs of tampering, including disturbed paper fibres or irregular lamination. Other tell-tale signs include inconsistent printing, such as mismatched fonts or disrupted patterns. Of course, the most obvious thing that we train our customers to be on the lookout for are data discrepancies, and photo signature irregularities. The use of UV lights and microscopes are essential, as these can reveal chemical treatments and differences in printing and personalization techniques that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye.</p>



<p>3. Fraudulently used or obtained genuine documents.</p>



<p>Of course, genuine documents can also be obtained fraudulently by using someone else’s personal information to apply for documents or providing false information on applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of a genuine identity document by another person is identity theft. Here, an impostor uses the stolen, found or given identity document of another person without authorization pretending to be that person (also referred to similarity fraud) with the intent to commit crimes in that other person’s name. A person who uses a mask (synthetic mask attack) also falls under the category of identity theft.</p>



<p>Facial morphing refers to the synthesis of two facial images from different individuals. Morphing can fully transform one face into another but when the process is stopped midway, a morph image with a non-existent person, who resembles both people at the same time, will be created. As a result, multiple individuals can use the same document. There is a substantial risk of receiving a morph image when an individual’s photo is submitted to the issuance authority while applying for an ID document, instead of the photo being taken on-site. In this case, the obtained document itself is authentic and genuine, and it is extremely difficult to detect this kind of identity fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We train attendees to express caution when examining documents because even if secure identification documents are genuine, they might have been obtained illegally. For example, criminals often change their name through a legal process and then apply for a new secure identity document to evade detection by law enforcement to cross borders and open bank accounts.</p>



<p>4. Fantasy and camouflage documents.</p>



<p>A fantasy document refers to any security document, such as a passport, issued by a non-recognized state, whereas camouflage document can be a document issued in the name of a country that no longer exists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fantasy documents mask the real identity or nationality of the holder and often bear the names of non-existent or historical nations, or fictitious issuing authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Detecting these documents involves searching for inconsistent components from different document sources. We train how to verify security features against genuine reference specimens and validate document numbers with issuing authorities.</p>



 



Daniela delivers a training session on the use of fraudulent travel documents.



 A collaborative approach. 



<p>Since 2023, IDnow has been delivering Security Document Examination and Fraud Detection training. Our sessions are interactive, practical and adaptable to different industries. They feature multiple modules and practical exercises to hone document examination and fraud detection skills. In doing so, we help strengthen the document verification capabilities of our customers, enabling them to examine and identify fraudulent documents and other types of fraud, including money laundering, deepfakes and money mules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Key components include:&nbsp;</p>



  Hands-on analysis of genuine documents  



  Tools and technologies used in document production  



  Security features verification  



  Classification of fraudulent documents  



  Scenario-based learning to reinforce decision-making skills and detect fraud  



  Up-to-date forgery detection techniques  



<p>Whether delivered in-person or virtually, the training is led by experts with backgrounds in fraud investigation, forensic analysis and law enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As counterfeit travel and ID documents are widely regarded as a major threat to public order, we recommend all our customers to have at least a minimum knowledge and skills for security document examination and fraud detection.</p>



 Beyond training: Building a culture of trust and vigilance. 



<p>While tools and technology help, it’s people who are always the first line of defence. Our goal is to help organizations build a culture of awareness and responsibility, where every employee understands their role in protecting against fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document fraud isn’t going away anytime soon — but with the right training and support, organizations can stay a step ahead. We’re proud to work alongside law enforcement and international organizations to empower our clients with the knowledge and strategies they need to safeguard their operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As fraudulent documents affect every industry, we deliver training sessions to a wide range of customers from financial services, telcos, gambling platforms and many other industries.</p>



<p>For more information on how we work with our customers to shape the future of identity verification, meet regulatory requirements, and anticipate upcoming technological and industry challenges, check out our<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/idnow-customer-advisory-board-clients/"> blog, ‘A collaborative affair: How IDnow works with its customers to innovate and tackle industry challenges.’</a></p>

<blockquote>For more information about the update, please refer to our GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.7.0">https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.7.0</a></blockquote><p>As the worlds of blockchain and artificial intelligence converge, AERGO takes a significant step forward with the release of AERGO 2.7.0, a significant upgrade that quietly marks the protocol’s first native adoption of AI to enhance its core infrastructure.</p><p>While the update includes several critical improvements across security, integration testing, and CI/CD automation, it’s the AI-powered contract source verification that signals a pivotal shift. AERGO is no longer just a blockchain. It’s evolving into an intelligent, self-aware system that’s preparing for the future of autonomous infrastructure.</p> Automated Smart Contract Auditing: Built-in Trust from the Beginning <p>With AERGO 2.7.0, smart contract verification enters a new era. By embedding AI-powered auditing directly into the platform, AERGO ensures contracts are not only deployed faster but with greater confidence in their security and integrity.</p><p>This system proactively scans for inconsistencies, flags suspicious patterns, and verifies that the deployed bytecode matches the source, reducing human error and reinforcing trust across the&nbsp;network.</p><p>It’s the first step toward a future where automated, intelligent auditing becomes the standard for every on-chain contract. This isn’t just a feature update. It’s the first signal of AERGO’s broader roadmap toward AI-assisted governance, automation, and optimization within its blockchain infrastructure.</p> Critical Security&nbsp;Updates <p>Security is non-negotiable. In 2.7.0, several key vulnerabilities were addressed:</p>  Outdated libraries flagged in public CVE reports have been updated to their latest, secure versions.  These patches ensure that nodes running AERGO are better protected against known exploits and maintain a secure runtime environment for both public and private deployments.  <p>It’s a proactive response to an ever-evolving threat landscape and a reminder that security is an ongoing commitment.</p> Smarter Integration Testing for Better Deployments <p>As more enterprise clients and ecosystem partners build on AERGO, the need for reliable test infrastructure becomes paramount.</p><p>With 2.7.0, AERGO introduces:</p>  Backward compatibility testing to ensure seamless&nbsp;upgrades  Refined testing environments for greater&nbsp;accuracy  Improved private chain support to help developers simulate real-world conditions for closed deployments  <p>These improvements help reduce edge-case failures, enhance developer confidence, and ensure that every upgrade fits into existing enterprise workflows.</p> CI/CD Enhancements: From Commit to Deployment, Smarter <p>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the heartbeat of modern software development. AERGO now leverages GitHub Actions to modernize its workflows, improving:</p>  Logging and debugging capabilities  Automation reliability  Testing across genesis configurations for more robust integration scenarios  <p>Together, these changes make the developer experience smoother, faster, and more reliable, which is critical for any protocol seeking to scale responsibly.</p> What’s Next: Building an Intelligent, AI-Ready Blockchain <p>AERGO 2.7.0 is more than just an update. It’s a glimpse into the future. By embedding AI into its infrastructure and refining the way it tests, secures, and deploys code, AERGO is signaling the start of a new chapter: a more intelligent, more automated, and AI-assisted blockchain.</p><p>This release lays the groundwork for deeper AI integrations as the protocol evolves into the backbone of the HPP (House Party Protocol) ecosystem.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to merge AI and blockchain into a unified, high-performance stack for the next era of&nbsp;Web3.</p><blockquote>For more information about the update, please refer to our GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.7.0">https://github.com/aergoio/aergo/releases/tag/v2.7.0</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2-7-0-the-first-ai-driven-leap-toward-smarter-blockchain-infrastructure-2ef1f1f75c8f">AERGO 2.7.0: The First AI-Driven Leap Toward Smarter Blockchain Infrastructure</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.pointsoflight.org/national-volunteer-week/">National Volunteer Week</a> we remind volunteers everywhere how important it is to stay safe while generously giving your time and talents to our communities.</p>



<p>Our advice is to not share your personal contact details with the many organizations, groups and individuals you meet as a volunteer.</p>



<p>Widely sharing personal phone numbers and email addresses puts volunteers at risk of identity theft, fraud, stalking, harassment and other safety concerns.</p>



<p>The safe option is to use <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> to instantly create new, alternative contact information to use with all your volunteering contacts and organizations.</p>



<p>Using MySudo while volunteering online or in person means you instantly create and share dedicated volunteering-only contact details instead of your own personal ones, so that people you meet while volunteering can only contact you professionally and never personally. You don’t expose your personal life in your public role.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo app family</a> also offers <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">data removal</a> from companies and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">VPN</a> (and password manager is coming soon!).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to use MySudo this National Volunteer Week:</p>



 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/#mysudo-dl">Download MySudo</a> for iOS or Android. 



 Set up a dedicated <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a> (a secure and instant digital identity) specifically for all your volunteering activities and emails, calls and messages. Depending on your <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">plan</a>, within that Sudo you’ll set up a secure <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">email</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/3-big-benefits-of-using-the-handles-in-mysudo/">handle</a>, and it’ll come with a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a> and the option for a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-virtual-card/">virtual card</a>, as well. 



 Use your ‘Volunteering Sudo’ phone and email instead of your personal ones every time you fill out forms, sign up for activities, and give your details to the people you meet and help as a volunteer. You keep strangers at arm’s length and prevent your personal email from being added to mailing lists and your personal number from being shared with other volunteers and organizations without your consent.&nbsp; 



 Take advantage of <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encryption</a> on all calls, messages and emails between you and other MySudo users—and get all this secure chat for FREE when you use your Sudo <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a>! 



 Keep your ‘Volunteering Sudo’ especially for all your volunteer activities to stay organized and on top of this important part of your life. 
 



<p>To recap, using MySudo for volunteering means:</p>



 
 Adding a layer of protection and control over your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> and personal safety 



 Maintaining your <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> even while engaging with the public as a volunteer

  <p>I’m Akanksha Bhasin, and I’m all about building community for developers. I come from a developer background, and for over six years, I’ve been building and growing communities for developers. On top of that, I’ve spent the last four years diving into Developer Relations. I’ve had the chance to work with some fast-growing companies, helping them build their communities worldwide. That means getting the word out about emerging tech to developers, organizing significant events and hackathons, speaking at conferences, fostering partnerships, and supporting open-source projects.</p>

<p>My lifelong curiosity, from early science experiments and a fascination with astronomy,  has propelled me into an exciting new orbit: officially becoming an Oktanaut at Okta! 🚀🌠🧑‍🚀</p>

 My journey into the tech world 

<p>My tech journey has been quite a ride! I began by experimenting with various things, including Arduino, different aspects of programming, and building AI applications.</p>

<p>What piqued my interest wasn’t just web development and the scope of AI applications. Back in 2018, when Google Assistant came out, I was fascinated by how voice could fit into our everyday lives, from controlling appliances to using apps, all with your voice! So, I started building Voice AI applications for Google Assistant and Alexa and eventually began teaching what I learned at professional meetups and colleges all over India, which then led to being featured at Google I/O for my work in Voice AI.</p>

<p></p>

 Building developer communities: my passion and journey 

<p>Driven by a passion for community building that began with Voice AI technology, I later founded Women in Voice, India, to empower more women to build careers in tech. Alongside this endeavor, I’ve delivered sessions worldwide, hosted hackathons and events, led Google Developer Groups on my campus, and volunteered to organize the largest DevFests in my region, which gathered 3,000+ developers.</p>

<p>My fondest memory has been in Mumbai, where I got to teach how to build AI applications in areas without much tech awareness and opportunities. Seeing someone’s face light up when they finally understood new technology was priceless and kept me going. Life is about giving back. Even if you have impacted just one person’s life, you have done something priceless.</p>

<p></p>

 Embracing developer advocacy at Okta 

<p>I’m so excited to join the Okta team; it’s a pinch-me moment! I love our principle of “Building a world where identity belongs to you!” Innovation is thriving, and change is here, making this the opportune and crucial moment for security.</p>

<p>Identity security and access management are the shields and the first line of defense for any software. They wrap every API, CLI, and SaaS workload in a magnetic field of strong authentication and privileged access. Without it, a compromised credential can topple an entire software system, just like a small puncture in a spacesuit; the whole mission can fail. With that, security can’t remain a checklist item; instead, security is the foundational layer of every enterprise application. I want to be part of this mission to help independent software vendors (ISVs) and developers secure user identities in their applications!</p>

 Let’s connect! 

<p>When I’m not geeking out about tech, you’ll probably find me dancing or exploring new places and cultures. If you catch me outside with my phone, I’m probably trying to capture a beautiful sky. These simple moments make me feel calm and happy. Connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/akankshabhasin">LinkedIn</a>; I’d love to chat with you!</p>

  We’re introducing a new layer of verification — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check. Additionally, independent organizations can verify accounts directly through our Trusted Verifiers feature.

<p>Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasn’t always given us the tools to know who we’re interacting with or why we should trust them.</p>
<p>In 2023, we launched our first layer of verification: letting individuals and organizations <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">set their domain as their username</a>. Since then, over 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to their website. Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky. At the same time, we've heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.</p>
<p>Now, we’re introducing a new layer — a user-friendly, easily recognizable blue check. Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity.</p>

  
  A verified Bluesky account with a blue check.

 Trusted Verifiers 
<p>Blue checks issued by platforms are just one form of trust. But trust doesn’t come only from the top down; it emerges from relationships, communities, and shared context.</p>
<p>So, we’re also enabling trusted verifiers: organizations that can directly issue blue checks. Trusted verifiers are marked by scalloped blue checks, as shown below.</p>

  
  The New York Times account is a trusted verifier with a scalloped blue check.

<p>For example, the New York Times can now issue blue checks to its journalists directly in the app. Bluesky’s moderation team reviews each verification to ensure authenticity.</p>
<p>When you tap on a verified account's blue check, you’ll see which organizations have granted verification.</p>

  
  Tap on the blue check to see which organization verified the user.

<p>You can also choose to hide verification within the app — navigate to Settings &gt; Moderation &gt; Verification Settings to toggle it off.</p>
 How to Get Verified on Bluesky 
<p>You can self-verify by <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial">setting your domain as your username</a>. We highly encourage official organizations and individuals to do this.</p>
<p>During this initial phase, Bluesky is not accepting direct applications for verification. As this feature stabilizes, we’ll launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.</p>

 Understanding the Role of Face Liveness Verification in Online Security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Welcome to our comprehensive blog, in which we will explore the role of face liveness verification in online security in detail.”</p>
<p>Those days have come when there is a long bunch of cyber criminals everywhere. Due to this, securing online sensitive information and valuable assets has become more important than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you think strong passwords are sufficient for online and offline security, it is a wrong assumption. Especially when it comes to sensitive information of institutions like banks, medical stores, and government institutions.</p>
<p>So, what to do now……</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the astonishing rise of technology has paved the way for us to interact with security and defeat the criminals bravely. Such a gift provided by technology is called face liveness verification.</p>
<p>If you are hearing this term for the first time, this comprehensive blog is for you. In this guide post, we will briefly provide its overview and explain its role in online security in detail.</p>
<p>Don’t miss any single part of this guide…..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Face Liveness Verification? 
<p>Face liveness verification, also known as face liveness detection, is a method of online verification that is implemented by ensuring the actual presence of users. This cutting-edge technology prevents fraud that is often made by using fake images, videos, and documents.</p>
<p>There are two major types of this liveness detection for face recognition:</p>
 
 Active face liveness detection: In this type, users are said to perform specific functions such as blinking, smiling, and rotating their heads for authentication. 
 Passive face liveness detection: This type of liveness detection is done by light reflection and texture analysis. 
 
<p>Once you understand this technology, it’s time to uncover its role in enhancing online security. Let’s proceed to the next section.</p>
<p></p>
 Why Face Liveness Verification Is Crucial For Online Security? 
<p>Read this section carefully, which includes the detailed role of face liveness verification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Prevents Spoofing Attacks 
<p>One of the easiest ways that cybercriminals adopt to manipulate the systems is spoofing. As hinted earlier, for this, they use fake images, videos, and other documents in place of actual persons. This spoofing is done to deceive the system into thinking that real or legitimate users are trying to access the accounts.</p>
<p>However, where there is a <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a>, there is no value in such thefts. We have discussed in the types that this recognition system asks users to perform specific functions that are not exclusive to these fake documents. By using this strategy, they easily distinguish between actual and fake users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Improve User Authentication 
<p>The liveness detection for face recognition enhances users’ authentication, especially in sensitive environments. Basically, these sensitive environments, such as banks, colleges, and universities, can never provide an opportunity for cyber criminals to steal their sensitive data.</p>
<p>Here, once again, face liveness verification plays its pivotal role. Here you will surely ask, how? Well! We can understand this by describing an example:</p>
<p>Let’s suppose a criminal with a fake identity came to your university and asked for the sensitive information of students. They will behave like as if they are a relative of that student. Here, you can easily use liveness detection technology to identify whether they are real or fake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Protects Against Account Takeovers 
<p>Identity theft is an ever-growing issue spreading all over the world. Sometimes, cybercriminals attempt to destroy the systems by using stolen passwords, usernames, and security numbers. Here, the face recognition SDK plays an unbelievable role and prevents fraud in two different ways.</p>
 
 The system can easily distinguish between a fake and a real person with the help of passive face liveness detection. This is done by users’ texture analysis and skin care when they are suspected. 
 The system combines this detection method with traditional authentication methods, such as fingerprint with blood flow, and password with eye retina dilution. 
 
<p></p>
 4. Protection in High-Risk Digital Transactions 
<p>Digital transactions of money have become a normal part of our lives. On the contrary, with this transaction, there are a lot of chances of cyber theft. They can visit banks and other financial institutions with fake IDs and images, and behave as real users.</p>
<p>However, if the bank has implemented the face recognition SDK, the criminals will be reduced to nothing. After all, they can be easily suspected and punished as they deserve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Prevent Fraud in Remote Environments 
<p>Many businesses shift from online to the remote environment. Due to this, online identity verification becomes a key challenge for them. Once again, face liveness verification will come back to back of cyber criminals……</p>
<p>With the rise of video conferencing, telemedicine, and remote transactions, ensuring that the person you are interacting with is authorized. Liveness verification system integrates with these remote platforms, minimizing the risks of online theft and crimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Find Face Liveness Verification Services? 
<p>After reading the importance of face recognition SDK, you will surely want to find such a service. Right? Don’t worry, not only service, but we will provide you with the complete solution that will implement all those things to prevent fraud, discussed in the upper sections. The solution is called <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>A <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credential</a> is a building block of decentralized identity. Think of it as a digital container that seals the information it contains. Attempt to tamper with the information, the seal breaks. Each container is bound to its point of origin, so you always know who issued the information inside. If you trust the issuer, you can trust the information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These qualities make Verifiable Credentials very powerful for sharing information, particularly digital identity information. Simple tech, big benefits</p>
<p>Think about it: a digital identity in a Verifiable Credential is immutable and traceable back to its issuer. This means:</p>
<p>Fraud reduction: The credentials can’t be faked or shared. I can’t borrow your identity or access it by stealing your phone. A Verifiable Credential can be bound to a combination of biometrics and code through device access, digital wallet access and liveness checks. There is also another layer of cryptographic binding between credentials.</p>
<p>There are no passwords to be guessed or hacked and no security questions to guess, no need for multifactor authentication. Even if a credential were to be “phished” or shared with a bad actor, they would not be able to present it as if it were issued to them.</p>
<p>Faster data sharing while reducing integration costs: Any data (within certain size limitations) can be stored this way and shared with anyone with the verifying software. Verifying software is simple to use on a mobile device. There are no database integrations necessary, removing the time, costs, and maintenance typically associated with data sharing.</p>
 Your organization can benefit today 
<p>The most important thing to get started is simply to decide who needs to know what. This translates into who is allowed to issue credentials, who will hold the credentials, and who will need to verify the credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 A few examples: 
<p>Employee access</p>
<p>A company can issue its employees verifiable employment credentials, which the employees can hold and use to provide secure identity information for fast access to buildings and documents they need to work. This provides organization wide Single Sign-On (SSO) and identity management on both an individual and per role basis.</p>
<p>Trade associations</p>
<p>Trade associations can issue Verifiable Credentials to their members for proof of membership, certifications, and other benefit qualifications. Members can provide this information by scanning a QR code, avoiding the need to manage paper documents or searching a database.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric authentication</p>
<p>If you are using biometric authentication, you already have a database full of people’s biometrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Verifiable Credentials, you no longer have the security risk of storing this information in order to verify it. By issuing a biometric in a Verifiable Credential, a person can bring a proof of their own biometrics for authentication and access. All the software has to do is compare the tamper-proof biometric in the credential against the liveness scan. If they match, the person gains access. In addition to radically simplifying security, this solves the problem of deepfakes and other biometric identity fraud for remote access.</p>
<p>None of these examples need anybody’s permission to start using Verifiable Credentials and gaining immediate benefits. Verifiable Credentials are built to be privacy-by-design and enable compliance with current data protection regulations.</p>
 You don’t need to wait for government or digital identity projects to use this technology. 
<p>For example:</p>
<p>You don’t need to wait for the European Union or any other digital identity project to finish deliberations to use this technology. These projects are great —&nbsp;the EU has signalled that decentralized identity is the future and has provided specifications for its single market to start adopting it. But the multi-stakeholder nature of these ventures mean they are lagging behind market implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what do these large government efforts and global identity programs provide? A trusted foundation for new relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frameworks and standards provided by these large efforts simplify the process of identifying new ecosystem partners and participants, which can be a major source of fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’re building multi-credential, multi-protocol, and interoperable solutions that allow you to build at the cutting edge of technology while being able to seamlessly work with less advanced, or slower-to-deploy decentralized identity implementations.</p>
<p>Continuous backward compatibility is the perfect way to maximize competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital world, identity is everything. From logging into enterprise systems to onboarding new customers in finance or healthcare, seamless identity access is critical.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet many organizations still struggle with identity silos: isolated pockets of identity data that don’t talk to each other. These silos cause redundant identity checks, security blind spots, compliance headaches, and user frustration.</p><p>Whether you're running an identity verification platform, managing IAM infrastructure, or building digital onboarding flows, identity silos slow you down. They form when different departments, business units, or legacy systems maintain separate identity records, making it hard to know who’s who across your ecosystem.</p><p>In this blog, we’ll break down what identity silos are, how they form, and why they’re costing you more than you think. We’ll explore their impact across industries like finance and healthcare, and show how verifiable credentials offer a powerful solution to eliminate identity silos—improving security, reducing friction, and restoring trust in digital interactions.</p>

<p>India’s Modi government has launched a mobile app that brings facial biometrics and enhanced privacy controls to its Aadhaar system, the national identity verification service used for everything from accessing public services to booking travel to opening bank accounts. It may also provide important lessons for a growing number of other digital identity initiatives worldwide.</p>
<p>Introduced in limited beta on April 8, the Aadhaar app is just the latest advancement for India’s ambitious Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)—the so-called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2023/11/07/india-has-a-digital-infrastructure-america-needs-one/">India Stack</a>” that has successfully helped boost financial inclusion across this country of 1.4 billion people, spur innovation, and supercharge a digital economy that’s second only to China in its pace of growth, and could soon be valued at <a href="https://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/indias-digital-economy-grows-10-times-races-towards-1-trillion-mark/118777732">$1 trillion.</a></p>
<p>Based on four API-enabled “layers”—identity, documents, payments, and empowerment—building the India Stack began in 2009, and has rapidly become the centerpiece of a digital transformation effort expected to propel India’s overall GDP to <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202404/the-rise-of-digital-public-infrastructure-boosts-india-towards-an-8t-gdp-by-2030">$8 trillion</a> by 2030. But as its latest advancement in digital identity gains the attention of governments racing to catch up, it’s worth noting that India’s technological head-start goes way back—thousands of years, in fact.</p>
 From the Vedas to Aadhaar: A Legacy of Innovation 
<p>Bounded by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast, this South Asian country’s traditions have always strongly embraced advanced technology, and the sanctity of an unalterable identity tied to the social good.</p>
<p>Its ancient Vedic texts and their stories of vimanas (flying chariots), Brahmastra (energy weapons), Ayruvedic medicine, and mathematics have long inspired, when not directly forming the basis for, innovations ranging from nuclear energy to aeronautics to software architecture, network design and more. And its Sanskrit Puranas include tales of King Harishchandra, who staked his identity on an unwavering commitment to truth and righteousness.</p>
<p>Not bad as far as digital age backstories go. Yet even so, India’s digital transformation over the past 16 years has been remarkable. As France’s Institut Montaigne points out, the DPI has pushed India to the top digitalization index of tax collection among emerging market economies. From mega-cities like New Delhi to Mumbai and from rural villages of Himachal Pradesh to Bihar, the DPI is designed to serve the public good and has enabled society-wide transformation in the way India provisions social services. It has also expanded access to education and, increasingly, digital health and agricultural services. At the heart—or rather, the start—of it all: digital identity.</p>
 Digital Identity Forms the ‘Stack’s’ Foundation 
<p>Today, more than 94% of the Indian population has a digital ID. Combined with smartphone penetration topping nearing 50% ,interestingly rural smart phone penetration is over 76%, Institut Montaigne estimates that more than three-quarters of the Indian population over the age of 15 has access to an account at a financial institution or via mobile wallet. In 2006, just 50% of Indian households had such access.</p>
<p>A significant contributor to the DPI’s success can be found in its building-block, or layered, approach, which include three overarching layers:</p>
 Digital Identity (or ‘Presence-less’) Layer 
<p>Aadhaar, which literally means “foundation” in Hindi, formed the Stack’s all-important first layer. In 2009, Aadhaar began as a digital identity card that has been able to provide definitive proof of identity to nearly 1.3 billion citizens—including those in its most remote areas. Each Aadhaar card includes the individual’s name, address, gender, and 12-digital unique identity number, and a photograph, and is backed by a fingerprint and iris biometric. What originally started with the vision of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) to ensure the mass subsidies reached the right hands, today, it is used for everything from accessing government services to travel bookings to banking, and more.</p>
 Digital Documents (or ‘Paperless’) Layer 
<p>Indeed, possession of a verified biometric identity, and the ability to build a financial history, proved to be a game-changer—paving the way for the Digital Public Infrastructure’s second layer: Aadhaar-enabled document storage and sharing. This includes a digital locker (or “DigiLocker” for storing identity documents such as driver’s licenses, academic certificates, and more. Meanwhile, e-Sign and new e-KYC processes simplified access to financial services and ensured access to a basic savings and deposit account, credit, insurance, and a pension. Later, utilities and telecom companies were able to start piggybacking their services through this channel as well.</p>
 Digital Payments (or ‘Cashless’) 
<p>In 2016, the next layer—an instant, real-time mobile payments system called the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) was added, enabling users to transfer funds between two bank accounts, whether for government services, or business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions. By 2023, the UPI had become the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/upi-surpasses-worlds-leading-digital-payments-platforms-with-this-record/articleshow/112949499.cms">world’s largest</a> real-time payments system in transaction volume, eclipsing PayPal, Brazil’s PIX, and even China’s Alipay. Today, 80% of all retail payments in India are made through this payment system. And overall, half the world’s daily <a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/india-s-plan-world-without-cash">digital transactions</a> take place on the UPI. The statistics are staggering for 2024, a 172 billion UPI transactions (~46% growth y-o-y) transferred a total sum of INR 247 lakh crore (~US$ 2.9 Trillion showing a 35% growth y-o-y). Indeed, this Aadhaar-enabled system has been so successful, it’s being <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/aadhaar-draws-interest-as-indonesia-india-sign-mou-on-digital-transformation">offered commercially</a> to other nations as well.</p>
 Empowerment (or ‘Consent’) Layer 
<p>The final layer in the India Stack is a framework designed to give individuals control over their data, ensuring that personal data is only shared when they provide explicit consent. Users can approve, manage, and revoke consent agreements for data sharing with financial, health, and educational services. This “Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture,” or DEP, enables individuals to securely share their financial data with chosen institutions <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/blog/economy-policy/how-india-stacks-aggregator-economics-can-become-a-game-changer-for-market-dynamics-330129.html">through intermediaries</a> called consent managers or Account Aggregators. In addition to reducing fraud due to its integration with Aadhaar, this can potentially enable Account Aggregators to confirm creditworthiness without sharing specific personal information—thus reducing bias.</p>
 Now, There’s an App for That–But Is It Enough? 
<p>The mobile app released in April brings all these layers into the physical world in new ways, making it easier for users to share their <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202504/india-launches-aadhaar-app-with-face-biometric-authentication">Aadhaar ID details</a> digitally, without the need to present physical copies at airports, shops, or hospitals, or hotels where ID details could be stolen or misused. ID verification is completed by scanning a QR code and allowing a <a href="https://organiser.org/2025/04/10/286720/bharat/aadhaar-verification-now-as-simple-as-upi-payment-bharat-govt-unveils-face-id-based-digital-identity-app/">real-time facial scan</a> via their smartphone camera. Just as with online data sharing via the UPI, users can share only the necessary data, giving them more control over their personal information. The app arrives amid the rise of so-called <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/digital-identity-strengthens-super-wallets-transforming-indias-dpi">super wallets</a>—integrating Aadhaar-based identification, facilitating real-time bank transactions by UPI, and securely storing digital credentials. There’s no reason to think biometric identity verification for physical data sharing won’t soon be integrated as well.</p>
<p>But that’s not to say there aren’t challenges. Fraudulent QR codes for parking and other services have been used to scam citizens since the earliest days of the DPI. And just in recent weeks, authorities uncovered a nationwide scam involving fraudulent Aadhaar modifications, counterfeit documents, tampered biometric devices, and a fake Aadhaar portal used to make unauthorized changes to a victim’s Aadhaar information, such changing birthdate, or linking the Aadhaar account to a <a href="https://organiser.org/2025/04/09/286594/bharat/uttar-pradesh-sambhal-police-bust-nationwide-aadhaar-scam-using-fake-biometric-devices-cloned-uidai-portals/">fraudster’s smartphone.</a></p>
<p>India-specific statistics are hard to come by, but globally, this kind of synthetic identity fraud led to as much as <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/10/16/2964004/0/en/TransUnion-Analysis-Finds-Fraud-Costing-Businesses-Equivalent-of-Nearly-7-of-Revenues.html">$3.2 billion</a> in losses worldwide during just the first half of 2024. Incidences of new account fraud using synthetic identity info jumped 18% YOY during the same period—an all-time high. That said, its latest layer has the India Stack headed in the right direction—though it could be even stronger.</p>
 What Should Come Next 
<p>It’s hard to argue with the success of India’s full-throttle embrace of digital identity across its DPI. But there are some easy ways to make it even more powerful and secure.</p>
<p>For example: While the government has launched an unrelated stack called “Vishvasya” as part of an initiative to promote <a href="https://www.globalgovernmentfintech.com/india-launches-vishvasya-blockchain-tech-stack/">blockchain use</a>, the India Stack does not yet use distributed ledger technology. In my view, digital identity’s fullest success can only be achieved through distributed technologies and the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/architectural-advantage/">architectural advantages</a> they offer. This is especially crucial given the country’s layered approach to leveraging digital identity. I believe the consent managers/Account Aggregators within the stack’s Empowerment layer are a step in the right direction—and their blind pass-through of personal information is key.</p>
<p>But distributed technologies hold the promise of a day when someone applying for a loan can choose which personal information to share, instead of opening their entire financial lives to a lender or dealer financing department, on their own—unlocking the Stack’s potential to curb bias and truly enhance financial inclusiveness.</p>
<p>It also means they could one day share third-party trust scores that allow them to demonstrate creditworthiness without revealing any personal information at all—bringing the microbusiness opportunities <a href="https://time.com/4828808/india-biometric-id-system-aadhaar-benefits-women/">afforded to women</a> through Aadhaar-based mobile services to a whole new level, for example. Remote and in-person <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">identity verification</a> and authentication becomes far more secure as well—easily enabling differentiation between legitimate users and imposters hiding behind stolen or synthetic identities.</p>
<p>India’s adoption of liveness tests during authentication through its new app is an excellent first step. Let’s hope its beta is a massive success and it goes into wide release sooner rather than later. But that’s only if they do it right.</p>
<p>To maximize effectiveness, the Indian government should consider adopting global best practices and standards—such as <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a>, <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/cybersecurity/2022/01/white-house-sees-chance-to-design-new-user-experiences-through-zero-trust-strategy/">FIDO2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/iso-30107-3-presentation-attack-detection-confirmation-letters/">ISO/IEC 30107-3</a>—for its digital identity infrastructure and related liveness testing. These can serve as a strong foundation while the country works toward developing its own standards in the future. Only then will they be able to defeat virtually any attempt at identity spoofing. I may be biased, but it seems fitting for a nation with a legacy of technological advances dating back to the Vedas—and I have to believe King Harishchandra would approve.</p>

<p>Meet Alex—a compliance analyst onboarding a new corporate client. The company looks legitimate, but beneficial ownership is often more complex than it appears. With layers of holding companies and indirect stakeholders, missing key details could mean regulatory trouble—or worse. Fortunately, with the right system, Alex’s beneficial ownership reviews can be streamlined, secure, and insightful.</p>



<p></p>



 Alex’s Approach to Beneficial Ownership Reviews 



<p>Instead of hunting through emails and databases, Alex pulls director filings, shareholder lists, and organizational charts automatically from trusted global sources. This gives him an instant overview of the company’s structure and connections—even across multiple jurisdictions. Once the data is collected, Alex focuses on identifying individuals with 25% or more ownership or control. He cross-checks these key players against watchlists, sanctions, and adverse media to flag potential risks early.</p>



<p>To close the loop, Alex compiles findings into an audit-ready report—no manual spreadsheets or patchwork PDFs. With one click, he generates a detailed summary that tracks every step of his review, making audits painless and ensuring regulatory requirements are met. Real-time alerts and built-in compliance checks mean Alex stays proactive, not reactive.</p>



<p></p>



 Key Considerations for Complex Beneficial Ownership 



 
 Trusts, Shells, and Hidden Layers: Ownership isn’t always direct. Many firms use trusts or shell companies to obscure control. A robust compliance platform helps uncover indirect ownership and manage ownership percentages with transparency. 



 Global Variations in Ownership Laws: Each jurisdiction may have different thresholds and definitions for beneficial ownership. Your system should adapt to local regulations while maintaining a unified global view. 



 Dynamic Ownership Changes: Ownership structures evolve due to mergers, investments, and leadership shifts. Continuous monitoring ensures you catch changes that could impact compliance long after onboarding. 
 



<p></p>



 Make Compliance Your Strength 



<p>With iComply, beneficial ownership reviews become an integral part of a smarter, more secure due diligence process. Automating data collection and verification saves time, reduces errors, and keeps your compliance team a step ahead. Ready to transform your approach? Let’s get started.</p>

<p>You may have heard the buzzwords lately—Microcredentials, <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/standards/open-badges">open badges 3.0</a>, verifiable credentials. It can be overwhelming to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the world of credentialing is moving into higher education and you don’t want your institution left behind, so here is your full guide on verifiable credentials (VC) in education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What Are Verifiable Credentials for Higher Education?&nbsp; 



<p>In higher education, <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/reusable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> are secure, digital representations of academic achievements and identity-based records.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities can issue VCs for:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Diplomas&nbsp; 



 Transcripts 



 Course completions 



 Student and Staff IDs 



 Professional certifications 



 And more 
 



<p></p>



<p>These credentials allow students to securely share their achievements with employers, boards, and other institutions without requiring manual verification from the university. By using cryptographic technology, VCs ensure authenticity, prevent fraud, and streamline the verification process, benefiting both students and the institutions that issue them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Digital Credentials vs Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>While the terms digital credentials and verifiable credentials are often used interchangeably, they have some major different in terms of security, verification, and ownership.&nbsp;</p>



 Digital Credentials: Basic Digital Records&nbsp; 



<p>Digital credentials refer to any electronic version of a traditional credential, such as a PDF diploma, an email confirmation of course completion, or a student ID stored in a university portal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While convenient, these credentials:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Lack built-in verification (Employers or institutions must manually verify their authenticity)&nbsp; 



 Are easy to forge (PDFs and digital images can be edited or manipulated) 



 Rely on central databases (Universities must store and confirm credentials, requiring ongoing administrative work)&nbsp; 
 



 Verifiable Credentials: Secure &amp; Tamper-Proof&nbsp; 



<p>Verifiable credentials (VCs) are a more advanced, fraud-resistant version of digital credentials. They are issued using cryptographic security, making them tamper-proof, instantly verifiable, and privacy-focused.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike basic digital credentials, VCs:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Are instantly verifiable (Employers and institutions can check authenticity without contacting the issuing university) 



 Can’t be altered or forged (Cryptographic signatures ensure credentials remain unchanged)&nbsp; 



 Are decentralized (Students own and control their credentials, eliminating reliance on a central database) 
 



<p>VCs provide increased trust and efficiency for all parties involved.</p>



<p>For universities, this means fewer manual transcript requests, fewer third-party verification costs, and reduced administrative burden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For students and alumni, it means the ability to prove academic achievement anytime, anywhere—with no delays, paperwork, or middlemen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because verifiable credentials are built on privacy-by-design principles, they also limit data exposure. Students share only what’s necessary—such as verifying enrollment status or degree completion—without revealing full personal records. This selective disclosure is ideal for both data protection compliance (like GDPR) and enhancing student privacy.</p>



<p>Additionally, VCs are designed to be interoperable and future-ready. A credential issued by a university today can be used across platforms and systems tomorrow, supporting career transitions, further education, and international mobility.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Universities that issue verifiable credentials are positioning themselves as innovators, enhancing student success and streamlining operations with scalable, secure technology.&nbsp;</p>



 Why Universities Are Moving to Verifiable Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>Traditional credentials create inefficiencies and security risks, while verifiable credentials provide a future-proof, automated, and fraud-resistant way to issue academic records. By adopting VCs, universities can streamline verification, reduce costs, and enhance trust for students and employers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But why are universities making this shift now?&nbsp;</p>



 1. Strengthening the University’s Reputation &amp; Trust&nbsp; 



<p>Diploma fraud and fake credentials damage the credibility of academic institutions. By issuing verifiable, fraud-resistant credentials, universities reinforce their reputation as trusted, forward-thinking institutions. Employers and graduate programs can instantly verify a student’s qualifications, eliminating doubts about authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 2. Creating a Better Student &amp; Alumni Experience&nbsp; 



<p>Students and alumni frequently request transcripts, diplomas, and certificates for job applications, further education, or licensing. Verifiable credentials allow universities to provide these documents instantly—saving students time and reducing administrative burdens.&nbsp;</p>



 3. Reducing Administrative Costs &amp; Workload&nbsp; 



<p>Traditional credential issuance and verification are time-consuming and expensive. Universities spend significant resources processing requests, verifying documents, and managing outdated systems. Verifiable credentials automate and streamline these processes, freeing up staff to focus on more strategic initiatives while cutting operational costs.&nbsp;</p>



 4. Enhancing Security &amp; Regulatory Compliance&nbsp; 



<p>Data breaches and identity fraud pose serious risks to educational institutions. Verifiable credentials are privacy-first, encrypted, and compliant with global regulations like GDPR. Unlike centralized databases that are vulnerable to breaches, VCs allow students to control their own data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>



 5. Creating New Revenue Opportunities&nbsp; 



<p>Offering verifiable credentials as a premium service for alumni, employers, and continuing education programs opens new revenue streams for universities. Institutions can monetize digital credentialing services by charging for expedited verification, lifetime credential access, or industry-specific certifications.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Future-Proofing University Credentials&nbsp; 



<p>As industries shift toward digital identity ecosystems, universities that adopt verifiable credentials gain a competitive edge. By providing secure, portable, and instantly verifiable credentials, institutions establish themselves as leaders in innovation while meeting the evolving demands of employers, students, and regulatory bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The Future of Academic Verification&nbsp; 



<p>Issuing verifiable credentials isn’t just about efficiency—it’s about enhancing security, improving the student experience, and strengthening institutional credibility. Universities that embrace this technology reduce costs, improve compliance, and create long-term value for students, alumni, and the broader education ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs makes it easy. We empower institutions to issue secure, tamper-proof verifiable credentials that enhance trust, streamline operations, and deliver a seamless student experience. Whether you’re modernizing your student ID system or enabling alumni to prove their degrees, we’ll help you build the future of digital trust—today.&nbsp;</p>

									  How to Keep Your Cool When Markets Freak   <p>It might have been a boom week in the crypto space. But anyone who’s so much as downloaded the Binance app is just as familiar with the busts.</p>  <p>You can picture it: Bitcoin’s down 14% in two days. Your cousin’s texting a blurry wallet screenshot, yelling, “We’re doomed!” CNBC’s still on about tariffs. And you’re eyeing your portfolio, fearing a dumpster fire.</p>  <p>Welcome to crypto in 2025 — a wild ride that’s not slowing down.</p>  <p>Inflation’s up, consumer confidence is at a 45-year low, and market sentiment’s all over the place. One day you’re king; the next, you’re glued to charts like they’ll save you.</p>  <p>But I’ve seen enough dips to assure you: panic kills your portfolio. So grab a coffee. (Or a Xanax.) Breathe. And let’s talk staying cool when the market’s anything but.</p>   Why Crashes Mess With Your Head   <p>Our brains hate this chaos. A dip hits, cortisol spikes, and you’re one click from selling it all. When prices soar, dopamine makes you feel like a genius, ready to YOLO on a memecoin “Frank” hyped. It’s a cycle that leaves most broke, bald, or both.</p>  <p>Since 2021, I’ve watched my portfolio tank 30% in a week more times than I can count. But I held on, and it always rebounded, often stronger.</p>  <p>The takeaway? Emotions are lousy traders. (Pro tip: know crypto cycles and have an exit plan to avoid holding bags when the bull run fades.) Dips get easier, just another day.</p>  <p>Ignore the noise — talking heads on TV or X shouting FUD or WAGMI. Use your vice of your choice with moderation and stick to your plan.</p>   Tools to Stay Chill   <p>Here’s what keeps me grounded:</p>    <p>Ditch price alerts.&nbsp;They’re like a 2AM “u up” text from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. You’d block him, so you should turn them off.</p>  <p>Set a schedule.&nbsp;Check charts morning and night. Stop doom-scrolling X rumors.</p>  <p>Touch grass.&nbsp;A walk by a river resets your soul. Nature ignores Bitcoin’s dip — that’s calming.</p>  <p>Find your crew.&nbsp;A group chat for the highs and lows saves sanity. Trust me.</p>  <p>Breathe deep.&nbsp;Try 4–7–8: inhale 4 seconds, hold 7, exhale 8. It’s a mental reset.</p>  <p>Write it down.&nbsp;Note why you bought each coin — solid tech, strong team? If nothing’s changed, don’t sell. My sticky note says: “Fundamentals good? Relax.”</p>    <p>These are my lifeline. Steal them, stay sane.</p>   Old-School Wisdom, New-School Game   <p>Marcus Aurelius said: “You have power over your mind,&nbsp;not outside events.” Crypto’s the same. You can’t stop crashes, but you can stop spiraling. Volatility’s just the game. Focus on your strategy, not headlines.</p>  <p>Next dip, breathe, watch your thoughts like clouds, and recall why you’re here. It’s mental yoga, no incense needed. Survive a bull-to-bear cycle, and you’ll have monk-level patience.</p>   Zoom Out, Chill Out   <p>Crypto’s a beast, 2025 included. The best investors stay calm. Pros shrug off 25% drops; newbies panic-sell at the first red candle. Guess who wins?</p>  <p>Try Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). Set a weekly buy, toss in what you can, forget it. No timing dips, no stress — just stack coins and live. I’ve DCA’d since 2021; it’s smoother than playing guru.</p>  <p>So, next crash, ask: Am I panicking, or sticking to the plan? Step back, zoom out. Dips pass. Peace of mind’s the real win.</p>  <p>Text your cousin, “Chill, bro — WAGMI.” Despite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtXiz-MIQR8&amp;t=3s&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">Randi Zuckerberg’s best efforts</a>, we didn’t.

									         Crypto’s Gamer Moment   <p>Genuinely speaking, traditional gaming is still a walled garden where publishers hoard control, servers crash mid-match, and your hard-earned loot is locked in someone else’s ecosystem.</p>  <p>Then there’s decentralized gaming (GameFi) — a player-first revolution built on blockchain rails, where your gear, glory, and game data aren’t just files on a server, but assets you actually own. In decentraland, your inventory is truly yours.</p>  <p>At its core, GameFi swaps centralized servers for distributed ledgers, giving players sovereignty over their identities, inventories, and even the rules of the game. Think Runescape, if you could sell your half-full wine jug for a full-full bag of cold hard cash.</p>  <p>But decentralized gaming isn’t a monolith. Some titles flirt with decentralization through tradable NFTs or governance tokens. Others go full tilt — DAOs, dApps, and no CEO in sight.</p>  <p>So today, we’re breaking the game down to pixels — and sharing the cheat codes.</p>   How It Works   <p>Instead of logging in with a Google account and praying Ubisoft doesn’t revoke your battle pass, you connect your wallet. Your profile is a decentralized identifier (DID). Your fire sword? It’s a semi-fungible token. Your mount? A tradable NFT. Your XP? Maybe it unlocks DAO voting rights.</p>  <p>This isn’t theoretical.&nbsp;<a href="https://illuvium.io/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">Illuvium</a>, for example, rewards players with ILV tokens and lets them catch tradable creatures called illuvials. Solana’s semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) even allow basic gear to evolve into unique, upgradable NFTs — kind of like Pokémon meets RPG gear progression.</p>   Benefits   <p>Decentralized gaming brings four major upgrades to the table:</p>    <p>Security:&nbsp;Game states stored across global nodes = no more save wipes, fewer hacks.</p>  <p>Privacy:&nbsp;Log in with your wallet, not your email. No corporate data leaks.</p>  <p>Ownership:&nbsp;Items, currency, even avatars — all yours to keep, sell, or transfer.</p>  <p>Fairness:&nbsp;DLT-based validation makes cheating harder and transparency easier.</p>    <p>And then there’s the cherry on top: governance. In many games, owning tokens lets players vote on new maps, mechanics, or lore arcs.</p>  <p>Some projects even go full DAO — no dev overlords, just player-powered progress.</p>   Downsides   <p>But let’s not pretend it’s all pixel-perfect.</p>  <p>Despite the promise, decentralized gaming has its pain points:</p>    <p>Scalability:&nbsp;High gas fees and sluggish chains can kill real-time multiplayer vibes.</p>  <p>Interoperability:&nbsp;Items in one game don’t always play nice with others. Ethereum items aren’t cross-compatible with Solana or Hedera unless bridges are built.</p>  <p>UX friction:&nbsp;Wallets, seed phrases, swaps — it’s a lot. Web2 gamers might bounce before onboarding is complete.</p>     What’s Next   <p>Still, the future of GameFi looks anything but AFK (away from keyboard).</p>  <p>With studios like Animoca Brands and Helix building blockchain-native infrastructure , we’re moving toward a world where decentralized doesn’t mean janky. And as big-name publishers keep dropping broken AAA titles at full price, the appetite for player-run alternatives grows stronger.</p>  <p>What decentralized gaming needs now isn’t another pixelated farming sim or half-baked metaverse. It needs polish. It needs scalability. And most importantly, it needs to onboard the next million users without a 12-step tutorial on MetaMask.</p>  <p>TL;DR: It’s still early days for GameFi.

									         Trekking for Precious Sound in a Music Desert   <p>As a reminder that NFTs are more than silly collectible .jpegs —&nbsp;and, in fact, a foundational technology that enables data ownership — I decided to check in on other art forms for which the NFT model makes sense.</p>  <p>Four years ago, in the excitement of the last NFT craze, music NFTs emerged as a vision that was unable to manifest itself faster than the market collapsed. Maybe you’ve heard of platforms like&nbsp;<a href="http://sound.xyz/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">sound.xyz</a>, the OG market leader, or projects like&nbsp;<a href="https://audius.co/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">Audius</a>, which emerged in spite of the depressive bear market.</p>  <p>But I was looking for unsung platforms to bring you tokenized singing.</p>  <p>First, I found&nbsp;<a href="https://playtreks.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">PlayTreks</a>, a music distribution, analytics, and royalty management platform for independent record labels. The roadmap includes a product suit for minting NFTs (supposedly on our beloved Solana&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SOL.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">$SOL.X ( ▲ 5.25% )</a>), as well as what appears to be an entirely separate marketplace streaming platform called The Playgrounds. (Going off the wallet connect options, almost certainly an Ethereum Virtual Machine-based project.)</p>  <p>However, a robust ecosystem it is not. Their token, $<a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x15492208ef531ee413bd24f609846489a082f74c?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">TREKS</a>, hasn’t moved in more than 600 days, and boasts 26 holders. In other words, this admittedly intriguing project probably died during the bear. But that doesn’t mean the vision should. There’s something to be said for stringing the needs of independent record labels and their artists to the digital tools for distribution and promotion with the emerging web3 infrastructure.</p>  <p>Buying music, while archaic now, is a familiar transaction —&nbsp;and one kept frantically alive by starving artists with every small-batch vinyl pressing and Bandcamp Friday. So it’s not hard to envision a future where listeners don’t pay to stream music they own / have collected, but do pay a metered rate to access the media they don’t own. And all of those processes could be best automated by smart contracts managing digital assets, otherwise known as NFTs.</p>  <p>The music on this platform is still live, and I’m sorry to report it didn’t really impress me. I sampled 6 different artists, but was unable to find one I truly liked. So here is one of the most popular titles on the platform, which were somehow all published on the same date — my 28th birthday, October 24, 2022.</p>  <p>Meet&nbsp;<a href="https://theplaygrounds.io/release/63563fa9d6c9e3feea83216a?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">Lucas Reis</a>, whose track “Deserto” offers a mariachi / country crossover catered to a Spanish speaking crowd. It puts me at ease and makes me feel like I’m on the way from the airport to the beach in some tropical destination. I’m sure I’m doing a disservice to the whole thing with my description.</p>  <p>He is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucasreisrbm?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gamer-moment">a small, but active artist</a>&nbsp;worth checking out, and arguably a visionary. He refers to his genre as Breggae.&nbsp;It may not be the type of music&nbsp;I’d&nbsp;pay to stream infinitely, but hey. Breggers can’t be choosers.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>

<p>As CEO of HYPR, I spend a lot of time thinking about the future of identity security. And right now, one of the most significant shifts we're witnessing is driven by the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence. While AI offers incredible potential, it also presents formidable challenges, particularly in the realm of identity verification. The uncomfortable truth is that the era of relying solely on scanning a driver's license or passport to prove someone is who they claim to be is rapidly coming to an end. AI has made forging these documents disturbingly easy, rendering traditional methods dangerously inadequate.</p>  
 How Advanced AI Undermines Traditional Document Checks  
<a></a> 
<p>We've all seen the headlines about generative AI tools like GPT-4o, Midjourney, and others. Their ability to create text, images, and even video from simple prompts is astounding. Unfortunately, this power extends to creating highly convincing counterfeit identity documents. What once required specialized skills, equipment, and significant time can now be achieved by malicious actors in mere minutes.</p> 
<p>This isn't a theoretical future threat; it's happening now. The implications for businesses relying on Know Your Customer (KYC) and employee identity verification processes are immense. From financial institutions onboarding new clients to travel companies verifying passengers, the foundational assumption that a presented document is genuine is crumbling under the weight of AI-driven forgery. This ease of access to sophisticated forgery tools democratizes identity fraud on an unprecedented scale, posing a severe risk to businesses and consumers alike.<br></p> 
 How AI Like GPT-4o Can Effortlessly Create Convincing Fake Passports and IDs  
<p>The alarming reality of AI's forgery capabilities was starkly demonstrated recently in a widely shared <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/musielak_you-can-now-generate-fake-passports-with-activity-7312844061973917698-v_sF?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAABBsJa8Bi7jTW5bovTQMMK-CEDMr2G0peKk">post on LinkedIn by Borys Musielak</a>. He highlighted just how simple and accessible this threat has become.</p> 
<p>As Borys shared, using generative AI capabilities available in models like GPT-4o, it took him a mere five minutes to create a convincing digital replica of his own passport. This wasn't a theoretical exercise; it was a practical demonstration yielding a fake document that, in his assessment, would likely sail through many automated KYC systems currently in use without raising any red flags.</p>  
<p>Borys's conclusion was blunt and accurate: "Photo-based KYC is done. Game over." And he's absolutely right. He further noted, "any verification flow relying on images as 'proof' is now officially obsolete. The same applies to selfies. Static or video, it doesn’t matter. GenAI can fake them too."</p> 
<p>This isn't about spotting blurry, amateurish fakes anymore. We're talking about high-resolution images possessing all the visual hallmarks of genuine documents, generated with frightening speed and ease. To the untrained human eye, and critically, to many legacy automated verification systems, these fakes are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. These systems, often designed to spot layout inconsistencies or basic digital manipulations, are simply not equipped to detect pixel-perfect forgeries created by AI trained on vast datasets of real documents.</p> 
<p>The types of foundational documents now easily counterfeited digitally include:</p> 
  
  Passports: Essential for international travel and high-value transactions.  
  Driver's Licenses: Widely used for domestic identification, age verification, and accessing services.  
  National ID Cards: Key for government services, voting, and proof of citizenship in many countries.  
  Birth Certificates: Often the root document used to obtain other forms of identification.  
  The sheer speed and quality achievable mean fraudsters can generate fake credentials on demand, tailored for specific targets or designed to bypass particular security checks. The core vulnerability lies in the fact that these traditional documents were designed for a pre-digital, pre-AI world. Their security features often rely on physical inspection (holograms, watermarks, special inks) which are completely irrelevant in a purely digital verification process based on submitted images. Visual layout consistency, once a reliable indicator, is now something AI can replicate flawlessly.
<br> 
 The Imminent Obsolescence of Just Using Document-Based Identity Verification  
     
<p>The consequence of this AI-powered forgery capability is stark: traditional, document-centric identity verification is becoming obsolete as a standalone method. Relying solely on a submitted image of an ID, or even pairing it with a selfie (which can also be faked using deepfake technology), is no longer a sufficient security measure.</p> 
<p>Why is this the case?<br></p> 
  
  Perfect Replication: AI can analyze thousands of genuine documents and learn to replicate their structure, fonts, layouts, and subtle visual elements with near-perfect accuracy.  
  Beyond Static Images: The threat isn't limited to document images. AI can generate fake selfies ("deepfakes") and even manipulate video feeds in real-time, fooling liveness checks that require a user to blink or turn their head.  
  Ease of Bypass: Fraudsters armed with these AI-generated fakes can easily circumvent onboarding processes, open fraudulent accounts, launder money, and commit other serious crimes, leaving businesses liable and customers vulnerable.  
  
<p>Continuing down the path of document-only verification is like putting a padlock on a screen door. It looks like security, but it provides no real protection against a determined adversary armed with modern tools. Businesses clinging to these outdated methods are not just failing to stop fraud; they are actively exposing themselves and their legitimate customers to significant financial and reputational risk.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=9b50cee6-bc8a-4f21-93f5-b04103b27804&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Multi-Factor Identity Verification: The Necessary Path Forward  
<p>So, if documents alone are no longer reliable, what's the answer? The solution lies in a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-rise-of-multi-factor-verification">multi-layered, multi-factor approach to identity verification</a>. Instead of relying on a single, forgeable piece of evidence, we must validate multiple, independent factors simultaneously during a single user interaction.</p> 
<p>Think of it like securing a high-value facility. You wouldn't rely solely on a single keycard; you'd incorporate security guards, cameras, biometric scans, and access logs. Similarly, robust identity verification requires multiple signals triangulated together to build confidence in the user's identity. This dramatically increases the complexity and cost for fraudsters, making it exponentially harder to bypass checks using only a fake document.</p> 
 Essential Components of Secure Multi-Factor Verification  
<p>A truly secure multi-factor identity verification process doesn't just ask for more things; it intelligently combines different types of signals. At HYPR, we believe the essential components include:</p> 
  
  User's Device Trust: Is the user interacting from a device (phone, computer) that is known and trusted? Analyzing device integrity, reputation, and security posture provides a critical anchor. Leveraging technologies like passkeys, which bind the user to the device cryptographically, adds a powerful layer.  
  Location &amp; Network Context: Does the user's location (derived from IP address, GPS, network signals) align with expected patterns? Is the network connection suspicious (e.g., coming from a known VPN or proxy associated with fraud)? Contextual data provides vital clues.  
  Advanced ID Document Validation (As One Factor, Not the Only Factor): We remotely analyze submitted document photos using sophisticated digital forensics to detect forgery and cross-reference key information against trusted national databases.&nbsp;  
  Simultaneous Validation &amp; Orchestration: Crucially, these factors must be checked together in a single, orchestrated session. A fraudster might be able to spoof one factor (like location via a VPN) or possess a fake document, but faking a trusted device, a plausible location, and passing advanced document checks all at the same time is significantly more challenging.  
  

This orchestrated, multi-signal approach creates a security posture far stronger than the sum of its parts.
<br> 
 Benefits of Multi-Factor Approach Over Document-Only Verification  
<p>Adopting a modern, multi-factor verification strategy delivers tangible advantages:</p> 
  
  Dramatically Reduced Fraud: Makes it exponentially harder for fraudsters to succeed with only fake documents.  
  Layered Security: Creates multiple barriers; if one factor is compromised, others still stand guard.  
  Enhanced Compliance: Helps meet evolving regulatory requirements that increasingly recognize the limitations of document-only checks.  
  Improved User Experience: Modern solutions can orchestrate these checks seamlessly in the background, often requiring less active user participation than more cumbersome processes.  
  Increased Trust: Demonstrates a commitment to highest security, reassuring users that their identities are being properly protected.  
  
 The Inevitable Path to Verified Digital Identities  
<p>Multi-factor verification is the crucial defense against current threats. But the long-term solution involves moving beyond verifying static documents altogether and embracing verified digital identities.</p> 
<p>Think of a physical wallet containing your driver's license, credit cards, and health insurance card. A digital identity wallet securely stores verified, cryptographically signed digital credentials on your smartphone or device. When you need to prove your identity online, you present the relevant digital credential from your wallet, which can be verified instantly and securely without transmitting unnecessary personal data.<br></p> 
 Flaws in Traditional KYC Processes Across Industries&nbsp;  
<p>The reliance on outdated, document-centric KYC is a systemic vulnerability affecting numerous sectors:</p> 
  
  Banking &amp; Finance: Exposure to account opening fraud, money laundering, and regulatory fines.  
  Insurance: Fraudulent claims, policy inception fraud based on fake identities.  
  Travel &amp; Hospitality: Circumvention of watchlists, booking fraud, non-compliance with passenger verification mandates.  
  Cryptocurrency Exchanges: High susceptibility to money laundering and sanctioned individuals using fake IDs.  
  Gig Economy &amp; Marketplaces: Platform abuse, background check evasion, trust and safety issues.  
  Government Services: Benefits fraud, unauthorized access to citizen services.  
  
<p>In all these areas, the risks of clinging to document-only verification are clear: rampant fraud, regulatory penalties, operational inefficiencies dealing with fraud fallout, and perhaps most damagingly, the erosion of customer trust.</p> 
 Digitally-Verified Identity: The Necessary Evolution of KYC  
<p>The future of <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">secure and user-friendly KYC</a> lies in verified digital identity. Forward-thinking governments and regulatory bodies, like the EU with its eIDAS 2.0 framework and digital identity wallets, are already paving the way. This approach offers a paradigm shift:</p> 
  
  Cryptographically Secure: Identity data is bound to the user and verified using strong cryptography, making forgery virtually impossible.  
  Verifiable Credentials: Users present specific, verified attributes (like "is over 18" or "is a resident of X state") without revealing underlying sensitive data.  
  Interoperable Standards: Built on common standards ensuring compatibility across different services and jurisdictions (e.g., eIDAS, GDPR principles of data minimization).  
  User Control &amp; Privacy: Users control their own identity data within their digital wallets.  
  Seamless Experience: Enables secure, passwordless authentication and instant identity verification, creating a frictionless user journey.  
  Verified digital identity isn't just about better security; it's about creating a more efficient, private, and user-centric digital world. It represents the true evolution of KYC for the digital age.
<br> 
 Choosing the Right Digital Identity Verification Partner  
<p>Transitioning to a modern identity verification strategy requires the right technology partner. As you evaluate solutions, consider these key aspects:</p> 
  
  Multi-Factor Verification: Does the platform incorporate device trust, location context, behavioral signals, and advanced document checks with sophisticated orchestration? Does it have proven fraud detection capabilities against modern threats?  
  Seamless User Experience: How easy is the verification process for legitimate users? Does it work across web and mobile, and for various use cases (onboarding, login, transaction verification)?  
  Compliance &amp; Standards: Does the solution support relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) and emerging digital identity standards?  
  Integration &amp; Flexibility: How easily can the platform integrate with your existing technology stack (via APIs, SDKs)? Can it adapt to your specific risk policies and workflows?  
  Future-Proofing: Does the provider demonstrate a commitment to innovation and staying ahead of evolving threats like AI-driven fraud?  
  
 Stay Ahead of Fraudsters with Multi-Factor, Digital Identity Verification  
<p>The security landscape is shifting beneath our feet. AI-powered tools have democratized sophisticated identity fraud, making traditional document verification methods dangerously inadequate. Waiting to act is no longer an option</p> 
<p>By embracing a multi-factor identity verification strategy, incorporating signals like device trust and location context alongside advanced document checks, businesses can build immediate, robust defenses. Looking ahead, the transition to verified digital identities offers a path to even greater security, privacy, and user convenience.</p>

<p>When we talk about introspection in digital identity, we’re not just talking about what happens in OAuth 2.0. Yes, there’s a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7662">token introspection spec</a>, but this post is about something broader: the idea that platforms—especially browsers—can inspect and influence the identity data being exchanged.</p>



<p>Is that a good thing? Apple and Google disagree on just how much introspection is required. And, unfortunately for my piece of mind, I can definitely see both sides of the argument.</p>



 What Is Introspection in Web Identity? 



<p>In OAuth, introspection allows a system (typically a resource server) to ask a trusted party whether a token is valid and get details like the user, scope, and expiration time.</p>



<p>But the concept of introspection has grown. On the web, it now also means the ability of browsers or platforms to inspect credential requests and responses in order to enforce policy, mediate UX, or protect users.</p>



<p>When a platform introspects, that could mean:</p>



 
 Checking the structure of the credential request 



 Verifying the origin of the Verifier 



 Filtering or transforming claims before they reach the user 



 Blocking requests that don’t meet policy requirements 



 Mediating consent UX on behalf of the user 
 



<p>The question is: how much of that should the browser do by default?</p>



<p>Some say introspection is essential to prevent misuse and protect people. Others argue it creates surveillance risks and makes systems harder to build and scale. Both arguments make valid points, and Apple and Google are not entirely aligned. If you’re expecting a consistent user experience across browsers and mobile platforms, this split is a problem.</p>



 A Quick Aside: Inspection vs. Introspection 



<p>(Because language matters and I needed to look this up myself.)</p>



<p>Inspection is about checking whether something is safe to process, typically by looking at its structure or syntax.<br>Introspection is about understanding what something means and making decisions based on its content.</p>



<p>In digital identity:</p>



 
 Inspection might involve validating that a request is well-formed and doesn’t contain code injection attempts. 



 Introspection would involve analyzing the claims being requested and deciding whether they’re appropriate to show to the user, or even whether the request should be blocked. 
 



<p>To put it another way:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Inspection asks, “Is this safe to handle?”<br>Introspection asks, “What is this trying to do?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That distinction matters, especially when deciding how much power the browser (or any other entity in the system) should have.</p>



 Two Tech Giants, Two Opposing Philosophies 



<p>I don’t think you’ll find these positions formally documented anywhere, but based on conversations I’ve had and observed, it boils down to this: </p>



 
 Apple enforces stricter policies that require any credential request passed from the browser to the OS to be syntactically valid and free from malicious content (which means they need to see that content). 



 Google takes a different approach: validating format but delegating deeper inspection to the wallet itself. That’s similar to how they handle passkeys with external providers. 
 



<p>Both companies agree that the browser, as the user agent, has the right to intervene if it believes a request is actively malicious, but they differ in how proactive the browser should be by default.</p>



<p>These positions ultimately shape APIs, UX flows, and developer expectations across major identity protocols. They even impact regulatory discussions as lawmakers argue about what they most want to protect the user from: Big Tech or everyone else.</p>



<p>(For a closer look at how these differences are shaping actual standards work, including the emerging <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">Digital Credentials API</a> at the W3C, I covered some of the details <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/14/what-is-the-w3c-wicg-digital-identities-project/">in this earlier post</a>.)</p>

 Enter Alice: A Real-World Example of Identity in Action 



<p>We all love Alice; she is the subject of many a tech story! Let’s say Alice goes to vote in a local election. She’s asked to scan a QR code, which opens her phone’s browser. The verifier (e.g., the state election site) sends a request to her digital identity wallet asking for name, age, home address, and proof of citizenship.</p>



<p>The problem? That’s not a single request. It’s really four separate ones. And Alice has more than one credential that could answer each, e.g., a mobile driver’s license and a mobile passport. Who decides which credentials are shown to Alice? Who ensures that the request is legitimate and not asking for too much?</p>



<p>That’s where introspection—by the browser, wallet, or platform—becomes a question of control.</p>



<p>It’s worth pointing out that neither Apple nor Google has said they want the browser to inspect everything or nothing. What they’ve done is adopt different implementation strategies:</p>



 
 Apple enforces stricter content validation between browser and OS. 



 Google favors letting wallets handle most decision-making, as long as requests are well-structured. 
 



<p>Both reserve the right to step in if a request seems actively harmful. But their default assumptions about the browser’s role do differ, and that shapes how developers must design for each environment.</p>



 Should the Browser Mediate or Stand Back? 



<p>If the browser only performs inspection, Alice’s experience might depend entirely on the wallet. That could mean an inconsistent user experience, especially if she has multiple wallets or credentials from different issuers.</p>



<p>If the browser goes further—into introspection—it could help Alice choose appropriate credentials, warn her if a verifier is overreaching, or even block suspect requests.</p>



<p>But that also means the browser has access to more metadata about what’s being requested and how Alice is interacting with verifiers. That’s a privacy concern in itself and ultimately a trade-off each platform has to make.</p>



 What This Means for Digital Identity Developers 



<p>The lack of consensus means that digital identity wallets, verifiers, and browsers are often behaving differently depending on what platform you’re using or developing for. That leads to:</p>



 
 Inconsistent user experiences 



 Confusing or overly technical prompts 



 Incompatibility between ecosystems 
 



<p>These differences are baked into major specs: <a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC)</a> for digital credentials in general and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO 18013-5</a> for mobile driver’s licenses all take a stance on who gets to inspect what.</p>



<p>These aren’t just product design differences—they affect how global standards get written. If the browser is deeply involved, specs like OpenID4VC or ISO 18013 need to account for that. If not, then the wallet has to take full responsibility for consent and UI, which introduces fragmentation risks across platforms.</p>



<p>Developers are caught in the middle, trying to build usable systems that work across platforms with  different requirements.</p>



 TL;DR: What’s at Stake with Introspection? 



 
 For users: Do you want the browser to protect you—or stay out of the way? The answer to that guides what platform provider you choose. 



 For developers: Do you build for Apple-style control or Google-style neutrality? Unfortunately, the answer is probably “both.” You job is complicated. 



 For standards folks: Do your APIs assume the browser mediates—or just observes? You’ll probably have to be more careful to build in feature detection (among other things). 
 



<p>The answers affect more than architecture; they shape the identity experience itself.</p>



 So, Is Introspection the Bug or the Feature? 



<p>In digital identity, introspection can be either.</p>



 
 When done right, it helps prevent overreach, clarify consent, and improve trust. 



 When done poorly, it increases complexity, leaks sensitive data, or just gets in the way. 
 



<p>What’s needed is nuance, which is insanely challenging. Right now, we’re stuck in a binary: inspect everything or inspect nothing.</p>



 What Comes Next? 



<p>Should browsers protect users from overly ambitious verifiers? Or is it time to let wallets and holders take full responsibility?</p>



<p>The question isn’t just technical. It’s political, ethical, and practical. And like so much in identity, it comes down to one thing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who do we trust to protect Alice?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’d love to hear how others are thinking about this. Is there a better path forward? Should introspection evolve or be reined in?</p>

<p>We founded Liminal in 2022 with a radical idea: that the future of intelligence wouldn’t be delivered through static reports or one-size-fits-all dashboards but through real-time, contextual insight embedded directly into the decisions that matter most. That idea led to <a href="https://liminal.co/product/link-core/">Link</a>, our core platform, and a broader vision to transform how leaders in complex and regulated industries navigate change, assess risk, and act confidently.</p>



 Today, I’m thrilled to share that Liminal has raised $8.5 million in Series A funding, led by <a href="https://noromoseley.com/">Noro-Moseley Partners</a>, with participation from early strategic investors and customers who have supported our vision. 



 



&nbsp;$8.5M Series A Funding Fuels Liminal’s Intelligence Platform



 



<p>This milestone is about much more than capital. It validates the market need, the strength of the team, and the urgency of the problem we’re solving. Most importantly, it fuels us to build the next generation of intelligence products that enterprise leaders can’t live without.</p>



 Why Now, Why Liminal? 



<p>Enterprise decision-makers are under more pressure than ever. Go-to-market teams face shrinking budgets and rising complexity. Risk and compliance leaders are overwhelmed by shifting regulations and increasingly creative threat actors. Product and strategy teams are expected to see around corners.</p>



<p>And yet, the tools they rely on are fragmented, slow, and outdated. Static research reports. Siloed dashboards. Intelligence that’s often too late, too shallow, or too generic to be useful.</p>



<p>We believe the answer isn’t “more data.” It’s better intelligence—delivered in real-time, tailored to the task, and embedded directly in workflows.</p>



<p>That’s the future we’re building at Liminal. And this round accelerates that mission.</p>



 Where We’re Going 



<p>With this Series A funding, we’re focused on three core priorities:</p>



 
 Product Innovation: Expanding Link and launching new tools that meet our users where they are. This includes products like <a href="https://liminal.co/product/sales-hub/">Sales Hub</a>, which was launched in March and brings real-time, contextual market and competitive intelligence into the hands of go-to-market teams. 



 Scalable Infrastructure: Building a data pipeline and delivery engine that supports the speed, scale, and specificity our customers demand. 



 Customer Success &amp; Growth: Deepening our partnerships with enterprise clients and growing our advisory, research, and support capabilities to help every customer extract maximum value from our platform. 
 



 What Makes Us Different 



<p>We believe that great intelligence is:</p>



 
 Dynamic: It adapts as the market evolves 



 Granular: It breaks down complexity into its most actionable parts 



 Embedded: It shows up where and when decisions are made 
 



<p>This is why we started by focusing on highly regulated, rapidly shifting domains like cybersecurity, financial crime, fraud prevention, and trust and safety. These are the areas where the cost of bad information is highest and where our platform can deliver immediate value.</p>



<p>Our approach combines human expertise, proprietary data models, and a flexible delivery system that brings intelligence into Slack, Salesforce, product roadmaps, sales playbooks, and executive dashboards—wherever needed.</p>



 A Thank You to the People Who Made This Possible 



<p>We wouldn’t be here without the support of our customers, early investors, partners, and team. To our early adopters, thank you for believing in our mission and pushing us to build something that truly works for you.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>Raising a Series A isn’t the end of the story—it’s the beginning of our next chapter. We’re more energized than ever to push the boundaries of what’s possible in enterprise intelligence.</p>



<p>We’re building Liminal for leaders who can’t afford to wait for answers, teams that need to see what’s changing in real-time, and companies that want to turn complexity into a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>We’re just getting started.</p>



 



<p>Don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to learn more <a href="https://link.liminal.co/">about our platform</a> or what we’re building next. We’d love to hear from you.</p>

 What is Facebook Profile Lock? 



<p>Facebook Profile Lock is a privacy feature that allows users to restrict who can view their profile details. Once you lock your Facebook profile, only your friends can see your posts, pictures, and other personal information. This feature is perfect for protecting your privacy and ensuring that only trusted connections can access your profile.</p>



<p>Locking your Facebook profile can be an excellent way to regain control over your online presence and limit exposure to strangers. This is especially useful if you want to prevent people from snooping around your personal posts and data.</p>


 
 


 5 Key Benefits of Locking Your Facebook Profile 



<p>Locking your Facebook profile isn’t just about privacy – it’s about taking control of what others see. Want to keep your personal info safe and reduce unwanted attention? Here are 5 key benefits that come with locking your profile and making your Facebook experience more secure.</p>



 Enhanced Privacy 



<p>Locking your Facebook profile provides a crucial boost to your privacy. When your profile is locked, only your friends can view the content you share. Strangers or non-friends will no longer be able to access your posts, photos, or personal details, significantly reducing the risk of privacy invasions.</p>



 Control Over Personal Information 



<p>With a locked profile, you are in control of who sees your content. You can restrict access to important posts, photos, and other personal information, ensuring that only trusted friends can view your updates. This gives you peace of mind, knowing that sensitive details stay within your social circle.</p>



 Prevent Profile Scraping 



<p>Locking your Facebook profile is an effective way to protect yourself from identity theft and online harassment. Automated bots and hackers often scrape public profiles for personal details, such as your email address or phone number. A locked profile makes it much harder for these malicious entities to gather your information.</p>



 Security for Sensitive Content 



<p>When you lock your profile, sensitive content like your contact information, relationship status, or any private updates are visible only to your friends. This added layer of security ensures that your personal data remains safe from unwanted attention and unauthorized access.</p>



 Minimized Risk of Targeted Ads 



<p>Locking your profile also reduces the likelihood of being bombarded by targeted ads. Advertisers rely on public data to tailor their campaigns, and with a locked profile, they can no longer access your publicly shared content, making it harder for them to track and target you based on what you post.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH) isn’t just a cryptocurrency – it’s a powerhouse driving innovation in the blockchain space. As ETH continues to evolve, its future is full of exciting possibilities. From Ethereum 2.0 to its dominance in DeFi and NFTs, ETH is shaping the next wave of digital finance. But what can we expect in the coming years? Let’s break down the trends, potential, and predictions for ETH between 2025 and 2031.</p>

 <a href="https://blog.herond.org/discover-what-an-ethereum-etf-is/">What is Ethereum?</a> 



<p>Ethereum isn’t just another cryptocurrency. It’s a decentralized platform that allows developers to create and deploy smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps). Think of it as the backbone of a new internet where transactions can happen without the need for a central authority like a bank. Ethereum (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, after Bitcoin, and it’s constantly evolving with a lot of promise for the future.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin serves mainly as a digital currency, ETH is much more versatile. ETH powers applications across various industries, from finance (through DeFi) to digital art (via NFTs). This flexibility is what makes ETH an essential part of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

 How Does Ethereum Work? 



<p>Ethereum runs on a public blockchain, which records every transaction. It uses smart contracts, self-executing agreements where the terms are directly written into code. No intermediaries are needed—transactions happen directly between users, making processes faster and more secure. These smart contracts have paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi), where users can lend, borrow, and trade without needing traditional financial institutions.</p>



<p>With ETH, users don’t just make payments, but also engage in decentralized applications that can transform industries, all powered by ETH as the native fuel for the network.</p>

 Ethereum Price Predictions for 2025-2031 



<p>Ethereum’s price predictions for the coming years have been widely discussed among experts. The consensus? ETH will likely continue its upward trajectory as blockchain technology becomes more mainstream.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/price-prediction/ethereum">Binance Research</a> forecasts that Ethereum could reach an average price of $6,124.39 by 2025, with the potential to go as high as $7,194.28. Meanwhile, other analysts, like <a href="https://coindataflow.com/en/prediction/ether-fi">CoinDataFlow</a>, believe the price could range from $1,464.20 to $3,496.67 by the end of 2025.</p>



<p>The broader trend? Ethereum will remain a key player in DeFi, NFTs, and various other blockchain applications. As more industries explore decentralized technologies, ETH will likely see greater demand, potentially driving prices to new heights in the next five to ten years.</p>

 Risks and Challenges for Ethereum in the Future 



<p>While Ethereum offers immense potential, it’s not without risks. Understanding these risks will help you make more informed decisions:</p>



 
 Market Volatility: Like any cryptocurrency, ETH is highly volatile. The price can fluctuate significantly, sometimes even in a matter of hours, making it a risky asset for short-term investors. 



 Scalability Issues: Ethereum’s current network struggles with scalability. While the transition to Ethereum 2.0 (moving from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)) will help with this, the technical complexities involved in such a transition could slow down the process. 



 Security Threats: Ethereum’s open-source nature makes it attractive to developers but also vulnerable to hackers. While the network itself is secure, there are always potential risks with smart contracts and decentralized apps. 



 Regulatory Risks: With governments and regulators continuing to define the legal framework around cryptocurrencies, Ethereum and other blockchain platforms may face changing regulations, which could impact its growth or market acceptance. 
 


 
 


 3 Trends of Ethereum’s Future 



<p>Ethereum isn’t static. It’s constantly evolving to meet the demands of an ever-changing digital world. Here are three key trends shaping its future:</p>



 The Growth of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) 



<p>DeFi has taken the blockchain world by storm, and ETH plays a central role in its growth. Ethereum’s decentralized applications allow users to access financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading—all without needing intermediaries like banks. As more users flock to DeFi, ETH will likely see continued growth. In fact, many believe Ethereum could be the backbone of the future global financial system. The accessibility, security, and flexibility of DeFi platforms on Ethereum could revolutionize how financial services are accessed worldwide.</p>



 Transition to Ethereum 2.0 and Performance Improvements 



<p>Ethereum 2.0 is the much-anticipated upgrade designed to tackle the platform’s scalability issues. By transitioning from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS), Ethereum aims to reduce energy consumption, increase transaction speeds, and lower fees. This transition is expected to improve the overall network’s efficiency, helping Ethereum compete with other blockchains like Solana and Binance Smart Chain, which currently offer faster transaction times and lower fees. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade could lead to Ethereum becoming even more mainstream, helping to drive ETH’s adoption and price in the process.</p>



 Growth in the NFT Market 



<p>NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have become one of the hottest trends in the cryptocurrency space, and <a href="https://blog.herond.org/the-rise-of-ethereum-daos-exploring-the-future-of-decentralization/">Ethereum is the platform driving this revolution</a>. From digital art to collectibles and even real estate, ETH powers the vast majority of NFT transactions. As the NFT market continues to grow, Ethereum will remain at the forefront, enabling creators, collectors, and investors to participate in this new digital economy. The future of Ethereum in the NFT space is promising, and its involvement in the market will only continue to expand as the industry matures.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>The future of Ethereum is bright, with ETH expected to remain a dominant force in the blockchain ecosystem. With the growing importance of DeFi, the imminent upgrades of Ethereum 2.0, and the booming NFT market, Ethereum has a strong potential for growth. While challenges such as scalability and market volatility remain, the platform’s ongoing evolution promises to keep it at the center of blockchain innovation.</p>



<p>For investors, ETH continues to be an attractive option due to its vast potential. Staying updated on Ethereum’s price and its latest developments is essential for anyone looking to invest in this space. Whether you’re looking to participate in DeFi, buy NFTs, or simply hold ETH for the long-term, ETH remains one of the most exciting and transformative projects in the world of digital finance.</p>

<p>The world of investing can be overwhelming, especially with so many options and complex strategies out there. If you’re looking for an easier way to get started, mutual funds might just be your ticket to smarter investing. So, what is mutual fund? and how can it help you build wealth? Don’t worry – we’ve got you covered. Let’s break it down in a way that’s simple, clear, and packed with the information you need to get started.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/understanding-mutual-funds-a-simple-explanation/">Understanding Mutual Funds: A Simple Explanation</a></p>



 What is a Mutual Fund? 



<p>Simply put, a mutual fund is a pool of money from various investors that is used to invest in a range of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and other securities. Think of it like a big investment basket, where everyone contributes, and a professional fund manager makes the decisions on what goes in and out of that basket.</p>



<p>Why is this so popular? Because a mutual fund gives you access to a diversified investment portfolio without the need to manage it all by yourself. Whether you’re a beginner or just don’t have the time to dive into the stock market, mutual funds are a great option to get you started.</p>

 How Do Mutual Funds Work? 



<p>When you invest in a mutual fund, you buy shares of that fund. Your money, along with money from other investors, is pooled together and managed by a professional fund manager. The fund manager chooses where to invest based on the fund’s strategy, whether that’s in stocks, bonds, or other types of assets.</p>



<p>The cool part? You don’t have to worry about managing each individual investment. The manager handles that for you, so you can sit back and let the professionals work. The value of your investment will change daily based on the performance of the assets in the fund — this is called the Net Asset Value (NAV).</p>



 5 Common Types of Mutual Funds 



<p>Not all mutual funds are created equal, so here’s a breakdown of the five most common types of funds you can consider:</p>



 
 Stock Funds (Equity Funds): These funds mainly focus on stocks. They can be further divided into growth funds, value funds, and blend funds, each with its own risk and return potential. 



 Bond Funds: These funds invest in bonds, offering more stable income and less risk compared to stocks. They’re a solid choice for conservative investors. 



 Money Market Funds: Low-risk funds that invest in short-term debt like government securities. If you’re looking for stability and a safer bet, this is your go-to. 



 Index Funds: Index funds aim to replicate the performance of a particular market index, like the S&amp;P 500. These funds generally come with lower fees since they’re passively managed. 



 Target-Date Funds: Designed for retirement savings, these funds automatically adjust their asset mix as you get closer to your target retirement date. It’s like setting your investment on autopilot. 
 


 
 


 5 Key Benefits of Investing in Mutual Funds 



<p>Making smart investment choices is crucial, but mutual funds offer a simple way to do so. Here’s why they stand out:</p>



<p>1. Diversification: One of the biggest advantages of mutual funds is that they provide instant diversification. Instead of putting all your money into one stock or bond, you invest in a pool of assets. This reduces the risk of losing everything if one investment doesn’t perform well.</p>



<p>2. Professional Management: You don’t need to be a financial expert to invest in mutual funds. The funds are managed by professionals who make informed investment decisions on your behalf. This saves you time and removes the stress of daily market monitoring.</p>



<p>3. Liquidity: Mutual funds provide flexibility when it comes to buying and selling. Unlike some investments, where you may need to wait for the right time or sell at a loss, mutual funds allow you to sell your shares on any business day.</p>



<p>4. Cost-Effective: Managing your own portfolio of stocks can be expensive, with high transaction fees for each trade. With mutual funds, you pay lower fees, and there’s no need to pay for every buy or sell, making them an affordable option.</p>



<p>5. Accessibility: Mutual funds are easy to get started with and don’t require large sums of money to invest. They’re great for beginners and allow you to start investing with a smaller amount compared to buying individual stocks.</p>


 
 


 4 Common Risks Investing in Mutual Funds 



<p>While mutual funds offer a range of benefits, it’s important to recognize the risks involved. Here are four risks to consider before diving in:</p>



<p>1. Market Risk: Mutual funds are subject to market fluctuations, just like any other investment tied to the stock or bond markets. If the market drops, the value of your fund could follow suit. Even though mutual funds often offer diversification, they can’t fully shield you from broader market downturns, and you might face losses during times of economic instability.</p>



<p>2. Liquidity Risk: While most mutual funds are relatively liquid, certain types—such as bond funds—may take longer to sell, especially during volatile periods. This could be an issue if you need quick access to your money. If the market is down, selling your shares could mean accepting a lower value, which could delay your ability to cash out at a favorable price.</p>



<p>3. Expense Risk: Many mutual funds come with management fees and other costs. These fees, known as the expense ratio, can eat into your returns over time. It’s important to carefully review the expense ratio before committing to a mutual fund, as high fees can significantly impact your long-term growth, especially with actively managed funds.</p>



<p>4. Manager Risk: A mutual fund’s success largely depends on the expertise and decisions of its manager. If the manager makes poor investment choices, the fund’s performance may suffer. Even a well-established fund could experience setbacks if the manager’s strategy doesn’t align with market conditions.</p>



<p>Understanding these risks is key to making informed decisions when investing in mutual funds.</p>


 
 


 4 Expert Tips on How to Choose the Right Mutual Fund 



<p>Choosing the right mutual fund can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be if you follow these expert tips on how to invest in mutual funds effectively:</p>



 Know Your Investment Goals 



<p>Before diving into mutual funds, it’s crucial to define your investment objectives. Are you looking for long-term growth, such as saving for retirement? Or are you aiming for short-term gains? Your goals will determine which type of mutual fund suits you best. For example, a growth fund might be ideal for long-term investors, while money market funds might be more suitable for those seeking stability and liquidity.</p>



 Consider Risk vs. Reward 



<p>Every mutual fund carries a certain level of risk. Some funds, like equity funds, are more volatile and have the potential for higher returns. On the other hand, bond funds and money market funds are typically safer but offer lower returns. Assess your risk tolerance and align it with your investment strategy to ensure you’re comfortable with the potential ups and downs.</p>



 Look at Fees 



<p>Fees can significantly impact your returns over time, especially with actively managed funds. Expense ratios can vary widely, so always check them before investing. Funds with lower fees are often more favorable unless a higher fee is justified by strong performance. Remember, low-cost funds like index funds might be a great option if you want to keep costs down.</p>



 Do Your Research 



<p>Don’t blindly pick a mutual fund. Always review the fund’s performance history, including how it has performed under different market conditions. This will give you insight into how well the fund is managed and how it reacts during periods of volatility. By doing your homework, you can choose a fund that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.</p>



<p>With these expert tips, you’ll be well-equipped to make informed decisions on how to invest in mutual funds and choose the one that’s right for you.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So, what is a mutual fund? It’s a great way to get started with investing, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned investor. Mutual funds offer diversification, professional management, and flexibility, making them a solid choice for many. Of course, like any investment, there are risks involved. But with the right knowledge and strategy, you can make mutual funds work for you. Whether you’re just starting or looking to expand your portfolio, mutual funds are an excellent option for building wealth.&nbsp;</p>

 What Is an Ad-Blocking Browser? 



<p>An ad-blocking browser is exactly what it sounds like- a browser that automatically blocks unwanted ads from showing up while you surf the web. Ads can come in many forms, such as pop-ups, auto-playing videos, and banner ads that disrupt your browsing experience. A good ad-blocking browser eliminates these distractions and gives you a cleaner, safer, and faster online experience. Plus, it keeps your data safe by preventing third-party advertisers from tracking your every move.</p>

 Exploring the Technology Behind the Face Recognition Liveness Detection 
<p>In today’s world, when security is our top priority, face recognition liveness detection has gained much popularity across multiple fields of life. This technology is widely used due to its non-intrusive nature and ease of use.</p>
<p>This technology is used to determine whether the face during authentication is real or fake. It also examined whether the person is physically present or using fake images or videos to manipulate the systems.</p>
<p>Such a technology is considered the top solution to prevent fraud……..</p>
<p>However, it is an interesting question that is often raised by many users: how does this face recognition liveness detection work? What is the actual technology behind this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you also have the same question? If yes, raise your hand and add to the list with those who are going to stay connected with.</p>
<p>So, let’s start…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Face Recognition Liveness Detection is Important? 
<p>We can understand its importance with a lifetime example:</p>
<p>Let’s suppose you are working for a bank institute as an employee, and a person comes to you with someone’s fake images. Here, they can claim to be an account holder. After this claim, they will come to their main point and ask for some sensitive information or perform the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, it’s not time to underestimate the importance of face recognition liveness detection. Without this technology, the fake person will easily manipulate you and cause you to have a big loss. You have to use this technology to determine whether the person who came to you is fake or real.</p>
<p>This system of security is gaining huge popularity across banks, educational institutions, and other financial systems day and night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Face Liveness Detection Works? 
<p>Let’s uncover the main topic of our blog. In this section, we have to explore how liveness detection for face recognition works. Basically, multiple components and technologies contribute to the working of this technology. Below are their descriptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Artificial Intelligence 
<p>We don’t think so, there is no field of life where Artificial Intelligence has not left its impact. Are we saying right? When it comes to liveness detection, AI plays a ground-breaking role. It analyzes facial expressions and behaviours of the person to determine whether the face is fake or real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This liveness detection system uses sophisticated AI algorithms to differentiate between real human users and deepfakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Machine Learning 
<p>Unlike Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning also plays its pivotal role in face recognition liveness detection. Machine Learning algorithms are trained to recognize the subtle patterns and anomalies in facial textures. This feature lets the system identify whether the face is fake or real.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, ML can easily identify the major signs of spoofing attempts that are made to manipulate the systems and cause their downfall by criminals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Action-Based Detection 
<p>After reading this sub-heading, you would have understood the 90% theme of this section. Well! It is good, but there are some concepts about this that need to be explained. As the name suggests, here, users are said to perform some specific actions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sometimes they have to smile, blink their eyes, and even nod their heads. Now, let’s have a very simple question for you: are these motions or actions exclusive to images or videos? It is not at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Blood Flow Detection 
<p>After reading this heading, you may be surprised or laugh that the blood that was used for the DNA test will be used for liveness detection. Actually, liveness detection systems analyze biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here, their main purpose is to monitor the color change that is associated with human blood flow. Sometimes, the same monitoring can also be achieved through their heartbeats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isn’t it funny……</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. 3D Imaging Technology 
<p>Accessing the depth perception is one of the most important aspects of the <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a> system. As hinted previously, fake persons use spoof images and videos to destroy the systems. Here, you may ask, why only 3D image technology?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Basically, 2D images lack the depth information of any person. Due to this, detection systems utilize 3D image recognition technology to identify whether the person is using fake images or is present physically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 6. Color And Texture Analysis 
<p>Liveness detection system enhances biometric identification and improves the system through color and texture analysis. They analyze facial color patterns that are associated with human faces. This approach ensures that the data reflects the actual and real human characteristics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we talk further about this component of facial liveness detection, it is considered the backbone of active liveness detection. If any institute adopts such a strategy, it is impossible to manipulate them by utilizing fake images and other documents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 7. Pupil Dilation Technique 
<p>Do you know how the mobile becomes unlocked when you bring your face in front of it? This is all just because of the retina image of an eye’s pupil. Similarly, when it comes to facial liveness detection systems, the pupil dilation technique is of great importance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Using this technique, some aspects, like changes in pupil size and natural eye movements, are monitored. Such monitoring is useful to differentiate between a fake person with stolen fake videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 “Introducing Our Face Recognition Liveness Detection Solution” 
<p>If you are looking for an innovative solution for face liveness detection, we are here with a possible solution named <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a>.&nbsp;</p>

This technology ensures seamless security across multiple fields and financial and educational institutions.</p>

<p>Join Michael Cichon, CMO at 1Kosmos, and Mike Engle, CSO, as they explore the growing impact of biometric privacy regulations across the U.S. and beyond. Learn how 1Kosmos protects user data through privacy-by-design, decentralized architecture, and secure biometric hashing. Whether you’re a security leader or privacy-conscious consumer, this conversation breaks down what to watch out for when scanning your face or ID online—and how to stay in control.</p>
  
<p></p>
 
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
<p>Well, hello, everybody. Welcome to the 1Kosmos Vlog. This is Michael Cichon. I’m the chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here with Mike Engle, our chief strategy officer. Always good to have you, Mike. Let’s jump right in. I want to talk to you about privacy. 1Kosmos is a identity verification, passwordless authentication company. So obviously, we capture biometrics. We use biometrics of various sorts, fingerprint, face ID, live ID, even getting into some things like iris if the company has that set up.</p>
<p>So a lot of privacy regulations making the news lately. The list’s probably too long to mention here, but Illinois, Texas, New York, probably several others by now, are all passing privacy legislation. Consumers generally seem to be at least, if not concerned, aware that their biometrics are being captured, and they want some degree of control here. So before jumping into 1Kosmos and how we manage privacy, can you talk a little bit about the privacy movement that we’re seeing in the United States and probably, in all likelihood, international, as well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So when Google and Facebook did their thing, they monetized all of us. Right? Get Facebook for free. Get Google for free. Guess what? They’re going to sell your data. There’s been quite a backlash, not only from people who don’t want that to happen, but the states are starting to force data privacy. A big part of data privacy is the biometrics, and it’s one of the most important things. You can sell the fact that I live at 123 Main Street, my social security number, and that’s bad.</p>
<p>You can protect against that. Right? You can move. Your address, by itself, really not too scary, and typically, there’s other controls. But you can’t change your biometrics. Then, the other challenge is once your biometrics are in a system, you don’t know how they’re using them and how they might use them in the future. So these are some of the things that are top of mind for legislators and, really, everybody.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, that is a concern, I mean, just a personal concern. I’ve been online. I’ve had to scan my driver’s license in a couple times, online prescriptions, even advertising, digital advertising now. When you go through the airport, if you want the fast path, you kind of have to scan your credentials. So should I, as a consumer, be concerned about scanning my driver’s license and my likeness into a website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>You should. Yeah. You should be careful where you do it. Trust the entity, and understand the privacy policies. Sometimes, you’re in a rush. You don’t check. Are they storing that driver’s license or your face in a place long term, or is it kind of transient, where they’re going to process it and throw it away, which is what they really should do unless there’s some reason, maybe legal. Right? Banking, they might have to keep it. So that privacy policy and how they’re going to use it in the moment and in the future is really important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>So privacy policy, of course, is important, but we’ve had thousands and thousands of data breaches. So data’s captured and secured until it isn’t. Right? So what are the questions to ask when we start scanning our biometrics into any system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Well, it’s, what are they using it for? Right? That’s the consent part. For example, let’s say you walk into a grocery store, and they have some new face authentication thing, which, it’s getting out there. Right? The Amazon Fresh has palm scanners. Panera Bread does, as well. Chase has this thing called PopID, which is a facial and other types of biometrics that they’re putting into retail. So what if that face could now be used to tell anytime you walk into the store? Would that bother you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>It might.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Right? So that’s the issue, is these entities must say, “We’re just going to use it to make your life easier at the register, and we’re going to take really good care of that face.” In fact, the way we do the technology, this is how 1Kosmos does it, is a way that we don’t even have to store your face in the system, but we can use you walking up to a camera over and over again. Right?</p>
<p>So we have, obviously, our fingerprint, 1Key device, and our face LiveID technology, which doesn’t actually store your face in a way that we can use it a second time without your consent. So that’s the big difference in the two. And so if I told you that, you’d probably have a little more comfort with the solution. Right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>I might. I might. So let’s talk a little bit more about that. What are some of the, if you were, the design considerations or security countermeasures that 1Kosmos puts in place to protect and secure personal identifiable information?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So there’s a couple. There’s the concept of biometric hashing. So imagine you walk up to a terminal, a kiosk, a website, your phone, and at the edge, that face can be turned into a mathematical formula, call it a thousand random numbers that look random and that cannot be reverse engineered into your face. That is where the determination is made as to whether it is you or somebody else. Hashing is a concept that’s been used since the password was almost invented, going way back. It’s really important when you apply it to biometrics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. The 1Kosmos platform is privacy by design. What does that mean?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>It means that the user is always in control of their PII. So if we work with you and verify your identity, or we need to authenticate you into your workstation or a website, we will never have access to your personal data, for example, your driver’s license information, your passport, that face biometric, your fingerprint biometric. We don’t have access to it.</p>
<p>So my head of engineering could not, with all his knowledge, reach into some type of database and get your stuff, period, full stop. That’s the way we’ve designed it. By design, it is private. Now, the only way to access it is if I give you my consent and, really, the private key, which enables that to be leveraged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So in a traditional system, somebody hacks the admin’s credentials. They have the same access the admin has. They can then see what’s in the central files and, I guess, encrypt them, view it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>In our system, if, God forbid, you hacked a developer or a central admin, congratulations, but you’re not going to be able to get any personal data from anybody. Because that admin, that person, by definition, doesn’t have access to it. It’s the whole nature of a distributed ledger. All right. So let’s talk about the practical application of this, then. Now, you have chief information security officers trying to make decisions about passwordless authentication, whether or not to use biometrics. What are some of the considerations that these folks should have when they evaluate the approach they’re going to take to eliminating passwords or strengthening authentication?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. So there’s the design. Right? So we talked about privacy by design. If a face from the authenticating or verifying system ends up anywhere that it can be accessed, it’s a big red flag. There’s been many biometric breaches of recent years, and that, it just opens up a whole host of issues. Then, so let’s say you are, you mentioned a chief information security officer. If they want to allow their employees to log into a Windows workstation with just their face glancing at a camera, much like Windows Hello, but it would work anywhere, they have to make sure that not only the provider, 1Kosmos, doesn’t have access, but they don’t either. Right? That CISO does not want access to faces. They don’t want to be able to click on some button in a system and be able to see them. So the privacy by design is important.</p>
<p>Just as important is consent. So all that means is you have to ask the user for their permission to do the thing that you’re going to do, and that’s what the states have been enacted laws for very aggressively. The most famous state for this type of topic is Illinois with their biometric regulation that they call BIPA, B-I-P-A. They’ve had over 1,400 lawsuits since 2019 suing the biggest companies in the world and companies paying out millions of dollars, because they just didn’t disclose properly. They didn’t say, “Here’s how we’re going to do it. Do I have your permission?” And they used it for a purpose that wasn’t intended.</p>
<p>So it’s really, if you do those two things, make sure you don’t have access. Then, when you do get access, make sure you don’t use it for unintended or undisclosed reasons. You keep yourself out of trouble in general. So we put together some guidance on this. It’s kind of a state-by-state breakdown of how the laws are today, how they’re evolving, some details on the lawsuits that have happened, because by seeing what people have been sued for, it can help you keep out of trouble. Right? I think everybody has to become educated on the topic as they embrace the technology, but there’s a lot of help we can provide along the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So interesting. So to use biometrics in authentication, you can access the data, but you don’t need to control it. If you’re going to access the data, you want to make sure you get user consent, and then, at the end of the day, sounds like the user has ensured that user has sole control of their information. Sounds like a three-step process that maybe makes sense out of the approach to some of these security regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. That’s right. That’s right, and some states are even saying written consent. So that one term, what does that mean, written? You got to go look at the devil in the details of what they mean and maybe what the lawsuits are claiming. Written consent could be as simple as I check, “Yes. It’s okay.” Other times, it may be written. So maybe you avoid biometrics in that one state, which, of course, you can do. You can solve for the 90% and handle the 10% with some edge case solutions, like maybe, then, use an alternate form of authentication. But that’s right. That’s the two ways to get yourself out of trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Awesome. All right. Mike, thank you very much for your time today. This is evolving topic. We might have to come back and revisit it, but appreciate you spending a few minutes with me today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Mike Engle:</p>
 
<p>My pleasure. Hope to see you soon.</p>

<p>MUNICH and LONDON – April 10, 2025 – <a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, is evolving its role in the digital identity landscape, ushering in a new phase of growth centered around trust, security, and future-proofing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where Trust Powers Identity – this phrase encapsulates IDnow’s evolution from a European leader in automated and expert-led identity verification to a forward-thinking, future-proof digital identity ecosystem. This ecosystem not only verifies identities but continuously enriches them, setting a new benchmark for trust and security in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s transformation of its identity approach comes as a strategic response to the fragmented digital identity landscape and the rapidly evolving needs of companies. This evolution strengthens IDnow’s position as a trusted name in fraud prevention and digital identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the rising complexity of global fraud and compliance challenges, industries’ demands go beyond traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) services. Today, true trust requires real-time fraud prevention at multiple touchpoints and as a result, identity verification becomes a proactive defense mechanism rather than a one-time regulatory obligation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trust is more than just an element of customer onboarding. Digital identities must remain secure and compliant in a constantly evolving market environment. Only then can they meet the demands of today’s digital landscape,” explains Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our new vision and strategic repositioning go far beyond traditional identity verification. We are creating an ecosystem where trust is embedded into every interaction, enabling businesses to gain a sustainable, competitive advantage in the global digital economy.”&nbsp;</p>



 Trust as the Foundation of Digital Identity&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow: Where Trust Powers Identity lays a strong foundation for the growth of the company. The key initiatives of this new mission include cementing business operations, streamlining processes, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for automation, and optimizing cost structures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founded in 2014, IDnow has evolved from a startup offering a revolutionary alternative to the PostIdent procedure into a global company. Its continuous adaptability and commitment to raising trust standards provide IDnow’s customers with a clear competitive advantage in the global digital economy.&nbsp;</p>



 A Central Platform for the Next Generation of Identity Verification&nbsp; 



<p>With AMLR and eIDAS 2.0 on the horizon, the digital identity landscape is becoming increasingly complex. In this context, IDnow is a one-stop shop, providing seamless access to electronic identities (eID), digital wallets, trust services, and all existing verification solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow plays a central role in the pan-European digital identity landscape. Its solutions simplify risk management, reduce regulatory complexity, and deliver customer-centric solutions. At the heart of this new vision, IDnow emerges as a key player in the next-generation identity verification ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Positioned for the future&nbsp; 



<p>With this new strategic direction, IDnow specifically addresses the evolving risks that business operating in the global digital economy face today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As cyberattacks grow in both frequency and sophistication, traditional security measures are often reactive and fail to provide the proactive defense needed. By prioritizing real-time fraud prevention and scalable security, IDnow is taking a forward-thinking approach to safeguarding businesses, ensuring that trust is embedded at every stage of the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s strategic shift allows companies to move from reactive to proactive security and implement a strong digital identity ecosystem. This approach, especially in highly regulated industries, creates crucial advantages while simultaneously optimizing the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A paradigm shift is taking place in the digital identity landscape: moving away from one-time verification towards a continuous security process,” summarizes Bodczek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“IDnow is a leading expert in fraud prevention. With our new vision and strategic repositioning, we are redefining what it means to be a leader in digital identity. We are creating a scalable, intelligent trust framework that future-proofs businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He concludes: “We help businesses stay one step ahead of tomorrow’s threats. The comprehensive suite of products in our ecosystem means our customers will benefit from seamless identity verification, real-time fraud protection, and continuous compliance, all while enhancing user experiences and conversion rates.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital-first economy, the financial services industry sits at the intersection of convenience, trust, and risk. The rapid acceleration of digital transformation has unlocked new opportunities for personalized services, frictionless experiences, and global connectivity. However, this shift has also broadened the attack surface for cybercriminals, placing digital identities at the center of a growing crisis. Fraud, identity theft, unauthorized access, and advanced AI-driven deepfake attacks have created significant vulnerabilities that financial service providers cannot ignore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For financial institutions, protecting digital identities is no longer just a cyber-security problem – it’s a strategic imperative. Secure and converged identity and access management (IAM) is critical to safeguarding customer trust, meeting evolving regulatory requirements, and preventing financial and reputational losses. A single breach can cost millions and irreparably damage trust. In fact, 80%1 of financial service organizations have experienced data breaches due to weak authentication, with each incident costing an average of $2 million.2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore the threats to digital identities in financial services and outline the key strategies financial service providers can adopt to protect customer, workforce, and B2B identities.</p>

<p>The role of Chief Information Officer involves managing everything from networking and IT to data systems and cybersecurity, all while technology continues evolving.</p><p>State CIOs are responsible for securing government networks, reams of public data, and public benefits systems, at a moment when advanced state actors have become increasingly aggressive and subtle. Hacking and phishing now regularly impact even <a href="https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FY23-FISMA-Report.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Federal government systems</a>, and state CIOs are expected to fend them off on a public-sector budget. This comes after the COVID-19 pandemic released a broad surge of attacks against benefits systems, such as unemployment assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>These conditions have led to accelerating turnover: nearly half of all state CIOs have been new to the role since 2022, and the median length of a state CIO’s term has declined from 30 months to 23 months over the same period, <a href="https://www.nascio.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Deloitte-NASCIO_Cybersecurity-Study_20024.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">according to a recent study</a> by Deloitte and the National Association for State CIOs.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is there’s a powerful new tool on the CIO’s side that can reliably confirm identities online: <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">verifiable digital credentials</a>.</p><p>Read More: SpruceID’s in-depth <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Introduction to Verifiable Credentials</a>.</p> Digital Identity: A Foundational Layer for Security and Privacy <p>The challenges facing state CIOs can be divided into three categories: ensuring accurate identity on state systems, protecting citizen privacy, and securing government networks.</p><p>Trustworthy digital identity has many benefits, but above all, it has become arguably the most important factor in cybersecurity. According to Crowdstrike, more cyberattacks now rely on <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">the theft of valid identity credentials</a> to compromise systems than malware.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable digital credentials are designed to mitigate these threats at their root. The cryptographic signature that validates a VDC is embedded in the phone’s secure element—a hardware-based vault specifically built to resist tampering. Extracting it is not just extremely difficult and costly; it’s practically infeasible with today’s technology. And even in the unlikely event of compromise, the credential is cryptographically bound to the device, rendering it useless anywhere else.</p><p>Identity fraud of a different sort can undermine state unemployment insurance programs or other benefits. Improper state UI payments, including fraudulent payments, ranged <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/unemployment-insurance-payment-accuracy?ref=blog.spruceid.com#NC">from 7% to as high as 25%</a> from July 2021 to June 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. </p><p>Much of this is enabled because of the transition to online services, where stolen or “synthetic” identities can pass through some systems undetected. Identity credentials built for digital trust, such as the Mobile Driver’s License (mDL), can reliably prove a holder’s identity and residency over the internet, presenting one path to mitigating fraudulent claims.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, digital identity can increase the privacy of state residents by reducing the amount of data being transmitted, thanks to a mechanism known as <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selective disclosure</a>. That means mDL adoption can prevent state agencies from becoming unwitting <a href="https://nordvpn.com/blog/data-hoarding/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">data hoarders</a>. This creates an even more virtuous cycle because less identity data is available to steal, which means hackers have less raw material for impersonating real people.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Privacy-protecting identity verification</a></p> Digital Credentials for Next-Generation Access Control <p>The goal of most network compromises and phishing attacks is to steal data that can be used in other malicious ways. Usually, that’s personal data that can be used for identity theft – and a state’s records are something like a hacker’s Holy Grail. That’s why CIOs <a href="https://www.nascio.org/resource-center/resources/2024-deloitte-nascio-cybersecurity-study/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">polled by NASCIO in 2024</a> said their second-highest priority was preventing bad actors from accessing data-rich systems.</p><p>A big part of the problem is that state intranets managing this data still often rely on password-centric identity and access control. This makes them vulnerable to phishing – manipulative “social engineering” that tricks humans into entering a password or other data into a fake portal, handing them over to an attacker. Those attacks have been massively accelerated by the availability of generative AI, which enables <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/ai-generated-phishing-emails-are-getting-very-good-at-targeting-executives/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">massive scale and “hyper-personalization”</a> that make phishing more effective.</p><p>As with public-facing applications, VDCs have the potential to massively undercut phishing attacks on state workers and systems by replacing passwords and other “knowledge-based” access controls with <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">cryptographic signatures</a>. The use of digital credentials for log-on and access control is still nascent but could either leverage public VDCs like mobile driver’s licenses or use different employee credentials issued by agencies or departments.</p> Large Scale, Low Cost <p>Device-tied access control systems are nothing new, of course – random-number keyfobs and similar solutions have been widespread in defense and other sensitive settings for decades. The deeper advantage of VDCs is that they can provide similar assurances at a much, much lower per-user issuance cost.</p><p>First, that’s because VDCs don’t require additional specialized hardware, instead leveraging the smartphones that state workers already have. Second, a mobile driver’s license issued by your state’s DMV will be sufficient added security for many roles, and those will come at little or no added cost to state offices.</p><p>Before long, new state employees will simply arrive on their first day with digital credentials in hand. Nearly 6 million Americans already have mobile driver’s licenses, early adoption driven by the simple convenience of leaving behind <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/06/technology/personaltech/mobile-wallet-app.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">an old-school paper-stuffed wallet</a>. Those first 6 million adopters are from about a dozen U.S. states that already have mDL programs up and running, and the number stands to skyrocket as more states come online.&nbsp;</p> Interoperability Without Lock-In <p>The open, interoperable, and standards-based nature of VDCs has other advantages compared to older purpose-built identity systems. Much like the World Wide Web can be read through many different browsers, a growing ecosystem of vendors can provision VDCs to the same standard. That competition will help keep costs down, whether for issuing more specialized credentials or building the front-end systems to accept and validate VDCs.</p><p>Maybe even more important, though, is that an open-source system prevents vendor lock-in. Whether credential issuance or systems-level work, the basic plumbing of VDCs is universal and interoperable. If anything goes wrong with one vendor, another team can easily pick up the ball and run with it. Signing up for the added security of digital credentials doesn’t mean being dependent long-term on any specific team.</p><p>Now is the time to start thinking about the potential for digital credentials in your state’s cybersecurity stance.

 IDnow is evolving from a pioneering video identification provider into a leader in digital identity trust. Here, we explain why. 



<p>In today’s hyper-connected, digital-first world, trust is no longer a luxury – it’s a necessity. Identity is the cornerstone of all online interactions, transactions and relationships. But in an era where digital identities are fragmented, evolving and increasingly under threat, how can businesses create a trust ecosystem that is both secure and scalable?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our transformation into a leader in digital identity trust reflects our deep commitment to meeting the ever-growing demand for robust, adaptive and intelligent trust solutions in a rapidly changing landscape.</p>



 Why trust needs to power identity. 



<p>In the past, identity verification was often seen as a one-time check – a necessary but static process. Today, it’s no longer enough to simply verify someone’s identity at the point of entry. With evolving threats, increased regulatory pressures and the constant need for frictionless customer experiences, trust must be continuous, dynamic and scalable. This shift in perspective is not just a response to market demand; it’s a recognition that businesses that embrace trust as a cornerstone of their identity systems will not only survive — they will thrive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023, the amount lost to fraud scams and brank fraud scams totalled <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/newsroom/blog/financial-crime-is-crippling-the-global-economy-breakthrough-identity-tech-is-leading-the-fightback">$485 billion</a>, highlighting the urgent need for real-time fraud prevention and continuous trust management. Fraud risks are not just threats to business revenue — they undermine consumer confidence, erode brand integrity and disrupt long-term relationships. This is why we believe that trust must power identity throughout the customer journey, from onboarding to every subsequent interaction.</p>



 A new approach: Continuous, scalable and intelligent trust. 



<p>As the market evolves, businesses today require more than just verification — they demand continuous, scalable and intelligent trust solutions that are agile enough to meet regulatory changes, combat emerging fraud risks and elevate customer experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our mission at IDnow is clear: we are not just a service provider; we are a trusted orchestrator of identity solutions. Our AI-driven, SaaS-based platform enables businesses to confidently navigate the complexities of the digital world. Whether it’s seamless identity verification, real-time fraud prevention, or adaptive compliance, we ensure that trust is integrated into every transaction, every interaction, every moment.</p>

 Trust in action: A competitive advantage. 



<p>The demand for frictionless identity verification has never been higher. Customers expect fast, effortless experiences without compromising security. Yet, in today’s digital economy, businesses cannot afford to overlook security for the sake of convenience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where trust becomes a competitive advantage. Without it, customers will look elsewhere. In fact, according to <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/improving-account-opening-process-in-retail-banking.html?icid=dcom_promo_standard%7Cus;en">Deloitte, 38% of new customers</a> are prepared to abandon the account opening stage if the process takes too long. &nbsp;</p>



<p>By embedding trust into every interaction, businesses not only improve conversions and enhance customer loyalty — they protect their operations from evolving threats, stay ahead of regulatory pressures and foster long-term relationships built on confidence. Trust is no longer a “nice-to-have”; it is a key differentiator in a crowded marketplace.</p>



 IDnow: The gateway to a secure digital trust ecosystem. 



<p>As EU’s new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR) and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/eidas-2-0-simple-update-fundamental-change/">eIDAS 2.0</a> continue to reshape the digital identity landscape, businesses face increasing complexity. The digital identity ecosystem is fragmented, with a myriad of platforms, devices and services that make it challenging for organizations to keep up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow is the key to unlocking a secure digital trust ecosystem. Our platform provides seamless access to eIDs, digital wallets, Trust Services, and verification solutions — all backed by cutting-edge, real-time risk intelligence. With IDnow, businesses can simplify complex risk management, combat fraud with precision and stay ahead of regulatory complexity, all while delivering trusted, customer-centric experiences that are designed to scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This holistic approach ensures that businesses are equipped not only to meet current demands but to adapt to the future of digital commerce — where security, compliance and customer trust are paramount.</p>



 The next level of KYC: Beyond verification. 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> used to be the standard for verifying identities. But in today’s fast-paced, digital-first environment, it is no longer enough. It’s not just about confirming a customer’s identity once — it’s about continuously validating trust throughout the customer journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With IDnow, businesses gain real-time fraud prevention capabilities that go beyond traditional KYC processes. From detecting synthetic identities and deepfakes to monitoring behavior and transaction patterns in real time, our platform provides continuous trust monitoring that adapts to emerging fraud risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our AI-powered risk intelligence doesn’t just stop at onboarding — it continuously analyzes behavioral and transactional signals to identify potential fraud threats, such as APP scams and money mule activity. This ongoing vigilance ensures that trust is never static but rather needs to evolve to meet the changing landscape of digital threats.</p>



 Building a resilient future with trust. 



<p>In an increasingly fragmented digital identity landscape, businesses that prioritize trust will always have an edge. Trust is no longer just about preventing fraud; it’s about building resilient, long-term relationships that allow businesses to adapt and grow in the face of new challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow equips businesses with the tools to not only mitigate risks but to thrive in a world where trust is the ultimate differentiator. As we look ahead to the future of digital identity, one thing is clear: trust will power every successful business strategy, every seamless transaction and every lasting customer relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we are proud to lead the way in shaping the future of digital identity. Together, we can build a world where trust isn’t just a goal — it’s the foundation of everything we do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Biometrics for identity verification have spread rapidly over the past few years making authentication fast and convenient. But a confluence of challenges, not least the arrival of deepfakes, means it’s time for biometric authentication to evolve. The good news is that with Indicio Proven’s “Bring Your Own Biometrics” (BYOB), it’s easy, it won’t cost the earth, and it will significantly enhance how biometrics are used and expand what they can be used for, benefiting everyone.</p>
<p>Here are three ways BYOB powers Bio.</p>
 1. Lack of integrated biographic data reduces efficiency 
<p>A biometric scan is a quick and seemingly reliable way to confirm that someone’s face, fingerprint, iris, retina, or voice match a record in a database. But without biographic data, this verification lacks context. Organizations must manually cross-check biometric results with separate records and information about the person, slowing down authentication processes and increasing the risk of mismatches.</p>
<p>For example, if a company uses facial recognition for secure facility access but does not integrate biographic data, employees may face unnecessary delays due to system errors or lack of context about their access rights.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven and BYOB solve this by giving organizations the ability to add a biometric template to a Verifiable Credential. This means that after, say, the identity assurance process for employee onboarding, that employee can hold their biometric data on their mobile device in a way that makes the information tamper-proof and easily shareable for verification, anywhere at any time.</p>
<p>The verifying party can be certain about the identity of the organization that issued the template —&nbsp;the employer, for example, can know that it issued the template —&nbsp;and that the template has been bound to the identity of the person its data describes.</p>
<p>This simplifies biometric security because, now, the employer doesn’t have to store employee biometrics in order to verify the identity of its employees, and it also enables the employer to add other useful information about the employee to the biometric credential, such as which systems or facilities they have access to.</p>
<p>For example, you could configure least privileged remote access to a network with biometric authentication and do so in a way that avoids the risk of generative AI biometric identity fraud, as each liveness check would require the simultaneous presentation of an authenticated biometric from a credential.</p>
 2. Simplifying compliance with GDPR, advancing eIDAS 
<p>Biometrics are a special category of personal data under the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which means that biometric data can only be processed under specific conditions, where there is a legal obligation or public interest.</p>
<p>At the same time, biometrics are increasingly being used for formal identity purposes, particularly around payments and travel, but neither <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS,</a> the EU’s digital identity framework, nor <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eudi-regulation">EUDI</a>, the European Digital Identity regulation for an EU digital wallet cover these biometric credential and wallet-based use cases.</p>
<p>This is where Indicio Proven’s BYOB provides a model for meeting GDPR on biometric security —&nbsp;and a model for implementing portable biometric digital identity in EUDI.</p>
<p>Under GDPR, biometric data must be encrypted at rest and in transit, “ensuring,” as noted by the EU’s <a href="https://www.gdprregister.eu/gdpr/biometric-data-gdpr/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20organizations%20can%20store,the%20specific%20purpose%20at%20hand.">GDPR Register</a>, “that even if data is accessed by unauthorized parties, it remains unreadable.”</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven BYOB, the person is issued an encrypted biometric template to store in their digital wallet. This data doesn’t need to be stored by anyone else in order to be cryptographically verified. This removes a critical security weakness in biometric processing — storing biometric data in a database to process it. And if it doesn’t need to be stored, it can’t accessed by any unauthorized person.</p>
<p>The significance of BYOB to eIDAS and EUDI is that it opens a seamless, secure route to using biometrics for a much wider range of authentication purposes. If a liveness check must be accompanied by an authenticated biometric presentation from a credential, you have a simple way to apply the highest level of authentication for any kind of access. There’s no need to store biometric data because processing maximizes data minimization; and because a liveness check must be backed by a BYOB presentation, the subject must explicitly consent to the processing.</p>
<p>All of this is quick and easily auditable.</p>
<p>And —&nbsp;as in the first section —&nbsp;you can add and bind lots of useful information to a biometric authentication.</p>
<p>BYOB is the most efficient way for eIDAS and EUDI to meet the market needs of biometrics and GDPR.</p>
 3. “Fake you” broke the law 
<p>Biometric systems are often marketed as precise when they are probabilistic. We know they can produce false positives —&nbsp;they can misidentify people. Similarly, they can produce false negatives —&nbsp;they fail to identify people. The US National Institutes of Standards and Technology has set benchmarks for accurate identification at one error per hundred thousand tests; one expert says the <a href="https://securitybrief.com.au/story/the-problem-with-biometrics-and-the-key-things-to-consider">reality</a> is more than one error per hundred, depending on the system.</p>
<p>Biometrics can be spoofed. From stealing fingerprints to using a photo to fake a liveness check to using generative AI to create “deepfake” audio and images. There’s an authentication-biometric fraud arms race.</p>
<p>Biometrics systems are also at risk of bias either from technical limitations in recording the biometric (such as registering skin tones) or from the way the biometric data might be analyzed and processed, especially from AI. Some people do not have fingerprints, or have spent years working jobs where their fingerprints have worn down. Wearing glasses may decrease the accuracy of biometric scans; disability may prevent using biometric systems altogether. There are a multitude of sensitive and potentially discriminatory issues around implementation.</p>
<p>BYOB solves all these problems by providing a fully portable way to cross check a biometric scan AND provide contextual information around the person’s identity —&nbsp;all in a secure, privacy-preserving way that’s easy to implement and easy for everyone to use.</p>
 Indicio’s BYOB = biometrics 2.0 
<p>Biometric authentication is convenient and powerful and people want to be able to trust it and use it— but it’s still flip phone tech for a smart phone era. With Indicio Proven BYOB, we’re taking biometrics to the next level, one where biometrics can be used more widely and more usefully and more securely than current systems can possibly deliver.</p>

 Protecting Digital Identity in the Web3 Era 



<p>Every 39 seconds, a cyberattack strikes. Ransomware drains billions, while stolen identities fuel a $3 trillion shadow economy. Yet, our defenses—passwords, centralized databases—remain stuck in the past. Web3 changes the game with&nbsp;Verifiable Credentials (VCs)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), tools that put control back in users’ hands. No more single points of failure. No more endless data leaks. This isn’t just security—it’s digital sovereignty. In this article, discover how <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/verifiable-credentials-vcs/" title="">VCs </a>and <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/decentralized-identifiers-dids/" title="DIDs ">DIDs </a>are slashing fraud, simplifying compliance, and safeguarding industries from healthcare to finance. </p>



<p>Plus, see how Extrimian’s plug-and-play solutions help organizations ditch outdated systems and embrace self-sovereign identity—today. Ready to turn vulnerability into strength? Let’s begin.</p>



Essential Cybersecurity Tips&nbsp;for digital data



 



 1: The Current Crisis in Digital Identity and Cybersecurity Risks 



 Data Breaches and Their Economic Impact 



<p>In 2023, the average cost of a data breach soared to a staggering $4.45 million, a 15% increase over three years, according to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report. These breaches aren’t just about stolen credit cards—they erode customer trust, trigger regulatory fines, and cripple business operations. For instance, the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack disrupted fuel supply across the U.S. East Coast, costing millions in recovery and reputational damage.</p>



 The Limitations of Traditional Centralized Systems 



<p>Centralized identity systems—like passwords and government-issued IDs—are inherently fragile. They create single points of failure. When a major credit bureau was hacked in 2017, it exposed the Social Security numbers of 147 million people. Why? Because centralized databases are goldmines for hackers. Worse, users have no control over how their data is stored or shared.</p>



<p>The digital identity crisis isn’t slowing down. Hackers exploit outdated systems, while users juggle dozens of easily guessable passwords. But what if there were a way to eliminate centralized databases entirely? Enter decentralized identity solutions, which shift control back to users and organizations. By 2026, Gartner predicts that 30% of enterprises will adopt decentralized identity tools to mitigate these risks. The question isn’t if your organization should transition—it’s when.</p>



 



 2: What Are Verifiable Credentials and Why Are They Essential for Web3? 



 Technical Definition and Components 



<p><br>Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are digital proofs—like diplomas, licenses, or certifications—that are cryptographically secured. They consist of three roles:</p>



 
 Issuer (e.g., a university granting a degree). 



 Holder (e.g., a job seeker storing the credential in a digital wallet). 



 Verifier (e.g., an employer validating the degree’s authenticity). 
 



 How Issuing and Verification Processes Work 



<p>Imagine a hospital issuing a nurse’s license as a VC. The credential is signed with the hospital’s private key and stored in the nurse’s wallet. When applying for a job, the nurse shares only the credential—not their Social Security number or address. The employer verifies it instantly via blockchain, ensuring it’s unaltered and legit.</p>



<p>VCs are game-changers for Web3. They’re interoperable (usable across platforms), portable (controlled by the user), and tamper-proof. For example, Extrimian’s VC platform helped a European healthcare network cut credential fraud by 90% by replacing paper-based records with blockchain-anchored digital licenses. In a world drowning in fake diplomas and deepfakes, VCs are the antidote.</p>



 



 3: DIDs: The Foundation of Decentralized Identity (SSI) 



 What Are Decentralized Identifiers? 



<p> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are user-owned, blockchain-based IDs that act as the backbone of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Unlike email addresses or usernames, DIDs aren’t tied to corporations or governments. Think of them as self-owned digital passports—no third party can revoke or censor them.</p>



<p>DIDs vs. Traditional Identifiers</p>



Traditional IDsDIDsControlled by issuers (e.g., Google)Owned by the userProne to data leaksEncrypted and decentralizedRequire constant reauthenticationPersistent and reusable



<p>Extrimian leverages W3C-standard DIDs, enabling seamless integration with platforms like Algorand for lightning-fast verification. A DID might look like did:algorand:123xyz, resolvable via blockchain to confirm its authenticity. This eliminates reliance on vulnerable central authorities—a leap toward true digital sovereignty.</p>



 



 4: Combining Verifiable Credentials and DIDs: A Shield Against Cyberattacks 



 Combatting Phishing and Identity Spoofing 



<p>Phishing attacks account for 36% of data breaches. But with VCs and DIDs, users prove their identity without revealing sensitive data. For example, logging into a bank app with a DID-linked VC means no passwords to steal. Even if a hacker intercepts the credential, it’s cryptographically useless without the user’s private key.</p>



 Reducing Attack Surfaces with Encryption 



<p>VCs use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), allowing users to share only necessary information. Need to confirm you’re over 21? A VC can prove your age without disclosing your birthdate. Extrimian’s solutions employ quantum-resistant encryption, ensuring credentials remain secure even against future threats.</p>



<p>Picture a supply chain where every supplier’s license is a VC tied to a DID. Tampering becomes impossible, and audits take minutes instead of weeks. After adopting Extrimian’s framework, a logistics firm reduced compliance costs by 40% and breach-related downtime by 75%.</p>



 



 5: Business Benefits Beyond Cybersecurity 



 Cost Savings in Identity Management 



<p>Manual identity checks drain resources. A Fortune 500 company reported spending $3 million annually on password resets alone. With Extrimian’s automated VC issuance, businesses slash IT costs by up to 60% and accelerate onboarding.</p>



 Compliance and Brand Reputation 



<p>GDPR fines hit €1.6 billion in 2023. VCs simplify compliance by design—data is minimalized and user-consent-driven. A fintech client using Extrimian achieved eIDAS compliance in 3 months, boosting customer trust and EU market access.</p>



<p>Beyond savings, VCs future-proof your business. A Forrester study found SSI adopters see 200% ROI within two years through fraud reduction and operational efficiency.</p>



 



 6: Success Stories: Universities, Banking, and Governments 



 Tamper-Proof Academic Credentials 



<p>MIT now issues digital diplomas as VCs. Graduates share them instantly with employers, eliminating verification delays. Fraudulent claims dropped to zero.</p>



 Secure Financial Transactions 



<p>Spain’s Basque Government uses Extrimian for citizen IDs, enabling secure access to 200+ services via a single VC wallet. Voter fraud? Practically eradicated.</p>



<p>A Nordic bank deployed Extrimian’s DID-based KYC system. Result? A 70% drop in account takeover fraud and 50% faster customer onboarding.</p>



 



 7: How to Implement Verifiable Credentials and DIDs with Extrimian 



 Low-Code Platforms for Rapid Issuing 



<p>Extrimian’s drag-and-drop toolkit lets organizations issue VCs in hours, not months. No PhD in cryptography required.</p>



 Seamless Integration and Support 



<p>From choosing a blockchain (Algorand for speed, Ethereum for flexibility) to training staff, Extrimian’s experts guide you at every step.</p>



 Here’s your roadmap:

									  Trumped Up Tariffs, Pt. 2   <p>Well, with TradFi in shambles, the DeFi market teetering on its own downturn, and&nbsp;<a href="https://broganlaw.substack.com/p/circles-s-1-annotated?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a-molotov-bread-basket-to-bretton-woods">Aaron Brogan reporting</a>&nbsp;that tariffs may have put the kibosh on any sort of public offering from Coinbase’s stablecoin project Circle, it feels like the ideal time to reprise our take on the Trump tax.</p>  <p>Up front, I don’t stan for Trump, Musk, or anyone, really. I believe every individual is a mix of good and bad. Their actions may tend to cumulate on one side or the other, but many contested things are neither universally good nor bad — they are circumstances opposed. Many of our political differences come from focusing on this division in and identifying the problem, rather than a resolution.</p>  <p>All to say, just because the consensus among economists opposes tariffs, particularly at the scale about to be enacted, I don’t think it’s productive to merely argue, “Tariffs bad.” In fact, I can personally get behind the concept of substituting import taxes for income taxes and import taxes, as they did prior to the latter’s genesis in 1913. By the same token, I’m also for meeting the friction on the road, where the implementation of this policy meets reality.</p>  <p>The long and short of it is, it’s going to be bad for the relatively small percentage of the U.S. population that owns the majority of the U.S. stock market. We know this, because they’re the same wealthy, influential cohort whose discontent has been most loudly voiced —&nbsp;the Jamie Dimons and Bill Ackmans of the world. On a Main Street level, it will also suck for small businesses depending on cheap exports to operate their business — online, D2C, dropshipper types; white-collar pros jumping on an arbitrage trend. And on an individual level, it could considerably harm those with invested retirement savings, particularly older Americans without a time horizon to recover their losses.</p>  <p>On the flip side, younger generations of high school grads have been trending toward the trades and other practical professions to avoid of crippling debt — the immediate pay that outsizes and outpaces most white-collar salaries, and the demand from an older generation of these professionals moving into retirement. These Americans stand to benefit most from the potential reshoring of job opportunities —&nbsp;and also happen to have a perspective unlikely to be amplified by most media channels.</p>  <p>As for my perspective, I believe there are opportunities ahead in both the equities and crypto markets, for those with an adaptable perspective of their own. The Trump tariffs may well be an apocalyptic event for the current financial order. Another way of looking at it is as a transition to retaining hard asset values in the U.S. and not trading at a fiscal deficit for goods of degrading quality and depreciating value. And IMO, consumer goods are not a reflection of strength, but a sign of dependency and a lack of fiscal discipline that prioritizes short-term luxuries for long-term security.</p>  <p>It just also just so happens that blockchain use cases are well-aligned with the needs of an increased investment in the domestic supply chain. Artists, craftsmen, and others who work with their hands to produce goods for the marketplace could leverage new reputation-based systems to maximize the earnings for goods of higher quality, and cheap charlatans would be highly visible for those who wish to avoid being defrauded.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It’s easy to turn to FUD when it feels like everything around you is burning. But while the Trump tariffs have indeed taken a Molotov bread basket to Bretton Woods, it’s not inconceivable that they could also lead to a sustainable economy supporting a thriving middle class. It undoubtedly sucks to see a world leader take a blowtorch to his citizen’s hard-earned savings for reasons it’s unclear if he really understands. Yet there’s an undeniable schadenfreude to seeing the PE firms and hedge funds that have been screwing those same citizens over for decades go up in the same flames.</p>  <p>Contradictions are life’s constant.

									           Standing Ovation   <p>Let’s be real: Most NFT platforms are glorified digital galleries with all the social depth of a crypto bro’s LinkedIn post.</p>  <p>Introducing you to&nbsp;<a href="https://ovation.network/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a-molotov-bread-basket-to-bretton-woods">Ovation Network</a>&nbsp;— a Kansas City-born startup swinging for the fences with a web3 social platform that mashes up intelligent NFT profiles, personalized portfolios, and a blockchain-powered UI into what it boldly calls a “unified NFT experience.”</p>  <p>Think LinkedIn meets OpenSea, but with fewer apes and more utility.</p>  <p>Launched in 2022, Ovation is part of the vanguard reimagining social platforms for the web3 era. Their MVP 1.0, rolled out in October 2024, already boasts 437 profiles and over 18k X followers — modest numbers, but growth hints at a niche hungry for more than static JPEGs.</p>  <p>The pitch? Ditch fragmented platforms (OpenSea for trading, Discord for community, Twitter for stunting) and consolidate everything into a single feed where users can:</p>    <p>Showcase NFTs like a web3 “Linktree”</p>  <p>Track engagement across communities</p>  <p>Monetize content via integrated tools</p>    <p>Think of it as a professional network for degens — a place to flex your Bored Ape, brag about your latest mint, and maybe even land a web3 gig.</p>  <p>Ovation’s selling point isn’t just aggregation; it’s context. While giants like Twitter and Instagram dabble in NFT profile pics, Ovation leans into data-rich profiles that display ownership history, community contributions, and even governance activity.</p>  <p>Other key innovations include:</p>    <p>Blockchain-backed portfolios: Sync your wallets, display your collection’s rarity score, and auto-generate “achievement” badges based on on-chain activity.</p>  <p>SocialFi mechanics: Gamified elements like follower milestones unlocking exclusive NFT drops (à la Pop Social’s dynamic NFTs).</p>  <p>Creator monetization: Direct minting, secondary sales royalties, and collab tools — all baked into the platform.</p>    <p>We’ll give a standing ovation to all of the above — but that doesn’t necessarily mean Ovation is a surefire hit. While partnerships with 100+ artists sound impressive, the platform’s real test is converting crypto-curious normies into daily users. Plus, it is remarkably similar to a more popular SocialFi platform, Pop Social. Both use NFTs to gamify engagement, but Pop’s “Treasure Chest” mechanic (randomized NFT rewards) feels more playful, while Ovation leans into professionalization. The latter’s recent $32.5k in grants from Texas Blockchain and Archway Foundation suggests institutional faith, but sustainability hinges on scaling beyond the NFT hardcore.</p>  <p>Ovation’s 2025 playbook includes expanding its team (they’re hiring a remote CTO to lead tech strategy) and refining its tokenized governance model. The goal? To morph from a niche tool into the go-to hub for web3 professionals. The company isn’t reinventing the wheel, but it’s polishing one that sorely needs it.</p>  <p>In a market where most NFT platforms feel like ghost towns after the 2021 hype, Ovation’s focus on social utility over speculative trading could carve a unique niche —&nbsp;and one bespoke to our heartland, utilitarian sensibilities.</p>  <p>— Muhammed</p>          								 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         NFTs in 2025: From Chaos to Cool   <p>Back in 2021, I’m hunched over my phone, eyes wide, watching NFT prices skyrocket like my heart rate after three espressos. I’d thrown some cash into a few collections — not enough to retire, but enough to feel the buzz. Then the news hits: a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT sells for $2.7 million.</p>  <p>Drink in hand, I’m torn. Genius or doomed? Turns out, a bit of both. Twitter was a brag-fest — burning 5 ETH&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ETH.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a-molotov-bread-basket-to-bretton-woods">$ETH.X ( ▲ 2.61% )</a>&nbsp;(~$15K at the time) on nominal ownership of a JPEG. Clubhouse? Total pandemonium, voices screaming “This is the future!” while I lurked, listening in, soaking in the casino-cult energy. It was wild, weirdly unforgettable, and forever COVID-coded mess.</p>  <p>Fast forward to 2025. The hype has crashed harder than the S&amp;P 500.</p>  <p>The market peaked at $57 billion in 2022, then tanked, leaving my wallet bruised and many others busted. I’d hawk my flops for pennies, laughing at the absurdity of the fad. What else could I do? But here’s the twist: NFTs didn’t fade away. They’re back at $61 billion now, per industry stats, with even more utility than they had at crypto summer’s climax.</p>  <p>So no more eye-rolling from me — let’s unpack the shift.</p>  <p>In 2021, I was swept up in the $41 billion chaos — flipping tokens, riding FOMO, watching Bored Apes explode. Social audio hyped “100x” gains, and I’d smirk, half-buying it. Then the 2022 bust hit, and my digital stash became a punchline. Today, it’s different. NFTs aren’t about quick flips — they’re practical. Think game items, concert tickets, even my buddy’s barber handing out loyalty perks as NFTs. I didn’t see that pivot coming, but my curiosity is thoroughly piqued.</p>  <p>Back then, NFTs were all about flexing digital art online. Now? They’re working overtime. Artists sell direct, skipping galleries — love that hustle. In games like Axie Infinity, your sword’s an NFT you can trade or cash out — real stakes, real fun. Bands drop tracks as NFTs, fans score rarities, artists get paid fair. Festivals even use them for tickets — no fakes, plus VIP perks.</p>  <p>In other words, they’re not just JPEGs anymore. They’re tools.</p>  <p>There was a time when every household name from Walmart to Wendy’s was getting in on the craze. But big brands fumbled NFTs early on — lame PR drops that flopped. The ones that stuck around have ditched the press releases and gone deep on integration.</p>  <p>Foo Fighters mint concert tickets. NBA teams offer season passes as NFTs, tossing in rare highlight clips. It’s not testing waters; it’s swimming Olympic-sized pools. I respect the shift from gimmick to strategy.</p>  <p>‘21 was a lawless free-for-all. The SEC couldn’t tell NFTs from stocks or toys; scams ran wild. By 2025, they’ve got a handle. Taxes are clearer, fraud’s down, and big investors aren’t spooked. A 2024 SEC ruling says most NFTs, like art or tickets, aren’t securities unless you’re promising profits. Most importantly, the “$1M rug pull” headlines are a thing of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=a-molotov-bread-basket-to-bretton-woods">Web3 is Going Great</a>&nbsp;posts past.</p>  <p>They’ve even become more sustainable over time. Minting NFTs used to drain my Ether faster than Raoul Duke on a Vegas bender. Fees stung like hell. Now? Platforms like Arbitrum make it cheap and fast. NFTs hop chains — Polygon to Solana, no fuss. Games run smooth, trades snap quick. Tech’s not fighting me anymore; it’s a teammate.</p>  <p>Bulls are betting the market will balloon to $247 billion by 2029. Gaming’s got explosive potential, and I’d wager on NFTs for deeds or diplomas next. It’s shedding “weird fad” vibes for “new norm” status. Could crash, could soar — I’m sipping coffee, watching, and deeply considering dipping a toe back in.</p>  <p>From 2021’s madness to 2025’s utility twist, NFTs went from risky bets to handy tools — games, tickets, perks. The market’s steadier, brands are all-in, tech’s solid. Volatility is still a beast, but I’m riding it out. Pick your flavor; art, gaming, whatever and give it a spin. No cartoon cat’s gonna buy you a house, though. That fantasy’s toast, and I for one am fine with it.</p>  <p>— Branden</p>

<p>The open standards development process, whether at the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/process/">IETF</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/">W3C</a>, or <a href="https://openid.net/policies/">OpenID Foundation</a>, has always been a balancing act. While politics inevitably plays a role (where there are people, there are politics), technology has historically held at least an equal seat at the table.</p>



<p>At least, it did.</p>



<p>With shifting geopolitical priorities and radical changes in the U.S. federal government, open standards organizations are increasingly viewed through the lens of tech sovereignty. Governments are asking:</p>



 
 Who is participating in standards development organizations (SDOs)? 



 Do certain entities have disproportionate influence? 



 Where are these organizations based, and whose culture shapes their work? 
 



<p>If the answers boil down to “Big Tech companies, largely U.S.-based, with an outsized impact,” then the technical standard itself becomes secondary. It’s not just about what’s in the spec. It’s about who wrote it. In some cases, that’s enough to render a standard unacceptable, regardless of its technical merit.</p>



 When Open Participation Isn’t Enough 



<p>Open standards bodies pride themselves on transparency and broad participation. In theory, anyone can contribute; maybe not vote (if voting even happens), but certainly comment, influence, and propose text. Yet that openness isn’t always seen as sufficient. The sentiment seems to be:</p>



<p>“Better to use a suboptimal standard that aligns with national interests than adopt something Those People created.”</p>



<p>If that sounds frustrating, it is. It’s also a stark example of why we can’t have nice things.</p>



 The Shifting Landscape of Standards Development 



<p>This growing concern over control and influence raises serious questions:</p>



 
 What happens to global interoperability if standards development fragments along geopolitical lines? 



 Will the most impactful standards shift to treaty-based SDOs, where geopolitical compromise often takes precedence over technical rigor? 



 Will national standards bodies step in, forcing vendors to adapt to country-specific requirements? 
 



<p>One example stands out: the Digital Credentials API (DC-API).</p>



 The Digital Credentials API: A Case Study in Standards Politics 



<p>On April 23, 2025, I <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hlflanagan_digitalcredentials-activity-7299501972565471232-yMqs?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAAezwAB2XSOIfPk0uSIUxiyRZ9UraWiMrg">posted on LinkedIn </a>about a major development: the formal objection blocking the DC-API from progressing in the W3C had been <a href="https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html">overturned</a>. The responses to that post were fascinating and mildly terrifying.</p>



<p>Some saw the DC-API as a valuable tool for the EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture Reference Framework (<a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">EUDI ARF</a>). Others argued that it was a mistake to allow the spec into anything the EU depends on. Further discussion resulted in the following (paraphrased):</p>



<p>“There’s nothing technically wrong with the spec itself—it’s about who wrote it.”</p>



<p>That’s a tough pill to swallow. If standards adoption hinges more on perceived authorship than technical quality, what does that mean for the future of open standards?</p>



 What Comes Next? 



<p>We’re witnessing a restructuring of how SDOs engage with the world. Will we see:</p>



 
 A shift toward EU-led standardization? They are doing some pretty cool stuff. 



 Treaty-based SDOs taking the lead? They already have the mechanisms in place for international government support. 



 A patchwork of national standards forcing enterprises to navigate an even more complex compliance landscape? It’s a lovely, short-sighted ‘win’ for national tech sovereignty.  
 



<p>I could make a strong case for the open standards model. Transparent processes, broad participation, and high technical quality should count for something. But I also understand why governments want to protect their interests—especially when U.S. politics seem increasingly volatile.</p>



<p>A middle ground would be nice. But before we get there, things are likely to get a lot messier.</p>



 Don’t Wait for Regulation to Decide for You 



<p>It’s tempting to sit back and wait for regulation to dictate which standards to follow. But that approach comes with real risks. Standards shaped solely by geopolitical negotiation—rather than technical expertise—are unlikely to serve enterprises, developers, or end users well.</p>



<p>If your company relies on interoperability, global reach, or future-proofing your technology investments, now is not the time to disengage from standards work. Instead:</p>



 
 Stay involved in open standards organizations—even if the process feels frustrating or slow. 



 Engage with policymakers to help them understand the real-world impact of their decisions. 



 Support industry collaboration to bridge gaps between regulatory needs and technical feasibility. 
 



<p>The future of global standards is still being written. The question is: who will be holding the pen?</p>



<p>Need Help Navigating This Shift? I spend a lot of time helping companies track standards developments, understand emerging regulatory trends, and figure out where they can (and should) engage.

			 How Tokeny Powers Fasanara’s Tokenized Money Market Funds 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Institutional investors are demanding faster, more cost-effective, and transparent ways to access money market funds. Recognizing this need, Fasanara Capital Ltd (“Fasanara”), a London-based institutional investment manager and a leader in digital finance with over $4.5 billion in assets under management (as of December 31, 2023), created a fully tokenized money market fund (MMF) designed for security, composability, and better efficiency. This is part of their wider mission and purpose of bridging traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi) to unlock new opportunities for investors and asset providers.</p>

		 
	 
   $1bn  Assets under management     1 year  track record     10  Team members                           <a href="https://youtu.be/7g3dFuVKLsg" title="Watch full interview"></a>                        
	 
		 
			 Web3’s Demand for Onchain MMFs 
<p>The question is no longer why asset managers should tokenize money market funds, it’s who’s ready to meet the surging demand. Web3 demand isn’t waiting. Stablecoin issuers need liquid and stable collateral to back their tokens. With the stablecoin market hitting a record $207.6 billion in mid-January, asset managers are taking action. DeFi treasuries seek secure, yield-generating onchain assets, while institutional crypto investors look for stable opportunities to deploy capital. Tokenized MMFs are emerging as the bridge between traditional finance and digital assets, offering the liquidity, security, and efficiency that Web3 demands.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Fasanara: One of the Digital Asset Leaders 
<p>As an established Digital Asset leader, Fasanara is not entering digital finance for the first time and instead brings over 13 years of expertise. Its deep integration with DeFi protocols like Aave and Uniswap, combined with its FCA-regulated status, positions Fasanara as a strong player in the tokenized MMF space.</p>

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “With our tokenized strategy, we are not only aiming to reshape the future of money market investments but also redefine how investors engage with financial markets. By harnessing blockchain technology, we are able to provide an innovative and compliant investment solution that should enable greater access to liquidity, real-time processing, and enhanced transparency – all while maintaining the rigor of traditional asset management practices.” 
<p>– Francesco Filia, Founder and CEO at Fasanara</p>

		 
	 
           
	 
		 
			 “With our Tokenized strategy, we are not only aiming to reshape the future of money market investments but also redefine how investors engage with financial markets.

<p>– Francesco Filia, Founder and CEO at Fasanara</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 The Challenge: Scaling Tokenized MMFs with Speed, Compliance, and Composability 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 “Rapidly and efficiently delivering innovative, differentiated products that offer high and unique value to our investors is central to our strategy at Fasanara.” 
<p>– David Vatchev, Head of Tokenization at Fasanara</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>As tokenized money market funds (MMFs) gain traction, Fasanara identified a key opportunity: delivering a compliant, scalable, and interoperable solution that can meet the needs of institutional investors, DeFi treasuries, and stablecoin issuers. However, success in this market demands more than expertise alone.</p>
<p>To establish a competitive edge, Fasanara needed to move quickly, integrate with key partners, and ensure long-term flexibility for its token holders. Composability—the ability for tokenized MMFs to interact with other onchain assets and protocols—was essential to unlocking future use cases and maximizing adoption. At the same time, compliance with strict financial regulations remained a top priority.</p>
<p>Bridging speed, interoperability, and regulatory adherence required a robust infrastructure partner—one that could provide a turnkey solution without adding technical complexity.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 The Solution: Tokeny’s Onchain Operating System for Seamless Tokenization 
<p>To overcome these challenges, Fasanara partnered with Tokeny, leveraging its enterprise-grade onchain operating system for compliant tokenization. Within weeks, the platform was fully set up, allowing Fasanara to issue, manage, and distribute tokens without technical complexity.</p>
<p>At the core of this solution is ERC-3643, the market standard for compliant tokenization. This ensures that:</p>
 
 Compliance is enforced at the token level, meeting regulatory requirements for every transaction. 
 Fasanara retains full control over its token strategy, enabling recovery, freezing, secondary liquidity solutions, and conditional transfers. 
 Fasanara’s strategy remains composable, meaning they can integrate effortlessly with legacy systems, blockchain service providers, and DeFi protocols. 
 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 “One of the key decisions for us is the trust, safety, and security of an institutional grade partner which Tokeny brings. Tokeny provides exceptional customer service, and working with a team that is also driven to bring about positive outcomes for both Fasanara and our end investors, has been a welcomed partnership.” 
<p>– David Vatchev, Head of Tokenization at Fasanara</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 The Impact: A Scalable, Compliant, and Future-Proof Tokenized MMF 
<p>By adopting Tokeny’s infrastructure and the ERC-3643 standard, Fasanara has successfully launched a next-generation tokenized MMF, with key benefits including:</p>

		 
	 
          Faster Time To Market  <p>Fasanara went live in weeks, not months, without the burden of building an onchain operating system from scratch.</p>
              Seamless Integration  <p>Tokens easily connected with Polygon, Fireblocks, Chainlink, and Apex Group, demonstrating plug-and-play standardization.</p>
              Native DeFi Composability  <p>Compliance is built into the tokens, allowing them to natively connect to any DeFi protocols while ensuring compliance to expand token utility, introduce new features, and support evolving investor needs.</p>
        
	 
		 
			<p>By launching Fasnara’s Token Strategy on Tokeny’s infrastructure, Fasanara has built more than just a tokenized MMF, it has created a future-proof, composable, and compliant digital asset. With growing interest from stablecoin issuers, DeFi treasuries, and hedge funds, Fasanara is now well positioned to be a leader the next evolution of real-world assets (RWA) onchain.</p>

<p>Every time you open a web browser, you’re inviting a whole host of third parties—advertisers, websites, ISPs, and even government agencies – to track your every move. But what if you didn’t have to accept that as the status quo? What if there were browsers specifically designed to protect your data and safeguard your privacy while still delivering fast, reliable performance? In this guide, we’ll explore the top browsers that offer an unmatched balance of speed and security, helping you take back control of your online experience.</p>

 5 Elements of a Secure Browser You Should Look For 



<p>Before we dive into the best browsers, let’s take a moment to understand the key features that make a browser truly secure. Here’s what you should be looking for when making a decision about which browser to use:</p>



 
 Encryption: A secure browser ensures that your connection is encrypted, which means that even if hackers try to intercept your data, they won’t be able to read it. Without encryption, you’re leaving your data wide open for theft. 



 Privacy Features: The best browsers go beyond simply offering incognito modes. They actively block third-party trackers and cookies, preventing advertisers from following your every click. Privacy-first browsers also minimize the data they collect, ensuring your browsing history remains private. 



 Frequent Updates: Security is an ongoing battle. That’s why a good browser will update frequently to patch vulnerabilities and keep hackers at bay. Frequent updates ensure that the latest threats don’t compromise your browsing experience. 



 Sandboxing: A powerful security feature that isolates web pages from one another, preventing malicious websites from compromising the rest of your system. In simple terms, it keeps potential threats confined, so they can’t reach your personal files or sensitive data. 



 Anti-Phishing &amp; Malware Protection: The best browsers automatically block phishing attempts and harmful websites. This feature adds an additional layer of protection by preventing you from accidentally visiting sites that could steal your personal information or infect your device with malware. 
 



<p>With these elements in mind, let’s explore the browsers that stand out in terms of speed, security, and functionality.</p>

 Top 10 Fast, Secure, and Best Web Browsers to Use 



<p>If you’re still relying on the default browser that came with your device, it might be time for an upgrade. Here’s a list of the top browsers that provide the perfect mix of speed, privacy, and security:</p>



 Herond Browser 



<p>Herond Browser sets itself apart in the crowded world of web browsers. It’s not just fast—it’s built for the future, offering top-tier security, blazing performance, and Web 3.0 integration, all in one package.</p>



 Unmatched Privacy and Security 



<p>At its core, Herond prioritizes privacy. With the Herond Shield, it blocks ads, trackers, and harmful websites. SSL certificates secure your connection, while Tor integration (coming soon) will add even more layers of protection. Plus, the Advanced Security Alert System (ASAS) keeps you one step ahead of online threats, making it a truly secure option for privacy-conscious users.</p>



 Seamless Web 3.0 Integration 



<p>Herond is ahead of the curve in the Web 3.0 revolution. It seamlessly integrates with Herond Wallet for decentralized digital asset management, giving users the tools to explore blockchain technology directly from the browser. It’s an experience designed for the decentralized web, putting users in full control of their data and assets.</p>



 Blazing Fast Performance 



<p>Speed is another standout feature. Herond loads pages up to three times faster than most browsers, ensuring that your browsing experience remains smooth and efficient. Whether you’re multitasking or streaming, Herond handles it all without slowing down.</p>



 User-Centric Design and Ecosystem 



<p>Herond’s design is all about customization. With a user-friendly interface and flexible settings, you can personalize your browsing experience. And with tools like Herond ID for decentralized identity management, Herond offers an integrated ecosystem that goes beyond just being a browser.</p>



<p>Looking for a fast and secure browser? Learn <a href="https://herond.org/browser">how to download Herond Browser on a computer </a>and enjoy top-tier privacy and Web 3.0 features. Plus, Herond is already available on both the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herond.android.browser&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">CH Play</a> and<a href="https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/herond-browser/id6462850011"> App Store </a>for your mobile device, offering a seamless and convenient browsing experience wherever you are.</p>


 
 


 Google Chrome 



<p>Google Chrome remains one of the most popular browsers, and for good reason. It’s fast, efficient, and well-integrated with Google’s ecosystem. Chrome frequently updates its security features and provides a seamless user experience. However, while Chrome does have robust security protocols, it is notorious for collecting data for advertising purposes. If privacy is a top priority for you, Chrome can be configured for enhanced privacy, but there are more privacy-conscious options available.</p>


 
 


 Mozilla Firefox 



<p>Mozilla Firefox stands as one of the best open-source browsers with a strong commitment to privacy. It offers an excellent speed-to-security ratio, with advanced privacy features like anti-tracking and phishing protection. Firefox also lets users customize their privacy settings, allowing you to decide what data gets collected. Plus, Firefox’s community-driven, open-source nature means that it’s constantly being updated and reviewed for security vulnerabilities.</p>



 Brave Browser 



<p>Brave takes privacy and security to the next level. This browser blocks ads and trackers by default, which not only protects your data but also boosts browsing speed. Brave’s integrated HTTPS upgrade ensures that you’re always browsing securely. Additionally, Brave’s innovative reward system allows users to earn cryptocurrency by viewing privacy-respecting ads—an excellent bonus for those looking to balance privacy and functionality.</p>


 
 


 Microsoft Edge 



<p>Microsoft Edge has come a long way since its earlier versions. Built on the same open-source Chromium engine that powers Chrome, Edge has improved in terms of speed and security. It includes features like built-in phishing and malware protection, as well as a secure password manager. Edge also boasts privacy tools like tracking prevention and a dedicated InPrivate mode. While not as privacy-focused as some others, Edge offers a well-rounded browsing experience with strong security features.</p>



 Safari 



<p>Safari has been the go-to browser for Apple users for years. It delivers excellent performance on macOS and iOS devices, especially when it comes to speed. Safari also offers strong privacy protection, with features like Intelligent Tracking Prevention, which helps block advertisers from following your every move online. It’s an ideal choice for those within the Apple ecosystem who want solid security without sacrificing performance.</p>


 
 


 Opera Browser 



<p>Opera is often overlooked but packs a punch with its robust security features. Built-in tools like a free VPN, ad blocker, and fraud protection make Opera a secure choice. The browser also boasts excellent speed performance, even with all these features running. Opera is an especially great choice for users who want a browser that provides a variety of privacy and security tools in one package, without needing extra extensions.</p>



 Tor Browser 



<p>When privacy is the top priority, Tor is the go-to choice for many. Tor’s ability to encrypt internet traffic and route it through multiple nodes makes it the best tool for users who need ultimate anonymity. Tor prevents tracking, stops unwanted surveillance, and shields your identity by masking your IP address. However, the trade-off for this high level of privacy is speed—Tor is slower than most browsers due to its complex encryption process. But for those who prioritize anonymity over speed, it’s the best choice.</p>



 Vivaldi 



<p>Vivaldi is a highly customizable browser that offers excellent speed and security. It comes with a built-in ad blocker, custom search engines, and advanced privacy features, giving you control over what data gets collected. Vivaldi allows you to configure almost every aspect of your browsing experience, from the interface to security settings, making it a great option for users who like to tweak things to their exact specifications.</p>



 Epic Browser 



<p>Epic Browser is designed with privacy in mind. It blocks all tracking cookies, advertisements, and even automatically forces secure HTTPS connections. Epic is known for its simple, no-frills interface and its commitment to keeping your data private. By default, Epic doesn’t store your browsing history or any personal data, and it doesn’t allow for any syncing, which is perfect for users who prioritize privacy above all else.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Choosing the right browser is more than just about convenience—it’s about security, speed, and privacy. The browsers we’ve discussed offer various features that cater to different user needs, whether you’re looking for an anonymous browsing experience, a super-fast option, or an all-around secure browser.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the best browser for you depends on your priorities. If privacy and security are your top concerns, browsers like Brave, Firefox, and Tor should be at the top of your list. If you’re after speed and integration with other services, Chrome and Edge will suit you well. And if you want the perfect balance between speed, privacy, and security, consider trying Herond or Vivaldi. Whichever you choose, remember that it’s time to take control of your online experience and make sure your browsing is as fast and secure as possible.</p>

<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The convergence of quantum computing and blockchain technologies represents a paradigm shift with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of digital interaction and data management. While classical blockchain systems have provided a secure and transparent framework for decentralized applications, the looming threat of quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptographic standards necessitates the exploration of quantum-resistant alternatives and the integration of quantum capabilities to enhance efficiency and unlock new functionalities. This report proposes a novel blockchain architecture that strategically combines the strengths of classical and quantum computing to address these challenges and capitalize on emerging opportunities. The architecture aims to harness the power of Equal1 Bell1 quantum computers for mining on a DWave quantum blockchain, facilitate the contribution of computational resources towards artificial intelligence (AI) operations, ensure seamless integration with existing classical blockchain networks, and meet stringent enterprise-level requirements for scalability, sustainability, interoperability, and efficiency. This report will detail the foundational technologies, present the proposed hybrid architecture, outline the design of a Classic-to-Quantum (C2Q) API, provide conceptual code implementations, analyze the architecture's feasibility for enterprise use, and conclude with a discussion of future research directions.</p>
<p>II. Background and Foundational Technologies</p>
 
 
<p>A. Equal1 Bell1 Quantum Computer: Architecture and Capabilities for HPC Integration <br>
The Equal1 Bell1 quantum computer represents a significant step towards bringing quantum computing out of specialized laboratory environments and into mainstream data centers 1. Unlike first-generation quantum computers that demanded dedicated rooms, complex cooling systems, and specialized infrastructure, Bell1 is purpose-built for direct deployment within High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments 1. As a rack-mountable quantum node, it is designed to integrate seamlessly alongside classical compute resources, occupying a standard 600 mm x 1000 mm x 1600 mm data center rack and weighing approximately 200 kg 1. This compact form factor, comparable to a high-end GPU server, belies its potential for exponential computational power for tackling complex problems 1. <br>
At its core, Bell1 utilizes a UnityQ 6-Qubit Quantum Processing System with integrated control electronics, all housed within a single rack 1. This silicon-based quantum technology leverages existing semiconductor fabrication processes, paving the way for future scalability and reliability 1. A remarkable engineering feat, Bell1 cools its silicon quantum processor to an ultralow temperature of 0.3 Kelvin (-272.85°C) using a self-contained cryo-cooling system, eliminating the need for external dilution refrigerators 1. This is achieved while operating within the heat and noise of a typical HPC data center, drawing a manageable 1600 W of power from a standard power socket, comparable to an enterprise server 1. <br>
Equal1 envisions Bell1 as the beginning of Quantum Computing 2.0, shifting the paradigm from experimental machines to practical quantum solutions readily deployable in existing AI and HPC data center environments 1. This focus on accessibility, scalability, and practicality aims to empower businesses to harness quantum acceleration for computationally intensive workloads in areas such as AI, financial modeling, pharmaceutical research, and materials science without requiring extensive infrastructure modifications 1. Future generations of the Bell Quantum Server family are designed to incorporate Equal1's Quantum System on Chip (QSoC) technology, integrating control, readout, and error correction onto a single chip, ensuring long-term return on investment and the ability to take advantage of future increases in qubit capacity and computational capabilities through field upgrades 1. The initial 6-qubit processor exhibits promising performance metrics, including a single-qubit gate fidelity of 99.40%, a CZ gate fidelity of 98.40%, and a readout fidelity exceeding 99.9% 5. These specifications indicate a reliable quantum processing unit suitable for exploring practical applications in the near term.</p>
 
 
<p>B. DWave Quantum Blockchain: Proof of Quantum Work and Distributed Quantum Computing <br>
DWave has pioneered a novel blockchain architecture that leverages techniques from its quantum supremacy demonstration to potentially enhance both security and efficiency compared to traditional blockchain systems 10. Their research introduces a "Proof of Quantum Work" (PoQW) consensus mechanism, where quantum computation is employed to generate and validate blockchain hashes 10. In a groundbreaking demonstration, DWave successfully deployed this quantum blockchain architecture across four of its cloud-based annealing quantum computers located in Canada and the United States, marking the first-ever instance of distributed quantum computing for blockchain operation 10. <br>
A significant potential advantage of DWave's quantum blockchain is the dramatic reduction in energy consumption compared to classical Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems, with estimates suggesting a decrease by a factor of up to 1000 10. This is achieved through a new quantum-powered method for securely and efficiently creating hashes by mapping mathematical functions to the complex programmable spin glasses simulated in DWave's recent supremacy demonstration 10. The PoQW algorithm is designed to incorporate hashes generated by a quantum computer, excluding classical computation from the process and adding an enhanced layer of security through the introduction of quantum-verifiable randomness, making these hashes computationally infeasible to replicate using classical hardware 10. DWave's PoQW approach is based on programmable spin-glass models, a class of complex optimization problems that their annealing quantum processors are particularly well-suited to solve 10. Beyond energy efficiency, this quantum blockchain model offers potential advantages in areas such as supply chain security, decentralized identity verification, and digital asset management 24.</p>
 
 
<p>C. Post-Quantum Cryptography: Ensuring Long-Term Security for the Hybrid Blockchain <br>
The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the security of current blockchain systems that rely on widely used public-key cryptography algorithms like RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) 43. Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm, can efficiently factor large numbers and compute discrete logarithms, which are the mathematical foundations of these cryptographic schemes 44. Furthermore, Grover's algorithm presents a potential threat by speeding up brute-force attacks on hash functions used in blockchain for ensuring data integrity 49. <br>
To address this impending quantum threat, the field of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is dedicated to developing cryptographic algorithms that are currently believed to be secure against cryptanalytic attacks by both classical and quantum computers 43. Several promising approaches are being researched, including lattice-based cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of lattice problems and includes algorithms like CRYSTALS-Kyber (for key encapsulation), CRYSTALS-Dilithium and FALCON (for digital signatures), and NTRU 43. Hash-based cryptography, utilizing algorithms like XMSS and SPHINCS+, offers another quantum-resistant solution for digital signatures 43. Other notable PQC families include code-based cryptography (e.g., McEliece), multivariate cryptography (e.g., Rainbow), and isogeny-based cryptography (e.g., SIKE) 43. Recognizing the urgency of this transition, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been conducting a rigorous standardization process to identify and recommend one or more quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms 44. NIST has already finalized its first set of standards, including ML-KEM (based on CRYSTALS-Kyber) for key encapsulation, ML-DSA (based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium) and SLH-DSA (based on SPHINCS+) for digital signatures 44. These standardized algorithms provide a strong foundation for building post-quantum secure blockchain solutions.</p>
 
 
<p>III. Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Blockchain Architecture</p>
 
 
<p>A. System Architecture Overview and Component Interaction <br>
The proposed architecture is a hybrid system designed to leverage the strengths of both classical and quantum computing. It comprises several key interacting components. The Classical Blockchain Layer forms the foundation, responsible for managing the distributed ledger, handling transaction processing for non-quantum-sensitive operations, and potentially executing quantum-resistant smart contracts. This layer also serves as the primary interface for users and external classical blockchain networks. The Quantum Mining Module integrates Equal1 Bell1 quantum computers, which contribute computational power to the DWave Quantum Blockchain Layer. This layer is a separate blockchain that utilizes DWave's "Proof of Quantum Work" (PoQW) consensus mechanism for enhanced security and energy efficiency. The AI Resource Contribution Layer allows users to contribute both quantum resources from Bell1 and classical computing power towards AI operations and processing, managed by the blockchain. An Interoperability Framework ensures seamless communication and asset transfer between the quantum blockchain and external blockchains running on classical computers. Finally, a Classic-to-Quantum (C2Q) API acts as a secure gateway, enabling classical systems to interact with the quantum blockchain for submitting transactions, querying state, contributing to AI, and retrieving results. <br>
The typical transaction flow might involve a user initiating a transaction on the classical blockchain layer. For transactions requiring the enhanced security or efficiency of the quantum blockchain, the transaction data (or a representation thereof) is passed through the C2Q API to the DWave quantum blockchain for processing and mining via the Bell1 quantum miners. Once processed on the quantum blockchain, the transaction status or a verifiable proof of the transaction can be relayed back to the classical blockchain layer through the interoperability framework, ensuring a consistent and auditable record across both systems. AI tasks are initiated through the classical layer, and the AI Resource Contribution Layer allocates these tasks to available quantum (Bell1) and classical resources. The results of these AI computations are then stored and can be accessed through the C2Q API. The architecture's modular design allows for the future integration of more advanced quantum computing hardware, improved PQC algorithms, and evolving AI techniques without requiring a complete overhaul of the system.</p>
 
 
<p>B. Quantum Mining Module: Integration of Equal1 Bell1 with DWave Blockchain <br>
Integrating the Equal1 Bell1 quantum computer with the DWave quantum blockchain for mining presents a unique challenge due to the fundamental differences in their architectures. DWave utilizes quantum annealing, an approach particularly suited for solving optimization problems, which forms the basis of their PoQW consensus mechanism 10. Equal1 Bell1, on the other hand, is a gate-based quantum computer 1. Given that DWave's PoQW was demonstrated on systems with thousands of qubits 10, a direct mapping of the entire PoQW process to Bell1's 6-qubit architecture is unlikely to be feasible in the near term. <br>
A potential approach involves a hybrid mining strategy where Bell1 contributes to specific sub-problems within the PoQW framework that can be efficiently tackled by a small number of high-fidelity qubits. For instance, Bell1 could be used to generate the quantum randomness required for the PoQW hashing process 10. Research into quantum hashing algorithms suitable for gate-based quantum computers with limited qubits would be necessary to identify specific tasks that Bell1 can perform effectively. Furthermore, the architecture could explore the orchestration of multiple Bell1 units in parallel to increase the overall computational contribution towards the mining process. These Bell1 miners would likely communicate with the DWave blockchain network through the C2Q API, potentially connecting to specialized mining pools that manage the distribution of tasks and the aggregation of results. To mitigate the impact of potential latency and error rates inherent in quantum computations, the system could incorporate error correction codes or adopt probabilistic validation methods similar to those employed by DWave in their quantum blockchain prototype 22.</p>
 
 
<p>C. AI Resource Contribution Layer: Utilizing Quantum and Classical Resources <br>
The proposed architecture aims to create a distributed computing platform for AI by allowing users to contribute both quantum resources from Equal1 Bell1 and classical computing power. For Bell1, the focus would be on AI tasks that can benefit from a small number of high-fidelity qubits, such as optimization problems commonly encountered in machine learning 12. These could include optimizing the parameters of neural networks, performing feature selection, or tackling combinatorial optimization problems relevant to AI. <br>
The architecture could implement a federated learning framework, enabling Bell1 units and classical computers to collaboratively train AI models on decentralized datasets without requiring the direct sharing of sensitive information 67. This approach would allow for privacy-preserving AI model training, leveraging the unique computational capabilities of quantum resources where applicable. To incentivize users to contribute their computational resources, the quantum blockchain's native token could be used as a reward mechanism. A dedicated resource management module would be responsible for registering available quantum and classical resources, allocating AI tasks based on their specific requirements and the capabilities of the contributing resources, and managing the distribution of rewards. This module would likely interact with the C2Q API to receive requests for AI computations and to dispatch tasks to the appropriate resources.</p>
 
 
<p>D. Interoperability Framework: Connecting Quantum and Classical Blockchains <br>
To enable seamless integration with the vast ecosystem of blockchains running on classical computers, the proposed architecture will employ a hybrid blockchain approach 93. This involves having a core quantum-secured layer, primarily the DWave quantum blockchain handling mining and potentially high-value transactions, and a classical interface layer responsible for managing interactions with external classical blockchain networks. The classical layer would operate using established blockchain protocols and could implement quantum-resistant smart contracts for enhanced security against future quantum threats. <br>
Interoperability with classical blockchains would be facilitated through standard mechanisms such as blockchain bridges 99. These bridges would enable the secure and efficient transfer of assets and data between the quantum blockchain and various classical blockchains like Ethereum or Hyperledger. For instance, a bridge could allow a user on a classical blockchain to initiate a transaction that requires the quantum-level security of the DWave blockchain. The transaction details would be relayed through the bridge, processed on the quantum blockchain, and the outcome (or a verifiable proof) would be communicated back to the classical blockchain. This hybrid approach allows the proposed system to benefit from the unique advantages of quantum computing while maintaining compatibility and interaction with the existing blockchain infrastructure.</p>
 
 
<p>E. Enterprise Usability Design: Scalability, Sustainability, Interoperability, and Efficiency <br>
The proposed hybrid blockchain architecture is designed with enterprise usability as a central consideration, focusing on scalability, sustainability, interoperability, and efficiency. For scalability, the classical layer of the architecture can implement techniques such as sharding to partition the blockchain and distribute the transaction load 108. Layer-2 solutions can also be explored to handle a high volume of transactions off-chain while still leveraging the security of the main blockchain. Furthermore, the distributed nature of quantum mining using multiple Bell1 units contributes to the scalability of the quantum blockchain layer. <br>
Sustainability is addressed through the adoption of DWave's PoQW consensus mechanism, which promises a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to traditional Proof-of-Work systems 10. Additionally, the architecture's ability to utilize contributed computing resources for AI processing adds to its overall efficiency and reduces potential energy waste. Interoperability is a core design principle, facilitated by the hybrid approach and the chosen blockchain bridge mechanism, allowing seamless interaction with existing enterprise blockchain solutions and other classical blockchain networks. In terms of efficiency, the use of quantum computing for mining has the potential to significantly speed up the transaction validation process on the quantum blockchain layer. The efficient allocation of both quantum and classical resources for AI tasks ensures that computational power is utilized effectively. Compared to existing enterprise blockchain platforms 93, the proposed architecture offers a unique combination of quantum-level security and efficiency, coupled with a strong emphasis on sustainability and interoperability, positioning it as a compelling solution for enterprises looking towards a post-quantum future.</p>
 
 
<p>IV. Classic-to-Quantum (C2Q) API Design and Implementation</p>
 
 
<p>A. API Requirements and Functionality <br>
The Classic-to-Quantum (C2Q) API serves as the vital interface enabling seamless communication and interaction between blockchains and systems operating on classical computers and the proposed quantum computing blockchain architecture. Its primary function is to bridge the gap between these fundamentally different computational paradigms, allowing for the utilization of the quantum blockchain's unique capabilities within the existing classical digital infrastructure. The API must support several key functionalities to achieve this goal. Firstly, it needs to provide a secure and reliable mechanism for submitting transactions originating from classical blockchains to the quantum blockchain for processing and validation. This includes handling various transaction formats and potentially incorporating classical cryptographic signatures for authentication. Secondly, the API should allow classical systems to efficiently query the state of the quantum blockchain, such as retrieving current balances of addresses, accessing data stored in quantum-resistant smart contracts, and obtaining real-time information about the network. Furthermore, it must enable classical computing resources to be contributed towards AI operations managed by the quantum blockchain, providing a way for classical nodes to register their availability and receive AI tasks. Finally, the API should facilitate the secure retrieval of results from quantum mining activities performed by Bell1 units and the output of AI processing tasks executed on both quantum and classical resources, ensuring that only authorized clients can access this information.</p>
 
 
<p>B. Proposed API Architecture and Endpoints <br>
A RESTful API architecture is proposed for the C2Q API, leveraging standard HTTP methods to ensure ease of integration with a wide range of classical blockchain platforms and development tools. The API will utilize JSON for request and response data formats, ensuring platform-independent data exchange. Key API endpoints include:</p>
 
 
<p>/api/v1/transactions/submit (POST): This endpoint will accept transaction data from classical blockchains. The request body will likely contain the transaction details in a standardized format, along with necessary classical cryptographic signatures for authentication. The response will indicate the status of the transaction submission to the quantum blockchain.</p>
 
 
<p>/api/v1/state/query/{address} (GET): This endpoint allows querying the current state of a specific address or quantum-resistant smart contract on the quantum blockchain. The {address} path parameter will specify the target address. The response will be a JSON object containing the current state information.</p>

The response will indicate the registration status and potentially provide an identifier for the contributing node.</p>
 
 
<p>/api/v1/mining/results/{minerId} (GET): Authorized classical clients can use this endpoint to retrieve the mining rewards or status for a specific Equal1 Bell1 quantum miner, identified by its {minerId}. The response will be a JSON object containing the relevant mining information.</p>
 
 
<p>/api/v1/ai/results/{taskId} (GET): This endpoint will allow authorized clients to fetch the results of a specific AI processing task, identified by its {taskId}. Authentication will be required to access these results, potentially through API keys or OAuth tokens passed in the request headers. The response will contain the output of the AI computation in a JSON format.</p>
 
 
<p>Security for the C2Q API will be implemented through standard authentication mechanisms such as API keys or OAuth 2.0, ensuring that only authorized entities can access and utilize the API's functionalities. Authorization rules will be enforced to control access to sensitive operations, such as submitting transactions or retrieving AI results.</p>
 
 C. Conceptual Code Examples <br>

However, its feasibility for enterprise adoption hinges on several critical factors. Cost analysis reveals that the initial investment in Equal1 Bell1 quantum computers, while designed for data center compatibility 1, will still represent a significant expenditure. Operational costs will include power consumption 1), maintenance of the quantum hardware, and potential usage fees for the DWave quantum blockchain platform. Incentivizing resource contribution for AI tasks will also add to the operational expenses.</p>
<p>From a security standpoint, the architecture offers a significant advantage by integrating post-quantum cryptography in the classical layer, mitigating the future threat of quantum attacks 43. The use of DWave's PoQW in the quantum layer further enhances security through quantum-verifiable randomness 10. However, the security of the interoperability framework and the C2Q API will require careful design and implementation to prevent vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The regulatory landscape for blockchain technologies is still evolving, and the introduction of quantum computing adds another layer of complexity. Compliance with data privacy regulations and cross-jurisdictional interoperability standards will need to be carefully considered. Integration with existing enterprise systems is facilitated by the hybrid approach and the proposed RESTful C2Q API, which aims to be compatible with standard classical blockchain platforms 75.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the potential for faster transaction processing through quantum mining is promising, although the current limitations of 6-qubit systems like Bell1 for DWave's PoQW need to be acknowledged. The efficiency of AI processing will depend on the specific tasks and the availability of contributed quantum and classical resources. The maturity and availability of the underlying technologies are crucial. Equal1 Bell1 was recently launched 1, indicating its commercial availability, while DWave's quantum blockchain is currently a research prototype 10. Standardized PQC algorithms are now available from NIST 44.</p>
<p>VII. Conclusion and Future Directions</p>
<p>The proposed quantum-classical hybrid blockchain architecture offers a novel approach to addressing the evolving demands of enterprise blockchain adoption in a post-quantum era. By strategically integrating Equal1 Bell1 quantum computers for mining on a DWave quantum blockchain, the architecture aims to enhance security through quantum-verifiable work and achieve greater energy efficiency. The inclusion of an AI resource contribution layer further leverages the computational capabilities of both quantum and classical systems, opening up new possibilities for decentralized AI processing. The interoperability framework ensures seamless integration with the existing ecosystem of classical blockchains, while the C2Q API provides a standardized interface for interaction.</p>
<p>The potential impact of this architecture spans various industries, offering enhanced security for financial transactions, improved efficiency in supply chain management through quantum-secured data, and new avenues for accelerating AI research and development.

<p>Data breaches are hitting the world hard:</p>



 
 In the first half of 2024, the total number of US data breach victims surpassed <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">1 billion</a>—a <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">490 per cent</a> increase from the same time last year.<br> 



 In the United Kingdom, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ico-55-uk-adults-have-data-lost/">30 million</a> people or <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ico-55-uk-adults-have-data-lost/">55%</a> of all adults have had their data stolen.<br> 



 <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/majority-of-australians-caught-in-cyber-attacks-as-threats-surge/">Two-thirds of Australians</a> experienced a cyberattack or data breach in the 12 months up to October 2024. <a>Half</a> of those were hit more than once.<br> 



 Across Europe, <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2024-in-europe">2,289,599,662</a> known records were breached in <a href="https://www.itgovernance.eu/blog/en/data-breaches-and-cyber-attacks-in-2024-in-europe">556</a> publicly disclosed incidents in the short time between November 2023 and April 2024.<br> 



 In the Middle East, the UAE’s public sector alone averages<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/uae-government-cyber-chief-50k-cyberattacks-daily"> 50,000 cyberattacks every day</a>, with the number of attacks on the private sector possibly <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/uae-government-cyber-chief-50k-cyberattacks-daily">double or triple</a> that number.<br> 
 



<p>Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/28/2115616/0/en/Nearly-half-of-global-consumers-expect-to-be-affected-by-a-data-breach.html">research</a> found that 30% of consumers globally had already fallen victim to a data breach (that’s nearly a third of the world’s consumer population)—and now, four years later, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">2024</a> recorded the biggest <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a> in history, including the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a> &nbsp;of 26 billion leaked data records from users of Tencent, Weibo, Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram, and government agencies.</p>



<p>It’s no wonder people are scared. The International Association of Privacy Professional’s 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf">Privacy and Consumer Trust Report</a>, which surveyed 4,750 individuals across 19 countries, found 68% of consumers globally are either somewhat or very concerned about their privacy online. Other major studies have found similar:</p>



 
 More than a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/views-of-data-privacy-risks-personal-data-and-digital-privacy-laws/">third</a> of Americans told Pew Research that they fear their personal information being stolen. 



 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/consumer-privacy-survey.html">60%</a> told Cisco that they feel they can’t protect their personal data. &nbsp; 



 Nearly <a href="https://www.ana.net/miccontent/show/id/aa-2023-12-consumer-privacy">six in 10 people told Deloitte </a>&nbsp;they worry their devices are vulnerable to security breaches. 
 



<p><br>As a result, people are becoming more proactive at solving the data privacy problem for themselves:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2024.pdf">67%</a> of consumers told <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2024.pdf">Cisco</a> this year that they review or update their privacy settings in apps and platforms 



 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2024.pdf">68%</a> said they implement multi-factor authentication. 



 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-infographic-2024.pdf">61%</a> said they use password managers for credential security. 
 



<p><br>We believe that there’s never been a more crucial time for consumers to proactively protect their <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a>.</p>



<p>If you discover your personal information was exposed in a data breach, quickly change your passwords, add a fraud alert to your credit reports, and place a freeze on your credit reports. More helpful advice is available at the non-profit <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a> and the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/media/79862">FTC</a>.</p>



<p>You can also move quickly today to download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> all-in-one privacy app and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> personal data removal service, powered by MySudo.</p>



<a></a>



<p>MySudo protects your personal information by giving you secure alternative phone numbers, email addresses, and payment cards. MySudo is the original all-in-one privacy app that lets you protect your information, secure your chat, and organize your life:</p>



 
 PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION with secure digital identities called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, each with its own phone, email, handle, private browser, and virtual card*. Anywhere you’d normally use your personal phone number, email or credit card, use your Sudo ones instead. Sign up for deals and discounts, book rental cars and hotel rooms, pay for concerts or a coffee—all without giving away your personal information.&nbsp;<br> 



 SECURE YOUR CHAT&nbsp;with end-to-end encrypted calls, texts and emails between MySudo users via your Sudo handle—or communicate standard outside the app with everyone else. Your Sudo phone and email work just like your personal ones&nbsp;AND&nbsp;they protect you from&nbsp;spam&nbsp;and&nbsp;scams.&nbsp;<br> 



 ORGANIZE YOUR LIFE with multiple Sudo digital identities, each with a different purpose. Depending on your plan, you can have up to 9 Sudos, so you can shop with a Sudo, date with a Sudo, order food with a Sudo, sell secondhand stuff with a Sudo, live with a Sudo. What happens in a Sudo stays in the Sudo, so your information is safe and organized. 
 



<p>What’s in a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>?</p>



 
 1 email address – for end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users 



 1 private browser – for searching the internet without ads and tracking 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal info and your money, like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account 
 



<p>*Phone numbers and virtual cards only available on a paid plan. Phone numbers available for US, CA and UK only. Virtual cards for US only.</p>



<a></a>



<p>RECLAIM tells you where your information has been caught in a data breach and helps you manage your next move.</p>



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim">RECLAIM</a>, powered by <a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>, is a new personal data removal service that helps you reclaim control of your <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-want-to-keep-private/">personal information</a> from the companies that store and might sell it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RECLAIM tells you which companies hold your personal information and—better yet—where your information might have been caught in a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/?s=data+breach">data breach</a>. It then gives you step-by-step instructions for protecting your information going forward, either by using&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo">MySudo</a>&nbsp;or asking the company to delete your personal information altogether.&nbsp;</p>

 When Security Experts Get Phished  
<p>Even the most seasoned cybersecurity professionals can fall victim to sophisticated phishing attacks. The phishing attack that gained access to <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/a-sneaky-phish-just-grabbed-my-mailchimp-mailing-list/">Troy Hunt's Mailchimp account</a> isn't just another security incident – it's a brutal wake-up call exposing the inherent weaknesses of probabilistic security and its inability to withstand modern attacks.</p> 
<p>This incident reveals a harsh truth: our current approach to <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/identity-security-guide">identity security</a> is fundamentally flawed. As digital threats evolve in complexity and scale, the inadequacies of traditional security measures become more apparent. The time has come for a paradigm shift – from probabilistic to deterministic identity assurance.</p> 
 Why the Troy Hunt Phishing Attack is a Wake-Up Call for MFA Inadequacy  
<p>The attack that affected Troy Hunt followed a depressingly familiar pattern. Picture this: a routine day, an innocuous-looking notification from Mailchimp appears in an inbox. Nothing seems out of the ordinary, except this notification was not from Mailchimp at all. It's a masterfully crafted phishing attack designed to appear legitimate down to the smallest detail.</p> 
<p>The attackers didn't just gain momentary access. They siphoned sensitive data, including information that Mailchimp had kept long after it served any legitimate purpose. The breach was comprehensive, devastating, and worst of all – preventable.</p> 
<p>What makes this incident particularly alarming isn't just that it happened, but how it happened. The supposedly "strong" multi-factor authentication that protected the account crumbled like a sandcastle at high tide. One-time passwords, once the gold standard of additional security factors, proved no match for attackers who have evolved their techniques to intercept and relay these codes in real-time.</p> 
<p>This isn't just a story about one breach. It's a story that's repeating with alarming frequency across industries, organizations, and individuals. And it will continue to repeat until we address the core problem.</p> 
 The Fundamental Problem: Probabilistic vs. Deterministic Security  
<p>To understand why our current security models are failing, we need to examine the core philosophical difference between probabilistic and deterministic security approaches.</p> 
 Probabilistic Security is Educated Guesswork   
<p>Traditional security methods (passwords, OTPs, knowledge-based questions, and even many forms of MFA) operate on a probabilistic model. They attempt to infer legitimacy based on factors that suggest, but don't confirm, a user's identity:<br></p> 
  
  Passwords: Assume that only legitimate users know the secret<br>  
  OTPs: Assume that only legitimate users have access to a particular device or email account<br>  
  Knowledge-based authentication: Assume that only legitimate users know personal information<br>  
  Behavioral biometrics: Assume patterns of behavior remain consistent<br>  
  
<p>The fundamental weakness in all these methods is the “assumption”. They work on statistical likelihood rather than certainty, leaving gaps that can be exploited.<br></p> 
 Deterministic Security Establishes&nbsp;Certainty  
<p>In contrast, deterministic security doesn't rely on assumptions or probabilities. It establishes certainty by verifying immutable factors that definitively prove identity:<br></p> 
  
  Cryptographic verification that mathematically proves possession of private keys  
  Device binding that ensures authentication can only occur from authorized devices  
  Biometric verification (when implemented properly) that confirms physical presence of a user  
  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=fb18a0a6-54ba-4774-9e36-f5e3e0465c01&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Why Probabilistic Security Continues to Fail  
<p>The shortcomings of probabilistic security models have become increasingly evident as attack techniques evolve in sophistication and scale. Modern phishing has transformed into a high-precision operation that can bypass traditional MFA by capturing credentials and authorization codes in real-time, then replaying them before they expire. This technique renders time-based one-time passwords virtually ineffective when an attacker can intercept and forward them immediately.</p> 
 Man-in-the-Middle Attacks  
<p>Similarly concerning are adversary-in-the-middle attacks, where attackers position themselves invisibly between users and legitimate services. In this position, they can silently capture and relay authentication data without being detected, creating the illusion of security while compromising the entire process.</p> 
 Credential Stuffing  
<p>Despite years of security awareness training, credential stuffing remains devastatingly effective because users continue to reuse passwords across services. This human tendency means credentials leaked from one breach often unlock multiple accounts, amplifying the damage from a single compromise.</p> 
 Social Engineering  
<p>The social aspects of security have proven equally vulnerable. Social engineering has evolved to bypass knowledge-based authentication by gathering personal information from social media and data breaches. Information that was once considered private enough to verify identity, (mother's maiden name, first pet, childhood street) is now readily available to determined attackers.</p> 
<p>The fundamental problem becomes clear when examining these vulnerabilities: probabilistic security measures attempt to build higher walls around inherently vulnerable systems, but determined attackers simply develop more sophisticated methods to bypass them. This approach is fundamentally reactive rather than transformative.&nbsp;</p> 
 The Path Forward: Deterministic Identity Assurance  
<p>The solution to these vulnerabilities lies in embracing a deterministic approach to identity security. This approach removes assumptions and probabilities, replacing them with cryptographic certainty.</p> 
 The Three Pillars of Deterministic Identity Assurance  
<p>A truly effective identity security system must address the entire identity lifecycle through three critical components:<br></p> 
  
  Authentication: Eliminating Phishable Factors and Shared Credentials<br>The first step is replacing vulnerable authentication methods with truly phishing-resistant alternatives: 
    
    FIDO Passkeys: Using public-private key cryptography instead of shared secrets, like passwords<br>  
    Device Binding: Ensuring authentication can only occur from registered, managed, or trusted devices<br>  
    Biometric Verification: Adding a physical presence requirement that can't be replicated remotely<br>  
    <br>  
  Adaptive Risk Assessment: Beyond Point-in-Time Verification<br>Deterministic security doesn't stop at login. It continuously monitors for anomalies throughout the user session:<br> 
    
    Behavioral Analysis: Tracking patterns of user behavior to identify deviations<br>  
    Contextual Signals: Evaluating location, device health, network conditions, and other environmental factors<br>  
    Risk-Based Policies: Automatically applying appropriate security measures based on detected risk levels<br><br>  
      
  &nbsp;Identity Verification: Securing the Starting Point<br>The strongest authentication is meaningless if the original identity verification is compromised:<br> 
    
    Document Verification: Validating government-issued IDs or verifiable digital credentials<br>  
    Biometric Matching: Confirming the user matches their ID<br>  
    Liveness Detection: Ensuring verification involves a real person, not a spoofed image or deepfake<br>  
      
  
 Implementing Deterministic Security: Real-World Applications  
<p>The journey toward deterministic security looks different for every organization, but certain principles remain constant. Let me walk you through how this transformation typically unfolds across different aspects of operations.</p> 
<p>For customer-facing applications, the shift begins with reimagining authentication. Gone are the days of password complexity requirements that frustrate legitimate users while doing little to deter attackers. Instead, customers use their devices' built-in biometrics, a fingerprint or facial scan, to unlock cryptographic passkeys that prove their identity without sharing secrets.</p> 
<p>The experience feels magical in its simplicity. A customer opening a banking app touches the fingerprint sensor, and they're in – no passwords to remember, no codes to enter. Behind this seamless experience lies rock-solid security: cryptographic verification that mathematically proves the user's identity.</p> 
<p>This same mechanism secures high-value transactions. When a customer initiates a significant funds transfer, the same biometric verification confirms their intent, eliminating the fraud that plagues traditional systems.</p> 
<p>For workforce security, the transformation touches every aspect of the employee experience. Morning workstation login happens with a tap or glance rather than typing a complex password that changes every 90 days. Remote <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce access</a>&nbsp;to corporate resources occurs through similarly streamlined but vastly more secure mechanisms.</p> 
<p>Particularly sensitive is privileged access. Those administrative accounts that hold the keys to the kingdom. Here, deterministic security adds additional contextual checks. An administrator accessing critical systems outside normal hours or from an unusual location might trigger step-up verification or management notification, all without disrupting legitimate work.</p> 
 The Business Case for Deterministic Security  
<p>Beyond the technical advantages, deterministic security provides substantial business benefits that extend beyond the security department.</p> 
<p>Organizations implementing deterministic identity assurance have reported significant improvements. For example, the HYPR Total Economic Impact report indicates that organizations can achieve a 324% 3-year ROI by deploying HYPR passwordless MFA.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=bd08d20c-dcc3-4693-91f9-b334d0eed4c5&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
<p>This includes benefits like: &nbsp;</p> 
  
  Business Risk Avoidance: Organizations can avoid $3,321,036 in business risk, due to an average 80% reduction in passwords.  
  Help Desk Cost Avoidance: There is a 95% reduction in password reset tickets, leading to $3,086,623 in help desk cost avoidance. &nbsp;  
  End-User Productivity Increase: A 30% faster authentication contributes to an increase in end-user productivity, valued at $3,246,711.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  These figures demonstrate that the impact of enhanced security measures goes beyond just preventing breaches. By reducing the burden on IT support and improving user workflows, organizations can reallocate resources to strategic initiatives and improve overall operational efficiency.
<br> 
 The Time for Deterministic Security Is Now  
<p>Troy Hunt's experience, while unfortunate, provides invaluable lessons. It underscores the urgent need for a paradigm shift in security – a shift towards deterministic, phishing-resistant solutions. HYPR is at the forefront of this shift, championing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> and continuous identity assurance as the future of security.</p> 
<p>We commend Troy for being so transparent and forthcoming in sharing the details of this incident. His openness not only demonstrates integrity but also provides critical insights for the entire security community. By walking us through what happened and how it could have been prevented, Troy is helping to raise awareness and drive better practices that can ultimately prevent future attacks like this.</p> 
<p>Don't wait for a breach to expose your vulnerabilities. Take proactive steps to secure your organization with deterministic identity assurance solutions.</p>

The alpha version of our Living Stewardship Agreement, being used in the&nbsp;field.<p>Since the last update, Radicle Civics has been developing prototypes to realise our vision of civics set out in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/radicle-civics-building-proofs-of-possibilities-for-a-civic-economy-and-society-ee28baeeec70">our blog</a>. We’ve explored what it means to “expand our understanding of citizens […] to include humans and more-than-humans,” and “reconfigure the ways in which we collectively relate and interact with one another, towards non-coercive, empathic, caring, and peer-to-peer systems.”</p><p>We believe that a non-monetary and care-based economy requires new tools to practically make sense of the world in this relational, multivalent way. This update focuses on the Living Stewardship Agreement tool we’ve been developing. For complex systems without clear boundaries, it helps actors make sense of their interdependence, and uses pro-social feedback loops to incentivise the fulfilment of mutual commitments, towards the system’s overall thriving.</p><p>We’ve started with the stewardship of river bioregions which fit this governance characteristic, but we think this approach can be applicable to different contexts.</p> Unbounded commons, a critical problem space for governance <p>While the governance of commons and common pool resources are well-established by Elinor Ostrom and others, they require “clearly defined boundaries” in both the membership and the resources governed and “must be able to exclude others” as essential criteria to their success (Ostrom, 1990). We like to call these ‘bounded commons’.</p><p>However, there is the vast remainder of commons where this criteria is not met, with ambiguous, multiple, or shifting boundaries (which we call ‘unbounded commons’). The governance model of a bounded area and membership under shared protocols is not easily applied. A river is a classic example, entangling a vast bioregion of ecologies, land uses, watersheds and shifting populations, but also manifesting in a linear, natural place and a fluid resource.</p><p>For these unbounded commons, we need to shift to a model of a networked system, focusing on relationality and interdependence between actors, nested across multiple scales. This is already being echoed in theoretical discourse, such as the <a href="https://ecologyandsociety.org/vol29/iss1/art33/">Social-Ecological Systems framework</a> which applies complex systems theory in governing humans and more-than-humans as a coherent&nbsp;system.</p><p>But how a centralised set of rules are enforced also needs rethinking in an unbounded context, where there is no fixed locus of authority. While digital commons are addressing this through decentralised technology, where participation is conditional on compliance, it is problematic to apply exclusion for physical places. In these cases, it may make sense to shift to a commitment-based approach, where individuals acknowledge and declare their commitments to each other for the thriving of the overall system. For this to work, information sharing across actors is critical to enable adaptive governance, where individuals adjust and coordinate their actions in feedback loops, in response to the health of the system. But not only that, social meaning must also be shared alongside this information, where a commitment is underpinned by an incentive system to fulfil&nbsp;them.</p><p>The challenge is how this conceptual approach can be applied in a practical context, and made intuitive so that all citizens can make sense of their role in this network of interdependence. We are strategically building the LSA to do exactly this, a practical tool for co-creating a collective picture of relationships and commitments to each other, and encouraging the practising and deepening of these commitments through feedback loops, to create an emergent ‘culture’ of stewardship. We are starting with rivers in the UK as a demonstrator for this approach, <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5802/cmselect/cmenvaud/74/report.html">where their mismanagement arising from siloed approaches</a> is a big part of the public debate, and is creating the demand for distributed, civil society-driven approaches to governance and stewardship.</p> Can commitment-based approach help realise the Rights of&nbsp;Nature? <p>This journey began when we were asking how we achieve an expanded civics that includes more-than-humans. We’ve been closely following the work of the rights of nature movement, which tackles the same question by including nature, from rivers, lagoons to ‘mother earth’ itself, as subjects that could have rights that can be enforced using the legal system. Rights of nature approaches act as interfaces between the ecosystem and the legal system of&nbsp;humans.</p><p>But while the groundbreaking precedents set by rights-of-nature initiatives are remarkable achievements in and of themselves, we still had reservations about how they essentially tried to shoehorn ecosystems into our human-centric (and flawed) institutions.</p><p>For example, for the granting of legal personhood to the Whanganui River, which was transformational milestone in both Indigenous and ecological rights, the governance structure introduced was very much ‘horizon 1’: it established a ‘two guardians’ office, Te Pou Tupua, which has a representative of the New Zealand Government, and another representing the Whanganui Iwi Maori tribe who have long-standing customary rights and responsibilities towards the river. The guardians are in turn supported by advisory and strategy&nbsp;groups.</p><p>This way of organising relationships, though creating an interface with Indigenous laws and customs, nevertheless has recognisable influences of conventional and hierarchical and bounded corporate structures. Now that rights-of-nature precedents have already been set in multiple contexts, we challenged ourselves to imagine what the next horizon approaches towards a more-than-human civics could&nbsp;be.</p> Strategies for a more-than-human civics <p>Our hypothesis for a ‘horizon 2’ more-than-human civics requires three elements:</p>  Relational Civic Systems: new underlying systems of organising that move beyond simple hierarchical and bounded models, to those structured to reflect the actual complex and relational nature of our world. E.g. moving from top-down hierarchies to decentralised networks.  Relational Interfaces: our existing models are entrenched in part because they are simple to understand and use (e.g. property ascribes a widely-understood set of rights and responsibilities to the owner, at the exclusion of others). In moving towards complex, more-than-human civic systems, interfaces can help the transition and make them more intuitive. These can be anything from new narratives, models, to technology. These can also serve different functions, such as representing more-than-humans, helping us overcome objectification and rebuild empathy, or even mediating between multiple actors with different needs.  Commitment Engines: while many forms of voluntary actions and relationships exist in civil society, they are often still underpinned by the power of the state to be the enforcer of last resort. In Radicle Civics’ aspiration for “non-coercive, empathic, and caring” systems, we also need to move beyond these human-centric models of enforcement, especially if they are to be legitimate for a civics that includes more-than-humans. Commitment Engines explore how prosocial incentive systems, such as promises and peer recognition and review, can be used instead to create a culture of care in this new kind of&nbsp;civics.  <p>As part of this process, we have been collaborating with partners such as Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences’s <a href="https://civicinteractiondesign.com/">Civic Interaction Design group</a> (working on the research project called <a href="https://circulateproject.nl/">Charging the Commons</a>), <a href="https://nieuweinstituut.nl/projects/zoop">Zoöp Nieuwe Instituut</a> (with <a href="https://zoop.earth">Zoönomic Institute</a>), and the urban interfaces group at the Utrecht University (<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/governing-the-digital-society">Governing the Digital Society</a>) to explore the different manifestations of Relational Interfaces. You can read more about the workshops <a href="https://circulateproject.nl/2024/05/03/workshop-relational-interfaces-design/">here</a> and the public talk <a href="https://nieuweinstituut.nl/en/events/charging-commons-workshop">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQqYegKxzNLpyc5FtVuBetCqFuF0vXtn/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>.</p> Reimagining ‘the social contract’ for a more-than-human civics <p>Researching rights-of-nature initiatives also led us to revisit the debates around the nature of rights. Extending rights to living agents and even earth systems, provoked fundamental questions about rights-based frameworks, such as how their scope is defined, how they are constructed, and how they are granted and/or claimed. <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/1619/1/wenarl8.pdf">Leif Wenar’s Nature of Rights</a>, building on the conceptual framework of Hohfeldian incidents, remains very influential on our thinking.</p><p>But perhaps the more practical and pressing question we were faced with was, if we declare nature has rights, how can they be made real? This thought had been bubbling up through our work on the <a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">River Dôn Project</a>, where we have been organising workshops and events with members of the river community as part of the <a href="https://festivalofdebate.com/2023">Festival of Debate 2023 programme</a> in Sheffield.</p><p>At these workshops we heard from <a href="https://www.friendsofthecam.org/">Friends of the River Cam</a>, who invited us to experience their annual river rights declaration ceremony. On the summer solstice of 2023, a group of people who care about the River Cam gathered in a circle by the river to declare the river’s rights, reciting them collectively. These rights&nbsp;are:</p>  The right to flow&nbsp;freely;  The right to express essential functions of flooding, moving sediment, recharging groundwater and sustaining biodiversity;  The right to be free from pollution;  The right to replenish and be fed by sustainable aquifers;  The right to native biodiversity;  The right to restoration;  The right to maintain connections with other streams and&nbsp;rivers.  <p>Before the ceremony ended, people pledged to act as guardians of the River Cam and committed to reducing threats to its health and survival. They called on all people to engage with the river in a relationship of respect and stewardship and to cease its exploitation. We were moved by the power of this moment of ritual, not only in how it brought together the river community, but also recentred our minds on our physical and spiritual connection with the&nbsp;river.</p>Friends of the River Cam’s rights declaration ceremony, 2023.<p>It was also a thought-provoking moment. We can declare a river has rights, but how exactly are they manifested?</p><blockquote>“The Rights of Man […] were supposed to be independent of all governments; but it turned out that the moment human beings lacked their own government […] no institution was willing to guarantee them.&nbsp;”</blockquote><p>— Hannah Arendt in The Origins of Totalitarianism</p><p>The current initiatives to embed rights-of-nature in law reminded us of Hannah Arendt’s concept of the ‘right to have rights’ in The Origins of Totalitarianism. While rights are claimed to be universal or natural, they rely on the power and authority of the state to be enforced. Those that are excluded from a political community, i.e. a state, also lose access to institutions that can guarantee those rights, effectively becoming rightless. While Arendt at the time was referring to stateless refugees, this can also be seen as an analogy for nature. If we extend our political communities to include nature, would that be enough to guarantee their&nbsp;rights?</p><p>Ideas like these draw heavily on ‘social contract theory’ which is highly influential on Western conceptions of civics. In particular, it echoes the ideas of John Locke, who believed that as part of this social contract, people consent to subject themselves to the power of government, in order for their rights to be protected.</p><p>Yet in the river contexts we are working with, especially the UK, <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5802/cmselect/cmenvaud/74/report.html">the government has already failed to protect the health of water bodies</a>, regardless of whether the river is deemed the subject of rights, or an object of good regulation. Granting a river rights or personhood, while creating avenues for legal action and accountability (however slow and expensive), still requires the power of the state to fix, or to compel individuals and organisations to fix our rivers. For us, this raises a question: whose responsibility is it to ensure the river has “the right to be free from pollution”? And is it enough that rights allow redress when things go wrong, or is that already too late? Shouldn’t we instead shape the way we think about everyday practices of active stewardship, and how these can be encouraged?</p><p>It is curious that social contract theorists often define organised societies against ‘the state of nature’, the chaotic and brutish world that was a free-for-all. Yet given what we know about ecosystems now, this was a caricature. Instead, we now know that ecosystems are intricately entangled interactions of many agents, each responding through feedback loops to the rest of the system, to create a delicate, dynamic equilibrium, as part of an adaptive process. So what if we answered the question of “where do rights come from?” in a more ecocentric way, rather than to impose the logic of centralised human authority onto a more-than-human world?</p> A new eco-social contract needs a new grammar of commitment <p>Based on the <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/radicle-civics-building-proofs-of-possibilities-for-a-civic-economy-and-society-ee28baeeec70">worldview shifts we want to realise in Radicle Civics</a> (a world of agents entangled together in commoning relationships), we want to explore how civic systems could ensure the ultimate goal of collective thriving. Rights are but one way of ensuring this goal, by declaring a set of entitlements against which actors are held accountable. The true character of a rights-based system only is revealed in how a conflict of different actors’ rights are resolved.</p><p>Yet as discussed above, to seek remedies for violated rights may already be too late. Our hypothesis is that these rights are more meaningful when they are manifested day-to-day instead of at the point of redress. As Paul Powesland, the founder of the River Roding Trust (RRT) explained in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/05/river-roding-barrister-paul-powlesland-london-polluters-footpaths">an interview</a> about their stewardship work in that river, “The RRT and local people are already upholding the rights of the Roding. I relate to the river as a sacred entity, and I’m doing whatever I can to uphold those rights, through law, campaigning or direct action. It comes from the wellspring of the belief that the Roding is sacred, it is a being and it does have rights, and I will manifest those in whatever way I&nbsp;can.”</p><p>As such, we believe we should create systems which encourage humans and more-than-humans to recognise, coordinate, and fulfil their responsibilities and obligations to each other in the system as part of an ongoing practice of stewardship. This is a mutualist approach to&nbsp;rights.</p><p>This mutualist idea was also inspired by what we saw in <a href="https://festivalofdebate.com/2023/everyday-life-as-a-knot-of-flows-collective-mapping-river-don">our workshop collectively mapping our entanglements with the River Don</a>, how everyone stepped up and took responsibility towards realising the river’s rights, and practised everyday acts of care to support the collective thriving of the bioregion. Not only did this include the <a href="https://dcrt.org.uk/">Don Catchment Rivers Trust</a>, who were the driving force behind delivering ecological restoration projects, but this also included individuals such as farmers (who need to plough their land for cultivation) considering how to do so while preventing run-off into the river, to wild swimmers and walkers, whose advocacy and volunteering to improve water quality recognises the entanglement between their enjoyment of nature with the ecosystem health on which they depended. In a context where centralised authorities were failing to guarantee these conditions for the river’s thriving, the coalition of citizens and civic groups were taking up the mantle, overcoming human-centric jurisdictional boundaries and departmental silos, and each playing their part to realise the conditions needed.</p><p>We felt that this approach to rights requires new informational tools, not only for recording and communicating rights, but also practicing them in a coordinated way. The idea of a singular Charters and Declarations, to be enforced by courts, seemed at odds with our idea of rights based on everyday practices of mutual stewardship. A new grammar of the social contract and rights are&nbsp;needed.</p><p>Here, we were influenced by what we learned during the Holochain Foundation’s Hackathon, where we experimented with Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun, and Joss Clifford-Frith. In the Hackathon, we attempted to build a tool that would support the operation of this mutualist social contract, using Holochain. Holochain is an open-source framework for building decentralised, peer-to-peer applications. In particular, its agent-centric principles define both the system architecture and the emergent social dynamics of apps based on the framework, based on <a href="https://www.holochain.org/how-does-it-work/">“mutual sovereignty”</a> — where individuals have agency but can freely associate by agreeing to the shared rules. This includes an individual’s sovereignty over their identity and the data they create, where they are stored on their own machine. But it also differs from other decentralised approaches, such as blockchain, where it does not require a global consensus to operate (that has its own centralising tendencies creating a single source of truth). Instead, it opts for ‘consensus-free’ design patterns, only requiring consensus at a local scale involving parties involved in a given transaction.</p>An (very incomplete) sample of how this relational grammar could be visualised, for a river&nbsp;context.<p>The technology’s architecture aligned with our proposed eco-social contract. At the Hackathon, we hypothesized how to structure this contract in a decentralized, peer-to-peer manner.</p><p>Agents (Users): These are the human users of the tool who participate in the stewardship ecosystem. They can do it either as themselves or also represent more-than-human actors (e.g. plants, animals, etc) — more on that below. (Under the Holochain framework, ‘agents’ only refer to the human users of the application.)</p><p>Actants: These include both the humans (including individuals and organisations) and more-than-humans who are part of this stewardship ecosystem. More-than-human actants can be represented by one or more human stewards who act and use the tool on their behalf, similar to the way interspecies councils&nbsp;operate.</p><p>Relationships: These reflect our entanglements in the stewardship ecosystem. These relationships are bidirectional by definition: they are in effect rights of nature reimagined in a mutualistic way. Each relationship records one condition an actant needs to thrive (their right), and how it is realised by other actant(s) commitments or promise to care. While the most obvious definition of relationships may be the material conditions needed for thriving (e.g. habitat, nutrition), the design of this model is designed to keep this open-ended for other interpretations of relationships, whether they focus on informational, cultural or spiritual conditions, intentionally without categorisation. For us, the idea of the ‘promise’ builds on cultural norms of how commitments are practiced.</p><p>This grammar of the eco-social contract becomes a relational interface: it creates a knowledge structure of the ecosystem that is explicitly centred around actants and a relationships register (rather than, say, a geographical map which emphasises territories and a top-down worldview). This also becomes a foundation for a commitment engine that encourage the practicing of these relationships:</p><p>Feedback: This is an eco-centric approach inspired by ideas of self-regulating ecosystems through feedback loops. In this case, these feedback loops are created within the knowledge structure. Any agent can submit feedback for any relationship: whether the relationship has been initiated, revised, or ended, whether the conditions to thrive have been fulfilled or breached, or even just open-ended reflections, in multiple forms of media, such as text and&nbsp;images.</p><p>Vouching: In line with a voluntary, non-centralising system, the knowledge structure of relationships and their feedback is also agnostic about asserting a “single source of truth”. Rather, the community is allowed to draw their own conclusions from a transparent knowledge structure. One key way is that other agents can vouch for the feedback provided, as a signal that the feedback is recognised and verified by&nbsp;peers.</p><p>Instead of centralised enforcement through compulsion, this open registry of peer-verified feedback allows different actants to be held accountable for their commitments through ongoing peer review and social reputation, and also encourages the rest of the community to adjust their behaviour accordingly through peer-to-peer signalling. This is based on a principle of adaptive governance, where feedback enables a continual learning process. Rather than a static charter of rights, it becomes a ‘living’ piece of collective ecosystem intelligence, where the medium of agreement has built-in mechanisms for encouraging self-compliance.</p> Living Stewardship Agreement: the alpha&nbsp;version Living Stewardship Agreement: the alpha version, showing the relationship network map, relationship, and feedback&nbsp;views<p>Based on the model above and our engagements with various river and other ecological communities, we have created a working prototype of an eco-social contract, which we call the Living Stewardship Agreement (LSA). For the sake of usability (especially in the field) and rapid iteration, we have built this prototype as a web app rather than a Holochain one, while preserving its decentralised ethos at a social&nbsp;level.</p><p>The LSA is not meant to be thrust upon a community in isolation; rather, it is designed to be introduced as one part of a strategy of community engagements, with the mission of bringing together civil society actors to recognise and fulfill their commitments to more-than-humans, to actualise the rights of&nbsp;nature.</p><p>To introduce the LSA to communities, we’ve been holding different kinds of public engagements as part of the River Dôn Project that introduce relational thinking to the public. This includes river walks, where the embodied experiences of nature can be contextualised by both visible and tacit relationships revealed by co-hosts who hold ecological knowledge (e.g. Don Catchment Rivers Trust). We’ve also held workshops, as discussed above, where stakeholders individually map their own entanglements with the river ecosystem, and deconstruct how their own care commitments are linked to other actants’ conditions to thrive, and vice versa. Communities during these engagements record these relationships on the LSA, setting up the beginnings of a relational network of their bioregion.</p><p>Once the relational network is set up, the user interface of the LSA is designed to help grow the network, and encourage the practice of its relationships and commitments. Users are presented with a (currently rudimentary) visualisation of the relationship network, showing the registered users/agents in the outer ring, the human and more-than-human actants they steward, and the relationships that connect them. At a glance, important nodes in the ecosystem can be gauged intuitively by the density of connections, such as relationships that involve many actants, or actants that impact many&nbsp;others.</p><p>With the further development of the LSA, we hope to explore different methods of making complex relational networks intuitive, whether it is drawing high-level insights from the network analysis, exploring alternative approaches to visualisation, or even using AI for ‘River Storyteller’ to distill the relationship dynamics into compelling narratives, that help citizens engage with the river ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>The LSA is designed to be used by stewards on a regular basis. On the home page, under the relationship network map, users are first presented with a newsfeed of the latest Feedback for the ecosystem, encouraging users to review, vouch for, and if they feel is necessary, take stewardship action in response, which in turn they can record as more feedback.</p><p>Any user can provide feedback, regardless of whether they are part of the relationship or not — after choosing a relationship on which to provide feedback, they can give their feedback a title, and for the content, they can add text or a photo. They also choose one of the predefined categories of feedback:</p>  Sign: An actant of the relationship can add a ‘Sign’ feedback as a way of signing their consent to initiating a relationship. Human stewards could also ‘sign’ on behalf of the more-than-human actants they steward. This serves a way of validating relationships.  Breach: An actant can report when the commitments of the relationship are not fulfilled, with evidence recorded in the text or photo content of the feedback.  Fulfillment: An actant can report when the commitments of the relationship are fulfilled, with evidence recorded in the text or photo content of the feedback.  Review: An actant can propose an amendment to the relationship, if they notice that the context or content has changed. These changes can again be consented to by ‘Sign’ feedback from the actants involved.  Termination: The opposite of a ‘Sign’ feedback, if a relationship is no longer active, this type of feedback signals an actant’s intention to leave the relationship. A relationship where all its actants have given a ‘Termination’ feedback could reasonably be interpreted as&nbsp;ended.  <p>Crucially, the system preserves a transparent, complete record of all feedback, but remains agnostic on a ‘single source of truth’. Instead, it allows the collective wisdom of the community to judge, based on which feedback has been most vouched for, and also where relationships have been ‘signed’ by all involved.</p><p>Users can also grow the network, when they discover previously unrecognised actants or relationships. The Actants section lists actants on the network. Users can view each actant’s page, which lists agents who steward each actant. Users can also recognise a new actant, giving it a name, photo, and inviting other agents to become stewards of the new&nbsp;actant.</p><p>Similarly, the Relationships section shows a list of all relationships in the system, and allows users to view each relationship’s page. This page shows which actant(s) hold the condition needed to thrive, and which actant(s) commitments to care to realise these conditions. It also shows all the feedback logged against a relationship, and allows the user to provide more. Users can also recognise a new relationship, where the relationship name, the condition and care commitments, and the actants involved are recorded.</p><p>The use of the tool records the community’s evolving knowledge of an ecosystem through the lens of relationships. This gradually builds up a valuable body of collective intelligence that shapes the stewardship response of individuals and the collective, and can be used for future applications, such as citizen science, ethnographic research or training a Storyteller AI.</p> Testing in context and broader applications <p>We have started testing it with communities in context, to validate our hypothesis of whether a tool that makes relationships and commitments tangible supports the stewardship of the ecosystem in a holistic way, while enabling self-coordination across an unbounded commons.</p><p>To begin testing, we are looking to partner with ecological stewardship communities that operate with this characteristic. This includes initial conversations with organisations such as <a href="https://codydock.org.uk/">Cody Dock</a>, based on the Lower Lea River, who consist of both a small, dedicated biodiversity and environmentalist team and a larger but transient body of volunteers who participate in varying levels of regularity — they anticipate that the LSA, by acting as a source of information on what different stakeholders have committed to and are doing, can support the encouragement and coordination of their stewardship activities across this loose-knit community.</p>Surge Cooperative’s Long Wall Ecology Garden, in Newham, London. (Image credit: Surge Cooperative)<p>Another community we look forward to working with is <a href="https://www.surge.coop/">Surge Cooperative</a>, where a group of residents who live on (e.g. barges on community moorings) or near the Channelsea river in Newham, London, engage with a diverse but fluid public through their regular ‘eco-gathering’ engagement events which combine art practice and conservation, and also collectively steward areas around the river, including the Long Wall Ecology&nbsp;Garden.</p><p>The approach of the LSA recognises that ecological stewardship communities hold deep-rooted and diverse knowledge of their local river and have the capability for sensitive acts of restoration. But this knowledge is spread unevenly, depending on the depth and length of a member’s engagement with that community. This also means that the coordination of stewardship activities is often reliant on a few lead actors, and collective knowledge is very vulnerable to the comings and goings of community members. This partnership recognises that encouraging community-led restoration and advocacy for the river needs a space for sharing knowledge and establishing a resilient, wide-spread stewardship culture. The LSA, as part of a wider participatory approach, can become that digital space, deepening a community’s interconnectedness with water bodies and environments, and each other, through a collective process of understanding and mapping their interrelationships.</p><p>Surge Cooperative anticipates that the Living Stewardship Agreement will be a place to record the tacit knowledge held by all parts of this community who have different levels of engagement with the river. Surge Cooperative are especially interested in the possibility of the LSA being a collective place for the ‘thick’ or ‘warm data’ about the Channelsea river generated by the actants’ feedback, recognising the value of the social contexts, emotions, meanings and stories that exist around the ecosystem. After all, we believe that making sense of one’s place in the ecosystem is a social and cultural challenge beyond just a scientific one, especially in an man-made urban environment such as the Channelsea river. Through this social meaning-making is how we can truly embed a culture of stewardship.</p><p>Surge Cooperative will be testing the LSA on a long-term basis in the coming year, for at least six months — they hope that the collective intelligence generated can support their negotiations to have formalised stewardship roles with institutional stakeholders around the river. The most prominent example is that Surge Cooperative has been granted by a historic ‘Tomlin order’ from the court, granting them a right to negotiate access to river spaces with the Port of London Authority, the Channelsea’s riverbed owner, for joint stewardship. The collective intelligence accumulated through the participatory process of using the LSA can be used as an evidence base for their stewardship impact, and inform the co-development of stewardship plans in the coming months tailored around the community’s capabilities.</p><p>This will also be an opportunity for us to test the LSA approach longitudinally with a community, and we will be collecting feedback in the process to inform the next versions of the LSA and its strategic roadmap. In particular, we would like to see how the LSA has changed how individuals make sense of their place in the ecosystem’s network of interdependency, their stewardship role, and ultimately their actions. We would also like to explore to what extent the commitment engine’s information-sharing and pro-social incentives encourage and sustain stewardship activity. We hope to be conducting and publishing this research in collaboration with Dr Sharon Prendeville from Loughborough University, who connected us with Hannah White and Stephen Shiell (co-founders of Surge Cooperative), to maximise its impact not only in this water space, but also the wider discourse on Social-Ecological Systems.</p><p>Beyond ecological stewardship communities, we are also exploring how the relational structure of the LSA can be used in a variety of contexts where a reorientation from focusing on boundaries to relationships can also support more generative outcomes. These&nbsp;include:</p>  Climate City Contracts: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">building on Dark Matter Labs’ past work with Sweden’s Viable Cities</a>, the LSA can be used as an open digital register for recording a citizen’s civic commitments towards other actants to support climate transition, with the commitment engine’s feedback loops helping achieve self, collective, and public accountability.  Crofter’s Purposeful Use Declaration: In <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/downloads/655b1bb264fac_SLC-DML_Discussion-Paper_for%20publication.pdf">our work with the Scottish Land Commission</a>, we’ve identified how crofting’s notion of ‘purposeful use’ currently focuses on compliance with the Croft Commission’s requirements. By using the LSA as a register for crofters to self-declare how their ‘purposeful use’ of land benefits the croft’s wider relationships, the approach leans into the tight-knit nature of rural communities and changes the dynamic from one of compliance to pledging, encouraging peer recognition and knowledge sharing across the crofting community, creating a rich data source for articulating the added value of crofting.  <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/property-beyond-introducing-a-new-part-of-the-dark-matter-labs-ecosystem-4acf70b16431">FreeLand</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/freehouse-tkaronto-4e6c2d27967a">FreeHouse</a>: One opportunity of transitioning from private to self-ownership is recognising the many relationships that exist around the land and the house. The medium of the LSA can allow these relationships and commitments to be practised in a peer-to-peer way with distributed accountability, beyond the bounded governance associated with traditional structures, which rely on fixed memberships that fractionalise and dilute ownership (e.g. boards, trustees, committees etc) rather than remove&nbsp;it.  <p>If you are in a context where a relational, commitment-based governance approach can be supported by the LSA, or if you can imagine alternative applications, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:radiclecivics@darkmatterlabs.org">radiclecivics@darkmatterlabs.org</a>!</p><p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pocalvin/">Calvin Po</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fang-jui-chang/">Fang-Jui ‘Fang-Raye’ Chang</a>, incorporating ideas from Alexandra Bekker, Indy Johar, and showcasing Shu Yang Lin and Gurden Batra’s work building the first prototype. We would like to extend a special thanks to Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun, and Joss Clifford-Frith for prototyping this idea with us, and James Lock, Alban Krashi, the Festival of Debate, Sharon Prendeville, Hannah White, and Stephen Shiell for exploring how we can explore the LSA in their contexts.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-an-eco-social-contract-the-living-stewardship-agreement-33a8f950c84a">Towards an eco-social contract: the Living Stewardship Agreement</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Navigating the FATF Travel Rule with Ease

Simplify compliance with the FATF Travel Rule using iComply's integrated platform. Automate data collection, ensure secure information sharing, and stay ahead of regulatory changes.

<p>Meet James—a compliance officer at a FINRA-regulated firm managing security tokens and tokenized funds. James is used to navigating complex regulations, but the FATF Travel Rule has added a new layer of pressure.</p>



<p>It starts with a client transferring cryptoassets to another platform. James knows the Travel Rule requires his firm to collect and share key information—names, wallet addresses, and account details—every step of the way. But the process quickly becomes overwhelming.</p>



 
 First issue: His team is manually verifying transaction details across different tools. 



 Next challenge: There’s no standard way to securely share data with other platforms. 



 Final complication: International transfers bring inconsistent rules that make compliance feel like guesswork. 
 



<p>By the end of the day, James feels more like a crisis manager than a compliance leader.</p>



<p>Now imagine a different scenario—where compliance with the Travel Rule is frictionless, thanks to iComply’s integrated compliance platform.</p>



 



 Simplifying the Travel Rule with iComply 



<p>With iComply, James’ compliance process transforms from reactive to proactive. When a client initiates a tokenized fund transfer, the system automatically collects and verifies all required data.</p>



 
 Automated Data Collection: Instead of juggling spreadsheets, iComply pulls client data, validates it, and attaches it to the transaction in real time. 



 Secure, Seamless Transmission: Information is shared through secure APIs, ensuring encrypted, standardized communication across platforms. 



 Regulatory Intelligence: iComply stays updated on regulatory changes globally, helping James’ firm remain compliant across jurisdictions. 
 



<p>The result? No more manual checks, last-minute fixes, or uncertainty during audits.</p>



 



 Turning the Travel Rule Into a Competitive Edge 



<p>The FATF Travel Rule is a reality for SEC and FINRA-regulated firms—and non-compliance isn’t an option. But firms that adopt smart solutions like iComply can:</p>



 
 Enhance data security: Protect sensitive client information with automated, encrypted verification. 



 Simplify workflows: Replace manual steps with streamlined processes that save time and reduce costs. 



 Build trust: Show clients and regulators that your firm is proactive, not reactive, about compliance. 
 



<p>James no longer spends his day scrambling to keep up with regulatory demands. Instead, he has confidence that his compliance framework is future-proofed and built to scale.</p>



<p>The Travel Rule doesn’t have to be a burden—it can be a chance to lead. With iComply, your firm can turn complexity into confidence. Ready to make compliance a competitive advantage? Let’s talk.</p>

									         MONKE Business   <p>I spent some time in Eden this morning. It wasn’t as paradisiacal as promised.<br><br>In my quest to find true art on Solana&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SOL.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=from-bs-to-bullish">$SOL.X ( ▲ 7.18% )</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;and to spotlight all marketplaces, given the decentralized nature of this emerging technology — I found myself stranded in the prestige-gated-PFP-collection-laden, last-cycle-coded wasteland that is Magic Eden.</p>  <p><a href="https://magiceden.us/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=from-bs-to-bullish">Magic Eden</a>&nbsp;caters —&nbsp;or rather panders — to the PFP collectoor. Now, I’m all for cute, pseudonymous JPEGs for profile pictures. Mine is literally a stoned cat in a karting helmet, so who am I to talk? But I can’t ignore pointing out that this interface is hardly showcasing the art, technology, or even the communities whose membership contracts are on sale. ME is multi-chain, they’ve got Bitcoin Runes! They have the potential to be the Phantom wallet of the NFT ecosystem on Solana, yet functionally, they’re just another OpenSea rip-off with no discernible vision.</p>  <p>But enough trashing the supposed NFT paradise. I’m contractually obligated to review art, so in keeping with the OG spirit of NFT PFP collections, let me wax poetic on some pixel art apes.</p>  <p>Solana Monkey Business DAO&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/MONKE.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=from-bs-to-bullish">$MONKE.X ( ▲ 2.43% )</a>&nbsp;is truly the poor man’s Bored Ape Yacht Club&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/BAYC.NFT?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=from-bs-to-bullish">$BAYC.NFT ( 0.0% )</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;although it’ll still take $2,000 – $3,000 USDC to get you in on the floor. The project bills itself as the first NFT DAO on Solana, and admittedly has boasted a fervent community for almost 4 years now. (I started following them last cycle before the FTX implosion. They do the normal DAO stuff: loosely supporting and funding projects from holders in their community who’ve hung around participating. We happen to know a few local holders here in KC.)</p>  <p>One of the missed opportunities that I just see as such obvious low hanging fruit is onboarding small business owners (SMBs) to leverage Solana’s amazing payment rail system and process USDC transactions via a PoS system. I mean, it wouldn’t exactly be off-brand for a collection called Monkey&nbsp;Business.&nbsp;But I digress. You’d just think community builders with a vision of Solana adoption would want to onboard the fiat masses with such an easy, impactful MVP. Especially when merchants routinely complain about card processing fees. But I’m not a product engineer or anything…</p>  <p>Anyway, if you want to see an NFT platform with vision, checkout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ovation.network/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=from-bs-to-bullish">Ovation</a>. They’re the all-in-one app for your NFTs and community — like Magic Eden, they’re also multi-chain, but they foster connections between holders.</p>  <p>Muhammed will likely spotlight the project here in the next few weeks. While we first and foremost celebrate its decentralized nature, we’d be remiss if we didn’t mention it’s being built right here, in Heartland, USA.</p>  <p>— El Prof</p>
