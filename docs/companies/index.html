 Stakers can claim DF77 rewards. DF78 runs Feb 22 — Feb 29,&nbsp;2024.  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 77 (DF77) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 15, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 22. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF78 is live today, Feb 22. It concludes on Feb 29. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF78   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF78 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York.

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

  <p>Over 800,000 organizations rely on Microsoft Entra to navigate the ever-changing threat landscape, ensuring their security while enhancing the productivity of their end users. Customers have frequently expressed their desire for greater transparency into their Entra usage, with licensing being a particularly popular request. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of Microsoft Entra license utilization portal, a new feature that enables customers to optimize their Entra ID Premium licenses by providing insights into the current usage of premium features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll provide an overview of Entra ID license utilization, including what it is, how it works, and how you can optimize your license to get the most out of your Entra ID Premium Licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Entra ID License utilization portal allows you to see how many Entra ID P1 and P2 licenses you have and the usage of the key features corresponding to the license type. We're thrilled that Conditional Access and risk-based Conditional Access usage are available as part of the public preview, but this would be expanded to include usage of other SKUs and corresponding features at general availability. This perspective is an initial stride towards empowering you to comprehend your license count and the value you extract from your Entra license. It also aids in addressing any over-usage issues that might emerge in your tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Try the public preview 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The license utilization &amp; insights portal is available under the “Usage &amp; Insights” blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1. License utilization insights portal under Usage &amp; Insights blade</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This portal would provide you with insights into the top features you’re using that correspond with your Entra ID Premium P1 and P2 licenses (as applicable). You can leverage these insights to secure and govern your users along with ensuring you comply with the licensing terms and conditions. Here is a screenshot of feature usage view you can see in the Entra portal:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3. Entra ID Premium P2 feature usage on License utilization portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll continue to extend this transparency into Entra usage and would love to hear your feedback on this new capability, as well as what would be most useful to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In this episode we talk with Phil Windley, Sr. Software Development Manager at AWS, Cofounder of IIW, former Chair of Sovrin Foundation. We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior. We hope this an interesting episode. We’re glad we got to tell a small part of the Sovrin story as we think a lot of today’s reusable ID projects have their roots in the movement Sovrin started—including Trinsic.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about Phil you can visit his personal website <a href="https://windley.com/">https://windley.com/</a> where you'll find ways to contact him, and buy his new book.</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Discover how one woman is exposing romance scams in our blog,<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/"> ‘What’s love got to do with it? Exposing the romance scammers, with Becky Holmes.’</a>]&nbsp;</p>



 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<p>You’re headed to your favorite drive-thru to grab fries and a cheeseburger. It’s a simple order and as you pull in you notice there isn’t much of a line. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty.</p>



<p>The restaurant is near a busy freeway with roaring traffic noise and airplanes fly low overhead as they approach the nearby airport. It’s windy. The stereo is blasting in the car behind you and the customer in the next lane is trying to order at the same time as you. The cacophony would challenge even the most experienced human order taker.</p>



<p>With IBM® watsonx™ Orders, we have created an AI-powered voice agent to take drive-thru orders without human intervention. The product uses bleeding edge technology to isolate and understand the human voice in noisy conditions while simultaneously supporting a natural, free-flowing conversation between the customer placing the order and the voice agent.</p>



 Watsonx Orders understands speech and delivers orders 



<p>IBM watsonx Orders begins the process when it detects a vehicle pulling up to the speaker post. It greets customers and asks what they’d like to order. It then listens to process incoming audio and isolates the human voice. From that, it detects the order and the items, then shows the customer what it heard on the digital menu board. If the customer says everything looks right, watsonx Orders sends the order to the point of sale and the kitchen. Finally, the kitchen prepares the food. The full ordering process is shown in the figure below:</p>







<p>There are three parts to understanding a customer order. The first part is isolating the human voice and ignoring conflicting environmental sounds. The second part is then understanding speech, including the complexity of accents, colloquialisms, emotions and misstatements. Finally, the third part is translating speech data into an action that reflects customer intent.</p>



 Isolating the human voice 



<p>When you call your bank or utilities company, a voice agent chatbot probably answers the call first to ask why you’re calling. That chatbot is expecting relatively quiet audio from a phone with little to no background noise.</p>



<p>In the drive-thru, there will always be background noise. No matter how good the audio hardware is, human voices can be drowned out by loud noises, such as a passing train horn.</p>



<p>As watsonx Orders captures audio in real time, it uses machine-learning techniques to perform digital noise and echo cancellation. It ignores noises from wind, rain, highway traffic and airports. Other noise challenges include unexpected background noise and cross-talk, where people are talking in the background during an order. &nbsp;Watsonx Orders uses advanced techniques to minimize these disruptions.</p>



 Understanding speech 



<p>Most voice chatbots began as text chatbots. Traditional voice agents first turn spoken words into written text, then they analyze the written sentence to figure out what the speaker wants.</p>



<p>This is computationally slow and wasteful. Instead of first trying to transcribe sounds into words and sentences, watsonx Orders turns speech into phonemes (the smallest units of sound in speech that convey a distinct meaning). For example, when you say “shake,” watsonx Orders parses that word into “sh,” “ay” and hard “k.” Converting speech into phonemes, instead of full English text, also increases accuracy over different accents and actively supports a real-time conversation flow by reducing intra-dialog latency.</p>



 Translating understanding into action 



<p>Next, watsonx Orders identifies intent, such as “I want” or “cancel that.” It then identifies the items that pertain to the commands like “cheeseburger” or “apple pie.”</p>



<p>There are several machine learning techniques for intent recognition. The latest technique uses foundation and large language models, which theoretically can understand any question and respond with an appropriate answer. This is too slow and computationally expensive for hardware-restrained use cases. While it might be impressive for a drive-thru voice agent to answer, “Why is the sky blue?”, it would slow the drive thru, frustrating the people in line and decreasing revenue.</p>



<p>Watsonx Orders uses a highly specific model that is optimized to understand the hundreds of millions of ways that you can order a cheeseburger, such as “No onions, light on the special sauce, or extra tomatoes.” The model also allows customers to modify the menu mid-order: “Actually, no tomatoes on that burger.”</p>



<p>In production, watsonx Orders can complete more than 90% of orders by itself without any human intervention. It’s worth noting that other vendors in this space use contact centers with human operators to take over when the AI agent gets stuck and they count the interaction as “automated.” By our IBM watsonx Orders standards, “automated” means handling an order end-to-end without any humans involved.</p>



 Real-world implementation drives profits 



<p>During peak times, watsonx Orders can handle more than 150 cars per hour in a dual-lane restaurant, which is better than most human order takers. More cars per hour means more revenue and profit, so our engineering and modeling approaches are constantly optimizing for this metric.</p>



<p>Watsonx Orders has taken 60 million real-world orders in dozens of restaurants, even with challenging noise, cross-talk and order complexity. We built the platform to easily adapt to new menus, restaurant technology stacks and centralized menu management systems in hopes that we can work with every quick-serve restaurant chain across the globe.</p>

<div class='wrap'>


<p>Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) is an automated and continuous software-based approach to offensive security. Similar to other forms of security validation such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/red-teaming-101-what-is-red-teaming/">red teaming</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing">penetration testing</a>, BAS complements more traditional security tools by simulating cyberattacks to test security controls and provide actionable insights.</p>



<p>Like a red team exercise, breach and attack simulations use the real-world attack tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by hackers to proactively identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by actual threat actors. However, unlike red teaming and pen testing, BAS tools are fully automated and can provide more comprehensive results with fewer resources in the time between more hands-on security tests. Providers such as SafeBreach, XM Cyber, and Cymulate, offer cloud-based solutions which allow for the easy integration of BAS tools without implementing any new hardware.</p>



<p>As a security control validation tool, BAS solutions help organizations gain a better understanding of their security gaps, as well as provide valuable guidance for prioritized remediation.</p>



<p>Breach and attack simulation helps security teams to:</p>



 
 Mitigate potential cyber risk: Provides early warning for possible internal or external threats empowering security teams to prioritize remediation efforts before experiencing any critical data exfiltration, loss of access, or similar adverse outcomes. 



 Minimize the likelihood of successful cyberattacks: In a constantly shifting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">threat landscape</a>, automation increases resiliency through continuous testing. 
 



 How does breach and attack simulation work? 



<p>BAS solutions replicate many different types of attack paths, attack vectors and attack scenarios. Based on the real-world TTPs used by threat actors as outlined in the threat intelligence found in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mitre-attack">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> and Cyber Killchain frameworks, BAS solutions can simulate:</p>



 
 Network and infiltration attacks 



 Lateral movement 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/phishing">Phishing</a> 



 Endpoint and gateway attacks 



 Malware&nbsp;attacks 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ransomware">Ransomware</a> attacks 
 



<p>Regardless of the type of attack, BAS platforms simulate, assess and validate the most current attack techniques used by advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other malicious entities along the entire attack path. Once an attack is completed, a BAS platform will then provide a detailed report including a prioritized list of remediation steps should any critical vulnerabilities be discovered.</p>



<p>The BAS process begins with the selection of a specific attack scenario from a customizable dashboard. Besides running many types of known attack patterns derived from emerging threats or custom-defined situations, they can also perform attack simulations based on the strategies of known APT groups, whose methods may vary depending on an organization’s given industry.</p>



<p>After an attack scenario is initiated, BAS tools deploy virtual agents within an organization’s network. These agents attempt to breach protected systems and move laterally to access critical assets or sensitive data. Unlike traditional penetration testing or red teaming, BAS programs can use credentials and internal system knowledge that attackers may not have. In this way, BAS software can simulate both outsider and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/insider-threats">insider attacks</a> in a process that is similar to purple teaming.</p>



<p>After completing a simulation, the BAS platform generates a comprehensive vulnerability report validating the efficacy of various security controls from firewalls to endpoint security, including:</p>



 
 Network security controls 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edr">Endpoint detection and response</a> (EDR) 



 Email security controls 



 Access control measures 



 Vulnerability management policies 



 Data security controls 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/incident-response">Incident response</a> controls 
 



 What are the benefits of breach and attack simulation? 



<p>While not intended to replace other <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> protocols, BAS solutions can significantly improve an organization’s security posture. According to a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3762274">Gartner research report</a>, BAS can help security teams uncover up to 30-50% more vulnerabilities compared to traditional vulnerability assessment tools. The main benefits of breach and attack simulation are:</p>



 
 Automation: As the persistent threat of cyberattacks grows year over year, security teams are under constant pressure to operate at increased levels of efficiency. BAS solutions have the ability to run continuous testing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, without the need for any additional staff either on premises or offsite.&nbsp;BAS can also be used to run on-demand tests, as well as provide feedback in real time. 



 Accuracy: For any security team, especially ones with limited resources, accurate reporting is crucial for efficient resource allocation—time spent investigating non-critical or falsely identified security incidents is wasted time. According to <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/local/upload/file/Damballa%20Malware%20Containment%20FINAL%203.pdf">a study by the Ponemon Institute</a>, organizations using advanced threat detection tools such as BAS experienced a 37% reduction in false positive alerts. 



 Actionable insights: As a security control validation tool, BAS solutions can produce valuable insights highlighting specific vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, as well as contextual mitigation recommendations tailored to an organization’s existing infrastructure. Additionally, data-driven prioritization helps SOC teams address their most critical vulnerabilities first. 



 Improved detection and response: Built on APT knowledge bases like MITRE ATT&amp;CK and the Cyber Killchain, and also integrating well with other security technologies (e.g., <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/siem">SIEM</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/security-orchestration-automation-response">SOAR</a>), BAS tools can contribute to significantly improved detection and response rates for cybersecurity incidents. <a href="https://www.safebreach.com/resources/reports/esg-report-the-impact-of-breach-and-attack-simulation-tools-on-security-operations">A study by the Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)</a> found that 68% of organizations using BAS and SOAR together experienced improved incident response times. Gartner predicts that by 2025, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3981104">organizations using SOAR and BAS together will experience a 50% reduction</a> in the time it takes to detect and respond to incidents. 
 



 Breach and attack simulation and attack surface management 



<p>While integrating well with many different types of security tools, industry data indicates a growing trend toward integrating breach and attack simulation and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface-management">attack surface management (ASM)</a> tools in the near future. As Security and Trust Research Director of the International Data Corporation, Michelle Abraham said, “Attack surface management and breach and attack simulation allow security defenders to be more proactive in managing risk.”</p>



<p>Whereas <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/vulnerability-management">vulnerability management</a> and vulnerability scanning tools assess an organization from within, attack surface management is the continuous discovery, analysis, remediation and monitoring of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors that make up an organization’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface">attack surface</a>. Similar to other attack simulation tools, ASM assumes the perspective of an outside attacker and assesses an organization’s outward-facing&nbsp;presence.</p>



<p>Accelerating trends toward increased cloud computing, IoT devices, and shadow IT (i.e., the unsanctioned use of unsecured devices) all increase an organization’s potential cyber exposure. ASM solutions scan these attack vectors for potential vulnerabilities, while BAS solutions incorporate that data to better perform attack simulations and security testing to determine the effectiveness of security controls in place.</p>



<p>The overall result is a much clearer understanding of an organization’s defenses, from internal employee awareness to sophisticated cloud security concerns. When knowing is more than half the battle, this critical insight is invaluable for organizations seeking to fortify their security.</p>

<p>A large, multinational automobile manufacturer responsible for producing millions of vehicles annually, engaged with IBM to streamline their manufacturing processes with seamless, automated inspections driven by real-time data and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>As an automobile manufacturer, our client has an inherent duty to provide high-quality products. Ideally, they need to discover and fix any defects well before the automobile reaches the consumer. These defects are often expensive, difficult to identify and present a myriad of significant risks to customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Quality control and early defect detection are paramount to uphold standards, enhance operational efficiency, reduce costs and deliver vehicles that meet or exceed customer expectations while safeguarding the reputation of the manufacturer.</p>



 How IBM helped the client better detect and correct defects during manufacturing 



<p>IBM worked with the client’s technical experts to deploy IBM® Inspection Suite solutions to help them reduce defects and downtime while enabling quick action and issue resolution. The solutions deployed include fixed-mounted inspections (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/visual-inspection">IBM® Maximo® Visual Inspection Mobile</a>) and handheld inspections (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/inspector-portable">IBM® Inspector Portable</a>). Hands-free wearable inspections (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/inspector-wearable">IBM® Inspector Wearable</a>) were also made available for situations that required a head-mounted display.</p>



<p>While computer vision for quality has existed in more primitive states for the last 30 years, the lightweight and portable nature of IBM’s solution, which is based on a standard iPhone and uses readily available hardware, really got our client’s attention. The client loved the fact that the solution can be used anywhere, at any time, by any of their employees—even while objects are in motion.</p>



 Scaling to 30 million inspections for an immediate and significant reduction in defects 



<p>The IBM Inspection Suite improved the client’s quality inspection process without requiring coding. The client found the system to be simple to train and deploy, without the need for data scientists. The system learned quickly from images of acceptable and defective work products, which enabled the solution to be up and running within a matter of weeks. The implementation costs were also lower than those of viable alternatives.</p>



<p>The ability to deliver AI-enabled automation by using an intuitive process in their plants allowed this client to scale this user-friendly technology rapidly across numerous other facilities where it aided in over 30 million inspections. The customer almost immediately realized measurable success due to the significant reduction in defects.</p>



<p>Voted on by the leaders of the client’s technical community, the client awarded their annual IT Innovation award to IBM for the technology they believed delivered the greatest value-driving innovation to their company. In presenting the award, the client’s executives declared that a discussion with IBM about transformation led to a focus on improving manufacturing quality with AI automation.</p>



<p>The Inspection Suite supported the client’s quality initiatives with in-station process control and quality remediation at the point of assembly or installation. The solution also provided continuous process improvement that is helping the client lower repair and warranty costs, while improving their customer satisfaction.</p>



 Transparency and trust in AI 



<p>By bringing the power of IBM’s deep AI capabilities, deployable on cost-effective edge infrastructure, across the client’s plants, IBM Inspection Suite enabled the client to deliver higher quality vehicles to their customers. The client is now expanding to additional plants and use cases thanks to their collaboration and innovation with IBM.</p>



<p>All the team members at IBM were honored that this client recognized them for their business and technical achievements. We believe that this recognition reflects the IBM values of client dedication and innovation that matters. It is a direct acknowledgment of the value IBM Inspection Suite provides to clients.</p>



<p>IBM’s mission is to harness the power of data and AI to drive real-time, predictive business insights that help clients make intelligent decisions.</p>

<p>Data monetization empowers organizations to use their data assets and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to create tangible economic value. This value exchange system <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-to-accelerate-your-data-monetization-strategy-with-data-products-and-ai/">uses data products</a> to enhance business performance, gain a competitive advantage, and address industry challenges in response to market demand.</p>



<p>Financial benefits include increased revenue through the creation of adjacent industry business models, accessing new markets to establish more revenue streams, and growing existing revenue. Cost optimization can be achieved through a combination of productivity enhancements, infrastructure savings and reductions in operating expenses.</p>



<p>In 2023, the global data monetization market was valued at USD 3.5 billion, and experts project it to reach USD 14.4 billion by 2032, demonstrating a <a href="https://www.imarcgroup.com/data-monetization-market">compound annual growth rate of 16.6% from 2024 to 2032</a>.</p>



 Treating data as a strategic asset 



<p>Data is one of the most valuable&nbsp;intangible assets for organizations. Therefore, adopting a holistic approach that prioritizes data-driven business transformation helps optimize value extraction. This transformation harnesses the power of data within the organization, enabling enterprise-wide cost optimization and unlocking net new direct revenue opportunities.</p>



<p>When it comes to data optimization, most organizations focus solely on infrastructure cost reduction. However, those that embrace data-driven business transformation strategies can multiply the benefits by considering revenue growth potential, optimizing costs across infrastructure, development, maintenance and enhancing data security and compliance.</p>



Figure 1: Data driven business transformation



<p>Critical aspects of data-driven business transformation are the overall data monetization strategy and how data products are used. Data insight and AI automation drive cost optimization with predictive maintenance, process automation and workforce optimization. AI automation substantially reduces data security and compliance risks by proactively identifying and analyzing the severity, scope and root cause of threats before they impact the business.</p>



<p>The net effect of data-driven business transformation is increased compliance, productivity and effectiveness via automation across different business units, such as sales, marketing and services. This leads to revenue uplift through opportunities to create new services and channels.</p>



 Identifying data products 



<p>Industries across the board are experiencing a surge in enterprise data volume, presenting both challenges and opportunities. These challenges, along with specific industry needs and use cases, influence the types of data products organizations or markets require.</p>



<p>Data products are assets developed from a company’s internal data sources or by combining internal and public data, augmented with AI to extract unique insights that help drive business decisions. Managed as products, these data assets come with defined service contracts, repeatable delivery methods and a clear value proposition.</p>



Figure 2: The data product lifecycle



<p>The banking industry, for example, faces the following challenges:</p>



 
 Competition from agile and innovative financial technology and challenger banks. 



 High degree of regulatory control. 



 Need to protect sensitive information. 



 Organizational data silos that impede a unified customer experience. 



 Pressure to increase margins and identify new revenue streams. 
 



<p>To address these challenges, organizations create relevant use cases that address their specific needs, as well as the needs of the market at large. The following sample use cases show associated data products and corresponding financial benefits.</p>



Use CaseImprove lending decision-making to reduce riskDrive behavior-based recommendations and personalizationDevelop customer service strategies based on comprehensive customer dataData ProductEconomic climate risk analysisCustomer behavior insightsUnified view of customer economic dataFinancial BenefitsImproved market share predictability and revenue growth. Reduced costs through risk mitigation.Enhanced understanding of customer preferences. Increased revenue growth through personalized product offerings. Improved user experience.Increased customer lifetime value through tailored services. Reusable, integrated data across organizational silos. Scroll to view full table  



<p>Data products can be created for internal use across various functions or business units. When an organization shares its data internally and consistently to improve efficiency and achieve qualitative or quantitative benefits, it is referred to as internal data monetization.</p>



<p>Data products can also be created for wider external consumption across multiple organizations and ecosystems. When data is shared externally to achieve strategic and financial benefits, it is referred to as external data monetization.</p>



 AI-driven data platform economics 



<p>An AI-driven organization is one where AI technology is fundamental to both value creation and value capture within the business model. A data monetization capability built on platform economics can reach its maximum potential when data is recognized as a product that is either built or powered by AI.</p>



Figure 3: Data platform economics



<p>In the collection-led model, data from external and internal sources, such as data warehouses and data stores, is fed into analytical tools for enterprise-wide consumption. At the enterprise level, business units identify the data they need from source systems and create data sets tailored exclusively to their specific solutions. This leads to a proliferation of organizational data and added pipeline complexity, which can pose challenges in upkeep and use for new solutions, directly affecting costs and timeliness.</p>



<p>As enterprises shift from collection-led to product-led models, data products are created by using external and internal data sources, along with analytical tools. Once developed, these data products can be made available to business units within the organization for real-time data sharing and analytics. Also, these data products offer opportunities for monetization through ecosystem partnerships.</p>



<p>In a platform-driven approach, business units build solutions by using standardized data products and combining technologies to reduce work, simplify the enterprise data architecture and decrease time to value.</p>



<p>The data platform offers data-enriched data products that use machine learning, deep learning and generative AI. Those AI-driven data products can virtualize and integrate disparate data sources to create domain-specific AI models using proprietary enterprise data. Data platform services enable data products to be provided as SaaS services, a single data mesh deployed across the hybrid cloud and authenticated, secure and audited data product delivery.</p>



<p>When organizations connect their valuable data and AI assets to wider user groups, they can use the multiplier effect from the consumption and evolution of data products, as well as the market reach from scalable cloud distribution.</p>



 The economic impact of data monetization 



<p>Organizations usually develop a business case spanning 3 to 5 years to gain a comprehensive view of short-, mid- and long-term economic benefits. Successful cases address market demands to remain competitive, foster scalability, and constantly pursue cost optimization and revenue enhancement opportunities.</p>



Figure 4: Economic impact of data monetization



<p>The graph above shows the incremental revenue potential from data monetization over a 5-year period. In an example organization with USD 2 billion in revenue, the baseline revenue from data is USD 5 million (0.25% of the overall revenue). If the organization follows the traditional approach, revenue from data might grow by 10% year-on-year, from USD 5 million to USD 6.7 million in three years, just 1.34 times the baseline revenue.</p>



<p>In contrast, data monetization can act as a force multiplier and <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Analytics/Our%20Insights/Fueling%20growth%20through%20data%20monetization/Fueling-growth-through-data-monetization.pdf">contribute to upwards of a 1% increase in a company’s revenue</a>. With data monetization capabilities, revenue from data could potentially grow from USD 5 million to USD 20 million in 3 years, representing a fourfold increase compared to the baseline revenue.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.rtinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Forrester-PowerPoint-Template-Guidelines.pdf">recent economic impact reports</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/9X4AX5WK">the cost of building</a> a data monetization capability is less than the baseline revenue from data. Therefore, an organization might allocate a portion of its existing data revenue in the first year to build a data monetization capability.</p>



 Getting started with data monetization 



<p>Organizations can start by defining their data monetization strategy and identifying the data products. Then, they can create their data monetization capability by developing an integrated AI-driven data platform. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-data">IBM Cloud Pak® for Data</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-integration">IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration</a>, IBM® <a>watsonx.data</a>™ and IBM® <a>watsonx.ai</a>™ provide them with that holistic platform.</p>



<p>We recommend a discovery workshop where you’ll explore your data and AI ambitions to determine your first data product. In a 4 to 6-week sprint, we’ll collaborate to craft a vision for your platform architecture and develop a proof of concept for the first data product design. This comprehensive process includes the development of the initial data product, the creation of a roadmap for future products, and the establishment of a supporting business case.</p>

<p>Last Friday, we <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-step-by-step-guide-on-verifying-bitcoin-non-custodial-wallet-ownership-through-user-signing">published a blog post</a> that explained the user signing process on the Bitcoin network using Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Today, we’re going to delve into the user signing process on the Ethereum network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the type of address you want to&nbsp;sign <p>First, we have to choose the type of cryptocurrency address to sign with, which is the Ethereum network in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 2: Connect Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Next, choose one of the four wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>If you don’t have a wallet account, tap on the “I don’t have a wallet” option on the left side of the screen. This will take you to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet#main-content">the Ethereum Foundations’ list of supported wallets</a>.</p><p>For this section, we chose&nbsp;Ledger.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Live <p>Now, you have to connect with Ledger Live, which you can do either through Ledger Live Mobile or the Ledger Live&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>For this guide, we will do it through the&nbsp;desktop.</p> Step 4: Connect to User&nbsp;Signing <p>You’ll then be prompted to connect to User Signing (dev.usersigning.shyft.network). Right click on both Ethereum and Polygon “Test on User Signing” options and click on the “Connect” button.</p> Step 5: Sign&nbsp;Address‍ <p>On this page, you will also see your selected Ethereum wallet address. Click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to a pop-up screen asking for your public key to continue the User Signing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Next, you have to open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p> Step 6: Open Your Ledger Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Now open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p><p>Next, on your Ledger device, you will be asked to confirm that you are the trust anchor of this public key and you own the given&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s it. You have now finished signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>After you sign the message, you’ll get a signature proof. This confirms that you own your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>We will now see a similar process on&nbsp;Trezor.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the Ethereum Network from the two available options — Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet‍ <p>Next, select from the four available wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and Trezor. For this segment, we will choose&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Scan&nbsp;Accounts <p>Now, click on the “Scan Accounts” button to get a list of your Ethereum wallet addresses. Doing so will take you to the next screen, where Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing&nbsp;service.</p><p>On this page, you have to click on the “Export” button. This helps you verify the address you own without exposing your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 4: Choose an Ethereum Wallet&nbsp;Address <p>Now, you will see a list of all your Ethereum addresses. From this list, choose the one address that you want to use for the User Signing process and click on the “Connect” button.</p><p>Once you do that, your Trezor wallet will be connected to Shyft User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>Here, you have to click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to the pop-up screen asking you to allow signing with your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>To sign the Ethereum message, click on the “Allow Once for This Session”&nbsp;button.</p> Step 6: Open Your Trezor Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Follow the instructions on your Trezor device and confirm that you are the trust anchor and own the given Ethereum wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>Next, your Trezor device will prompt you to confirm ownership of the address and verify you as the trust anchor for the public&nbsp;key.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>The verification is now complete, generating a signature proof. This confirms your Ethereum address ownership.</p><p>📽️ If you want to watch a video of the entire process, you can find it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), ensuring the legitimacy of transactions to comply with regulatory standards such as the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining user privacy is crucial. However, this was easier said than done until <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Shyft launched User Signing</a> in late December last&nbsp;year.</p><p>With Shyft User Signing, VASPs now have a user-friendly and secure way for users to prove ownership of their non-custodial wallets.</p><p>In this guide, we outline the user signing process on the Bitcoin network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>The first step in the user signing process is to select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. In this case, we are focusing on the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step is to choose the hardware device that you will use to connect to your Bitcoin wallet. For this section, we will proceed with&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Trezor&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connecting your Trezor device is straightforward. Once you’ve selected Trezor as your hardware wallet, you’ll be prompted to connect the device to your computer and enter your&nbsp;PIN.</p><p>The service will then communicate with your Trezor to prepare it for&nbsp;signing.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing service. This is a crucial step as it allows the service to identify which address you’re proving ownership of without compromising your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>With your public key exported, the next step is to sign a message. This is done through the Trezor interface, where you will see a prompt to sign a Bitcoin message. Follow the instructions on your Trezor device’s screen to complete this&nbsp;step.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>Upon successful signing, you will receive a signature proof. This is a cryptographic string that proves you have signed a message with the private key corresponding to your public Bitcoin&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now, we will see a similar process with Ledger, another popular hardware crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. We selected the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step involves selecting your hardware device, which was Ledger in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connect your Ledger device to your computer, enter your PIN, and open the Bitcoin application on the device. The interface will then establish a connection with your Ledger and prepare it for the user signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Your Ledger will now ask permission to export your public key to the user signing service. This step is essential for the service to verify your address ownership securely.</p> Step 5: Sign the&nbsp;Message <p>Once your public key is exported, sign the message using your Ledger. Here, you will see the details of the message to sign. Now, confirm the message on your Ledger device to complete the signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>After signing the message, you’ll receive a signature proof — a cryptographic verification that you have used your private key to sign the message without exposing it. This proof is used to confirm ownership of your Bitcoin address securely.</p> Conclusion <p>User signing is a must-have for VASPs to keep transactions secure and compliant. With this guide, VASPs can help their users confidently verify their non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, making sure everyone’s on the same page with clear and secure processes.</p><p>If you wish to check the video of this entire process, you can head over here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>In an era of accelerating <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk-Lu-gZiEAxVSj4kEHQQ1BWEQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibm.com%2Ftopics%2Fclimate-change&amp;usg=AOvVaw3szVX0AYWBbNffiB4v7AEv&amp;opi=89978449">climate change</a>, predicting the near-future can yield major benefits. For instance, when utility officials are aware that a heat wave is on its way, they can <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/mercados-emi">plan energy procurement</a> to prevent power outages. When farmers in drought-prone regions are able to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-and-texas-am-agrilife-provide-data-technology-and-expertise-to-farmers-in-need/">predict which crops are susceptible to failure</a>, they can deploy additional irrigation.</p>



<p>These proactive measures are made possible by evolving technologies designed to help people adapt to the effects of climate change today. But what will the impacts of climate change be in the future? And how will humans adapt to them then?</p>



 Climate models provide answers 



<p>Human activities precipitated changes to the Earth’s climate in the 20th century and will largely determine the future climate. Significant reductions in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> could help mitigate the climate crisis. Under a higher emissions scenario, however, the 21st century would see much more severe consequences of climate change.</p>



<p>Global climate models have given climate scientists a set of expectations as to what the future could hold, both for the Earth at large and for specific regions. Climate modeling consists of using datasets and complex calculations to represent the interactions between major climate system components—namely, the atmosphere, land surface, oceans and sea ice.</p>



<p>One of the latest climate modeling initiatives come through a partnership between IBM and NASA. The collaboration is currently focused on building an AI-powered <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/weather-climate-foundation-model">foundation model</a> to make climate and weather applications faster and more accurate. The model could potentially be used to identify conditions that raise the risks of wildfires and predict hurricanes and droughts. An earlier model built through the IBM-NASA partnership became a tool to help scientists map urban heat islands in the United Arab Emirates and monitor reforestation in Kenya.</p>



<p>According to the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the US’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA), “Climate models reduce the uncertainty of climate change impacts, which aids in adaptation.”1</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the models’ predictions for the changing climate as well as how society could adapt.</p>



 Average global temperature increases 



<p>The most well-known sign of climate change, rising surface temperatures—also known as global warming—is a result of the greenhouse effect: the process in which increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases act as a barrier, trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. According to the European Union climate monitor Copernicus, 2023 was the warmest year on record—nearly 1.48 degrees Celsius (2.66 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than 19th century pre-industrial levels.2</p>



<p>How much higher will temperatures climb? Predictions range as high as 5 degrees Celsius or more by the end of the 21st century, according to the Climate Science Special Report from the U.S. Global Change Research Program. However, sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could cap the temperature rise at 2 degrees Celsius or less.3</p>



<p>While the transition from fossil fuels to clean, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/renewable-energy-history/">renewable energy</a> sources is already underway, accelerating this transition could help further limit emissions, even amid rising global energy needs. The International Energy Agency predicts that a combination of renewable energy and nuclear power will meet more than 90% of increased demand by 2025.4</p>



 More extreme heat and heat waves 



<p>As global warming progresses, heat waves will become more common and more intense. The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts people living in Africa, Australia, North America and Europe will face health risks due to rising temperatures and heat waves.5</p>



<p>The Global Disaster Preparedness Center recommends policymakers and others adopt a range of measures to help their regions adapt to higher heat. These include steps to reduce surface temperatures—like establishing more green spaces and designing buildings with vegetative layers on their roofs—to creating cooling centers and spray parks.6</p>



 More intense droughts and water scarcity 



<p>Global warming is causing more intense droughts and affecting water storage on land, decreasing access to freshwater. The IPCC projects that water available for human use will continue to decline in North America, while water security will be at risk in Africa, Asia and South America. Droughts and water scarcity will also impact crop growth, undermining food security. Parts of Africa will be especially vulnerable, with agricultural yields declining by as much as 50% in some areas.7 In addition, drier conditions are extending wildfire seasons around the world.</p>



<p>Nature-based and technological solutions offer some avenues for adapting to drier conditions. Studies show that planting trees combats desertification and triggers greater rainfall,8 while <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/food-security-smallholder-farmers/">artificial intelligence-powered climate forecasts and crop data analysis</a> can help farmers make informed decisions on crop management under challenging circumstances. Around the world, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-16-IBM-Furthers-Commitment-to-Climate-Action-Through-New-Sustainability-Projects-and-Free-Training-in-Green-and-Technology-Skills-for-Vulnerable-Communities?_ga=2.19402744.1984713725.1702473547-1643077335.1670424615&amp;_gl=1*1s6m076*_ga*MTY0MzA3NzMzNS4xNjcwNDI0NjE1*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTcwMjQ4NjEzMy4xMDguMC4xNzAyNDg2MTMzLjAuMC4w">AI-powered climate models and other technologies</a> can help scientists, government officials and utilities providers forecast water access conditions and improve water resource management.</p>



 Evolving precipitation patterns and flooding 



<p>As some parts of the Earth get drier, others will get wetter. Even if the temperature rise is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC predicts heavy precipitation and flooding to become more frequent and intense in Africa, Asia, North America and Europe. Storms and tropical cyclones are also expected to intensify.</p>



<p>Policymakers are looking to a variety of strategies to mitigate coastal and inland flooding, including the installation of canals, drainage systems and rainwater storage systems, as well as the preservation and restoration of “spongey” natural barriers like dunes, mangroves and wetlands. In some cases, the latter can mean rolling back older flood mitigation strategies. In a city in China, for instance, officials removed a concrete flood wall to make room for plants and overflow ponds.9</p>



 Changing ocean chemistry 



<p>Global warming and greenhouse gas emissions are changing the composition of the world’s oceans and will continue doing so through the end of the century, according to the IPCC. As the global average temperatures rise, ocean oxygen levels will keep declining in what’s known as ocean deoxygenation. Ocean acidification will also continue. Both processes are considered harmful to sea life.</p>



<p>Key to mitigating these changes is reducing carbon emissions, but there are other solutions as well. Runoff and water pollution contributes to deoxygenation; according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Resources, legislation monitoring and limiting run-off could help.10 On the ocean acidification front, some scientists are hopeful about a new technology for removing acid from seawater.11</p>



 Global sea level rise 



<p>Sea levels rose rapidly in the 20th century, largely due to melting glaciers and ocean thermal expansion. That trend is expected to continue: NASA found that since 1993, the average rate of global mean sea-level rise has increased from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inches) per year to 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year.12 Ongoing sea level rises may be driven by instability and disintegration of ice shelves and ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. The IPCC predicts that the global mean-sea level will increase as much as 0.29 meters (0.95 feet) by 2050 and by 1.01 meters (3.3 feet) by the end of the century.13</p>



<p>As with flooding, adapting to sea level rise can take the form of both manmade and nature-based solutions, including erecting physical barriers such as seawalls and levees and restoring or preserving natural barriers such as wetlands. Considering rising sea levels during the design of infrastructure and building projects could make those structures more resilient: In California, for instance, transportation officials are planning to lift a portion of a busy highway 30 feet on account of rising sea levels.14</p>



 Ecosystem changes and biodiversity loss 



<p>Changes in earth’s climate system will include changes to ecosystems and wildlife populations. Research shows, for example, that much of the Amazon is approaching the tipping point of transforming from rainforests to savannah due to wildfires and droughts, endangering the species that call the forests home.15 Meanwhile, global warming and resulting marine heatwaves are continuing to imperil coral reefs, with the IPCC projecting a 70% to 90% decline in coral reefs once global average temperatures are 1.5 degrees Celsius higher. Breaching that temperature threshold would also result in 4% of mammals losing at least half their habitat, according to the United Nations.16</p>



<p>Monitoring, conservation and restoration efforts can help save ecosystems and animals. In Europe, policymakers approved a law in 2023 setting nature restoration objectives for the European Union, including binding targets to restore at least 30% of degraded habitats in EU countries by 2030 and 90% by 2050.17</p>

<p>In today’s complex global business environment, effective <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-management">supply chain management (SCM)</a> is crucial for maintaining a competitive advantage. The pandemic and its aftermath highlighted the importance of having a robust <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">supply chain strategy</a>, with many companies facing disruptions due to shortages in raw materials and fluctuations in customer demand. The challenges continue: <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/tech-and-regionalization-bolster-supply-chains-but-complacency-looms">one 2023 survey</a> found 44% of companies had to make changes in the past year due to issues with their supply chain footprint, and 49% said supply chain disruptions had caused planning problems.</p>



<p>But with the right tools and priorities, each step in the process can run smoothly. Here’s how companies are using different strategies to address supply chain management and meet their business goals.</p>



 Why supply chain management matters 



<p>Supply chain management involves coordinating and managing all the activities involved in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sourcing">sourcing</a>, procurement, conversion and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-logistics">logistics</a>. It includes everything from product development and strategic decision-making to information systems and new technologies. But perhaps most relevant today are the capabilities within SCM to help mitigate disruption.</p>



<p>Supply chain disruptions are caused by a variety of factors, from pandemics, natural disasters and political instability to supplier bankruptcy and IT failures. To <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">mitigate these risks</a>, companies need the resources and technology to develop robust contingency plans.</p>



<p>On top of disruption, companies with global supply chains must also deal with different regulatory environments, cultural norms and market conditions. They need strong SCM practices to help work out the logistics of transporting goods across long distances and through multiple countries without creating longer lead times or delays.</p>



<p>Effective SCM initiatives offer several benefits:</p>



 
 Lower operational costs: By optimizing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/inventory-management">inventory levels</a>, improving warehousing efficiency and streamlining order fulfillment processes, companies can save on storage, labor and transportation expenses. 



 Better customer satisfaction: An <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-optimization">optimized supply chain </a>allows businesses to make sure products are available when and where people want them—which can improve relationships and loyalty with customers. 



 Fewer disruptions: A healthy supply chain mitigates risks and protects against inevitable disruption. By developing contingency plans and resilient supply chains, companies can continue to operate even when unexpected events occur. 
 



 Key strategies for effective supply chain management 



<p>There are a number of ways that companies can better optimize and manage their supply chains. Here are the areas some businesses are focusing on as they refine their overall approach:</p>



 Forecasting and demand planning 



<p>Companies can reduce storage costs and avoid stockouts or overstock with help from accurate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/demand-planning">demand forecasting</a>, which uses historical sales data, market research and economic trends to predict future market demand for products or services.</p>



<p>Big data and predictive analytics are increasingly being used to improve forecasting accuracy, allowing businesses to respond more effectively to changes in customer needs. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/mro-inventory-optimization">Advanced software tools</a> can automate some parts of forecasting, providing real-time updates and alerts when inventory levels are too high or low.</p>



 Automation 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">Automation </a>can streamline supply chain operations, from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/order-management">order fulfillment</a> to inventory tracking. It can take many forms, from automated warehouse systems that pick and pack orders, to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts">blockchain-based smart contracts</a> to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/transaction-manager">software that automates purchasing and invoicing processes</a>. These technologies can significantly reduce manual labor, minimize errors and speed up processes, leading to increased efficiency and cost savings.</p>



 Technology-driven visibility 



<p>AI and machine learning can be used to analyze large amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing insights that can improve forecasting, inventory management, and customer service. <a href="https://impact.economist.com/projects/trade-in-transition/">A 2023 survey</a> found that a third of businesses are using <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> to improve resource and supply chain planning, and more than a third said using digital tools for inventory management was the most effective strategy in cutting overall supply chain costs.</p>



<p>Real-time tracking systems, often enabled by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices, help companies monitor their supply chain accurately and immediately. Having visibility into the status and location of goods as they move through the supply chain helps companies monitor supplier performance, identify bottlenecks and respond quickly to disruptions. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/control-towers">supply chain control tower</a> can connect many sources of data-driven information and improve end-to-end visibility.</p>



<p>Moreover, enterprise resource planning (ERP) software can integrate different aspects of a business into one system, providing a holistic view of operations and the metrics needed to streamline supply chain processes. Integrated supply chain analytics software, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/supply-chain-planning">IBM Planning Analytics</a>, connect complex data sets for more insightful analytics and scenario analysis that can help avoid demand-and-supply mismatches or fulfillment delays.</p>



 Sustainable and ethical sourcing 



<p>Companies are trying to ensure that every stage of their supply chains is adhering to responsible practices. This not only helps satisfy customer desire for sustainability and ethical products but also helps mitigate risks, such as regulatory penalties or reputational damage.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ethical-sourcing">Ethical sourcing</a> involves ensuring that the products and services a company procures are produced under fair, safe and environmentally friendly conditions. This may involve conducting audits of suppliers, implementing codes of conduct and using certification schemes to verify compliance. Sustainable sourcing, meanwhile, focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of the supply chain. This might involve partnering with suppliers who use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a>, reducing packaging or implementing recycling programs.</p>



<p>Blockchain technologies can increase transparency and traceability in the supply chain, helping to prevent fraud and ensure product authenticity. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/food-trust">IBM Food Trust®</a>, a collaborative network of growers, processors, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers and others, uses blockchain technology to improve visibility and accountability across the food supply chain.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-33406">Access the Food Trust ebook</a>



 Building strong partnerships 



<p>Strong relationships are a key part of any business strategy. When it comes to supply chains, strong connections with providers, distributors and other key stakeholders in the supply network can help companies improve resilience. Partnerships can facilitate better communication, collaboration and responsiveness, particularly in times of disruption. They can also provide access to new markets, technologies, and expertise, offering a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Because finding the right suppliers can be challenging, some businesses turn to technology to help. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/trust-your-supplier">IBM® Trust Your Supplier</a>, a supply chain risk management software solution, helps ensure suppliers and other partners in the supply chain meet global and industry standards, provides continuous monitoring and risk assessment and uses blockchain-based information management to ensure transparency and traceability.</p>



 Effective supply chain strategy for the future 



<p>Whether it’s through forecasting, automation, sustainable sourcing, strong partnerships or new technologies, there are numerous strategies companies can employ to optimize supply chain planning and execution. By doing so, they can improve profitability, meet customer demand and ensure their business is resilient in the face of disruptions.</p>

<p>In many organizations, but not all, customer service is treated as part of the customer experience. Both are interested in driving customer satisfaction, but they focus on different parts of the customer journey to achieve it. So what are the key differences in customer service vs. customer experience? And why do both matter for your business?</p>



<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">Customer experience</a>, or CX, is a holistic accounting of customers’ perceptions resulting from all their interactions with a business or brand, whether online or in-store. Customer experience involves <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/">customer experience management</a> (CXM), which refers to strategies, technologies and practices for improving business results by creating an ideal experience for anyone interacting with a company. The overall customer experience focuses on meeting customer expectations and influencing the customer’s overall perception of products and solutions wherever they take place on the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-experience">customer journey</a>.</p>



<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-trends/">customer service</a> refers to the actions that an organization takes to ensure that customers are satisfied with their products post-purchase. Customer service, which can also be called customer support or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/customer-care">customer care</a>, is much more customer-facing than many parts of customer experience. Providing great <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-types/">customer service</a> involves making important decisions about pricing, branding, positioning, and use cases.</p>



<p>Customer-centric organizations should aim to excel at both customer experience and customer service. Therefore, it’s worthwhile to explore more deeply where the two are similar and where they differ.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=news-urx-51964">Subscribe for customer and employee experience topic updates</a>



 Customer service vs. customer experience across the customer journey 



<p>The simplest key difference between CX and customer service is that CX is concerned with meeting customer needs during the entire customer journey. Customer service is focused on post-purchase. As such, CS is considered a subset of CX.</p>



<p>CX teams are concerned with both short-term tactics and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/">long-term strategy</a>. They are thinking about the holistic picture of the entire customer journey from awareness to consideration to purchase and post-purchase.</p>



<p>Customer journey mapping involves defining the touchpoints throughout the lifecycle of engagements with prospects and customers. A customer journey involves many touchpoints over the entire lifecycle of customer engagement. The assumptions behind customer journey mapping are that prospects or customers are being purposeful at each touchpoint—trying to solve a problem, answer a question, compare options, or cross something off a to-do list.</p>



<p>One way to think about the intersection of customer experience and customer service is to map out the marketing funnel. Doing so demonstrates how CX oversees the entire process, whereas customer service is activated for specific functions.</p>



 
 Awareness: This starts with the customer learning about the organization and its solutions, and potentially exploring competitors’ solutions. They might sign up for email messages or follow the organizations on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transformation-of-the-digital-customer-experience/">social media</a>. 
 



 
 Consideration: After they understand the value propositions, they may ask questions or do further research. 
 



 
 Purchase: When a customer is ready to make a purchase, customer service activates. The function helps customers with any questions when they are finalizing purchases and can facilitate the purchase if a customer cannot buy online or in-store. 
 



 
 Loyalty: The moments immediately after a purchase are incredibly important for generating customer loyalty. The customer service function helps ensure that customers know how to use the product they purchased. CS is also available to answer further questions or solve problems afterward. Companies often create customer success teams, which can be a part of customer service or the sales team, to provide tutorials and best practices on maximizing the use of a product. The goal is to help those customers use the product as quickly, simply and satisfactorily as possible. 
 



 
 Advocacy: Creating loyal customers unlocks the possibility that some of them tell people in their network about an organization’s products or even potentially laud the value of the customer experience it provides. Creating customer advocates helps the customer experience function perform better. That is because new prospects come into the funnel already ‘warmed’ by the positive sentiment from previous customers. 
 



 CX and CS tools 



<p>Both customer experience and customer service disciplines rely on valuable tools to maximize their value.</p>



 Key customer experience tools: 



<p>CX teams use tools that help them see and take strategic actions across the entire customer journey.</p>



 
 Customer relationship management (CRM) tools enable organizations to collect, track, and analyze data resulting from customer interactions <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-experience-trends/">across channels</a>. 
 



 
 A/B test software, which can provide different messaging to website visitors to identify which resonates the most. CX teams, working directly with UX teams, can use software to create variations of a message and track which one leads to the most purchases or time that is spent on the site. 
 



 
 Dynamic recommendations for other products or accessories based on previous product purchases. 
 



 Key customer service tools: 



<p>While customer service teams will likely use the previously mentioned tools, some others are much more aligned with CS team roles and responsibilities.</p>



 
 Self-service chatbots that interact with customers to provide answers to their questions.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/"> Customer service interactions</a> are increasingly powered<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/"></a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/customer-service-future/"></a> by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> and generative<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence"> artificial intelligence</a> (AI). 
 



 
 Web-based knowledge bases where users can find articles, FAQs and videos to walk them through how to solve issues and use their products or services correctly. 
 



 
 A webpage that provides customers with multiple ways to reach the organization to talk to customer support representatives. 
 



 
 Proactive email or text messages to customers who inquire how the product is performing and provide instructions and tips on how to use it. 
 



 CX and CS metrics are different 



<p>Both customer experience and customer service involve measurement of their activities to ensure that they are successful in meeting customer needs. Many revolve around capturing customer feedback and measuring real-time responses. And while some common KPIs relate to both disciplines, others are more closely aligned with one than another.</p>



 Key customer experience metrics: 



 
 Customer satisfaction score (CSAT): CSAT is the percentage of respondents who claim to be satisfied (4) or very satisfied (5) in surveys that are offered after a touchpoint experience. 
 



 
 Net Promoter Score (NPS): NPS gauges how likely a person is to recommend a company or its products to others. People are asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how likely they would recommend it to others. Scores 6 or less are subtracted from the number of 9s and 10s to create a percentage. It is best considered a customer experience metric because it can occur during any part of the customer journey. 
 



 
 Customer Effort Score (CES): After a touch, the customer is asked how easy or difficult it was to accomplish their goal, rating the difficulty from 1 (easy) to 5 or 7 (difficult). 
 



 
 Customer retention rate: Maintaining high customer retention rates demonstrates a successful customer experience function and enhances the bottom line by increasing customer lifetime value. Increasing customer loyalty and limiting churn means that customers are either satisfied with the product or solution or have yet to find a good replacement. 
 



 Key customer service metrics: 



 
 First Response Time (FRT): How long it takes for customer support teams to respond to a customer problem or request. It is a sign of good customer service for an organization to be able to respond immediately to a customer issue, whether on social media, email, chat room, or phone call. 
 



 
 Average Resolution Time (ART): This involves how long it takes from the beginning of a customer service interaction until the issue is resolved. 
 



 
 Issue resolution rate: This relates to how many customer service issues are successfully addressed and resolved. While a customer service team cannot expect to resolve every issue, failure to solve almost all issues is a sign of an issue. 
 



 CS and CX together ensure that organizations are caring for customers 



<p>Today’s consumers are more discerning and have more options than ever. To delight your customers and remain competitive, you should personalize every touchpoint across the entire customer experience (CX). True personalization at scale involves all aspects of your business, from marketing and messaging to supply chain, sales, and service.</p>

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

<p>Customers and partners that interact with your business, as well as the employees who engage them, all expect a modern, digital experience. According to the Salesforce Report, nearly 90% Of buyers say the experience a company provides matters as much as products or services. Whether using Experience Cloud, Sales Cloud, or Service Cloud, your Salesforce user experience should be seamless, personalized and hyper-relevant, reflecting all the right context behind every interaction.</p>



<p>At the same time, Salesforce is a big investment, and you need to show return on that investment as quickly as possible. Ensuring maximum user adoption and proficiency is key. The more useful and relevant the experience is, the more effective users will be on the platform—and the more frequently they will return to it.</p>



<p>Here are six ways you can elevate your Salesforce experience for customers, partners and employees.</p>



 1. Continuously inform and engage your users.  



<p>Keep users abreast of everything they need to know about your business, and share valuable, engaging content related to their needs and interests. Deliver timely information and critical alerts through tailored announcements. Keep your audience informed and engaged with virtual and in-person events and targeted news, blogs or other articles. Manage and surface all of this within Salesforce to minimize context switching and to keep users coming back to the platform.</p>



 2. Personalize the user experience for hyper-relevance.  



<p>Infuse context and personalized content to enrich the entire experience and make it more relevant to individual customers. Don’t make employees struggle with out-of-the-box search and list views; dynamically present what they need in the flow of work, so they don’t have to leave the current task to find it. Whether it is location mapping, embedded video, targeted news and events, assigned learning, or recommended products and knowledge articles, strive to give users the information they need when they need it.</p>



 3. Escape the confines of the typical Salesforce look and feel.  



<p>Break away from limiting, out-of-the-box layouts, view, and UI components to give users the beautiful, modern experience they expect. Follow current UX design principles and ensure that every touchpoint represents your unique branding look and feel, rather than just looking like any other Salesforce implementation.</p>



 4. Accelerate platform adoption and mastery.  



<p>Develop a plan to thoroughly onboard users and get them proficient with the platform as quickly as possible to start realizing value. Streamline and automate the onboarding process. Gathe data to drive users to the site or platform, personalize the experience, and equip them with the knowledge and resources they need for success. Then, go deeper and give your employees, partners and customers an immersive digital learning experience tailored to their specific needs. A highly skilled ecosystem is a loyal and effective one, and educated customers are advocates for the brand.</p>



 5. Enable users to serve themselves and each other.  



<p>Give your customers, partners and employees the ability to serve themselves 24/7, whether researching products, making purchases, managing accounts or troubleshooting and solving issues. This means making your product information, knowledge articles and other content easily accessible, searchable and filterable. Deflect cases by giving customers access to the same content your service employees use via the knowledge base or a chatbot.</p>



 6. Empower your users to be your advocates.  



<p>An effective way to get your brand and messaging in front of as many potential customers as possible is to give your users ways to advocate for you. Organically expand the reach and influence of your brand by enabling users to share, contribute to and interact with your content. Enable partners and employees to contribute blogs and articles, empower customers to share your content in their social networks, and enable users to rate and review products, services and other records. Use this active user base to crowdsource the best ideas for improving your business and your Salesforce implementation.</p>

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>



 Privacy Tools as Revenue Generators: A Win-Win Strategy 



<p>Privacy tools are a great way to start a new revenue stream. By charging a small monthly subscription fee, you will keep your customers safe from fraud and foster customer loyalty.</p>



<p>Here is the suite of privacy tools you could offer your customers:</p>







 Cyber Safety Tools: 



 
 Password Manager: Offer customers a secure way to manage and store passwords, ensuring enhanced cybersecurity. 



 Virtual Private Network (VPN): Provide a VPN service for safe and private online activities. 



 Virtual Cards: Introduce virtual card solutions for secure online transactions, reducing the risk of fraud. 
 







 Secure ID Verification: 



 
 Secure Communications: Enable encrypted communication channels, increasing customer trust in sensitive interactions. 



 Encrypted Voice, Video, Email, and Messaging: Ensure end-to-end encryption for various communication channels, safeguarding customer privacy. 
 







 Safe Browsing: 



 
 Private Browser: Introduce a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/09/4-reasons-safe-browsing-and-vpn-combined-can-boost-revenue/">private browsing</a> experience to protect users from tracking and potential cyber threats. 



 Ad &amp; Tracker Blocker and Site Reputation Service: Enhance online safety with tools to block ads, trackers, and assess website reputations. 
 



<p>👷 No need to build it yourself. You can offer all of these products to your customers quickly by partnering with Anonyome Labs. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/a-quick-and-easy-path-to-increased-consumer-loyalty-and-value-FINAL-1.pdf">Learn more here.</a></p>



 The Path Forward: Embracing Innovation

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Japan is&nbsp;US$3000.  It has been in effect in the country since June&nbsp;2023.  During its evaluation, the FATF praised Japan’s anti-money laundering efforts and called them effective while also noting areas for potential improvement.  <p>Japan was among the first countries to recognize the potential of the decentralized crypto ecosystem and took significant measures to position itself as the world’s crypto hub. One of the measures Japan took included the introduction of various crypto-related regulations, such as the FATF Travel Rule, aimed at preventing malicious entities from exploiting digital assets for illicit activities, including terrorist financing and money laundering.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan <p>Japan legally recognized cryptocurrencies in 2016 and further solidified their status by amending the Payment Services Act in 2019 to treat crypto assets as legal property. It led to the establishment of clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, including the need for strict anti-money laundering measures.</p><p>The country later introduced the Crypto Travel Rule in 2022, requiring exchanges to share transaction data to combat money laundering. FATF Travel Rule, however, did not become active in 2022 and instead <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">came into force in June&nbsp;2023</a>.</p><p>The current threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule applies to a crypto transaction in Japan is $3000. This means VASPS must transmit the required information only if the amount exceeds this&nbsp;limit.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Compliance Requirements <p>In line with FATF’s Recommendations, beneficiary and originator VASPs in Japan must obtain, hold, and make available on request to appropriate authorities the following information:</p><p>- Name and account number of the originator</p><p>- Place and date of birth of originator as well as address or national identity number, customer identification number</p><p>- Name and account number of the beneficiary</p><p>The information makes it possible for authorities to track the transaction routes of crypto assets and stablecoins.</p><p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, according to Japan’s financial regulation PSA, are those that are involved&nbsp;in:</p><p>- Purchase, sale, and exchange of crypto&nbsp;assets</p><p>- Intermediating, brokering, or acting as an agent for the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing customer’s money in connection with all the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing crypto assets for the benefit of another&nbsp;person</p><p>Now, a recent development seeks to refine this regulatory framework further, with <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2024/573.html">the FSA proposing</a> to simplify the Crypto Travel Rule on January 26th this year. The new draft requires VASPs to report restricted crypto-assets to a certified payment service association and publicly disclose this information. The agency is currently receiving public comments on the proposal until February 26th,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Japan’s self-regulated crypto organization, JVCEA, also noted in its “2024 New Year’s Thoughts” <a href="https://jvcea.or.jp/news/main-info/20240101-001/">notice</a> that by revising the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) to implement the FATF Travel Rule, it has become the “first major developed country to do&nbsp;so.”</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Japan, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the FSA, which is responsible for overseeing banking, securities, and exchange sectors. Meanwhile, the Payment Services Act has been applied to all crypto exchanges operating in Japan since April&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Moreover, through amendments to its Payment Services Act, Japan already requires exchanges to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (ML) measures. Under this, crypto exchanges need to provide customer due diligence procedures, maintain records, ensure customer assets are secure, and improve their security.</p><p>Now, with the Crypto Travel Rule in place, it further tightens these regulations for crypto exchanges in Japan, as they now have to assess the money laundering and financial terrorism risks for self-hosted wallets as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The APTCP also plans to update its rules, requiring VASPs to collect sender and receiver information for transactions involving self-hosted wallets or unregistered VASPs, including when these transactions occur in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule is not yet enforced.</p><p>Although Japan does not mandate covering transactions with counterparties in locations that haven’t yet implemented the Travel Rule regulations, VASPs must still evaluate the risks and gather necessary information. To aid this process, the FSA regularly updates its list of countries that meet Japan’s Travel Rule standards.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Global Context and Comparisons <p>Japan’s Travel Rule sets a US$3,000 threshold for cryptocurrency transactions, higher than Singapore’s SGD 1,500 and Canada’s CAD 1,000, and unlike many countries that have no threshold. This stringent threshold is part of Japan’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategy, which <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/countries/detail/Japan.html">the FATF has deemed effective</a> while also highlighting areas that could benefit from further improvements.</p><p>Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">PWC’s report</a>, Japan is among the only 23 countries that were engaged in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023 across all four key focus areas: Travel Rule compliance, stablecoin regulation, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In conclusion, Japan’s adherence to clear guidelines for crypto companies and global anti-money laundering standards, exemplified by initiatives like the Crypto Travel Rule, reinforces its standing in the crypto industry amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.</p> Relevant Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>What do global climate change and global warming look like? Surface temperature statistics paint a compelling picture of the changing climate: 2023, <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record">according to the European Union</a> climate monitor Copernicus, was the warmest year on record—nearly 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial levels.</p>



<p>To gain a holistic understanding of the current climate crisis and future climate implications, however, it’s important to look beyond global average temperature records. The impacts of climate change may be organized into three categories:</p>



 
 Intensifying extreme weather events 



 Changes to&nbsp;natural ecosystems 



 Harm to&nbsp;human health&nbsp;and&nbsp;well-being 
 



 Extreme weather events 



<p>While <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a> is defined as a shift in long-term weather patterns, its impacts include an increase in the severity of short-term weather events.</p>



 
 Heat waves: Dangerous heat waves are becoming more common and are one of the most obvious effects of climate change as the Earth’s temperature continues to rise. 



 Droughts: Higher temperatures can cause faster water evaporation, making arid regions even more dry. Climate change-linked shifts in atmospheric circulation can further exacerbate drought conditions as rain bypasses dry regions. 



 Wildfires: Droughts and faster water evaporation can lead to drier vegetation, fueling larger and more frequent wildfires. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">According to NASA</a>, even typically rainy regions will be more vulnerable to wildfires and wildfire seasons are extending around the globe. 



 Heavy rain and tropical storms: Climate change alters precipitation patterns, with NASA reporting more frequent periods of excess precipitation. <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/#:~:text=Tropical%20cyclone%20rainfall%20rates%20are,increase%20in%20atmospheric%20moisture%20content.">Scientists project further increases</a> in tropical cyclone rainfall in particular, due to greater atmospheric moisture content. 



 Increased coastal flooding: Sea level rises associated with global warming are leaving low-lying coastal areas vulnerable to greater flooding, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/">according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC). 
 



 Changes to natural ecosystems 



<p>Due to climate change, natural ecosystems&nbsp;are undergoing&nbsp;long-term changes&nbsp;and declines in biodiversity. Here are a few examples:</p>



 
 Sea ice loss and melting ice sheets: Declining levels of Arctic sea ice threaten the habitats of species such as polar bears and walruses. Polar bears hunt seals in the Arctic sea ice habitat while walruses rely on the ice as a place to rest when they’re not diving for food. In Greenland and Antarctica, melting ice sheets are contributing to rising sea levels, endangering coastal ecosystems around the world. 



 Damage to coral reefs: Ocean temperature increases&nbsp;in warmer climates from Australia to Florida are causing coral reefs to lose colorful algae, leading to what’s known as “coral bleaching.” 



 Ocean acidification: Marine life is also at risk from&nbsp;ocean acidification, stemming from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions</a> and the greater concentration of&nbsp;carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That carbon dioxide is absorbed&nbsp;by seawater, leading to chemical reactions that make oceans more acidic.&nbsp;Shellfish are especially vulnerable to ocean acidification, which NOAA describes as having “osteoporosis-like effects” on oysters and clams. 



 Invasive species proliferation: Warmer temperatures allow invasive species to move to new areas, often to the detriment of native wildlife. The spread of the purple loosestrife plant in North America, for instance, has reduced nesting sites and resulted in the decline of some bird populations. 



 Harm to estuarine ecosystems: Droughts reduce freshwater flows and increase salinity in estuaries, while greater precipitation increases stormwater runoff, introducing more sediment and pollution. These changes threaten the wildlife that rely on specific estuarine conditions to thrive. 
 



 Harm to human health and well-being 



<p>Climate change is increasingly impacting the quality of life on Earth, affecting people’s health and economic well-being.</p>



 
 Illnesses and fatalities: Rising global temperatures foster conditions for infectious diseases to spread, and extreme weather events cause tragic loss of life as well as illnesses. Poor air quality from wildfire smoke can exacerbate asthma and heart disease, for example, while heat waves can cause heat exhaustion. <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/60-000-people-died-from-blistering-european-heat-waves-new-analysis-finds/">More than 60,000 people</a> died in European heat waves in 2022. 



 Food insecurity: Droughts and scarcity of water supplies, severe storms, extreme heat and invasive species can cause <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/agriculture">crop failures</a> and food insecurity. Most of those at risk of climate change-linked hunger are in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/10/17/what-you-need-to-know-about-food-security-and-climate-change">according to the World Bank</a>. 



 Financial consequences: Climate change can hurt businesses and individuals’ financial well-being. For example, changing weather patterns have imperiled wine production in California, while rising sea levels threaten the future of Caribbean coastal resorts. Meanwhile, insurance companies are increasingly declining to provide property insurance in areas vulnerable to extreme weather, leaving homeowners there at greater financial risk. 



 Damage to infrastructure: Wildfires, powerful storms and flooding can damage <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/energy-utilities">energy grids</a>, leading to power outages, as well as transportation networks, hindering people’s ability to access services and goods to meet their daily needs. Damage to one type of infrastructure can lead to consequences for another: <a href="https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/highlights/report-findings/infrastructure">As noted by the U.S. government’s National Climate Assessment</a>, “failure of the electrical grid can affect everything from water treatment to public health.” 
 



 Hope for the future 



<p>Though some of the impacts on Earth’s climate are irreversible, a wide range of organizations from the public and private sector are working on climate actions that address the causes of climate change. These include ongoing mitigation strategies and targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as emissions of carbon dioxide and methane.</p>



<p>Meeting these targets relies in part on the growth of clean, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20is%20energy%20generated,hydropower%2C%20geothermal%20energy%20and%20biomass.">renewable energy</a> production that reduces the world’s reliance on energy derived from the burning of fossil fuels. Other climate science innovation could also contribute to climate change mitigation measures, ranging from <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/decarbonization">carbon capture</a> technology to methods of <a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2023/09/08/new-system-uses-seawater-to-capture-and-store-co2/#:~:text=Ebb%27s%20technology%20is%20designed%20to,years%2C%20and%20threatens%20marine%20ecosystems">neutralizing ocean acidity</a>.</p>



<p>Existing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainable-technology">sustainable technologies</a> can also help companies lower their carbon footprint. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite/sustainability">Artificial intelligence-powered analysis,</a> for example, can help companies identify what parts of their operations produce the most greenhouse gas emissions; <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/carbon-accounting">carbon accounting</a> can inform their strategies on reducing those emissions.</p>



<p>Of utmost importance, scientists say, is acting quickly.</p>



<p>“If we act now,” IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1134777#:~:text=Governments%20are%20key&amp;text=">said in a 2023 statement</a>, “we can still secure a livable sustainable future for all.”</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Combating Biometric Spoofing with 1Kosmos 
<p>Biometrics can improve security by replacing passwords, but they can be subject to theft, spoofing, and decision bias. As discussed, bad actors are implementing approaches to bypass biometric assurances with increasing success.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos platform performs a series of checks to prevent biometric-based attacks. For instance, 1Kosmos LiveID can perform both “active” liveness (requiring the user to perform randomized expressions) and “passive” liveness, one without the user’s involvement. Additionally, 1Kosmos utilizes true-depth camera functionality to prevent presentation attacks and offers an SDK to protect against camera manipulation to prevent an injection attack. Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also offers the following features:</p>

To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF77 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug fix in reward calculation  5.1 Overview <p>Some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. They’ve now been compensated the difference. The rest of this section elaborates.</p> 5.2 The&nbsp;Issue <p>In early February 2024, we identified an issue affecting DF reward calculation. The part of code that limits reward based on DCV (data consume volume) was supposed to limit in units of OCEAN. However it limited in units of USD. This led to Volume DF rewards being lower than intended, starting in DF63 (start of Predictoor DF). There were 69 wallets affected, with a total of 64,501 OCEAN less than it should have&nbsp;been.</p> 5.3 Solution in&nbsp;Code <p>As soon as we discovered the issue, we fixed it by limiting using the correct units (OCEAN, not USD). Then we took steps to reimburse; see next&nbsp;section.</p> 5.4 Reimbursement <p>We always strive to do the right thing. Trust is of utmost importance to us.In this case, that means: ensuring that every DF participant receives the DF rewards they&nbsp;earned.</p><p>We carefully calculated the missed amounts for each affected wallet. Section 5.5 lists each affected wallet, and the amount of OCEAN that was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>We are pleased to announce that these reimbursements have been processed and are now available for claiming. Participants affected by this issue can claim their reimbursement in the same manner as they would typically claim their DF rewards via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>.</p> 5.5 OCEAN Reimbursed, per&nbsp;Wallet  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+<br>| Address

 Stakers can claim DF75 rewards. DF76 runs Feb 8— Feb 15,&nbsp;2024 <p>[Note: this article was meant to be published on Feb 8,&nbsp;2024].</p> 1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 75 (DF75) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 1, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 8. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF76 is live as of Feb 8, 2024. It concludes on Feb 15. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF76   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF76 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire.

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetopen%20source">Kubernetes</a> (K8s) containers and environments are the leading approach to packaging, deploying and managing containerized applications at scale. The dynamic, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/open-source">open-source</a>, microservices-based configuration of Kubernetes can be a great fit for businesses that are looking to maximize infrastructure agility. However, the distributed flexibility that makes Kubernetes appealing can also make implementing Kubernetes monitoring and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/observability">observability</a> practices challenging.</p>



<p>Observability comprises a range of processes and metrics that help teams gain actionable insights into a system’s internal state by examining system outputs. It’s an essential part of maintaining any IT infrastructure. But managing the sheer volume of data, nodes, pods, services and endpoints that comprise Kubernetes environments requires observability practices that are appropriate for the job.</p>



<p>In this blog, we discuss how Kubernetes observability works, and how organizations can use it to optimize cloud-native IT architectures.</p>



 How does observability work? 



<p>Broadly speaking, observability describes how well internal system states can be inferred from external outputs. It’s the ability to diagnose and understand why a system is behaving in a particular way, which is vital to troubleshooting, deciphering performance issues and improving system design.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a>, the concept of observability has evolved to refer to the end-to-end visibility of a system state as dictated by telemetry data. The primary data classes used—known as the three pillars of observability—are logs, metrics and traces.</p>



 Logs 



<p>Logs include discrete events recorded every time something occurs in the system, such as status or error messages, or transaction details. Kubernetes logs can be written in both structured and unstructured text.</p>



 Metrics 



<p>CPU usage, memory consumption, network I/O, request latency or any business-specific indicators. Kubernetes metrics are often aggregated to create time-series observability data that can help teams spot trends and identify patterns.</p>



 Traces 



<p>Traces help teams follow a request or transaction through the various services and components of a distributed system. They also help teams visualize the dependencies between different components of an infrastructure so that delays and errors can be located quickly.</p>



<p>Achieving successful observability requires the deployment of appropriate Kubernetes monitoring tools and the implementation of effective processes for collecting, storing and analyzing the three primary outputs. This might include setting up and maintaining monitoring systems, application log aggregators, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/application-performance-management">application performance management (APM)</a> tools or other observability platforms.</p>



<p>However, Kubernetes environments also necessitate a more thorough examination of standard metrics. Kubernetes systems comprise a vast environment of interconnected containers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> and other components, all of which generate large amounts of data. Kubernetes schedules and automates container-related tasks throughout the application&nbsp;lifecycle, including:</p>



 Deployment 



<p>Kubernetes can deploy a specific number of containers to a specific host and keep them running in their desired state.</p>



 Rollouts 



<p>A rollout is a Kubernetes deployment modification. Kubernetes enables teams to initiate, pause, resume and roll back rollouts.</p>



 Service discovery 



<p>Kubernetes can automatically expose a container to the internet or other containers using a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/dns">DNS&nbsp;</a>name or&nbsp;IP address.</p>



 Autoscaling 



<p>When traffic spikes, Kubernetes&nbsp;can automatically spin up new clusters to handle the additional <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workload">workload</a>.</p>



 Storage provisioning 



<p>Teams can set up Kubernetes to mount persistent local or cloud storage for containers.</p>



 Load balancing 



<p>Based on&nbsp;CPU&nbsp;utilization or custom&nbsp;metrics, Kubernetes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/load-balancing">load balancing</a>&nbsp;features can distribute workloads across the network to maintain performance and stability.</p>



 Self-healing&nbsp;for&nbsp;high availability 



<p>Kubernetes can automatically <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/debugging">debug</a>, restart or replace a failed container to prevent&nbsp;downtime. It can also decommission containers that don’t meet health check requirements.</p>



<p>With so many shifting, interacting and layered components comes as many potential issues and failure points, therefore lots of areas where real-time monitoring becomes a necessity. It also means that a conventional approach to monitoring logs, metrics and traces might prove insufficient for observability in a Kubernetes environment.</p>



 Kubernetes observability principles 



<p>Because every component in a Kubernetes architecture is interdependent on other components, observability requires a more holistic approach.</p>



<p>Kubernetes observability requires organizations to go beyond collecting and analyzing cluster-level data from logs, traces and metrics; connecting data points to better understand relationships and events within Kubernetes clusters is central to the process. This means that organizations must rely on a tailored, cloud-native observability strategy and scrutinize every available data source within the system.</p>



<p>Observability in a K8s environment involves:</p>



<p>1. Moving beyond metrics, logs and apps. Much like virtual machine (VM) monitoring, Kubernetes observability must account for all log data (from containers, master and worker nodes, and the underlying infrastructure) and app-level metrics. However, unlike VMs, Kubernetes <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">orchestrates container interactions</a> that transcend apps and clusters. As such, Kubernetes environments house enormous amounts of valuable data both outside and within network clusters and apps. This includes data in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ci-cd-pipeline/">CI/CD pipelines</a> (which feed into K8s clusters) and GitOps workflows (which power K8s clusters).</p>



<p>Kubernetes also doesn’t expose metrics, logs and trace data in the same way traditional apps and VMs do. Kubernetes tends to capture data “snapshots,” or information captured at a specific point in the lifecycle. In a system where each component within every cluster records different types of data in different formats at different speeds, it can be difficult—or impossible—to establish observability by simply analyzing discrete data points.</p>



<p>What’s more, Kubernetes doesn’t create master log files at either the app or cluster level. Every app and cluster records data in its respective environment, so users must aggregate and export data manually to see it all in one place. And since containers can spin up, spin down or altogether disappear within seconds, even manually aggregated data can provide an incomplete picture without proper context.</p>



<p>2. Prioritizing context and data correlation. Both monitoring and observability are key parts of maintaining an efficient Kubernetes infrastructure. What differentiates them is a matter of objective. Whereas monitoring helps clarify what’s going on in a system, observability aims to clarify why the system is behaving the way that it is. To that end, effective Kubernetes observability prioritizes connecting the dots between data points to get to the root cause of performance bottlenecks and functionality issues.</p>



<p>To understand Kubernetes cluster behavior, you must understand each individual event in a cluster within the context of all other cluster events, the general behavior of the cluster, and any events that led up to the event in question.</p>



<p>For instance, if a pod starts in one worker node and terminates in another, you need to understand all the events that are happening simultaneously in the other Kubernetes nodes, and all the events that are happening across your other Kubernetes services, API servers and namespaces to get a clear understanding of the change, its root cause, and its potential consequences.</p>



<p>In other words, merely monitoring tasks is often inadequate in a Kubernetes environment. To achieve Kubernetes observability, get relevant system insights or conduct accurate accurate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root cause analyses</a>, IT teams must be able to aggregate data from across the network and contextualize it.</p>



<p>3. Using Kubernetes observability tools. Implementing and maintaining Kubernetes observability is a large, complex undertaking. However, using the right frameworks and tools can simplify the process and improve overall data visualization and transparency.</p>



<p>Businesses can choose from a range of observability solutions, including programs that automate metrics aggregation and analysis (like Prometheus and Grafana), programs that automate logging (like ELK, Fluentd and Elasticsearch) and programs that facilitate tracing visibility (like Jaeger). Integrated solutions, like OpenTelemetry, can manage all three major observability practices. And customized, cloud-native solutions, like Google Cloud Operations, AWS X-Ray, Azure Monitor and and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana Observability</a>, offer observability tools and Kubernetes dashboards optimized for clusters that are running on their infrastructure.</p>



 Best practices for optimizing Kubernetes observability 



<p>• Define your KPIs. Figure out which key performance indicators, like app performance, system health and resource usage, give you the most useful insights into your infrastructure’s behavior. Revise them as needed.<br>• Centralize logging. K8s environments generate massive amounts of data. Aggregating and storing it using a centralized logging solution is integral to data management.<br>• Monitor resource usage. Collect real-time data on memory, CPU and network usage so you can proactively scale resources when necessary.<br>• Set up alerts and alarms. Use established KPI thresholds to configure alerts and alarms. This practice allows teams to receive timely notifications when issues arise.</p>

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn how to get started you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">read more about the Proven Mobile SDK</a>, or <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

 System to achieve full compliance of Crypto Asset Service Providers and self-hosted wallets with AML regulations and the Transfer of Funds Regulation&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could we meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether. All of this means that, while MFA is a great way to reinforce login credentials like usernames and passwords, it may not be enough to stop the latest types of ATO.</p>

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions. By adopting these measures, organizations can further protect their critical systems and their existing IdP.</p>

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>
<p>To learn more about OEE and the three key production indicators, measurement &amp; analysis, and calculating speed and efficiency, read our white paper, <a href="https://go.entrust.com/production-analytics-solution-wp">“Understanding Production Efficiency in High-Volume Card Issuance Operations.”</a></p>
<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:47] Comparison of DIDs to Other Verifiable Identifiers: Exploring how DIDs contrast with other types of verifiable identifiers and their benefits over traditional identifiers like email addresses and phone numbers.

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>

 The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable identity verification.

While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a>.</p>  
<p>Employee identity risk and fraud have skyrocketed in recent years. The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI recently warned</a> that fraudulent job applicants are using deepfakes and stolen PII to obtain remote work positions. “Bait-and-switch” schemes are also on the rise, where the person interviewed by a company is not the person who is actually hired. In the best case, companies end up hiring someone completely unsuitable for the position. In the worst case, they onboard and provide access to cybercriminals who can install malware, steal confidential and privileged information, and more.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond hiring and onboarding. Just this week, a multinational finance firm revealed that an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">employee was tricked into making a $25 million wire transfer</a> by deepfake video and audio. The thieves used AI-generated likenesses&nbsp; of the company’s CFO and other known colleagues in a live video conference with the finance worker.</p>

<p>Know Your Employee, commonly abbreviated as KYE, is the process of verifying the identities and backgrounds of an organization’s current workforce and prospective new employees. KYE aims to ensure that employees are who they claim to be, and do not have a criminal background that poses an undue risk.</p> 
<p>The KYE - Know Your Employee process continues past initial hiring and onboarding. Effective KYE involves continuous monitoring and regularly updating and reviewing employee information to identify any potential risks that may arise.</p> 
 KYE vs. KYC  
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Employee (KYE) are two essential processes in the realm of compliance and risk management. KYC verifies customer identities to determine if they are who they claim to be and discover any potential risks, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations. In contrast, KYE involves verification of employee identities and thorough background checks to reduce the risk of employee fraud and theft, and address internal compliance needs.</p> 
<p>Both KYC and KYE share the common goal of mitigating risks, upholding legal standards and preventing fraud. The main distinction is in their focus: KYC is customer-oriented, while KYE centers on internal workforce dynamics. KYC is a point in time process, while KYE should be a continuous process, throughout an employee’s tenure. Integrating both processes is crucial for a comprehensive risk management framework in business.</p> 
 The Growing Importance of Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>Identity verification poses an ongoing challenge for organizations. In fact, 40% of IT security experts named it a top identity security challenge in the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-workplace-identity-security-trends-2024">2024 Workplace Identity Security Trends report</a>. This is likely to climb as new attack and fraud tactics make accurate <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a> and verification increasingly difficult. A recent report by Onfido found a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023, thanks to face-swapping apps, generative AI and other readily available fraud tools.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond non-compliance. Employee fraud tactics such as interview fraud, bait-and-switch scenarios, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employee-fraud-how-companies-can-spot-employees-outsourcing-their-jobs-2022-8">unauthorized outsourcing</a>, mean that the person doing the work may not be the person you interviewed or hired. This creates massive security risks for organizations.</p> 
<p>Moreover, identity risks persist throughout the employee lifecycle – not just at hiring and onboarding. The recent breach of MGM resorts succeeded because attackers were able to impersonate an employee and convince the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. Robust, continuous KYE processes could have prevented the attack. In this evolving landscape, a comprehensive KYE strategy is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, ensuring the integrity of their workforce and safeguarding against potential malicious activities.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>While every organization will approach KYE differently depending on their specific needs and structure, there are basic principles that hold across all workplaces.</p> 
 Employ Multiple KYE Verification Methods  
<p>A thorough KYE approach requires layering multiple verification methods — which ones, and when to invoke them, will depend on the risk level of the employee verification scenario as well as organizational and environmental risks at play. Verification methods include document verification, facial biometric verification, live video, chat verification, as well as passive signals such as device/endpoint and location detection.</p> 
<p>As we’ve seen, identity fraud techniques evolve rapidly — it’s critical that your KYE methods keep up. A robust KYE strategy should incorporate advanced technologies such as liveness detection to detect deepfakes and other AI-aided fraud.</p> 
 Make It Easy for Your Admins and Employees  
<p>It’s human nature to circumvent processes that add an unreasonable burden. When done well, KYE - Know Your Employee processes should be fast and easy for both employees and administrators alike. This means automating processes as much as possible, requiring the right level of identity verification for the scenario, and using technologies that people are familiar with, like their smartphones. Of course security cannot be sacrificed for usability.</p> 
 Continuously Monitor for Risk  
<p>Employee identity risks do not end with secure onboarding. Higher risk scenarios arise throughout an employee’s career. Resetting credentials, getting a new phone, logging in from unknown locations, gaining increased access privileges, personal financial problems, active cyberattacks — all can be situations of elevated risk. Your KYE controls should be ready to address these, taking specific measures according to risk level.&nbsp;</p> 
 Don’t Operate in a Silo  
<p>It’s critical that your KYE processes and tools are connected and synchronized to your <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> systems and HR system of record. The users accessing digital services may differ from the identities that IT believes they have. In other words, the digital identity may not match the real world identity. Your employee onboarding and identity verification procedures should be directly tied to your authentication processes, ideally using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. As mentioned, it’s also important to invoke re-verification at certain times of increased risk. This means connecting your identity risk monitoring to your Know Your Employee (KYE) systems.</p> 
 Keep Up With Current Regulations and Compliance  
<p>In the current regulatory landscape, it's not just ethical but imperative for businesses across various industries to comply with applicable statutes and standards. The incorporation of a robust "Know Your Employee" (KYE) process is a key aspect of this compliance. These checks are vital for verifying credentials, ensuring workforce integrity, and meeting legal obligations.</p> 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance are severe, underlining the indispensability of KYE in any organization's overall compliance strategy. For example, a comprehensive KYE process is vital for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, helping identify potential risks and preventing misuse of the financial system.</p>

<p>Holochain provides blockchains with auditable applications that can be tied to on-chain transactions, opening new possibilities for NFTs, DAO communities, and more.</p> Binding Wallets to Holochain Apps <p>We’ve developed a proof of concept for binding together Holochain agent keys with public keys on blockchains. Holochain uses a system of source chain validation to ensure that any action taken in an application is auditable, creating a secure environment for most application needs. By binding a Holochain agent with a public key in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), data created by the Holochain agent can be associated with the EVM key. This setup allows for unforgeable and bidirectional verifiability, facilitating provenance confirmation on both Ethereum and Holochain.</p> Validated Content for NFTs  <p>Rather than storing NFT payloads in unvalidated and/or centralized storage, with Holochain you can create and validate the payload and the reference for an NFT fully within a distributed context. The demo below shows that you can also manage the minting and transfer of the NFT from a Holochain app precisely because you can first bind your wallet to your Holochain agent. By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS. </p> Notaries and Oracles <p>Combining patterns from oracles and notaries with agent binding on Holochain opens up new ways to move between peer-to-peer systems via “cross-chain” proofs. </p><p>Smart contracts pre-authorize the public keys of agents from whom they will accept proofs. The proofs are signed verifications that reference actions or decisions taken in Holochain, all of which are also transparent and verifiable by any member of the application. This enables scalable but still verifiable sensemaking. </p><p>An example of how this could be used is with DAOs. Large scale voting on-chain is costly, both in gas fees and network traffic. But a voting app on Holochain can provide the trust and transparency of blockchain without the gas fees, and then the fully verifiable decision can be notarized creating a proof which is used to make a single on-chain transaction. The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Explore other benefits Holochain brings to DAOs. </a></p> Data Storage  <p>Given the two examples above, you can see that what Holochain provides to blockchains is validated data storage. While the examples given talk about two major concerns for current blockchain development, you can store or interact with any data you choose to program into an application. Holochain is an incredibly flexible framework — the validation rules of each application can be customized based on the security and design needs of a particular use case. The combination of energy and cost efficiency, auditability, and flexibility makes Holochain a perfect choice for applications that need to interface with blockchain.</p><p>Plus, it’s all coded in Rust — with UIs using your favorite JavaScript framework — making it even easier for Ethereum devs to use and build with.</p> Learn More and Connect <p>Learn how Holochain can <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-web3?ref=blog.holochain.org">extend Web3</a>, and get involved by introducing yourself to our team and community on <a href="https://bit.ly/A-New-Link-in-Web3-DEV-HC?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> or by joining one of our <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-events?ref=blog.holochain.org">upcoming events</a>.</p>

<p>New technology is tough to explain sometimes. But Holochain isn’t reinventing the wheel. Rather, we are inventing the bicycle when all you have ever seen or used are wagons. </p><p>Holochain is built from familiar technical components and best practices, just as a bicycle is built from wheels, gears, frames, and steering mechanisms which all previously existed as basic forms or principles in other contexts. </p>Sum&gt;Parts: The key components of Holochain already existed, but we put them on a new frame<p>Our back wheel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">Distributed Hash Table</a>, similar to the ones used by <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a> to revolutionize peer-to-peer file sharing. This is the database structure that allows data to be transferred in the context of a distributed app.</p><p>Our front wheel is built on a lot of the same principles as <a href="https://git-scm.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Git</a> which pioneered <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first</a> version control as we know it today. While our local-first tools are built out of slightly different materials, the principle remains: Agents can always make local changes which then update the network when connected online. Not dissimilar to how the front wheel determines the direction of the bike. </p><p>These wheels are powered by a familiar device, the bike chain. Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">source chain</a> uses an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain?ref=blog.holochain.org">hashchains</a>, which were popularized by blockchains, to connect one action to the next, every action containing the hash of the last. Each agent has their own bike and so they each update their own source chain, independent of the actions of other cyclists. This provides mobility compared to the wide wagon of a single central chain. The beauty of bikes is their independence, the ability to act without everyone needing to be in the same wagon. </p><p>The handlebars that steer this contraption are also familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography?ref=blog.holochain.org">Public/private key cryptography</a> used for cryptographic signatures is a staple of most processes on the web, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS?ref=blog.holochain.org">HTTPS</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signal Protocol</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell?ref=blog.holochain.org">SSH</a> which is used by devs everywhere to access remote machines. Alongside encryption, these keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate?ref=blog.holochain.org">act as the identity tools</a> which connect the user, the human riding the bike, to their actions on the digital road. Every action they take is signed, controlled through those handlebars, and only the rider is able to steer. </p><p>Holochain pulls together all of these time tested tools and reconfigures them to do something none of them can do alone. </p><p>We’ve been talking about Holochain from the perspective of the agent — the rider and their bike. But Holochain is an application framework. In this analogy, every application is a unique path that controls where a rider can go, what actions can be taken, and how data is formatted. We talk about this from the perspective of the rider because they get to determine which paths they ride. Riders bridge between paths, connecting them into personalized neighborhoods. Each new app increases the area that the rider can travel and grows an ecosystem of potential routes. Different paths take you to different places, but Holochain lets you move between them seamlessly. </p><p>The affordances of each road dictate what can be done on it. Wide roads let many ride together, small curvy paths mean you slow down, etc. In the same way, the application rules are baked in. Changing them would be the same as changing roads. </p><p>As a framework for peer-to-peer applications, Holochain is taking on some of the toughest challenges of distributed computing. Ensuring data is validated and secure without central servers, allowing for asynchronous action across a network, and keeping agents honest, are all hard tasks. But each individual piece of this puzzle already exists, we are just recombining them to offer new possibilities. </p><p>Holochain is built to allow any group to come together, develop a bike path, and each with their own bike traveling at their own pace, ride the path together. Many different bike paths can overlap and intersect, and riders get to choose their route through them — traveling freely and at their own will.</p>

  ESMA’s latest guidelines clarify that non-EU crypto firms can only serve EU residents when they request it&nbsp;first.  It prohibits crypto firms from providing any additional services unrelated to the initial request from their EU&nbsp;clients.  The draft guidelines seek to thwart any attempts by third-country firms to bypass the rules while also encouraging stakeholders to provide feedback to improve ESMA’s approach.  <p>Recently, the European Securities and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">published a consultation paper</a> discussing the draft guidelines on reverse solicitation <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">under MiCA</a>. Here, reverse solicitation refers to a situation where third-country firms solicit clients in the European Union, directly or indirectly.</p><p>The ESMA’s main purpose with these guidelines is to specify when third-country firms can offer crypto services to EU clients and to prevent firms from circumventing the reverse solicitation rule.</p><p>The agency also aims for these guidelines to be consistent, efficient, and effective when rolled out for implementation. For that, ESMA has urged all stakeholders, including crypto-asset service providers (including from third countries) and financial entities dealing with crypto-assets, to respond to this consultation paper.</p><p>Responses should address the questions asked, provide explanations, and suggest alternative options for the ESMA to consider.</p> When are Non-EU Crypto Firms Allowed to Offer Services to EU Residents? <p>The latest ESMA guidelines say that non-EU crypto firms can provide their services to EU residents only when they request it. However, after the initial contact, the firm can’t offer more cryptocurrencies or related services unless they are related to what the client asked for in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Instructions for Relevant National Regulators <p>To ensure an interaction is genuinely initiated by the EU-based client, the guideline suggests regulators look at how and when the client approached the firm. Was it truly on their own, without any nudges from ads or&nbsp;emails?</p><p>The draft guidelines also provide instructions to national agencies on how to decide if a third-country firm is marketing a new kind of crypto asset or service. They suggest that national authorities look at two&nbsp;things:</p>  The type of crypto asset or service being&nbsp;offered.  The risks involved with the new crypto asset or&nbsp;service.  <p>It also notes that MiCA only mentions three crypto asset types (asset-referenced tokens, electronic money tokens, and tokens that don’t fall into these categories), and such broad categories might enable third-country firms to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/navigating-regulatory-challenges-mica-and-the-defi-landscape">circumvent the rules</a>. So, ESMA urges relevant national authorities through these guidelines to:</p>  Monitor the marketing efforts that third-country firms deploy in targeting EU-based&nbsp;clients.  Conduct relevant consumer&nbsp;surveys.  Keep a tab on clients’ complaints and whistleblowing.  Cooperate with authorities, including law enforcement, as and when required.   Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, the draft guidelines offer insights and guidance on when third-country firms can approach clients in the EU and provide strategies for detecting any attempts to bypass these rules. And since it’s a consultation paper, stakeholders are invited to share their feedback on ESMA’s approach, identifying any potential gaps or effectiveness concerns. Responses are accepted until April 29,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One way to understand governance as a component of decentralized identity is to look at identity verification and data sharing as an “ecosystem.”</p>
<p>An ecosystem is any use case where you have:</p>
 
 One or more parties issuing verifiable credentials for digital identity to people, organizations, or devices. 
 People, organizations, or devices who then hold the credentials to prove their identity and share data within the credential to other parties. 
 People, organizations, or devices, that need to prove the identity of those presenting verifiable credentials, and the data within their credentials to accomplish some goal. 
 
<p>In an ecosystem, participants are interested in the same kind of data to solve the same kind of problems. This could be who is allowed to access a facility, an operational system, a software application.</p>
<p>Governance makes this happen.</p>
<p>The governance authority establishes who can issue credentials. If there is only one issuer, say in the case of a company issuing employee credentials, the company is the governance authority.</p>
<p>The authority establishes:</p>
 
 who can be issued a credential. 
 who else can issue credentials 
 What information is going to be issued in a credential. 
 How that information is to be interpreted — if x, then y 
 How that information can be shared in ways to comply with data privacy regulations. 
 
<p>While there are other technical aspects to governance (choosing credential formats, DID methods, protocols, cryptographic key management etc), the key governance actions can be reduced to two workflows:</p>
 
 Which credentials can I trust? 
 What data needs to be presented and authenticated and how does it need to be presented? 
 
<p>These questions are solved by machine-readable governance. The governance authority publishes a file in a format that can be read by the software required and held by each participant in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once you have an ecosystem for a specific use case, you can extend the governance to other use cases, depending on how robustly you have authenticated the person, organization or device that you issued the credential to.</p>
<p>Governance would enable a credential issued to an employee to access a hospital to also access a specific database or device. Governance could allow this credential to be used as a proof of identity for specific organizations that provide employee benefits. So you’ve gone, just through a simple addition of code, from opening a door to opening an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two different hospital systems could agree and use machine readable governance to authorize doctors in one system to work in another.</p>
<p>The fact that these rules can be rendered in a machine-readable format makes implementation and updating fast and simple. You can rapidly reconfigure your ecosystem to manage new data and requirements.</p>
<p>And once you are able to use verifiable identity and data, the permutations are limitless. Governance makes all these permutations work and enables expansion and scale.</p>
<p>It turns trust into an actionable, valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn, it seems there’s a new process, a new technology, and a new consumer preference that is “going digital.” More and more cardholders around the globe are preferring, and expecting, a digital-first payment experience. Because of the technology behind it all, IT professionals are at the center of this digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated an awareness of and migration to contactless and digital payments, and the payments ecosystem is now one of the fastest movers when it comes to digitization.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">51% of U.S. cardholders</a> state that their mobile banking app is their preferred method to engage with their financial institution. This data shows us that customers are looking for seamless, digital-first payment and card management experiences. With that data guiding us, it’s clear an elevated and enriched issuance and payment enablement process is now the gold standard to meet the demand of cardholders.</p>
<p>Bridging Physical and Digital Experiences for Cardholders</p>
<p>That gold standard experience – providing a compelling, seamless digital card and payment experience – can help a bank to achieve <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/maintain-your-top-of-wallet-status-with-advanced-card-controls/">top-of-wallet status</a>. We learned in a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">recent survey</a> among 1,000 U.S. cardholders that digital card controls in the banking app make the cardholder more likely to use the card as a default payment method. This has led to some banks going all-in with fully featured, integrated digital card solutions. Others, especially small to midsize banks, have asked their IT teams to implement some fundamental digital features as building blocks to their digital card platform – a foundation that can be enhanced and expanded by partnering with a digital card solution provider to offer cardholders a truly digital-first payment experience.</p>
<p>But financial institutions have different challenges when it comes to enabling intuitive yet secure digital payment options for their cardholders. The building blocks themselves, like choosing the right digital features, knowing which features are most requested by cardholders, and meeting the demands of different demographic groups, can be challenging to organize and understand. Similarly, it’s important to consider a solution that is scalable and future-proof to ensure the biggest ROI. Most IT teams have heavy resource constraints with a multitude of existing projects. Smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to build out their own digital card solution, while bigger institutions will think closely about the existing infrastructure in place. For example, by leveraging what they’ve already put in place and partnering with Entrust, a financial institutions’ IT team can answer the need for an even more digital and seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>Simplifying Digital Card Implementation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">The Entrust Digital Card Solution</a> is a single mobile software development kit (SDK) that’s easy to implement and opens a world of possibilities. The entire menu of capabilities becomes immediately available, but with the flexibility and scalability to pick and choose the right configuration for your customers at that point in time, adding more capabilities seamlessly as the organization’s payments enablement strategy evolves.</p>
<p>This innovative strategy shifts an IT team’s highly complex digital-first strategy to a unified and simplified integration for digital payments enablement. Our SDK or web service integration aims to create faster time to value with minimal intervention on behalf of IT. Our implementation helps IT teams overcome common challenges like internal resources among small departments, total cost of ownership across multiple features, and time to market.</p>
<p>Choosing a solution developed by experts focused on the digital card makes adding new integrations for the cardholder a much smoother, less time-intensive process. Ultimately, these specific capabilities enable IT teams to focus on mission-critical initiatives while promoting a fully integrated digital card solution.</p>

<p>As digital transformation accelerates across industries, technology thought leader Philip Sheldrake brings an urgent yet nuanced perspective on constructing digital identity systems centered on human needs.</p><p>With a perspective spanning engineering, computer science, and involvement in decentralized projects, Sheldrake understands the intricacies of designing digital ecosystems.</p><p>However, through his interdisciplinary lens, he sees profound gaps in how identity gets formulated in computational realms versus lived human experience.</p><p>In the same way that the internet has brought a series of helpful technological advancements, it’s also brought unintended consequences.</p><p>For Sheldrake, identity may be the premier challenge to align digital progress with human flourishing rather than harm.</p><p>By drawing out insights from his expertise in bridging social and computer sciences, this article explores the past, present, and most hopeful future pathways for digital identity.</p> Understanding and Describing Identity <p>Even defining digital identity proves slippery, as technologist Philip Sheldrake explains:</p><p></p><blockquote>“It’s so difficult to actually even describe the space we're about to talk about. It's astonishing how few words have real meaning in this space.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Identity intersects technology, business, government, philosophy, culture, and our personal lives. Thus, no singular perspective captures its complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake notes, “There are just a few throwaway phrases that just mislead people because they're so ubiquitous, they hardly mean anything anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake brings decades of experience working across domains, from helping launch open source browser Firefox to involvement with Ethereum and decentralized technology projects. He sees identity as the crux where technology and humanity meet — for better or worse:</p><p></p><blockquote>“I am obsessed with the potential for digital technologies to lend a hand in human flourishing. Except that, so far, the experiment of the digital has thrown up as many negative externalities… as positive. Little things, you know, like undermining democracy.”</blockquote><p></p><p>The alluring promise of technology remains unfulfilled until we construct frameworks elevating both computer science innovations and social scientific understandings of identity.</p> Technology Changes Identity Dynamics Over Time <p>While databases and algorithms remain constant, the societal outcomes and experiences with digital systems transform remarkably across months and years. Sheldrake explains how innovations go through a “series of phases” regarding consequences as usage patterns and cultural incorporation structurally mature.</p><p>In the early days of social media, few guard rails for behavior existed, enabling exploratory identity play. Yet, as digital engagement became mobile and pervasive, external constraints tightened. Structures accreted, along with probabilities of harm.</p><p>Sheldrake gives the example of shifting sentiment around decentralized technology projects like blockchain. Initial optimism about democratization gave way to backlash concerning crypto’s environmental impacts. This reveals less about the fundamentals of blockchain itself changing and more about the emergence of unintended externalities at scale.</p> Contrasting Views on Identity <p>There are fundamentally different perspectives on identity in computer science and social science. Sheldrake points out, “In computer science...nothing is addressable in internetworking until it has an entity and identifier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rigid constructs like legal identities and cryptographic claims of personhood dominate programming approaches.</p><p>Meanwhile, in sociology and psychology, “identity is a sense-making capacity...a process, it’s a verb.” Human identity lives between people and contexts, ever-negotiated through information exchange. Instead of static entities, constantly co-created meaning flows.</p><p>Sheldrake argues the clash stems from differing historical customers driving innovation, noting “the first customers of IT were large corporations and governments...IT served the bureaucracy, it was the definition of bureaucracy.”</p><p>Thus, digitization elevated standardized legal identities for taxation and service provision — not the nuanced, fluid identities enlivening human relationships outside institutional walls. Much gets lost in translation.</p> The Path Forward Requires New Perspectives <p>Progress on digital identity relies on transcending entrenched disciplinary silos to enable genuine dialogue and collective innovation. While compromising on decentralized principles proves difficult, rigidly decentralized systems similarly risk harm without weighing human needs.</p><p>Sheldrake argues identity resides in “getting social science and computer science and the humanities, kind of riffing off each other's best strengths, rather than allowing computer science to riff off its worst weaknesses.” No single expertise holds the answers alone.</p><p>He continues: “One of my mentors mentioned to me, the beginning of the 90s, the 20th century was all about disciplinary excellence, the 21st century will all be about the interdisciplinary or even the transdisciplinary, trying to fill in the gaps between the disciplinary knowledge.”</p><p>To sufficiently fill those gaps, technologies like <a href="https://www.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> aim to bring individual sovereignty and collective capacity. While there isn’t a perfect formula for identity, the next wave of innovators can learn from how it’s translated digitally.&nbsp;</p>

Nick has a fascinating career that has paralleled digital identity for a long time, as a cofounder of Bluetooth and FDX, the major open banking standards body in the US. These are both organizations that brought an industry together around common standards to grow the market far bigger for everyone involved—and we talk lessons learned and how this applies to identity.</p><p>Nick shares a deep look into Finicity’s story starting as a consumer application and eventually becoming a major data aggregator. Then we dive into Finicity’s journey disrupting themselves by pushing into open banking. We explore the work Finicity did with verifiable credentials as an issuer, and the big challenge that prevented them from rolling it out. You’ll appreciate all of his takes on the parallels between fintech and IDtech.</p><p>To learn more about Nick you can find him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasathomas/">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords.

<p>Considering a decentralized identity (DI) solution? Is this your wish list:<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy DI capabilities in the simplest way possible.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to focus on your core business while leaving others to do the detailed technical work of deploying your DI solution.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy your DI solution faster and at a much lower total cost of ownership (TOC) than other deployment models offer.<br></p>



<p>To have those wishes granted, you need a cloud-based, SaaS deployment model—a complete and managed solution that includes the deployment, management, maintenance, and support of DI services. In short, you need the Anonyome Platform.</p>



<p>Read our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">whitepaper</a> or continue here for the highlights.</p>



 More companies are turning to a SaaS solution for DI &nbsp; 



<p>For software providers and integrators, adding a DI infrastructure to their product lines presents many of the same choices they faced when integrating other system elements: for example, will we host our web servers in own own local data center using our own hardware? Or should we opt for the simplicity of leasing server space from a cloud hosting provider?</p>



<p>Both methods have benefits. Some companies enjoy the peace of mind that comes with controlling their own hardware and software stacks. Others—an increasing majority—find peace of mind comes from knowing that the hardware and software stacks are delivered and maintained through a contract model.</p>



<p>The contract model is often referred to as cloud hosting or the more formal Software as a Service (SaaS) model because the vendor provider deploys, manages, maintains, and provides support for the software.</p>



<p>Calculating the total cost of ownership (TOC) usually determines whether to use a SaaS or on-site deployment model. The key cost drivers for any software implementation are the costs of:<br></p>



 
 software application 



 hardware/hosting 



 staff required to deploy, manage, maintain, and support the application. 
 



<p><br>Any of those cost drivers that a company can successfully outsource become line items in a budget without the operational complexities imposed by on-site deployments.<br></p>



 The Anonyome Platform embraces the SaaS model 



<p>Many companies have calculated the inefficiency, complexity, and additional expenses of the traditional on-site software model and have opted for the simplicity of the SaaS model. In fact, the SaaS model has become the de facto standard for delivering software solutions and the Anonyome Platform was built to embrace this model.</p>



 <br>Here are 7 reasons why: 



<p></p>



 1. No upfront capital costs 







<p>With the SaaS model, the customer doesn’t have to bear the upfront capital costs of deploying a software solution or even contracting their own cloud provider. Instead, the SaaS vendor incurs these costs (e.g., hardware/hosting, software application, and IT staff hiring and training). This simplifies startup and operating costs for the customer, the customer only pays a monthly or annual subscription cost, and deployment is immediate.</p>



<p></p>



 2. Fast deployment 







<p>SaaS delivers an almost instant solution to the customer, which is far more attractive than waiting the many months typically required for deploying and testing in-house solutions. Anonyome provides a fully automated approach to deploying new environments for customers.</p>



<p></p>



 3. Vendor-provided maintenance and upgrades 







<p>In the on-site solution, a customer is on the hook for updating and applying security patches to the software and operating systems, and for performing compatibility tests with every change. On the other hand, in the SaaS model, the software vendor maintains and upgrades the software, which includes delivering new versions and security patching the hosted system to protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p></p>



 4. No staffing requirements 







<p>Paying staff to research, design, integrate, test, finetune, and launch any system is a significant cost with in-house solutions—up to 75% of the overall costs, in fact. The SaaS model eliminates the staffing concerns for contracted services.</p>



<p>In new emerging areas such as DI, it may be extremely difficult to find new hires with the right skills. The Anonyome Labs’ team, on the other hand, is highly experienced and highly trained in DI technologies. Beyond the Anonyome Platform, we support the ongoing development of DI by:</p>



 
 helping to run three DI-focused blockchains 



 being an active contributor to the DI standards organizations 



 contributing source code back to the DI open source community. 
 



<p></p>



 5. No-fuss application scalability 







<p>With in-house solutions, the customer must think about infrastructure issues such as network bandwidth, database and server sizing before deciding whether to ramp up their solution. But customers using the SaaS model don’t have to think about the technical how of scalability, because it’s already done for them. This leaves them free to focus on their business strategy and when to scale for maximum revenue.</p>



<p></p>



 6. 24-hour software support 







<p>The service level agreement (SLA) is key to a SaaS solution because it outlines the reliable actions and response times a customer can expect should an issue arise. With Anonyome’s global workforce across multiple time zones, staff are always on hand to respond to priority issues, even after hours at the customer’s site.</p>



<p></p>



 7. High level security and privacy 







<p>Under the SaaS model, the software vendor hires and trains people to maintain top security and privacy capabilities on the customer’s behalf, which is a significant resource saving.<br></p>



<p>DI is exploding as the new identity management solution</p>



<p>As you’d know, DI is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy, and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the personal information that forms their identity. It’s decentralized because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>According to June 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">figures, </a>more than&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a>&nbsp;of US companies plan to incorporate a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">DI </a>solution into their operations, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a>&nbsp;likely to do so within a year.</p>

<p>Centralized identity models are no longer sufficient to safeguard against exploitations from either rogue internal operators or external bad actors. DI has stepped into the breach, because:<br></p>



 
 DI is safer: Without central storage of credentials, DI presents much less risk of credential theft or other operational issues for the customer as custodians of sensitive data. 



 DI streamlines process:Organizations no longer have to repeatedly collect and distribute data, and sign-up and sign-in processes are faster because there’s no need to duplicate efforts and approvals. 



 DI gives individuals control over data:The customer controls their own data, which reduces risk, unifies user experience, and boosts their satisfaction. 



 DI reduces the compliance burden: The system eliminates manual error and inconsistent and redundant data distribution and validation. 
 



 The Anonyome Platform specializes in DI (and much more) 







<p>The Anonyome Platform does three things we know enterprise customers want:<br></p>



 
 Very quickly deploys DI capabilities in their application environment 



 Handles the deployment, management, maintenance and support of the DI solution 



 Allows the customer focus on high-level strategy instead of the technical intricacies. 
 



<p>Within the DI offering, the Anonyome Platform has five licensable products:</p>



 
 White label mobile DI wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating storing cryptographic keys; and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers, and supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Mobile native DI wallet SDK: For customers who want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage; creating cryptographic keys; establishing connections; and receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. 
 



 
 Verifiable credentials service/SDK/sample apps: This service establishes connections with DI wallets, issues verifiable credentials, and requests and verifies presentation proofs from DI wallets. It supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Relay service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the relay service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



 
 Governance framework:This framework empowers DI network participants to enforce rules while staying true to the tenants of DI. Organizations can define and enforce governance rules associated with their ecosystem, including which wallets, issuers, and verifiers are trusted and which credentials can be used and requested. 
 



<p>In addition to the current Anonyome Platform DI products, we are also developing:</p>



 
 Enterprise DI wallet: A combination mobile wallet application and cloud wallet, the enterprise DI wallet manages credentials associated with the enterprise. Differing from a personal DI wallet, the enterprise DI wallet is intended for one or more users to use simultaneously and to be inheritable by a future occupant of a particular job or position within an enterprise. 
 



<p>The Anonyome Platform is a SaaS-based, API-first developer platform of individualized services<br></p>



<p>Also known as the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the Anonyome Platform offers a set of DI, privacy, and cybersecurity services and SDKs that developers can add as capabilities to their existing or new applications.</p>



<p>When a customer has licensed one or more of the Sudo Platform services, we create a new Sudo Platform deployment instance for that customer, which contains their specific licensed services. One of Sudo Platform’s unique features is it doesn’t use a shared deployment model (common for SaaS environments). Rather, Sudo Platform deploys environments individually for each customer. This means the customer can customize the environment for their needs, and that customer’s data and processing are completely separate from those of other customers.</p>



<p>Once we have deployed and configured an environment for a customer, we maintain and support it, which includes updating and patching it, and monitoring it 24/7.<br><br><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">Now, head to our whitepaper for specifics on how the Anonyome Platform operates</a></p>



<p>Ready to start building?</p>



<p>Remember, we built&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so you don’t have to, and we make it easy for you to make it your own. It’s a modular, turnkey collection of services including:</p>



 
 DI 



 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications. 
 



<p><br>You can use one, some, or the entire stack to augment your established offerings with adjacent capabilities that dramatically increase value for your customers.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> includes everything you need to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments.

<p>Recent reports from the FBI have shed light on the escalating cyber espionage activities orchestrated by state-sponsored actors, particularly those emanating from China. Case in point — the emergence of the Volt Typhoon botnet, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/china-hacking-threat-us-volt-typhoon-botnet-fbi-warning">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea">AP News</a>, underscoring the critical need to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of digital identities, now more than ever.</p>
 Understanding the Threat Landscape 
<p>The FBI’s warnings regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage activities serve as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Coincidently, my last <a>blog</a> covered Midnight Blizzard – Russian nation state attackers on Microsoft. These threats pose significant challenges to national security and underscore the vulnerabilities inherent in identity verification and data protection. This also means the threat landscape is expanding.</p>
 Luckily, the Threat was Prevented 
<p>In this instance, the threat was thwarted before an incident occurred. In the case of the Midnight Blizzard attack on Microsoft, we were not so lucky. The warnings come as a shot across the collective bow for all organizations and serve as a reminder that this will not be the last time a foreign entity or any other hacker will target the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So, what are organizations to do to keep themselves out of the headlines? Not a huge surprise, but first we must all keep up with applying security patches and up-to-date versions of the OS and application layers. To restate the obvious, good system management hygiene is a must.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that bad actors log in as frequently or even more often than using some sophisticated hack to gain access. Many organizations are minimizing dependence on passwords, but they are finding that the big challenge is addressing the many authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Windows Hello for Business conveniently supports passwordless access within the Microsoft platform, but try getting this to work with Mac OS, Linux or even your VPN. Domain controllers and virtual machines, for example, also continue to depend on passwords. To the delight of hackers, the resulting “passwordless strategy” resembles Swiss Cheese more so than it does a Swiss Army knife supporting the broad range of needs enterprise wide.</p>
<p>So, on the path to eliminating passwords it’s the diversity of information technology that needs to be managed, and for good reason. Most enterprise IT environments evolved over decades as did security standards. There should be little to no expectation that somehow magically all ways of authenticating into this morass would happen with some type of hand waving let alone a black box that effortlessly solves all unanticipated authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Identity, it turns out, isn’t sufficiently managed with a password, an SMS code or the knowledge of mother’s maiden name. This is not new … a long list of three letter acronyms including IGA, SSO, PAM, and IAM all recognize identity as a corporate asset that needs to be managed and governed. None, however, seem able to keep up with the unrelenting attacks using social engineering and pirated account credentials. You just need to read the headlines to know this.</p>
 Closing the Open Door 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’ve always approached passwordless MFA as a feature, but we’ve viewed the root cause authentication issue as a business challenge revolving around identity. We solved that by performing identity verification and then generating as an artifact a non-phishable passwordless MFA credential with liveness detection.</p>
<p>But as our passwordless journey continued, something interesting happened. We found that placing identity outside of the application platforms and providing for various levels of identity assurance tuned to the risk of the digital interaction helped us rapidly evolve our identity and authentication platform to address the constant stream of use cases that surfaced in just about every customer deployment.</p>
<p>It turns out that not everybody wants an app, not everybody owns a mobile device, and some work environments outright prohibit the use of mobile handsets. By offering identity verification and authentication in a single privacy-by-design platform we’ve provided ourselves and our customers an elegant way to systematically accommodate the unexpected, and in a sense, hardest-to-solve authentication use cases.</p>
<p>This approach to identity modernization quickly augments core identity and access management to mitigate risk, reduce technical debt, and enhance access controls, effectively closing the open door that many hackers walk through unchallenged. By way of example, it’s why we’ve been able to rapidly release app-less authentication, browser-based identity verification journeys and most recently BlockID 1Key, a biometric security key.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that by integrating identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, we equip organizations with the tools and insights needed to combat identity-based attacks effectively – and in ways not possible before.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative and identity-centric approach to security, we help organizations bolster their resilience and navigate through this digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers like those behind Volt Typhoon.</p>
 Prepare Now for What May Come 
<p>Given the advanced warnings from the FBI regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage, we were lucky this time. But this sequence of events telegraphs the dangers that live among us and should serve as a battle cry for heightened security measures, starting with identity verification at first and every login … for customers, workers, and citizens.</p>
<p>Embracing innovative technologies that in turn enable rapid business innovation … it’s the path forward to reduce risk and deliver order-of-magnitude business improvement. It’s the logical path forward for organizations that thrive on the speed of innovation and want to de-risk their business plan by modernizing and simplifying identity and access management. It’s this bright future we at 1Kosmos envision for all organizations navigating digital transformation and the delivery of digital services.</p>

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks%22%20/l%20%22sign-in-risk-detections">Learn more about sign-in risk</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs. Your proactive approach to implementing multifactor authentication policies is crucial in fortifying your organization against evolving security threats.

<p>In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in distributed ID and payment card printers is not just a recommendation but a necessity. These small hardware-based security modules serve as the sentinels guarding sensitive information in a digital age.</p>
<p>Security Significance of Trusted Platform Modules</p>
<p>At its core, a Trusted Platform Module is a dedicated microcontroller chip integrated into a device’s motherboard or system-on-a-chip. Its primary function is to secure and safeguard critical data, cryptographic keys, and system integrity. TPMs adhere to established industry standards and offer a range of cryptographic operations. They generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys and execute operations like digital signatures and card issuance. One of the most critical aspects of a TPM is its ability to provide <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5254641">Secure Boot processes</a>, ensuring that the device’s firmware and operating system remain unaltered and authentic. This fundamental feature prevents attackers from compromising the system at its root, thereby establishing trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>Government institutions worldwide recognize the necessity of Trusted Platform Modules in safeguarding sensitive data and critical infrastructure. In the U.S., <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">all devices connecting to government networks are mandated to incorporate TPMs</a> as part of their security standards. These modules play a crucial role in protecting classified information, securing communications, and mitigating potential breaches. Government systems equipped with TPMs are not only more secure but also enable remote attestation, meaning that their status can be verified and authenticated by trusted entities. This is essential for ensuring that the device’s software and firmware have not been tampered with, guaranteeing the utmost security.</p>
<p>Imperative for ID and Payment Card Printers</p>
<p>Without a TPM, devices such as ID and payment card printers become susceptible to rising security threats. Hackers, malicious software, and unauthorized users can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, potentially leading to devastating consequences:</p>
 
 Data Breaches: Sensitive personal and financial information, including ID and payment card data, can be compromised, resulting in identity theft and financial fraud. 
 Counterfeit Cards: Fraudsters may take advantage of unsecured printers to produce counterfeit identification and payment cards, posing a severe risk to both individuals and institutions. 
 System Tampering: The absence of Secure Boot processes leaves systems open to firmware attacks, making them more susceptible to malware and unauthorized access. 
 
<p>The inclusion of Trusted Platform Modules in distributed ID and payment card printers is a necessity. Government institutions understand the imperative need for TPMs in safeguarding sensitive information, and the same principle applies to banks, universities, and enterprises. The absence of TPMs leaves these entities exposed to security vulnerabilities that could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By integrating TPMs into their systems, organizations can fortify their defenses against data breaches, counterfeiting, and system tampering. These modules, with their technical prowess and cryptographic capabilities, offer a solid foundation for robust security in the digital age, ensuring the trustworthiness of the devices that shape our lives. Entrust is the only provider globally using Trusted Platform Modules across our latest line of issuance systems.

<p>In recent months, ransomware attacks have gained attention and become a top concern across multiple industries. The threat has affected many well-known brands, ranging from cable providers and aircraft manufacturers to mortgage servicers and title insurance companies. Ransomware is a type of malware used to infect computers and encrypt data. Once infected, the ransomware attempts to spread to connected systems. This can include computers accessible on the network, shared drives, and backups. The goal of the attack is to render data and applications unusable for the victim until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>According to Corvus Insurance, ransomware leak site victims reached a <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-victims-record-november/">record-high in November</a>: a 39% increase from the prior month and a 110% increase year-over-year. The report suggests the uptick was largely due to LockBit and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966">CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed vulnerability</a>. The exploit allows threat actors to circumvent password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to hijack legitimate user sessions for harvesting credentials and accessing data. On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued this <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-325a">advisory</a>.</p>
<p>For financial services organizations, ransomware attacks can be particularly damaging. In August 2023, real estate brokers and agents in the U.S. suffered from an <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/commentary/mls-cyberattack-a-wake-up-call-for-all-leaders">attack</a> that took 23 multiple listing service (MLS) systems offline. MLS systems are private databases created, maintained, and funded by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell properties. In November, one of the largest <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/mr-cooper-data-breach-impacts-14-7-million-individuals/">mortgage servicers</a> in the U.S. experienced an outage impacting millions and homeowners were unable to submit mortgage payments. Weeks later, two large title insurance providers in the U.S. and UK were attacked and closing transactions were delayed. In early January, one of the largest non-bank lenders was also <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/loandepot-ransomware-exposes-17M-people/705169/">attacked</a>.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of a ransomware attack? Depending on the industry, the answer will vary. To understand the scope of impact, consider these two sample customer transactions: An iced latte beverage versus a residential piece of real estate. While the first is likely the smallest purchase a customer may make in a single day, the other may be the largest single purchase they make in their lifetime. If the ice cubes used for making the latte represent data, a real estate financing transaction is an iceberg. The volume of personally identifiable information (PII) involved with buying and selling a home and making monthly loan payments make real estate, mortgage, and title firms highly sought-after targets for would-be attackers.</p>
<p>The Ice Cube</p>
<p>When a national coffee chain is subjected to a ransomware attack, customers are likely to face temporary inconveniences. Systems may go offline. Point-of-sale systems for credit cards may be unavailable until the recovery process is complete. Perhaps loyalty rewards information or some confidential data is exfiltrated. If it is determined that a material breach occurred, the compliance team will act in accordance with state and federal breach notification laws. The impacted organization will notify, within a required timeframe upon discovery of the incident, the attorney general for each state in which affected customers reside. Impacted customers will subsequently receive a notification. If PII is stolen or lost for certain customers, those individuals may be offered free credit monitoring for a designated period.</p>
<p>The Iceberg</p>
<p>For a mortgage lender or title agency experiencing a ransomware attack, the incident response process is similar. However, the downstream impact can have significantly greater consequences. For those in the process of buying or selling a home, closings may be delayed. Outages may prevent appraisers from uploading reports. Title companies may be unable to disburse funds from escrow. Seller proceeds, mortgage payoff amounts, real estate agent commissions, and other payments will be delayed until systems are fully restored. The homeowner may be unable to make their monthly loan payment online. A mortgage servicer may be unable to receive borrower payments.</p>
<p>For most borrowers in the U.S., the mortgage servicer also facilitates the property tax and insurance payments on behalf of the homeowner. For these escrowed loans, the impact of a ransomware incident could disrupt real estate tax payments to counties and payments toward homeowner insurance policy premiums. The extent to which stolen data is used for other purposes beyond extortion, such as identity theft or credit card fraud, may also remain largely undetermined for an extended period.</p>
<p>The real estate mortgage and financing ecosystem depends on moving large sums of money in a timely manner between multiple transaction participants. Whether delayed mortgage payments or delayed real estate agent commissions, the immediate impact of a ransomware incident on a financial services organization can be substantial. A sustained outage could affect loan amortization schedules, interest calculations, and principal balances. To facilitate funding new mortgages, lenders regularly sell loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, these GSEs offer mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which consist of a group of mortgages organized to pay interest like a mortgage bond. The mission for these entities is to help provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market. Listed as one of 16 critical infrastructure <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/financial-services-sector">sectors</a> by CISA, financial services firms play an integral role in ensuring economic stability.</p>
<p>From making their smallest purchase in a single day to the largest single purchase of their lifetime, a customer’s expectations regarding data protection will vary. Leaking a customer’s latte purchase history is not a desired outcome; however, the theft of data containing a borrower’s credit history, income, bank account number, and transcripts of past tax returns is exponentially less preferred. A substandard approach to securing transactions for this segment of the industry can create dangerously high levels of risk. The real estate financing industry plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve home ownership, and customer data protection efforts should be considered accordingly.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Preparation, Prevention, and Mitigation</p>
<p>CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">#StopRansomware Guide</a> provides ransomware and data extortion preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices. Preparation best practices focus on backups, incident response plans, and implementing a Zero Trust architecture. For prevention and mitigation best practices, CISA groups by initial access vectors, such as phishing and compromised credentials. Highlights from CISA’s recommendations include:</p>
 
 Maintain Frequent Backups: Encrypt backups of critical data and store them on separate devices inaccessible from a network. 
 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Organizations should consider implementing a Zero Trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. 
 Update and Patch Systems: Ensure applications and operating systems have the latest patches and updates. Updates should be obtained directly from vendor sites rather than clicking on email links. Enable automatic software updates and do not use end-of-life software. 
 Email: If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, CISA recommends verifying the email’s legitimacy by contacting the sender directly.

 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/user-identity">Phishing-Resistant Identities</a> ensure both the user and device are verified and authenticated using digital certificates to help protect against business email compromise (BEC) and account takeover (ATO) attacks. Compromised credentials are a common initial access vector in ransomware attacks. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/reports/gartner-mq">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management</a> recognizing Entrust as a Challenger. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails. A common delivery method for ransomware is phishing. Real estate brokerages, lenders, and title agencies leveraging VMCs can prove to their transaction participants that emails received are indeed from the sending organization and not spoofed emails. VMCs also help reduce the risk of wire transfer fraud and seller impersonation fraud. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Readiness</a> – Long-lived data, such as property ownership history and mortgage loan servicing information, are at greater risk of the “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” threat. Within the decade, quantum computing capabilities powerful enough to break public key encryption protocols are expected. Organizations involved in the real estate financing industry should take steps now to protect sensitive data, applications, and transactions.

 How are connected the digital Identity and Digital Signature in Web 3.0? 



<p>Explores how digital and electronic signatures are fundamental in the age of digital identity, with a special focus on decentralized technologies, advanced cryptography and Self-Sovereign Identity within the Web 3.0 world.</p>



 Disclaimer: 



<p>In this article, we will use the terms “decentralized identity” and “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) interchangeably. It should be noted that the views and opinions expressed are based on our experience in the field of digital identity, but should not be interpreted as legal definitions.<br>What is an electronic signature?</p>



<p>An electronic signature, in essence, is your consent in the digital world. It can be an image of your signature, a PIN code, or even a click of a button. It is vital in managing digital identities and preventing cyber-attacks.</p>



 Digital signature: a specialization of electronic signature 



<p>The digital signature, a specific subset of the electronic signature, relies on asymmetric cryptography technologies. This technology uniquely links each signature to the signer and the document, providing reliable verification of authenticity. A clear example is the Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>



 Digital signature and legal entities in different countries 



 Let’s see two examples on this subject: 



 
 In Argentina: Digital signatures are restricted to individuals, which presents unique challenges for digital identities. 



 In Mexico: Legal entities can use digital signatures, advancing in the management of digital identities. 
 



 Private key management and security 



<p>The security of a digital signature is based on proper management of private keys. The responsibility for protecting these keys varies by country and type of entity, being crucial for online security.</p>



<p>Following the previous example, in countries where the digital signature is personal, as in Argentina, the responsibility for protecting the private key falls on the individual, which is fundamental for the prevention of cyber-attacks. In Mexico, on the other hand, the entity is responsible for its protection.<br>Identity in the legal and commercial sphere</p>



<p>Identity, both for individuals and entities, is built through actions, reputation and other attributes accumulated over time. For legal entities, this includes their track record, credentials and legal compliance. This identity is crucial in business and legal interactions and operations, and is at the core of what defines Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the Web 3.0 era.</p>



 Digital signature in Web3 



<p>Web3, with its focus on decentralized identity, proposes a new paradigm in the management of digital signatures. This decentralized approach, exemplified by protocols such as QuarkID, significantly improves interoperability between different systems and entities, allowing greater flexibility and control by users over their digital identities.</p>



<p>In turn, these technologies enable selective disclosure, which allows users to share only the information that is essential for a specific transaction, protecting their privacy.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the concept of non-repudiation ensures that users’ actions, backed by the immutability of the blockchain and advanced digital signatures, are indisputable, increasing the security and reliability of digital interactions.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital and electronic signatures are essential in the era of Web 3.0 and digital identity. Understanding these concepts is crucial for their effective implementation. To learn more about how Extrimian integrates digital identity and cybersecurity solutions, visit Extrimian.</p>

<p>Bluesky is building an open social network where anyone can contribute, while still providing an easy-to-use experience for users. For the past year, we used invite codes to help us manage growth while we built features like moderation tooling, custom feeds, and more. Now, we’re ready for anyone to join.</p>
 
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Sign up for Bluesky</a>
 
<p>Join more than three million people discussing news, sharing art, and just posting.</p>
 What is Bluesky? 
<p>To mark the occasion, we teamed up with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davis.social">Davis Bickford</a>, an artist on the network, to share why we’re excited about Bluesky.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>To learn more about Bluesky and how to get started, read our <a>user FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>And if deep dives are more your style, we worked with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com">Martin Kleppman</a>, author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications and technical advisor to Bluesky, to write <a href="https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf">a paper that goes into more detail</a> about the technical underpinnings of Bluesky.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>We’ve been working on more features that put you in control of your social media experience. Here’s what you can expect to see soon:</p>
 Stackable Moderation Services 
<p>Safety is core to social media. Bluesky moderates the app according to our community guidelines, and our vision for <a>composable moderation</a> allows users to stack more moderation services together, such as subscribable moderation lists.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re excited to release the labeling services which will allow users to stack more options on top of their existing moderation preferences. This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.</p>
<p>One potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz">partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz</a>.</p>
 An Open Social Network 
<p>When you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.</p>
<p>This month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.</p>
<p>For developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network. You’ll be part of the first batch of servers that federate with the network, so expect to experiment alongside us! We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon. In the meantime, you can test out your server set up via our developer sandbox. <a href="https://www.docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Find instructions here</a>.</p>

 Watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here.</a>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Indicio Identity Community Meetup kicked off its first discussion of 2024 with Michael Zuriek, Head of Innovation for Digital Travel at SITA, and Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, diving into the ways verifiable credential technology will transform the experience of travel for everyone — passengers, airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>First, some context. Indicio and SITA are partners who <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">successfully developed and deployed a Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> following International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.</p>
<p>Why is this a revolutionary technology for travel?</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is coming: Seamless travel</p>
<p>For years, countries have been storing traveler data in centralized databases and using complex agreements and policies to share that information to make travel possible. It’s why there are so many hoops travelers have to jump through when crossing borders.</p>
<p>Now, with a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) that follows ICAO’s global standard for storing identity data on personal mobile devices, there is no need for this complex, cumbersome system to facilitate border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the DTC allows security to simply scan the traveler’s digital information, in a fraction of the time of using a manual, paper-based system. And it provides a way to pre-authorize travel and check in before the traveler leaves home.</p>
<p>We have been conditioned to wait; but automation can severely reduce the bottlenecks in airports.</p>
<p>Dahl described using a DTC to pass through Aruba’s immigration as “almost magical.”: The system was so efficient and seamless that the border guard had waved her through before she was even aware of what was happening. The DTC allowed her paperwork and identity to be verified ahead of time and a biometric scan at the airport checked that she was the correct individual tied to that travel information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every traveler to Aruba will soon be able to have the same experience as the island implements DTC-enabled technology.</p>
<p>By using a DTC for all the touchpoints at an airport where identity needs to be checked, passengers get a much quicker experience, while airports, airlines, and governments benefit from the verified data, simplified privacy compliance, and enhanced security that comes from decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Airports have already invested significantly into biometrics when Covid hit, we could see rapid adoption of the DTC as some of the hardware is already in place.</p>
<p>The EU, US, IATA, and other governments and industry organizations are all currently working on bringing biometrics and digital travel together. Because Indicio and SITA’s DTC works on any airport system, deployment of the DTC will be rapid. The DTC makes biometric technology work much more efficiently and effectively, while simplifying data privacy compliance. And, on a practical level, as airports are an industry of fragmented IT systems, ease of adoption and integration is a critical value proposition. As many airports have biometric investments, the DTC is an easy way to capitalize on these investments and improve processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of takeaways from the conversation; if you have time, I highly recommend you watch the full recording which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here</a>. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch</a> with <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today to get the DTC for your business.</p>
<p>Join us for the next meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup, where we’ll be speaking with Klaeri Schelhowe, Executive Director of Trust Alliance New Zealand and their Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project a tool that enables farmers, farm enterprises, and industry organizations to manage critical farm data in an efficient and secure way.</p>

  The European Securities and Markets Authority has urged member states to decide whether to opt into MiCA’s grandfathering scheme or not by June 30th,&nbsp;2024.  The first part of South Korea’s planned two-part crypto regulation draft will come into force in July this&nbsp;year.  2024 is going to be a regulatory intense year for the crypto space in the US, with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act setting the stage for stablecoin regulations in the&nbsp;country.  <p>Just weeks into 2024, the crypto world is already seeing major regulatory changes, with the most notable one being the US SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as a lot more is to come this year in areas like issuance, services, stablecoins, and oversight, with a strong focus on AML and KYC measures.</p><p>Emerging technologies such as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs will also be under the regulatory lens, especially in Europe, Japan, and parts of Africa this year. So, what major crypto regulatory changes are we to expect from these areas in&nbsp;2024?</p> Europe <p>2024 will bring a wave of sweeping changes across the crypto landscape. The rollout of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA)</a> in EU states is reshaping the scene, even influencing economic partners like Switzerland. As this unfolds, European regulators are joining forces, aiming to streamline how they categorize, monitor, and handle the tech side of crypto assets, creating a unified approach across the continent, with different types of crypto assets getting their own unique set of&nbsp;rules.</p> European Union <p>As a part of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation rollout, the European Securities and Market Authority is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">set to issue guidelines</a> on crypto asset categorization, market monitoring, and technological infrastructure standards. <a href="https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/eu/esma-encourages-smooth-transition-to-mica/">By June 30th, 2024</a>, EU states must decide on opting into the grandfathering scheme under MiCA, which permits crypto asset service providers to operate under national laws until MiCA authorization is obtained or&nbsp;denied.</p><p>This scenario could lead to varied regulatory approaches across Europe, which ESMA aims to harmonize. Furthermore, the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA24-229244789-4595_SMSG_Advice_on_MiCA_package__1.pdf">advising ESMA</a> to ensure MiCA’s alignment with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by the end of&nbsp;2024.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p><a href="https://decrypt.co/200289/uk-wont-be-copying-mica-crypto-parliamentary-group-chair">Instead of creating</a> a standalone regulatory framework like the EU’s MiCA, the UK plans to incorporate crypto activities into its existing financial services framework, necessitating crypto firms to comply with traditional banking regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority will offer guidance for crypto businesses <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/01/uk-crypto-firms-to-get-broad-laws-may-need-new-authorization/">requiring authorization</a> under this&nbsp;regime.</p><p>Different types of crypto assets, such as unique NFTs and already-regulated assets like security tokens, will also be distinctly regulated this year. Moreover, legislation to formalize this framework is anticipated in 2024, with transitional arrangements for businesses. As for stablecoins, the UK’s immediate regulatory emphasis is on fiat-backed ones used in payment systems, with legislation targeted for early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.taxjournal.com/articles/-it-would-be-premature-ineffective-for-the-uk-to-regulate-defi-activities-currently-says-treasury-#:~:text=the%20UK%20government%20does%20not,to%20regulate%20DeFi%20activities%20currently.">regulation of Decentralized Finance</a> remains under consideration.</p> Switzerland <p>Switzerland is implementing the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.pdf">Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</a> this year, bringing digital assets under tax transparency regulations and necessitating due diligence on users by crypto service providers. Moreover, the Federal Department of Finance also plans to prepare a <a href="https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/the-fdf/nsb-news_list.msg-id-98545.html">consultation draft for implementing these rules</a>, targeting completion by the end of June&nbsp;2024.</p> Asia Pacific&nbsp;(APAC) <p>Across the Asia Pacific region, governments and regulatory authorities are placing a heightened focus on strengthening the regulatory frameworks to ensure the security of digital assets and protect consumers. This includes the implementation of clear taxation policies for crypto assets, where profits from transactions are subject to taxation, and strict reporting requirements are imposed on crypto investors.</p><p>Governments are also emphasizing the importance of security and compliance, with regulations targeting anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and robust cybersecurity standards. Additionally, emerging technologies like DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins are receiving regulatory attention, leading to the development of comprehensive policies and guidelines.</p> Japan <p>In 2024, Japan will continue its detailed approach to cryptocurrency regulation, focusing on consumer protection. This is in response to past breaches at Japanese exchanges, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures. We can also expect Japan to initiate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/269200/japan-seeks-to-exempt-companies-from-tax-on-unrealized-crypto-gains-reports#:~:text=The%20Japanese%20government%20has%20approved,according%20to%20local%20media%20reports.">its much-anticipated tax policy reforms</a> to support the growth of crypto startups this&nbsp;year.</p> India <p>India is yet to finalize its approach to cryptocurrencies, with the anticipated cryptocurrency bill still pending since 2021. However, the Reserve Bank of India <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/rbi-ranks-crypto-near-the-bottom-of-systematic-risks-despite-harsh-criticism/77763/1">remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies</a> and instead favors CBDCs over other digital currencies, indicating no major regulatory changes in 2024. So, we are unlikely to see any major changes in terms of crypto regulations in India in&nbsp;2024.</p> South Korea <p>South Korea is working on a two-part crypto regulation framework for 2024. The first part, focusing on structuring the crypto market, will take effect in July 2024, whereas the second part, which is still under development, will establish rules for the issuance, listing, and delisting of cryptocurrencies. The country has also decided <a href="https://www.khan.co.kr/economy/finance/article/202401111541001">not to support crypto ETFs</a> and is considering <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/04/south-korea-regulator-seeks-ban-on-crypto-purchases-with-credit-cards/amp/">banning credit card purchases</a> of cryptocurrencies. Adding to this, <a href="https://crypto.news/south-korea-to-mandate-crypto-disclosure-for-5800-officials-in-2024/">both officials and companies</a> will need to start revealing their crypto holdings from next&nbsp;year.</p> Singapore <p>In 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to focus on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-23/singapore-plans-more-rules-to-curb-retail-crypto-speculation">reducing speculative trading</a> in cryptocurrencies, including the ban on cryptocurrency platforms offering incentives for trading. Moreover, starting in mid-2024, the use of Singapore credit cards to purchase digital payment tokens will <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cryptocurrencies-digital-payment-token-credit-card-mas-2311461">no longer be&nbsp;allowed</a>.</p> Hong Kong <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC67">are considering applications</a> for spot crypto ETFs and other virtual asset funds this year. It is expected to make significant progress in stablecoin regulation, too, with <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/12/20231227/">a consultation paper</a> already published seeking public feedback. The regulator also has plans to unveil <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/12/20231227-4/">a “sandbox” framework</a>, enabling market participants to engage directly with the regulatory environment in&nbsp;2024.</p> China <p>The People’s Bank of China recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-pboc-crypto-defi-stability-report">emphasized the need</a> for global crypto rules, maintaining its tough stance on cryptocurrencies. However, the country is pushing for <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/273492/china-forms-metaverse-working-group-with-huawei-tencent-ant-group-and-others#:~:text=China%20has%20formed%20a%20working,growth%20of%20the%20nascent%20industry.">standardization in the metaverse sector</a>, collaborating with tech giants and government representatives, and has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/chinese-regulators-aim-to-disconnect-gaming-tokens-from-real-world-currency/#:~:text=Chinese%20authorities%20have%20proposed%20a,regulations%20for%20the%20gaming%20industry.">proposed a ban</a> on converting virtual gaming tokens to real-world assets this&nbsp;year.</p> Australia <p>Australia plans to advance its <a href="https://paymentexpert.com/2023/10/16/australia-new-crypto-regulations-2024/">crypto licensing framework in 2024</a>, introducing a regulatory framework covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers. This legislation, once approved, will include a 12-month transitional period. The Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia will also <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/australian-cbdc-pilot-for-digital-finance-innovation-project-report.pdf">publish a joint report</a> on CBDC research this year, setting a roadmap for future&nbsp;work.</p> The Americas <p>Governments throughout the Americas are actively enhancing cryptocurrency regulations to address common concerns. They’re taking steps to combat issues like money laundering and fraud and safeguard investors.</p><p>A prominent focus is on regulating stablecoins, with measures to ensure that issuers maintain sufficient reserves and adhere to financial rules gaining traction.</p><p>Additionally, tax regulations concerning cryptocurrencies are being clarified, encompassing reporting requirements, capital gains taxes, and income tax obligations for crypto-related activities.</p> The United&nbsp;States <p>2024 in the US kicked off with the launch of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023">the country’s first Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. Yet, the SEC is maintaining its firm stance, not relenting in its rigorous crypto scrutiny. Laws for stablecoin issuers are also likely to emerge in 2024 following the House Financial Services Committee’s passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4766/text">the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>, which is currently awaiting consideration in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Another key focus for this year is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12223">the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, which could shift the crypto world from securities to commodities, with the CFTC taking the lead. Similarly, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info">the bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act</a> aims to classify most cryptos as commodities, shifting more responsibility to the CFTC and establishing stablecoin regulations.</p><p>Moreover, from January 2024, <a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-contains-new-cryptocurrency-reporting-requirements">the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> has been in effect, making it mandatory for entities to report crypto transactions over $10,000 to the IRS or face serious consequences. Lastly, the outcome of the US elections in November 2024 could significantly impact the crypto industry, as a crypto-friendly administration could bring much-needed clarity and legitimacy to the&nbsp;sector.</p> Canada <p>The Canadian Securities Administrator announced <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-seek-feedback-on-rules-for-public-investment-funds-holding-crypto-assets/">new regulations for public investment funds</a> in crypto assets in January this year, which is open for public feedback until April 17th, 2024. The new rule will permit only the non-redeemable and alternative investment funds to handle crypto transactions directly, requiring other mutual funds to invest through these entities. It also underlines that the crypto assets must also be fungible, insured, stored offline, and listed on a recognized Canadian exchange with an annual custodian review.</p> Brazil <p>In Brazil, policymakers are working to tighten crypto regulation and bring brokerages under stricter supervision in 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-government-tax-income-financial-investments-obtained-abroad-2023-05-01/">newly enacted income tax regulations</a>, effective January 1st, 2024, impose up to 15% tax on individuals earning over $1,200 from foreign-based exchanges, aiming to generate $4 billion in tax revenue. Also, the Brazilian central bank’s digital currency, DREX, is in its testing phase until February 14th, 2024, with a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-central-bank-names-digital-193619347.html">public launch</a> planned by year-end.</p> Colombia <p>Colombian lawmakers are drafting a <a href="https://bacsociety.com/en/new-bill-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-in-colombia/">bill for comprehensive crypto regulation</a>, with collaboration between the crypto ecosystem and government bodies like the Central Bank and the Financial Superintendency. The bill, expected to be presented publicly this year, will undergo analysis by the Executive and then Congressional approval.</p> Argentina <p>This year, Argentinian President Javier Milei, a pro-Bitcoin advocate, aims to introduce crypto regulation aligned with the IMF’s anti-money laundering approach.</p><p>Milei’s draft bill, <a href="https://www.ambito.com/adjuntos/239/documentos/041/223/0041223294.pdf">the Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines</a> proposes favorable tax rates for declared domestic and foreign crypto holdings and legalizes their use. Tax rates start at 5% until March 2024, then increase to 10% through June, and 15% thereafter until September 2024.‍</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Africa <p>In the Middle East and Africa, governments are attempting to strike a balance between nurturing the growth of digital finance and addressing regulatory challenges. This trend involves a focus on developing structured frameworks for cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, reflecting an awareness of their growing economic impact. However, there’s also an emphasis on enhancing anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures within the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>​​This year, the UAE is on the brink of finalizing its stablecoin laws, with Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority leading the charge. VARA, the first of its kind in crypto supervision, <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/dubais-move-oversee-stablecoins-bring-certainty-regulatory-grey-area">has revamped its virtual asset rulebook</a> to integrate regulations for fiat-referenced virtual assets (FRVAs), or stablecoins. These rules categorize cryptocurrencies, placing FRVAs in ‘category 1’. For stablecoin issuers, this means getting authorization and a license from VARA and adhering to its stringent regulations and the newly minted FRVA&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority has also recently <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">tweaked its AML and sanctions rules</a> in line with the FATF Travel Rule, specifically targeting provisions related to wire transfers in the digital asset&nbsp;realm.</p> Saudi Arabia <p>As of yet, Saudi Arabia does not have a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country has also banned banks from processing transactions related to crypto, while the Saudi Central Bank governor has <a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/636735/SAUDI-ARABIA/SAMA-chief-warns-against-dangers-of-crypto-currencies">underscored the need</a> for adequate supervision, regulation, and coordination in virtual currency activities. Amidst this, SAMA has been experimenting through the launch of <a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/cbshgsmf/aber-report-2020-en.pdf">Project Aber</a>, a joint collaboration between SAMA and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (“CBUAE”), which explores CBDC for cross-border payments. Besides these developments that will continue this year, there’s not much happening on the regulatory front in&nbsp;Saudi.</p> South Africa <p>Last year, on October 22nd, South Africa began <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/News%20Documents/FSCA%20Press%20Release_Declaration%20of%20Crypto%20Assets%20As%20A%20Financial%20Product_20%20October%202022.pdf">recognizing cryptocurrencies as a financial product</a> and made it <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/south-africas-crypto-firms-will-soon-need-to-apply-for-registration-or-face-a-heavy-fine/?_gl=1*1cr5fq9*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE1NjY2NzkxLjE3MDU4MjY0MDI.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwNTgyNjQwMS4xLjAuMTcwNTgyNjQwMS4wLjAuMA..">mandatory for all crypto exchanges</a> to secure operating licenses before the year ends. While the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act currently governs them, crypto-related services will <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/2020%2010%2008%20CoFI%20Bill%20(version%20published%20for%20comment)%20(slightly%20updated).pdf">soon fall under the Conduct of Financial Institutions bill</a>, set to become law in the coming years. Additionally, with the Financial Action Task Force closely monitoring South Africa, 2024 will bring more robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures to the crypto sector, aiming to help the country exit the greylist by&nbsp;2025.</p> Nigeria <p>Nigeria, after lifting its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-central-bank-lifts-ban-crypto-trading-2023-12-23/">2021 crypto ban</a>, has set out <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">new rules for VASPs</a>, focusing on strong KYC and AML checks. However, Nigerian banks still can’t <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">trade or hold cryptocurrencies</a> themselves. At the same time, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to handle license applications from crypto custodians and exchanges, showing a careful move towards more involvement in cryptocurrencies.</p> Kenya <p>After passing the <a href="https://kra.go.ke/images/publications/The-Finance-Act--2023.pdf">Finance Bill 2023</a> and signing it into law, Kenya is ready for a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework covering tax integration and revenue guidelines. The local industry lobby group, the Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK), is tasked with <a href="https://www.mariblock.com/kenyan-lawmakers-blockchain-association-draft-crypto-bill/">preparing the first draft</a> of a VASP bill referred to as the Crypto Bill by the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. With that, Kenya might become the first country where the industry’s representatives <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainKenya/status/1748641509069435244">develop</a> the regulatory framework for&nbsp;crypto.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In 2024, we’re at a crossroads as far as global crypto regulations are concerned. Across the globe, from the European Union to the United States, governments are crafting new rules, influencing how the world perceives and uses cryptocurrencies in everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>While each country’s approach varies, it’s crucial to ensure that the underlying intent remains consistent: safeguarding user experience and security. The decisions made this year will not only shape the immediate future of cryptocurrencies but will also lay the groundwork for their integration into the mainstream global financial ecosystem. So, this year will go down in history as a defining moment for the crypto industry, one that could determine its trajectory for the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 4th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In today’s issue, we will cover the latest regulatory updates from all over the world from the last two weeks as we enter into the second month of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As crypto adoption grows, regulatory developments, too, are getting ramped up with the US and Europe aiming for more clear guidelines. Meanwhile, in another part of the world, China remains unfriendly towards crypto while its special administrative region, Hong Kong, continues to provide regulatory guidelines in an attempt to become a crypto&nbsp;hub.</p><p>So, let’s take a deeper look into these regulatory advances being made around the globe and their impact on the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> The Global Landscape of Crypto Regulations <p>One of the major developments on the crypto regulatory front comes from the US, as American lawmakers are trying to delete the controversial accounting bulletin that imposes restrictions on companies for holding their customer’s crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong is making major crypto regulatory moves, as it is planning to consult on the regulatory framework for over-the-counter crypto venues “very soon.” China, meanwhile, is amending its <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering regulations</a> for the first time since 2007 to cover crypto-related transactions.</p><p>Similarly, in Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authorities, the securities regulatory authority of the 27-member union, is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">seeking public feedback until April-end</a> to assess the criteria for classifying crypto as financial instruments.</p><p>With the proposed guidelines, the financial regulator aims to provide authorities and market participants with flexible conditions to determine whether a crypto asset can be categorized as a financial instrument, avoid having a one-size-fits-all approach, and ensure consistency across the&nbsp;region.</p> US Lawmakers Challenge the SEC on Crypto Custody&nbsp;Rule <p>Members of Congress, including Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) has introduced resolutions to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">2022 staff accounting bulletin&nbsp;№121</a>.</p><p>The custody rule requires a company holding a client’s crypto assets to do so on its own balance sheet.

<p>There’s been quite a buzz about Zero Trust in the last couple of years. Its genesis dates back to 2009, when the then Forrester Research analyst John Kindervag popularized the term when presenting the idea that an organization should not extend trust to anything inside or outside its perimeters. However, Zero Trust is still not a theme that resonates with all IT security experts. There are some who find it too fuzzy and non-deterministic, given that it is more akin to a philosophy or organizational strategy than a prescriptive certification that can be followed to the letter.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Principles – A Look Back in Time</p>
<p>We concluded that Zero Trust is firmly rooted in traditional well-established security design principles. We reached out to our Director of Product Security, Pali Surdhar, to get his view on Zero Trust. Pali forwarded a vintage document for our edification. The document “<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1011/R01/75-protection.pdf">The Protection of Information in Computer Systems</a>,” authored by Jerome H. Saltzer and Michael D. Schroeder, was published a mere 49 years ago in 1975. This was a time when computers were the preserve of universities, industry, and governments, and usually so big that they needed a large room to accommodate them. It was a time when Gates, Allen, Jobs, and Wozniak were just fledgling computer enthusiasts about to start their transformational journey in personal computing.</p>
<p>A quote from the abstract section of the paper gives a flavor of the content. “[this paper] examines in depth the principles of modern protection architectures and the relation between capability systems and access control list systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected subsystems and protected objects.”</p>
<p>Security Principles Circa 1975</p>
<p>The paper then introduces three security categories:</p>
 
 Unauthorized information release 
 Unauthorized information modification 
 Unauthorized denial of use 
 
<p>These terms still resonate, although today we’d probably describe them as data breach, code hacking, and finally, Denial of Service, or perhaps a ransomware attack, where a bad actor has taken measures to lock out the authorized user.</p>
<p>The paper then provides examples of security techniques sometimes applied to computer systems. We thought it would be worthwhile translating into today’s cybersecurity terminology.</p>



Security Techniques&nbsp; – 1975
Today’s Security Terminology
Aligned with a Zero Trust Principle?




Labeling files with lists of authorized users
Access Control List – defines who has access to a system or application. Authorization and authentication could apply here too.
Yes


Verifying the identity of a prospective user by demanding a password
Password verification or even passwordless MFA
Yes


Shielding the computer to prevent interception and subsequent interpretation of electromagnetic radiation
Side channel attacks. Typically require an antenna or probe within close proximity of a device to eavesdrop by analyzing electromagnetic signals.
N/A


Enciphering information sent over telephone lines
Encryption, probably using TLS or similar. Refer to our last blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/harvest-now-decrypt-later-fact-or-fiction/">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later – Fact or Fiction</a> for more information.
Yes


Locking the room containing the computer
Access control, defense in depth, secure room/vault, etc. These security measures are all still in use today.
Yes


Controlling who is allowed to make changes to the computer system (both its hardware and software)
Least privilege principle – only giving access to those who have the correct clearance and need access to the system
Yes


Using redundant circuits or programmed cross-checks that maintain security in the face of hardware or software failures
High availability would typically be used today with hardware devices having a backup device ready to continue service should a failure occur. Software can be designed with similar fault tolerance.
N/A


Certifying that the hardware and software are actually implemented as intended
In today’s IT environment this would involve a combination of internal quality assurance, security testing, and approval of hardware or software design. In addition, the code or hardware could be submitted to a third party for penetration testing and product certification against industry standards such as FIPS 140-2/3 or PCI DSS. Given today’s complex software and hardware systems, knowing the provenance of the components is essential. This is achieved through bills of materials, code signing, and security processors in hardware.
Yes



<p>So while the language used is reflective of the time it was written, we think you’ll agree that most of the ideas conveyed are security principles that equally apply in today’s modern distributed architectures.</p>
<p>NIST, CSA, and the CIA Triad</p>
<p>For those not inclined to read the 59-page NIST <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf">SP 800-207</a> document, here are the seven core tenets of Zero Trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Building on the NIST publication, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has recently published its <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/zero-trust-guiding-principles/">Zero Trust Guiding Principles</a>. For anyone who wants to get up the learning curve on Zero Trust without digging too much into the weeds, it is an excellent read. It is also reassuring that the CSA Zero Trust Working Group are of the same opinion as us:</p>
<p>“Zero Trust is a collection of long-standing principles applied in a way that aligns the security architecture with the way we work and live.“</p>
<p>The CSA document then provides a list of the security principles critical to the success of your Zero Trust effort:</p>
 
 Concept of least-privilege access controls (e.g., preventative) 
 Separation of duties (e.g., preventative) 
 Segmentation/micro-segmentation (e.g., preventative) 
 Logging and monitoring (e.g., detective) 
 Configuration drift remediation (e.g., corrective/reactive) 
 
<p>While the term Zero Trust was coined by Kindervag 34 years after the Saltzer &amp; Schroeder paper, we think you’ll agree that many of those principles align with the 1975 document.</p>
<p>And while things have certainly changed since 1975, when computers were monolithic and had limited networking capabilities (think remote users connecting in from terminals), the concerns about security were the same: protecting confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Hopefully most of you will be familiar with the CIA triad, another cybersecurity fundamental.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Unchanging Need for Robust Security</p>
<p>Today, while the concerns remain the same, the complexity of compute environments has greatly increased. For example, in current environments, systems can be spread out across multiple clouds, software systems consist of many microservices, and data resides everywhere, just to name a few of the complexities. Additionally, today’s users not only consist of internal computer users sitting at their desks with directly connected terminals, but also potentially anyone, anywhere on the planet, accessing these complex systems via the internet.</p>
<p>The problem, and the strategy to mitigate the problem, have remained somewhat unchanged over the years. It is just the scale of the problem that has changed. Saltzer and Schroeder knew that the identity of a user needed to be established. They specified using a password for this. At the time with the limited access (no wide area network) this was sufficient. Today users (and adversaries) can access systems from anywhere. This makes establishing identity require something more than a strong password.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while Saltzer and Schroeder talked about locking their 1970s computer room (i.e., protecting the perimeter), they recognized that wasn’t in itself sufficient. In today’s world of distributed users and a multitude of devices wanting access, those physical walls have been replaced by a virtual perimeter, making it even harder to protect and further emphasizing the need for alternative approaches. Zero Trust therefore does not focus on perimeter defense, but instead advocates for strong identity (never trust, always verify) and micro-segmentation (to avoid lateral movement through the network). Sometimes what’s old is new, and that is because we have had a good thing all along.</p>

Learn about the significance of 1Kosmos becoming an AWS advanced technology partner and the seamless deployment options for developers. Explore how this collaboration enhances user experience, reinforces identity management, and sets the stage for the future of secure digital identity. </p>
  
<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Hi, I am Rob MacDonald, vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and today I’m joined by Huzefa, co-founder and COO of 1Kosmos. How are you doing today Huzefa?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>I am doing great, Rob. It’s a Friday, so never better.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>It’s Friday, you’re in New Jersey, I heard it snowed a little bit this week, I hope you’re keeping warm.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>When you talk about snow, you’re in Canada, so I cannot talk to you about snow. We got a little bit of a sprinkling, that’s it.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Fair enough. All right, well listen, today, thanks for joining us, or joining me. We just made a recent announcement of a new integration partner, Amazon Cognito. So, before we talk about all the goodness of what we’re doing with Cognito, why don’t you tell me a little bit about what it is? What is Cognito?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, Cognito is a single sign-on platform, an IdP provider that Amazon Web Services provides, especially if you are building your applications on the AWS platform, this is the native integration that the AWS provides out of the box. So, Cognito is widely used across applications, individual applications that may be developed and have their own ecosystems within the AWS network.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Cool. So, interesting. Where is AWS deployed within an organization? So, you said it’s an IdP, I think everybody that’s probably listening to these understands what an IdP is, but where do you typically find it? Because, when we think workforce in particular, there’s Okta and Microsoft and ForgeRock and Ping. Where’s Cognito, where do you find that?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>They primarily operate in the customer identity and access management or CIAM space today. So, they have not published essentially their numbers of their deployment, but it’s pretty vastly adopted. So, any kind of a public facing application which is hosted on AWS application, and if they would not have a custom integration to be done on Okta or Microsoft, Amazon says, here you go, you can use AWS Cognito.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, the primary use case for this would be a CIAM type of initiative, somebody’s put some application on AWS, and then this is the identity management portion of that application, is that what I understood?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Makes sense. So, what motivated either 1Kosmos to partner with AWS or AWS to partner with 1Kosmos? How did that come to be?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, identity is our motivation. We’ve made some significant deployments in the CIAM space recently. 2023 has been a great year for us in that particular sense. And our customers were essentially looking for, hey, do you have these integrations with AWS Cognito that you provide out of box? Their footprint is pretty vast, which I got to know. And that has led to us building this integration with them and providing a more out of box solution with them as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, that’s amazing. Everybody knows AWS, everybody knows Amazon, and it’s cool to know that they’re doing this part of their business as well. So, we are now considered an AWS advanced technology partner. So, what specifically does that mean?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, our integration today with AWS is around us being a strong authentication for them. Meaning, if you need to do either multifactor authentication, if you want to do passwordless, if you want to have passkeys that you can deploy on your application that is supported by AWS Cognito, here you go. We are the partner of choice that you can go to. So, it’s pretty significant because most of the applications are now being mandated from a compliance standpoint that, hey, you need to have either Strong MFA or support passwordless passkeys in your application deployment stack, and that’s where our integration with AWS Cognito becomes extremely important. I just wanted to add that we want to continue this particular integration and develop further stories, more on the other sides of pieces that we have, identity proofing and better public mentions, but that is more in the future for us.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, based on what I’ve read on the Amazon Cognito site, they have more of these advanced technology partners. It looks like organizations that are aligned to that have gone through some sort of testing, is that correct? By Amazon?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Yeah, integration as well as testing. So, while anything that we’ve done with AWS, it goes through significant scrutiny and review. So, even this particular integration that we put together, we had to document it. The entire GitHub of this particular technical integration is available. It is referenced in a blog that is published by the AWS community that goes out to anybody, the AWS customer. You can essentially go back and look at it. There are references to the GitHub link as well and what that integration is. But, anyway, all of this was not put together by us. We provided the integration story, but it was reviewed through multiple different channels and reviews. I cannot even recall how many by AWS and published by them.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Well, that’s amazing. So, somebody looking at adding our technology into that stack can be pretty much rest assured that it’s been tested by Amazon to make sure that it works with their technology, and that the integration and implementation of us with Cognito would be seamless.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, if you’re a developer, if you’re watching this, if you have AWS Cognito, feel free to look at the blog. Maybe we can reference it into the link as well when we post this. But, it’s pretty simple, straightforward. You would essentially put a custom auth plugin with 1Kosmos, and there you go. You’ll be able to provide strong MFA or passwordless authentication to your end customers.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Awesome. We take user experience pretty seriously here at 1Kosmos. I guess, I’m sure you would agree with me on that. Everything we do revolves around that and basically privacy. But, it’s commonly known that users will go elsewhere if it’s too hard, if what they came to do wasn’t easy. How does 1Kosmos help Cognito users provide a better experience when they’re dealing with their end users?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, when the experience is, and I always want to highlight that there are two experiences. One is the strong MFA, because we believe in the story of you don’t have to completely take your organization from password to passwordless from day one to day two. You may have a transition period, so strong MFA becomes important. So, we have factored that experience in the entire channel where you can authenticate in Cognito, and then there’s a dialogue box that opens up, which essentially factors in what 1Kosmos provides to you, as any of the strong MFA options that you may have, push notifications, OTP, TOTP, et cetera. For our passwordless and passkeys, we provide an SDK, which again, from an end user standpoint, it seems seamless for them, where all they’re doing is entering their username, their backend API calls that we’re available, that contact 1Kosmos console or gateway that we have, and then we provide, we essentially see if this particular authentication is valid and give the signals back to AWS.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Listen, I think it’s amazing. So, when we look at Amazon Cognito customers, we touched on it earlier, but how easy, or a developer, how easy is it for developers to deploy 1Kosmos into a Cognito instance?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, like I said, you can sign up for a 1Kosmos instance by going to a developer environment. If you have a Cognito instance, you can sign up for a free account for Cognito as well. That is available on the AWS site. There are instructions to develop a custom auth plugin. And on that particular blog we also highlight, and the GitHub repository, what are the steps that you need to essentially use to integrate AWS Cognito with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, then as a follow on to that question, that obviously sounds relatively easy. How would customers acquire an instance of BlockID? So, it’s like, I like it, I installed it at work, and the testing developer did all the great work. How do I then pay for the instance that I chose?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>We want to make the entire experience easy. So, if you’re a customer in the AWS ecosystem, we are listed on the AWS Marketplace. We have three distinct product lines that are available. So, you can choose any one of them. Most likely it will be around BlockID customer or verify. And you can sign up for the product through AWS Marketplace. You would get your instance, your license keys, et cetera, through that particular portal and you’ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>That’s cool. Listen, Huzefa, I know that you’re super busy as always, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time today to sit down and tell us about this exciting announcement that we made this week. And I wish you the best, and I hope you come back and talk to me again on a vlog soon.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Look forward to it, Robert. Thank you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, listen, if you want to find out more about this integration, you can check out our website. We’ve got a data sheet and a press release there that you can go take a read and learn more about this Cognito integration. And then, plus, as Huzefa mentioned earlier, there’s a Amazon Cognito blog that you can read as well. We’ll put the links to all of those down below. Thanks again everybody. We’ll see you again shortly.</p>

<p>In 2024, our product vision is to continue delivering solutions that empower not only issuers, but all ecosystem participants in the tokenization journey to&nbsp;cultivate liquidity and accumulate more users.&nbsp;In our view, to achieve the liquidity endgame, we have to build it up through a few phases: standardization, digitalization, collateralization, distribution, and then reach the liquid secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Below, I’ll explain how we are turning our product vision into actionable steps to address your technical and operational pain points, smoothly transitioning to new phases, and adding value and services, all while improving liquidity for your investors.</p>
<p>Accelerating standardization phase:&nbsp;The industry now embraces the official token standard ERC-3643 for compliant tokenization. We’re working closely with the ERC3643 Association to swiftly advance standardization. Our focus includes developing key tools like the ERC-3643 DApp, streamlining the effortless deployment and management of ERC3643 tokens, and setting a new benchmark for simplicity in compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>Digitizing real-world assets and securities en masse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Speeding up time to market:&nbsp;While our contributions to standardization are open-source, the value of Tokeny’s solutions extends beyond smart contract deployment (<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">more details here</a>). We are committed to enhancing our APIs and white-label SaaS solutions. Tailored products for diverse segments, ranging from asset managers to Web3 RWA projects, are in development to catalyze the RWA wave and advance the asset digitization phase.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Delivering immediate benefits:&nbsp;Accelerating towards liquidity begins with addressing immediate pain points for institutions. Why tokenize now? It’s all about enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining processes with 3rd parties applications, to slash costs. By solving these points, we can set the stage for bringing enormous high-quality assets on-chain, laying the foundation for the critical mass needed for advanced services, and emphasizing transferability, reach, and liquidity.</p>
 
 Improved operational efficiency:&nbsp;Manual, human-based processes are not just time-consuming but also costly. And it is a common challenge across the entire private market. To tackle this, we’re developing features and smart contracts for various business cases, automating workflows from onboarding, and corporate actions, to secondary tradings. Automation increases operational capability, empowering institutions to reach a larger investor base. 
 Bridging 3rd party digital applications:&nbsp;Another notable challenge arises from the fragmented collaboration between various applications, each operated by different third parties. The multitude of digital applications involved in operations can create gaps when assets are brought on-chain. To address this, our products will continue to connect these disparate solutions, ensuring a cohesive operational workflow between tokenized assets and the involved providers. 
 
<p>3.&nbsp;The powerhouse for major corporations:&nbsp;Our strategy revolves around seamless integration into legacy systems and forming partnerships with tech providers, such as custody solutions, integrators, and financial platforms. Through strategic ecosystem integrations, we empower partners to seamlessly utilize our engine, allowing them to concentrate on their core business and sales while we manage all technical aspects.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi by building a common data set for private markets:&nbsp;Initiated by accelerating permissioned DeFi, this month, we co-developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-association-members-developed-open-source-ui-components-to-bridge-defi-and-regulated-rwa?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">an open-source UI component</a>&nbsp;with Dev.Pro. With this tool, DeFi is now equipped for regulated assets through ERC-3643, enabling any decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMMs), or lending protocol to provide compliant liquidity or collateralization for tokenized securities and RWA. Regulated entities can even launch their lending smart contracts. Our next move involves building a universal data set for tokenized securities through a product named AssetID, facilitating easy access to verifiable asset data for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Building the distribution rails: DINO is an interoperable distribution network for digital securities that leverages the ERC-3643 standard. Our commitment to growth extends to integrating additional distribution channels into the DINO ecosystem. Compatibility with centralized exchanges (CEX) and AMMs is seamlessly established on our platform. As we eagerly await more DeFi protocols, the open-source UI component stands ready to welcome them. Think of us as a connector, ensuring a seamless convergence of all distribution rails on our platform.</p>
<p>Secondary market innovation:&nbsp;We will unveil an upgraded version of the Billboard, serving as a license-exempted P2P secondary market solution, enabling investors to seamlessly publish buy or sell intentions, just like placing an ad. Taking it a step further, we will introduce a fully decentralized version of the Billboard, entirely powered by smart contracts. This will allow counterparts to accept an offer directly on-chain, facilitating a peer-to-peer transaction. The offer can circulate across the entire distribution network, visible to all, but only eligible investors for the concerned tokens can accept it.</p>
<p>Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to embarking on this journey with you. Stay tuned for more developments throughout the year.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF74 rewards. DF75 runs Feb 1 — Feb 8,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 74 (DF74) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 25, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 1. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF75 is live today, Feb 1. It concludes on Feb 8. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF75   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF75 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Future updates will add decentralized ecosystem governance (DEGov), JSON-LD and SD-JWT credential types, and OID4VC, providing interoperability with the European Union’s Digital Identity Wallet standards. Indicio is committed to enabling interoperability with all major cross border projects.</p>
<p>“Our SDK is the biggest advancement in digital identity wallet technology to date,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “We’ve eliminated the complexity of having to cobble together code written in different languages from multiple libraries and delivered a single source for integrated innovation with comprehensive functionality and interoperability — all based on well-tested code. Everything’s in one place for you to start building, save time, save money, and deliver the killer features your customers want in your products.”</p>
<p>Apps created using the Indicio Proven Mobile SDK also work with <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a>, Indicio’s complete out-of-the-box product for issuing and verifying wallet data.

<p>METAR scores are made in every airport, every hour of the day. Can you predict the next few hours with the highest accuracy?</p><p>2024 marks the 3rd year of the Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Program initiative. ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ is the second data challenge in 2024, and the second opportunity to score points in the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Championship Leaderboard</a> for this season. The challenge launches today Feb 1, 2024, with a deadline to participate ending Feb 20, 2024, 23:59:59 UTC. Access to the challenge description and submission guidelines can be found on the <a href="https://desights.ai/challenge/18">Desights</a> platform.</p><p>The dataset used for the ‘Aviation Weather Forecasting Using METAR Data’ challenge holds METAR scores that update every hour of every day. at KPIM Miami International Airport. We will only use 1 airport for this data challenge, though METAR is a standard score updated at each airport. The data we use for this challenge is Miami's historical METAR logs from 2014–2023. Recognizing the symmetrical data structure of METAR as a metric, models developed in this challenge will be able to be run in real-time for 1–12hr ahead of present-time predictions for METAR score. This is a unique opportunity for data people to dive into real-world data and uncover insights that could shape the future of aviation safety, understanding, airline efficiency, and pilots driving&nbsp;planes.</p> Challenge Overview <p>Objective: Building upon the insights gained from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), participants in this data science competition will venture into hands-on, real-world artificial intelligence (AI) &amp; machine learning (ML). Their primary objective is to develop advanced models that accurately predict future weather conditions at KMIA (Miami Airport). These AI/ML models become invaluable tools for aviation operations and safety by harnessing the extensive historical METAR&nbsp;data.</p><p>Data Set: Access to the dataset of historical METAR data points is available to download from the Ocean Market via the Mumbai Test Network (Polygon Testnet), and via Polygon Mainnet. You can download the dataset directly through <a href="https://bit.ly/3SONYvf">Desights</a>.</p><p>Machine Learning Model: Participants have free reign to attack their model selection based on their own preferences. Some ideas for Python native ML to include ARIMA/SARIMA using 'statsmodels', LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) Networks using TensorFlow or Keras, Random Forest Regression using scikit-learn, or Gradient Boosting Machines using XGBoost. When implementing these models, you’ll typically start by preprocessing your time series data (e.g., normalization, choosing model weights, etc.), followed by feature engineering (like extracting time components and creating lag features). After that, you can train your model, tune its parameters, and validate its performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or MAPE and pursue the most accurate METAR prediction.</p><p>It’s also a good practice to perform cross-validation to assess the robustness of your model. Given the complexity and variability of METAR data, it might also be beneficial to ensemble different models to improve predictions in prior portions of the data challenge.</p> METAR <p>METAR is a format for reporting weather information. A METAR weather report is predominantly used by aircraft pilots, airlines, observation stations, and <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/science-art-meteorology/">meteorologists</a> who use aggregated METAR information to assist in current general weather forecasting.</p><p>Raw METAR is the most common format in the world for the transmission of observational weather data. It is highly standardized through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO), which allows it to be understood throughout most of the&nbsp;world.</p><p><a href="https://metar-taf.com/explanation">This is how you read a METAR</a></p><p>Additional Clarity: <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/wrh/mesowest/metar_decode_key.pdf">METAR/TAF LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS AND&nbsp;ACRONYMS</a></p> Prizes <p>In 2024, we’ve increased the prize pool to $10,000 USDC (or recievable in OCEAN) per challenge.

Applications may pay storage fees on behalf of&nbsp;users  Storage Node Operators: Stake tokens to earn an income from providing storage capacity to the&nbsp;network   Network Economic&nbsp;Model <p>The Verida Network is a self-sovereign “user-pays” model, whereby users pay for their own storage needs. In this way, “access to user data” is not the product, rather the product is the “security and protection” of user&nbsp;data.</p><p>The Verida Network has the following storage objectives:</p>  Create a sustainable economic “user-pays” model  Maximize the geographical distribution of storage&nbsp;nodes  Maximize the availability and security of data stored on and across the&nbsp;network  Incentivize early adoption to bootstrap the&nbsp;network  <p>Users pay a monthly fee to access storage on the network. There are currently no charges for bandwidth, however this will be reviewed in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Storage node operators earn fees for the storage capacity they provide to the network that is utilized by&nbsp;users.</p><p>A small transaction fee, similar to gas fees on blockchain networks, is intended to be retained by the Verida Network to support its ongoing development and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Verida enables a “self-sovereign” data network, so it’s essential that all stakeholders have control and choice. Users can select which storage nodes they want to use for storing their data (or operate their own node(s)), while storage node operators have the choice to not provide their service to a particular user.</p><p>This creates a free market that can evolve as the Verida protocol matures and the network grows. Storage node operators will eventually be able to differentiate themselves by offering various options and features to users, including different pricing and service level agreements.</p> Community Pre-Sale: Get On The Whitelist <p>Verida will be enabling whitelisted community members to purchase Verida Storage Credits ahead of the public sale.

  Decentralized Identity (DID) is pivotal in the digital era, offering a secure, privacy-centric identity solution. In contrast to traditional systems, which are centralized and prone to breaches, DID is built on blockchain technology. With DID, users have control over their data, reducing the risk of identity theft. Interoperability is enhanced, enabling secure authentication across platforms without a central authority. DID aligns with privacy regulations like the EU’s GDPR, emphasizing user consent and data control in a self-sovereign environment. 

As digital interactions surge, decentralized identity becomes a crucial, user-centric tool for secure and seamless identity management in our interconnected, digital world. In this second edition of the “Road to EIC” series, we will discuss questions such as: Is it too early for DID's widespread implementation or is the advent of yet another disruptive technology breakthrough imminent?

<p>Between the pings, swipes, and endless scrolls of the modern world, genuine human connection often feels out of reach. For Joe Feminella, the problem of fostering meaningful interactions in the digital era led him to found the dating app First Round’s on Me.</p><p>Sparked by his own fatigue trying to find deep relationships in a system obsessed with scale over substance, Joe’s journey reveals three pivotal insights on coordinating impactful collaboration.</p><p>Joe's experience in developing a dating app offers a unique perspective on how innovative technology can be used to create more meaningful connections.</p> How the Design of Coordination Systems Affect Outcomes <p>While technology has the power to connect people globally, design choices dictate impacts on relationships. App founder Joe Feminella observes, “I think technology is just moving so quickly that we often don't know what to do with it.” Rapid digitization makes it hard to accommodate the reality of everyday life.</p><p>Consequently, Joe watched social platforms overwhelm users with information rather than facilitating meaningful connections. Engineered to maximize matches, the barrage of stimulus short-circuited genuine intimacy.</p><p>Joe suggests that “progress requires transcending entrenched, engineering-only perspectives.” Bridging system gaps in belonging allows innovation to elevate, not exploit, understanding.</p><p>This involves recalibrating metrics to empower care-centered coordination. As Joe concludes, “user-informed design interweaves logic with healthy social values.” By grasping technology’s influence, we gain a conviction for writing social code that finally facilitates the connections we want.&nbsp;</p> Using Feedback to Build a Better App <p>User frustration often signals when tools hamper rather than help healthy relating. For app founder Joe Feminella, the frustration he and his dates shared about the platforms they were meeting on revealed recurrent unmet needs.</p><p>Across demographics and identities, people voiced the desire for more intentional interactions cultivating genuine intimacy. They felt starved of courtship customs signaling care, not just matches indicating cursory interest. Stark contrasts emerged between the claims of these dating apps, which promised meaningful connections, and the actual experiences of emotional depletion they provided.</p><p>Application users expressed feeling reduced to a number, valued for quantification over quality of character. As the number of dating apps grew, environments that should encourage vulnerability lacked sufficient moderation protections. Leaving many to feel objectified by digitally amplified attention patterns.</p><p>Joe suggests exploitation causes anxiety, stating “onslaughts of stimulus overload sensitivities crafted over millennia.” By focusing computing on growth before grounded human needs, innovation routinely agitates users.</p><p>This taught Joe the need for cross-discipline solutions. He felt compelled to bridge the gaps hindering healthy bonds and to leverage technology for good. As he concludes, “Progress means transcending entrenched perspectives across disciplines.” Collectively authored improvements weave care back into digital social fabrics.</p> Bringing More Heart Into Tech to Bridge Understanding <p>Holochain's framework is made for peer-to-peer applications that are secure, reliable, and fast. Moreover, Holochain is made for social applications that bring people together, centering the user. This technology aligns perfectly with Joe's vision of building authentic connections.&nbsp;</p><p>His experience developing a dating app that emphasizes genuine human relationships is paralleled by Holochain's goal to connect user devices directly in secure networks, giving users the autonomy of locally installed software that still benefits from the power and redundancy of cloud software.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe's insight into user experience and cross-disciplinary thinking are essential. New, innovative technology still needs to be user-friendly and accessible to help enable human connection. Hope persists for redeeming technology to elevate healthy bonds, not degrade them.

<p>Less than a month into 2024 and password spraying is being named as the origin for our first eye-opening cyber-attack. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/">blog post</a>, Microsoft has identified Midnight Blizzard, the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as NOBELIUM for the attack on their corporate systems.</p>
<p>This is another in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As organizations continue to grapple with the reality of sophisticated cyber-attacks, it becomes imperative to look for additional alternatives to bolster defenses if a breach is due to a wider security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Considering the recent guidance provided by Microsoft on the “Midnight Blizzard” nation-state attack, we at 1Kosmos delve into the nuances of this threat and offer insights into how organizations can navigate through the latest attack vector.</p>
 Understanding the Midnight Blizzard Cyber-Attack 
<p>What was the Midnight Blizzard cyber-attack? As covered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it represents a formidable challenge for organizations worldwide. Characterized by the group’s stealthy infiltration and persistent nature, this sophisticated attack exploited network vulnerabilities and breached Microsoft’s Outlook by using a test account to authorize a custom-built malicious application.</p>
<p>The group utilized a password spraying attack that successfully compromised a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. The account inadvertently gave hackers access to the inboxes of various executives, including those in cybersecurity and legal functions.</p>
<p>This allowed them to steal copies of their emails and attachments through a legacy OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The group had access for approximately six weeks before they were discovered.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was not limited to Microsoft’s own environment. As part of their forensic analysis, Microsoft determined that the same group of attackers used identical tactics to target the inboxes of an unspecified number of Microsoft’s customers.</p>
 The Attack 
<p></p>
 1Kosmos Perspective: Building Security Resilience 
<p>The nature of this attack illustrates a need to eliminate passwords, strengthen multi-factor authentication, prevent lateral movement, and simpifly the IT (Information Technology) stack.</p>
 How 1Kosmos can help: 
<p>Prevent Password Spraying Attacks: 1Kosmos can eliminate passwords wherever possible, and where not possible, enforce regular password reset intervals with a password reset workflow that proves the user’s identity to ensure the reset request’s validity.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Methodology: 1Kosmos authentication methods exceed Zero Trust guidelines and mitigate the risk posed by attackers, by verifying every user and device attempting to access resources. The result can limit the lateral movement of attackers within their networks, thwarting sophisticated infiltration attempts.</p>
<p>Phish-Proof MFA: 1Kosmos strong identity-based authentication protocols perform strong authentication and significantly improve the user experience. 1Kosmos LiveID is a phishing-proof MFA that proves identity at every access request.</p>
<p>Risk Based Authentication: One-size-fits-all authentication solutions prove ineffective, underscoring the imperative for risk-based authentication to become the standard rather than the exception. 1Kosmos can use contextual factors like device details and location to assess the risk level and apply the right level of authentication.</p>
<p>Audit and Reporting: 1Kosmos is built on a private and permissioned blockchain. This private, permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to the digital identity. These logs can be shared with SOC teams and other platforms to ensure quick digital forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Collaborative Defenses: Collaboration and integration are key to a successful security infrastructure. 1Kosmos has built out-of-the-box integrations with industry peers (including Microsoft) to enhance the resilience of organizations against sophisticated attacks. Relying on a duct tape infrastructure and the gaps they inject is exactly what these hackers are looking to exploit. A tightly coupled integration will reduce gaps and improve an overall security posture.</p>
<p>Industry Certifications: 1Kosmos has taken the step to ensure the safety and security of our platform. For instance, 1Kosmos is certified to many standards including FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF and iBeta DEA EPCS. The combination of these standards prevents identity impersonation, account takeover and fraud while delivering frictionless user experiences that preserve user privacy.</p>
 1Kosmos Prevents Identity Based Attacks 
<p></p>
<p>As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we must remain focused and adaptive in our cybersecurity strategies. The Midnight Blizzard attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by nation-state adversaries. By embracing a proactive, collaborative, and identity-centric approach to security, organizations can bolster their resilience and effectively navigate through the digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we empower remote identity verification and passwordless multi-factor authentication, facilitating secure transactions with digital services for employees, customers, and residents alike. Through the integration of identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, 1Kosmos effectively combats identity-based attacks, empowering organizations with the tools, insights, and expertise needed to combat threats such as this one and safeguard their digital assets.</p>

<p>On March 1st, 2021, the European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/a3e89f4f-fbf3-4bd6-9e07-35f3243555b3/Final%20Amending%20%20Guidelines%20on%20MLTF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf">published final revised guidelines</a> on money laundering and terrorist financing risk factors, offering directions on how it intends to lead, coordinate, and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Nearly three years later, on January 16th, 2024, the EBA published guidelines amending the earlier&nbsp;ones.</p><p>So, what do these amendments imply? How do they impact CASPs, the crypto asset service providers? What do the CASP/VASPs need to do to comply with these amendments? These are the aspects we will discuss in the segments&nbsp;below.</p> How Does EBA’s Final Guidelines Impact&nbsp;CASPs <p>The amendments outline what CASPs must do to handle potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks in their overall business and each transaction.</p> The Assumption That Drives EBA’s Guideline Amendments for CASPs/VASPs <p>The new guidelines recognize that Crypto Asset Service Providers operate differently from traditional banks. They point out that CASPs often deal with transfers to self-managed wallets and various decentralized platforms, which aren’t uniformly regulated worldwide. This might make them more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The guidelines also note that certain features in crypto assets, which can keep transactions anonymous, could increase these&nbsp;risks.</p> What Could CASPs Do to Reduce&nbsp;Risk? <p>The EBA is advising Crypto Asset Service Providers to increase vigilance against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially due to the ease of anonymous international transfers.</p><p>Their advice includes practical steps like limiting product features to control where money can be sent. This means <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">allowing transfers</a> only to certain approved parties, such as crypto-asset accounts or bank accounts in the customer’s name, which are already following strict anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations.</p><p>Additionally, the EBA suggests CASPs could use more controlled payment systems, like those used for small payments or transactions with the government. Another idea is to offer services specifically to certain groups, like a company’s employees, to better manage&nbsp;risk.</p><p>The EBA also notes that CASPs can lower their risk by ensuring customers meet regulatory standards and have a clean history of crypto transactions. Transactions that involve converting to or from official currency, especially through bank accounts in low-risk areas, are seen as safer. The same goes for low-value transactions for goods and services, as long as there’s no negative information about the involved crypto accounts.</p><p>CASPs are also encouraged to think about the risks linked to how and where they offer their services.</p><p>While these suggestions can help minimize risks, the EBA emphasizes the need for CASPs to actively implement measures that make their operations more&nbsp;secure.</p> The Measures that the EBA’s Amending Guidelines Recommend for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA wants CASPs to have suitable and effective monitoring tools, including transaction monitoring tools and advanced analytics tools. The CASPs must also train relevant employees for them to have a wholesome understanding of crypto assets and ML/TF risks to which they may expose the provider.</p> The CASPs Must Ensure Enhanced Customer Due Diligence <p>According to the European Banking Authority’s published final revised guidelines,</p><p>CASPs must verify the identities of customers and beneficial owners using multiple trusted and independent sources. They also need to identify and verify majority shareholders who are not yet compliant.</p><p>EBA underlines that to understand customer relationships better, gathering more information about the customer and the business’s nature and purpose is essential, including tracing the origins of their funds and&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>CASPs are also advised to increase the frequency of monitoring crypto-asset transactions. And upon any triggering event, they need to rigorously review, update, and document relevant customer information. Conducting business relationship reviews more regularly is part of this protocol.</p><p>According to EBA, CASPs should use investigation tools more extensively for a deeper investigation into crypto assets. This includes examining all distributed ledger addresses a customer might use, particularly if they have several. They also need to monitor customer IP addresses more frequently.</p><p>Understanding a customer’s knowledge about crypto assets is another focus area of the amended guidelines. CASPs should take additional steps when withdrawal or redemption patterns do not align with the customer’s usual profile and determine whether the customer or a third party initiates these transactions.</p><p>Lastly, CASPs have the responsibility to verify that a customer truly controls and owns their self-hosted wallet address. To aid in this process, CASPs can now utilize <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Veriscope’s User Signing feature</a>. It allows them to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ self-hosted wallets.</p> Analytics and Record-Keeping Requirements for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA guidelines recommend the application of advanced analytics tools to transactions on a risk-sensitive basis. Their deployment must come as a supplementary addition to the standard monitoring tools. This is particularly important for transactions involving self-hosted wallets.</p><p>These advanced tools are designed to help CASPs trace a wallet’s transaction history and check for any possible connections to criminal activities or suspicious persons and entities.</p><p>Additionally, the guidelines highlight the need for CASPs to go beyond relying solely on distributed ledgers for record-keeping. They should have procedures to link each distributed ledger address with its corresponding private key, controlled by an individual or a legal&nbsp;entity.</p><p>Overall, these updated guidelines from the EBA are directing CASPs to adopt a more thorough approach to tackling money laundering and the use of crypto in terrorism financing.</p><p>This will likely mean that CASPs have to allocate more resources, including manpower and training, to comply with these guidelines and enhance their monitoring capabilities.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-global-crypto-regulatory-outlook-2024">Click here to read the latest global crypto regulatory outlook 2024&nbsp;report.</a></p> Key Takeaways   The European Banking Authority (EBA) published amended guidelines for Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks.  The guidelines recognize that CASPs operate differently than traditional banks and may be more vulnerable to risks due to features like anonymity.  The EBA advises CASPs to take practical steps like limiting high-risk product features and transactions, verifying customer identities rigorously, and monitoring transactions more&nbsp;closely.  CASPs need enhanced customer due diligence including gathering more customer information, investigating crypto addresses, and understanding customer knowledge and behavior.  The guidelines recommend CASPs use advanced analytics tools to supplement standard monitoring and maintain comprehensive records linking crypto addresses to individuals/entities.  <p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Moving to digital trust and verifiable credentials is the goal of many current organizations. Doing so carries substantial benefits, including fraud reduction, increased data sharing with reduced integration costs, and even privacy law compliance.</p>
<p>Large-scale efforts by governments and orgs like GLEIF to create organizational identity are often championed as the foundations for this new digital world, and many are under the impression that it is one that we must wait for.</p>
<p>In reality, the relationships you already have are the key to building a digital ecosystem. Ecosystems need to identify the parties involved in the issuance and verification of credentials — who to trust for what. By contrast, large global identity projects&nbsp; will actually provide very little value to established ecosystems where the parties have established relationships with each other. Moreover, as ecosystems turn digital, newly created digital identifiers from ecosystem participants can be passed directly between participants and the ecosystem governance authority using existing communication channels and relationships; there is no need for that to be orchestrated by another party.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Employees within a company — companies already know their employees and have existing HR processes for interacting and coordinating with employees. Employees know which company they work for. Issuing those employees verifiable employment credentials requires no outside authority.</p>
<p>Trade associations — trade associations already know their member companies and have been working with them for a long time, in some cases, years or decades. Verifiable credentials for member companies, including certifications, proof of membership, and other benefit qualifications are all based on existing relationships.</p>
<p>Business partner networks — insurance companies are a great example of how to build on established trust. They know the providers in their network, and they know the insured individuals. They can provide both directories and introductions between newly connecting parties, all leveraging these existing relationships. Patient VCs can ease onboarding at a new medical provider, while providers can provide qualification credentials to patients. Data entry errors are minimized, efficiency is gained, etc.</p>
<p>None of these examples need anybody’s permission to start innovating with VCs and gaining immediate benefits.</p>
<p>So, what do these large government efforts and global identity programs provide? We’ve made it clear that existing relationships don’t need external parties. What these large identity systems do provide is a trusted foundation for new relationships. It simplifies the process of identifying new ecosystem partners and participants, which can be a major source of fraud. By streamlining the correct identification of individuals and organizations, ecosystems can grow rapidly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>So what’s the holdup on these large programs?&nbsp; It should be no surprise that policy creation, technology development, and often regulation take time to get right.</p>
<p>As these programs mature and deliver the right technologies, they will assist in the growth of already established identity and trust ecosystems. They’ll improve upon existing methods of vetting new partners and participants, and that’ll be great.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technologies needed to enhance trust and create digital ecosystems from your existing relationships already exist. We at Indicio help our customers do just that, and we’d like to help you as well.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

 IDnow to become an active part of the European netID Foundation’s ecosystem 



<p>Munich, January 30, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, announces its cooperation with the <a href="https://netid.de/">European netID Foundation</a>. The goal: The introduction of an identity wallet for netID users in Germany as an alternative to the offerings of US platforms.</p>



<p>Developed by IDnow, the netID Wallet app will be available for users to download later this year and will allow them to reuse and share stored digital identities.</p>



<p>Self-determined and even simpler reuse of identities</p>



<p>netID is an open standard that enables users to access online services of netID partners (among others Süddeutsche Zeitung, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet with the WEB.DE and GMX brands) via the same login details, all in compliance with data protection regulations. The introduction of the identity wallet will make storing and retrieving identities even easier for around 40 million potential users.</p>



<p>Bundled in one digital location, users can access and verify proof of identity such as ID cards, driving licenses, social security data and much more on their smartphone at any time – making everyday processes more efficient. netID partners, in turn, can significantly simplify their processes for verifying customer data, for example for invoice purchases, and thus make them more cost-effective. </p>



<p>Wallet can be used by the partners of the netID ecosystem</p>



<p>The initial verification of the user’s identity to create the wallet is carried out using the proven IDnow solutions. Once the identity has been confirmed and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> has been successfully created, the user decides with whom they want to share what data. Anyone who uses the wallet once to register with a mobile phone provider, for example, can use it again at any time with one of the partners in the netID ecosystem for verified identification.</p>



<p>The wallet is another step toward the future: the European Commission is about to publish a new version of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services)</a>, which is expected to come into force in 2024. All EU citizens should have a digital identity by 2030. The launch of the netID Wallet supports this goal.</p>



<p>“netID has been simplifying digital life in Germany since it was founded. Transparency and data protection have always been at the heart of what we do. We see the netID Wallet as the logical next step in the further development of the netID offering. Thanks to the cooperation with IDnow, we can offer our users secure and user-friendly identity verification that will even be able to serve regulated use cases in compliance with eIDAS in the future,” explains Uli Hegge, CEO of the European netID Foundation.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to have gained a trustworthy partner for our identity wallet in Germany in the form of the European netID Foundation and to be an active part of the netID ecosystem in the future,” says Uwe Stelzig, Managing Director DACH at IDnow.  </p>



<p>“IDnow and netID pursue similar goals in terms of data security and user-friendliness, which we are now also pursuing together in identity verification. With the introduction of the wallet, users no longer have to identify themselves again and again, but can save their verified identities and simply reuse them the next time. In this way, netID partners can offer their users even faster and secure access to their services,” continues Stelzig.</p>

   by Martin Kuppinger  A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I talked about this last year at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s European Identity and Cloud Conference, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-metaverse-cre23">talked about this last year</a> at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a>, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.</p>
<p>Going back to the question: The easiest way to solve complex problems is by deconstructing them into smaller pieces, solving these, and putting everything together again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the graphic, foundational elements of Web3 converge with metaverses related technologies. It’s tough to try to solve security holistically, of course. But there is NFT Security as a smaller, yet complex&nbsp; challenge. There is DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Security — some of which we could deconstruct even further.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, there is a common universal element: Decentralized Identity. This is the glue. For solving security in a decentralized world, we need decentralized identity. Then we can solve the various challenges and construct a unified security approach.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity, which is part of the broader theme of Digital IDs (aka Digital Identity) is one of the main themes of EIC 2024. Digital IDs are not just elements of Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is something much bigger. They relate to IAM, but in cross-organizational use (decentralized, reusable) and supply approaches that enable and leverage business models.</p>
<p>When we think about an avatar (or agent or whatever is the industry term de jour) in a metaverse, this is sort of a “digital double” to us. The term “digital twin,” unfortunately, is already used in another context (namely, manufacturing and simulation).</p>
<p>This digital double has an identity which relates to our digital identity. It acts on our behalf. This imposes challenges such as control, liability, and other concerns. Digital identity is the core of the solution, because we can define that identity, relate it to our identity and others, and keep control. Without this, we will fail in our journey towards new models, especially everything including autonomous or semi-autonomous (that is how I would name an avatar in a metaverse) systems.</p>
<p>While this field is still evolving, one thing is clear: A central foundational pillar of Web3 and the Metaverse (and every modern digital service and business) are Digital IDs, particularly decentralized identity. Also, don’t miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/a-closer-look-at-eidas-20-and-the-eu-digital-identity-wallet">recent blog post of my colleague Alejandro Leal</a> on eIDAS and the EUDI wallet, another key topic at EIC 2024. There also is a lot of research on this topic available by KuppingerCole Analysts, such as the Advisory Note <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">How Enterprises Will Learn to Love Decentralized IDs: The Roles of Distributed and Sovereign Identities in Our Private Metaverse</a> written by Mike Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>Look at our research, talk to the analysts of KuppingerCole, and don’t miss attending EIC 2024. See you in Berlin in June!</p>

<p></p><p>"Our current credit system says, 'Saddle yourself, so we can give you more to saddle.'" Eric Lapin, President of <a href="https://www.formfree.com/">FormFree</a>, stated during a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TZkK8a64E7I?si=2qhaIF22uGbD7lbJ">TBD live stream</a>. His comment sheds light on a fundamental paradox of the U.S. credit system: it often requires you to accumulate debt as a prerequisite for obtaining loans, leading to more debt. This systemic issue is underscored by <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access#/experiences-credit-demand1">recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, which reveals that 1 in 5 applicants for mortgages, car loans, or other types of loans were rejected — the highest rate in five years. This trend disproportionately impacts Black and Latino applicants. Guided by their slogan, 'Democratizing lending for all people without bias,' FormFree developed a platform built with Web5 and AI to address these issues.</p> Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)<a title="Direct link to Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)">​</a> <p>The Fair Isaac Corporation score, better known as a FICO score, is a three-digit score that helps lenders in the U.S. evaluate the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. A higher score indicates greater reliability. However, achieving a high FICO score — or any credit score — largely depends on accruing and gradually repaying debt. This may come as a disadvantage for various groups of people who may not have a credit score, including veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, immigrants, young adults, and folks who prefer cash transactions.</p><p>To provide a more holistic view of a person's creditworthiness, FormFree developed a new system called <a href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-releases-residual-income-knowledge-index/">Residual Income Knowledge Index™ (RIKI™)</a>. Instead, RIKI analyzes monthly income and spending. Integrating this method into our existing credit system provides greater opportunities for home ownership, car purchases, and other essential loans.</p> "It's like Tinder for banks!"<a title="Direct link to &quot;It's like Tinder for banks!&quot;">​</a> <p>During the live stream, FormFree Software Engineer, Jon West, showcased their <a href="https://passport.formfree.com/">Passport</a> product. The demo highlighted Passport's ability to match borrowers with lenders.

 Looking Back at 2023 
<p>2023 was a year of change for Public Trust Certificates – discussions on reduced validity periods, approval of new requirements, and significant progress in access to Verified Mark Certificates. Let’s review what happened in 2023 along with a few predictions for what’s to come in 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The Google Chrome team was quite active in the TLS ecosystem. They began <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">promoting</a> modernizing PKI infrastructures including reducing the TLS certificate validity period to 90-days. Entrust provided <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">our response to the 90-day proposal</a>. The Chrome team also provided the market with information to help secure TLS PKIs through automation for a safer more reliable internet.” You can then hyperlink the word “information.</p>
<p>The CA/Browser Forum (CABF) published ballots which updated the TLS Baseline Requirements (BRs):</p>
 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/02/ballot-sc61v4-new-crl-entries-must-have-a-revocation-reason-code/">SC61</a> – New Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) entries must have a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/use-of-crl-reason-codes-updated/">revocation reason code</a> 
 <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/03/17/ballot-sc62v2-certificate-profiles-update/">SC62</a> – Certificate profiles update for the requirements and restrictions of the TLS certificate profiles 
 SC63 – Makes OCSP optional, require CRLs, incentivizes automation, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/short-lived-certificates-finally-approved/">finally approves short-lived certificates, which do not require certificate status</a> using CRL or OCSP 
 
<p>The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9345">IETF has published RFC 9345</a> to support delegated credentials for TLS and DTLS. The delegated credential mechanism allows a server operator to use the private key from their server to issue a delegated credential. The new credential will have a different private key and a validity period of no greater than seven days. Since the delegated credential is only valid for a short period of time, there is no status protocol required to be checked, that is, no CRL or OCSP response.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/11/s-mime-baseline-requirements-approved-by-the-ca-browser-forum/">The CABF approved the S/MIME Baseline Requirements</a> in November 2022, which provides an S/MIME standard for the public trust CAs. The S/MIME BRs have been effective since the September 1, 2023. ETSI also released standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11941106/01.01.01_60/ts_11941106v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 411-6</a> to comply with the EU regulation on electronic signatures in email messages and to support the S/MIME BRs. This allows EU CAs meeting the S/MIME BRs to be audited using the ETSI audit criteria. The S/MIME BRs were also required by the Apple and Mozilla policies.</p>
<p>DigiCert provided an <a href="https://github.com/digicert/smbr-cert-factory">S/MIME certificate factory</a> with samples of certificates which meet the S/MIME BRs. They followed up with the <a href="https://github.com/digicert/pkilint">pkilint tool</a>, which can be used for S/MIME certificate linting to find errors when a certificate does not meet the S/MIME BRs. Entrust fully supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">digital certificate linting&nbsp;</a> and its <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/deploying-digital-certificate-linting/">deployment</a>.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF began requiring <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/09/ca-browser-forum-updates-requirements-for-code-signing-certificate-private-keys/">code signing certificate keys to be generated and managed in a crypto device</a> effective as of June 1, 2023. The goal is to reduce key compromise by removing the option to generate key pairs in software. The CAs must also verify if the keys were generated in a crypto device which would include server HSMs, USB tokens and cloud HSMs.</p>
<p>Ballot CSC68 was issued to update the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/code-signing-revocation-requirements-updated/">code signing certificate revocation requirements</a>. The purpose was to tighten up the procedure when a key is comprised, or if a subscriber signs suspect code. If the CA finds out that either of these occurred, then the certificate must be revoked within 24 hours. At a later time the CA may backdate the revocation time before the key was compromised or the suspect code was signed. This will cause signatures after the revocation date to fail.</p>
<p>Verified Mark Certificates</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/">Government organizations can now get Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs) for their outgoing emails</a>. This is equivalent to VMCs issued to companies which have registered marks. Google also strengthened VMCs by <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/05/gmail-now-offers-a-new-checkmark-for-emails-enabled-with-verified-mark-certificates-and-bimi/">adding a blue checkmark</a> which proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot.</p>
<p><a href="https://bimigroup.org/resources/VMC_Requirements_latest.pdf">VMCR 1.5 was released</a> create Common Mark Certificates. This will allow a certificate applicant to submit either a modified registered mark or a prior use mark to be added to the certificate. The modified registered use mark will allow an applicant with a registered mark to make a change such as removing/moving words or removing a portion of the mark. This may allow the applicant to modify the mark to fit in place with different dimensions or perhaps provide a seasonal change to the mark. For prior use mark, the applicant must have historically displayed the mark for at least 12 months and the mark must be found in an archive webpage source. The Common Mark Certificate beta program has just started in December 2023. Note: we are not sure if both Google and Apple will fully support common marks and emails will not get the blue checkmark.</p>
<p>Mozilla sets Root CA Lifecycles</p>
<p>To support cryptographic agility which Mozilla states is the ability to replace cryptographic primitives, algorithms, and protocols efficiently at reasonable cost with limited impact on operations, Mozilla has <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Root_CA_Lifecycles">set a lifecycle schedule for trusted root certificates</a>. There is a migration plan for existing roots, but the ongoing schedule will be from the date of key generation, a TLS root will be removed after 15-years and an S/MIME root will be removed after 18-years. The lifetime will allow the CA time to get the root embedded and at least 10 years of use. The S/MIME roots have a longer lifecycle as S/MIME certificates are issued with a longer validity period.</p>
 To 2024 and Beyond&nbsp; 
<p>Here are some expected changes for 2024.</p>
<p>TLS Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF TLS validation subcommittee is working on <a href="https://github.com/ryancdickson/staging/blob/require-mpdv-v2/docs/BR.md#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration">multi-perspective issuance corroboration</a> to ensure when verifying a domain name that the determinations made by the primary network perspective is correct before a TLS certificate issuance. Multi-perspective determination will be applied to both domain names and Certification Authority Authorization (CAA)record compliance. We anticipate multi-perspective will migrate to a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>
<p>Code Signing Certificates</p>
<p>The CABF code signing working group is working on updates for Signing Services and high-risk certificate applications. Signing Service will help the certificate subscribers to be complaint and ensure their key pairs are generated in a cryptographic module, the private key is protected, and only the subscriber can activate the private key for signing. The high-risk certificate application has been changed as now all key pairs must be generated in hardware, which mitigates some of the risks that were addressed in the CSBRs.</p>
<p>Key attestation is a method for the CA to verify that the private key was generated in a cryptographic module. There is no standard for key attestation, so this is difficult to implement. Members of the IETF are working on addressing this issue by generation an RFC for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-csr-attestation/">CSR attestation</a> and for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-rats-x509-evidence/">X.509 based attestation evidence</a>. CSR attestation can be implemented with existing crypto modules and the RFC may be available in 2024. X.509 based attestation will take longer to define and would need to be implemented in new cryptographic modules; as such, we do not expect to benefit from this effort for many years.</p>
<p>S/MIME Certificates</p>
<p>The IETF publish RFC 9485 which supports <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/caa-for-s-mime-email-certificates/">certification authority authorization (CAA) for S/MIME certificates</a>. This will support domain name owners to provide the CAA record “issuemail” for their authorized CAs. The CABF S/MIME working group is developing on an update for CAA as a recommendation in late 2024 and a “must” requirement in 2025.</p>

 What is Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring? 



<p>Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring is a process driven by compliance regulations to ensure that financial transactions conducted by institutions are not used for money laundering or terrorist financing. The process is mandated by regulations such as the <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en">EU’s AML Directives</a> and the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, which set international benchmarks for companies that engage with the US and Europe. Financial institutions use rule-based or AI-enabled tools to identify and report suspicious transactions, and analysts are responsible for maintaining compliance and ensuring secure financial environments.</p>



<p>These solutions play a critical role in detecting money laundering and other illicit activities, thereby ensuring the integrity of the financial system. Compliance with AML regulations is not only necessary for regulatory purposes but also vital to avoid severe legal and financial consequences. In fact, recent statistics indicate that global fines for AML violations have exceeded $5 billion in 2022 alone. By adhering to regulatory compliance measures, financial institutions can foster trust and contribute to the transparency of the financial system. Furthermore, compliance standards have led to significant advancements in AML solutions, with regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act, EU’s AML Directives, and FATF recommendations acting as catalysts for innovation in Anti-money laundering transaction monitoring technology.</p>



<p>The range of financial institutions that must comply with regulations has expanded to include fintech and cryptocurrency organizations, given the higher risk of money laundering associated with digital currencies and technologies. To address these new financial services, emerging regulations such as the “Travel Rule” from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the 5th and 6th Money Laundering Directives from the European Union have been introduced. The industry is also shifting towards the use of AI/ML technologies to detect suspicious activities more quickly and make more accurate decisions. Currently, 66% of financial services are investing more in AI to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>Tangle Labs are happy to share the release of Vira Wallet v0.3.0 one of the most advanced self-sovereign identity wallets on the market and just one step away from a full 1.0 release.</p><p>After rigorous testing over the past couple of months, and the impressive demonstration of interoperability with other projects, we have experienced significant positive feedback and ensured that the wallet has matured to a level where it is now being used for ticketing and open badge experiences in the real world. Learnings from such events and experiences have given the team valuable feedback that has Vira to develop into such an advanced application.</p><p>Vira is currently being used across a number of projects including the UNESCO Lifelong Learning project NGDIL, various real world event ticketing and open badge experiences, and has recently been declared a DIIP compliant wallet by the <a href="https://www.dutchblockchaincoalition.org/dbc-zone/diip-wallets">Dutch Blockchain Coalition</a>, alongside the UniMe wallet from Impierce Technologies. </p><p></p> Feature Updates <p>Whilst a lot has been done behind the scenes to streamline the app in the backend and to ensure its security, stability, and feature performance, the four big feature updates include:</p><p></p><p>Improved UX/UI</p><p>The Vira UI has developed into a seamlessly intuitive and easy-to-use user experience. The balance between user experience and security in the world of crypto and decentralised identity is a very difficult area, often sacrificing one for the other. Having worked alongside partners to build out seamless experiences, we have streamlined the Vira experience to be a smooth one, without sacrificing the importance of security and privacy for users. This important area of the development process can place Vira in the top ranks of user experiences in the identity wallet space.</p><p></p><p>Open Badge Support</p><p>Credentials can now be issued as standardised open badges, supporting the Open Badge Standard v3.0. Separating credentials by standardised types provides a versatile approach to how credentials are received, shared, and stored. The Open Badge standard, by Ed1Tech, is a world leading standard used all over the world. Having implemented the standard in its entirety in the latest release, Vira can now become an open badge compatible wallet that may be used by millions of badge holders in open badge ecosystems around the world.</p><p></p><p>Self-Signed Credentials</p><p>User signed credentials to allow self-declaration of information such as name and email. Having verified credentials issued by a third-party is one thing, but being able to verify that you have self-declared information personally, is another. By implementing self-signing within Vira wallet, this opens up a world of opportunity allowing users to assign self-signed data to profiles, such as name, telephone number, email address, and other data for profiling at the granular level whether its a business card, a user login, or another profile, Vira users can now declare the information they want to within their individual profiles.</p><p></p><p>Internationalisation and RTL Support</p><p>Fully integrated support for translation into any language allowing Vira to go global. Cross-border use is one of the huge value propositions of decentralised identity. With Vira now fully integrated with global internationalisation standards, it can support any language translation as we begin to be used in multiple countries around the world. So whether its an open-badge event in the Netherlands, a travel ticket in Germany, or a business document in UAE, Vira is poised to become a truly global app.</p><p></p><p>Login with DID</p><p>Login with DID support via open-source OpenID standards. Vira is 100% ready to allow its users to login with DID allowing any project to integrate login with DID into their apps and websites using the open-source libraries from Tangle Labs, giving users the opportunity to privately connect to services without the need for third-party identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or X, etc. </p> What’s next? <p>These updates alone have put us one step away from a final public v1.0 with a feature complete release scheduled for later in the year. With Vira already live in the real world supporting and showcasing decentralised identity in its many forms, the next release of v0.4.0 will add the final pieces of the puzzle to ensure the complete package is ready for adoption.</p><p>The next features to be updated and integrated into the 0.4.0 release for final testing include:</p>  <p>Full Multichain Support - to allow users to operate in different ecosystems by selecting which networks they wish to engage with.</p>  <p>Document Signing - allowing users to legally sign documents with digital signatures from within their Vira wallet</p>  <p>Translations - full translations to allow Vira to be used in various languages such as ES, NL, AR, DE, etc.</p>  <p>Verified Account Support - allowing users to verify their identity for reusable credentials</p>  <p></p><p></p>

Background 
<p>At Northern Block, our journey toward enhancing Canadian critical mineral supply chain transparency and traceability collaboration began with an <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">innovative pilot</a> in 2022, in partnership with the Government of British Columbia, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
<p>During this initial pilot, we successfully demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions reporting could be converted into digital credentials, making this sustainability data verifiable and highly available for various systems within the supply chain. This demonstration effectively showcased how, by utilizing common standards and protocols, sustainability data can be seamlessly transferred between different organizations’ systems while maintaining its integrity (note: we cover more of ‘how this works’ in the section below ‘Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry?’)</p>
<p>In early 2023, we expanded our efforts by adding support for two new digital credentials:</p>
 
 Mines Act Permit: Easily prove your permit status (for major mine operators in B.C.) 
 Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM): Submit TSM scores and share verified environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data securely 
 
 <p>Both credentials are rooted in authoritative governance frameworks, and utilise OCA bundles for proper credential branding</p> 
<p>To support mining operators in receiving their Mines Act Permit in the form of a digital credential, we continued our ongoing partnership with the Government of B.C..</p>
<p>To transform TSM reporting data into digital credentials, we formed a key partnership with the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada (MAC)</a>, whose 100+ members account for most of Canada’s production of critical minerals. Canada already produces more than 60 minerals and metals and is a leading global producer of many critical minerals, including nickel, copper, potash, aluminum, and uranium. MAC is also behind <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">the TSM initiative</a>, a globally recognized ESG standard implemented not only in Canada, but in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia. TSM, first established in 2004, allows mining companies to turn high-level environmental and social commitments into action on the ground. Additionally, TSM was the first mining standard in the world to require site-level reporting with external verification. We anticipated that facilitating the creation of digital credentials for mines, based on a recognized and important reporting standard, should generate significant demand and value in downstream supply chains.</p>
<p>We worked closely with MAC to develop a set of rules and standards for this new type of digital certificate to mobilize the data generated through the&nbsp; TSM standard. This digital certificate, or ‘credential,’ is designed for organisations involved in extracting important resources. Our goal was to make this TSM digital credential as accurate and trustworthy as possible, similar to what we had previously achieved with the greenhouse gas credential in 2022. We aimed to base the TSM credential on direct, original data (source data) and combine technical methods with strong surrounding governance. This approach ensured that TSM data transmitted through this credential could maintain its reliability and integrity, increasing its value. It can then be used effectively by other companies and organisations further along in the supply chain.</p>
<p>TSM’s comprehensive approach, utilizing various environmental, social and climate change indicators, has been a great mechanism for promoting responsible production practices. Our work in this domain reflects our commitment to making TSM data not only more accessible but also a trusted element in global supply chains, reinforcing responsible mining practices worldwide.</p>
<p>In late 2023, we achieved a significant milestone by enabling mines&nbsp;to self-issue their TSM reports for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023 in the form of digital credentials, which were then digitally presented to MAC using this innovative method. This accomplishment marked a huge milestone for our objective of creating trusted data inputs for supply chains. In this process, we also involved PricewaterhouseCoopers and Envirochem, two recognised TSM verification firms. The two verification firms created externally verified TSM reports as digital credentials for the two mines in question. Essentially, this means that when a mining company receives one of these digital reports from their verifier, it comes with the verifier’s digital signature. This signature proves that the report is genuine and hasn’t been altered. When the mining company shares this report with other supply chain participants, everyone can trust the data accuracy and provenance.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the ecosystem which Northern Block is supporting with both the Mines Act Permit and TSM credentials:</p>
 <p>Note that in this image, the Government of British Columbia has developed its own digital credential system for government ministries, independent of Northern Block’s system. However, both systems are capable of communicating with each other due to their use of interoperable technology. It’s important to recognize that a digital trust ecosystem can involve many different actors, each potentially using services from various providers. A key advantage of this decentralized approach is the flexibility it offers participants, allowing them to choose their preferred platforms without being confined to a single, centralized system.</p> 
<p>This advancement was a substantial step in making the existing international TSM standard more accessible for supply chain participants. Our next focus is on broadening its use and creating a demand generation strategy. Given the increasing demand for high-integrity data in supply chains, we believe that our efforts have established crucial foundational groundwork.</p>
 Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry? 
<p>Digital credentials are based on internationally accepted technical and governance standards that are meant to facilitate digital trust. A digital trust architecture enables any two entities to share data between themselves in a trusted manner, independent of the system or application they’re using. This can be compared to email clients, where emails are reliably sent and received regardless of the different clients being used (e.g., like Microsoft Outlook and Google’s Gmail). This reliability is due to the use of common underlying protocols (a common language). Digital trust solutions leverage a common set of protocols, enabling them to exchange trusted data between themselves, with Security, Privacy, Authenticity and Confidentiality in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allowed us to conduct trusted data exchanges between different systems. For example, we facilitated a live exchange&nbsp; between the Government of British Columbia and CMM, where CMM was able to use Northern Block’s ‘Orbit Enterprise Wallet’ to receive a digital credential representation of their Mines Permit. This was issued by the Government of British Columbia, from their credential issuance system, and CMM was able to receive the offer, and upon accepting it, stored the credential within their digital wallet, hosted by Northern Block. This demonstrates that by speaking a common set of standards and protocols, technical interoperability is attainable, avoiding enforcing any supply chain participants to use a specific solution, similar to how email works!</p>
<p>A key aspect of digital trust stems from digital signatures using cryptography. Whenever a piece of data (a digital credential) is sent from an authoritative party to another, that data is signed, becoming tamper-proof and backed by verifiable governance processes. For instance, when a supply chain participant consumes verifiable TSM data as a digital credential proof, they can be confident about the data’s provenance, knowing it came from a mine or the mine’s auditor, and that it followed the correct governance established by MAC. This creates a root of trust for ecosystems that wish to consume that data.</p>
<p>Once these digital credentials are available, they can be shared with any participant in an ecosystem at the discretion of the credential holder. For example, a mining company can easily share this data with investors, buyers, or ESG marketplaces with just a click of a button. They can also selectively share different credentials, controlling what data they share and with whom. Being able to mix and match various types of verifiable data can unlock new efficiencies and value creation opportunities. For example, CMM may share with an investor a proof that they’re a recognised mine in British Columbia, along with selective ESG data from their TSM credential. In this case, they were able to share data that came from two separate, but verifiable sources. The investor will know that all data proofs shared are authentic. This example starts to make us think about some of the efficiencies and new opportunities when being able to mix and match data from various sources.</p>
<p>By converting this data into digital credentials and storing them in wallets owned by the data owners, it becomes easier to share within supply chains, thereby making it more available. This is particularly important in the context of ESG reporting, where fraud is a concern. Digital trust is crucial because it allows for the creation of supply chain data inputs that are authentic and verifiable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, digital trust technologies will elevate the level of trust within critical mineral supply chains. Creating supply chain transparency is only as effective as the data that flows into it. Our goal is to ensure that the data entering supply chains is of high integrity and value, and our work to-date aligns well with the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy.</p>
 Northern Block’s Mining Credentialing Solutions 
<p>Northern Block has been dedicated to developing enterprise digital credentialing technology suitable for a variety of applications. In early 2020, we launched the first commercial graded digital credential management platform in Canada, called NB Orbit Enterprise ; a no-code digital trust web-based platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of digital credentials that are held and owned by organisations in digital wallets. The platform contains a collection of components based on identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. Importantly, it is compatible with global digital trust standards and protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the components available within Orbit Enterprise that we leveraged for this particular critical minerals digital trust project:</p>
 
 Organisational Wallet: a component that allows organisations to receive digital credential offers from their peers, such as governments and auditors, and securely store them in the organisational wallet (e.g., Mines Permit credential, TSM credential).&nbsp; 
 Secure Connection Manager: This tool helps organisations set up secure, two-way communication channels with each other. Once these channels are established, they can exchange information safely and privately, ensuring that all communications are genuine and confidential. 
 Digital Credential Creation and Sharing Module: This is a service that allows organisations to create and issue digital credentials, like digital IDs or certificates, either to themselves or to other organisations. It also includes features for requesting credentials, negotiating terms, and sending secure messages. This is particularly useful in business-to-business (B2B) situations, where two organisations need to collaborate on issuing these digital credentials. 
 Digital Credential Verification and Exchange Toolkit: This toolkit is used by organisations to either ask for proof of digital credentials from others or to provide proof of their own credentials. It supports collaboration and communication, similar to the credential issuance service, making it easier for organisations to verify each other’s credentials. 
 Credential Governance Toolkit: This toolkit is designed for creating and managing the rules and designs for digital credentials. It’s used by authoritative bodies to set standards and publish these credentials to trusted data registries. organisations can use this toolkit to follow these standards when issuing credentials. It also helps ensure that the branding and legitimacy of these credentials are consistent, especially in supply chains, so that everyone recognizes and trusts them. 
 
 Call to Action 
<p>If you are interested in contributing to the growth of this ecosystem, <a href="mailto:info@northernblock.io">we would love to hear from you</a>. Our initiative welcomes participation from a diverse range of stakeholders, including natural resource companies, data consumers in need of high-integrity sustainability data, government regulators, and technology solution providers. It will require the collective effort of many strong participants to elevate this ecosystem to the next level and generate a network effect. We are confident in the foundational elements already in place, especially our credentials rooted in authoritative trust. This foundation paves the way for an array of future use cases and broader applications.</p>

 Cloud storage is amazing — and risky 







<p>The 2000s may be over, but cloud storage is still amazing. Services such as <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://www.icloud.com/">iCloud</a>, Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Drive</a>, and Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage">OneDrive</a> all help users share files with friends, recover when a hard drive crashes, and move files between their devices. Still, hearing about data breaches[<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/dropbox-files-left-unprotected-open-to-all">1</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nz74qb/hackers-stole-over-60-million-dropbox-accounts">2</a>, <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/dropbox-breach-130-github/">3</a>] leaves people wondering whether their data is safe in the cloud.</p>



 Security on today’s cloud lacks end-to-end encryption 







<p>Today’s cloud storage services use fairly similar client–server architectures that start with a locally installed application that monitors a specific file folder on a user’s computer. When the app detects changes in the folder, it relays them to the user’s account on the cloud. The cloud service handles copying them to a user’s other devices.</p>



<p>One of the problems with cloud storage is that files are not end–to–end encrypted (E2EE) – meaning that files encrypted before leaving a user’s device do not remain encrypted until they return. Rather, most providers use the transport encryption + encryption at rest paradigm. In this model, transport encryption encrypts files sent to the server (e.g., HTTPS), but decrypts them upon arrival. Next, the server applies encryption at rest so that only encrypted files are stored. While providers tout the strength of their encryption algorithms (e.g., AES 256), what they don’t highlight is that the server decrypts user files before re-encrypting them and that they hold the decryption keys!</p>



<p>While this model is efficient, it is vulnerable to attack or service provider bugs and unfortunately is the mainstay of cloud storage. This leaves users wondering: Are cloud providers accessing my data? and Can hackers steal my digital files? &nbsp;</p>



 We can make the cloud safer with Decentralized Identity 



<p>Answering those questions is difficult and varies over time. So, how do individual users protect their files in the cloud? One idea is to help users layer end–to–end encryption (E2EE) on top of any features the cloud storage services provide. This is fairly easy using the cryptographic features of decentralized identity (DI).</p>



<p>The DIDComm messaging specification was created to provide a platform-independent yet interoperable encrypted messaging capability that enables users of a wide range of DI platforms to exchange end-to-end encrypted messages.</p>



<p>This E2EE messaging capability can be used to secure files stored on virtually any cloud storage platform without divulging any plaintext file data content to the cloud service. Further, by storing secure files in an encrypted messaging format, those files can potentially be activated to later perform a myriad of secure file services for security and privacy conscious users.</p>

It concludes on Feb 1. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF74   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF.

To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF74 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.

 Are you the top Data Scientist in the land? Demonstrate your case for 1st place in this year’s data challenge championship season.  Introduction <p>This blog introduces the kickoff of the 2024 Ocean Protocol Data Challenge Championship. The<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo"> first Data Challenge of the year</a> is live on Desights now and ends on Tuesday, Jan 30, 2024. ’24 is the 3rd year of Ocean Protocol-sponsored data science competitions. This year welcomes season 2 of the championship and leaderboard points. Additional details about the 2023 Season can be found <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/2023-data-challenge-championship-leaderboard-awards-f489cc45cf99">in this blog post</a>. Some minor details have been added/subtracted to this year’s championship, which are presented below:</p> What’s New This&nbsp;Season? <p>2023 welcomed over 200 unique data scientists competing in data challenges. To accommodate an increasing number of recurring participants, we have raised the prize pool for each data challenge from $5000 USD to $10,000 USD available every challenge. Due to this, the 200 OCEAN participation bonus for submitting reports &amp; proposals has concluded.</p><p>Starting with the current data challenge (<a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Road to Safety: Traffic Accident Analysis</a>) the $10,000 prize pool will be distributed to the top 10 scored submissions per data challenge. Additionally, leaderboard points for the championship season will be rewarded for every challenge, scaled to the top 10 on a given data challenge. All participants outside of the top 10 will not receive points towards the championship season leaderboard. Furthermore, new data challenges will begin roughly on 2 Thursdays of each month, and each will be open to participate for 20 days. 2022 &amp; 2023 data challenges tested different time durations between 7–30 days. It has been determined that initiatives and hypothesis testing that require longer than 20 days will be tagged and executed as something other than a data challenge (data science competition).</p><p>Beyond the program structure, new features and functionalities of <a href="https://bit.ly/48ngARo">Desights.ai</a> continue to roll out regularly. Desights is the application that the Ocean Data Science team uses to conduct data challenges. The platform continues to mature as the web3 platform to crowdsource solutions to AI &amp; ML challenges, business intelligence, applied data science, and predictive analytics.</p> How It&nbsp;Works <p>There are 3 points to pay attention to while submitting:</p>  You will need a Desights Profile to submit to a data challenge. If you don’t have one, you can follow this simple tutorial to create one:<a href="https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile"> https://docs.desights.ai/guides/creating-desights-profile</a>  Before submitting make sure you have the valid asset URL for your submission. Here’s how to do that:<a href="https://docs.desights.ai/guides/checking-if-your-asset-url-is-correct"> https://docs.desights.ai/guides/checking-if-your-asset-url-is-correct</a>  Make sure you submit correctly!

The submission form will not be available once the challenge expires.</p><p>Check out the Championship leaderboard, and active + previous data challenges here <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges.">https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges.</a></p> 2024 Leaderboard &amp;&nbsp;Awards <p>As briefed above, the reward structure for each data challenge and the end-of-championship season awards have been modified.</p><p>1) More $ incentives repeatedly for the best quality reports/outcomes, and 2) advancements in gamifying the points structure for the year are the two main pillars of change to bear in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>An updated structure for the current data challenge and all challenges hosted in the 2024 season is articulated in the image&nbsp;below:</p> Calendar of&nbsp;Events <p>Data Challenges sponsored by the Ocean Protocol Data Science team will begin 2 Thursdays of every month. Challenges will also end on 2 Tuesdays of every&nbsp;month.</p><p>Each Challenge will be open for 20 days to formulate a report, results, or alternative submission criteria for the given challenge.</p><p>The 2024 Championship Leaderboard is live and will conclude in December&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Updates to changes in the leaderboard will be published through Ocean Protocol media channels after each data challenge ends and new points are&nbsp;accrued.</p> Join The Community <p>The Ocean Protocol Data Science team and alternative core teams are available in the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Protocol Community Discord</a> &amp; Desights Community Discord Channels.

<p>Since its inception, Veramo has been designed as a modular framework for decentralized identity and verifiable data, utilizing a “plugin” architecture. If you need to support a new DID method, a new credential type, or an alternative storage layer, you can simply add a plugin for that functionality into your Veramo agent and continue to use the rest of the agent’s functionality without having to do a bunch of extra integration work.</p><p>Now we’ve brought this “plugin paradigm” to the Veramo Agent Explorer.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, the Agent Explorer is a React application that allows you to connect to (local, remote, or in-browser) Veramo agents and interact with them through an intuitive user interface. The Agent Explorer allows you to create and manage your DIDs, create and verify credentials, and even communicate with other DIDs through the DIDComm interface.</p><p>Now, you can bring your own user experience into the Agent Explorer by creating plugins that can be loaded into this front-end dynamically. Plugins can be as simple or complex as you want, depending on the experience you want to provide. Plugins can provide custom rendering for certain credential types, additional DIDComm message handlers, or even full “windows” into your application or protocol without having to re-implement all the DID, credential, and storage management that the Agent Explorer provides.</p>Plugins page in “Settings” of Agent Explorer&nbsp;app<p>Much of the existing Agent Explorer functionality is already implemented through built-in plugins, which you’re free to turn on or off at your discretion.</p><p>To develop your plugins, please refer to the Agent Explorer Plugin documentation, available here: <a href="https://github.com/veramolabs/agent-explorer/blob/main/packages/plugin/README.md">https://github.com/veramolabs/agent-explorer/blob/main/packages/plugin/README.md</a>. This page also links to several existing plugins that you might use for inspiration or as a guide for developing your own Agent Explorer&nbsp;plugins.</p><p>To celebrate this new functionality, we’re hosting a small hackathon focused on Agent Explorer plugins.

 If the recovery email and phone number aren’t reset, the user might be able to regain access to their account. 
 If you forget to forward the user’s email, you might miss out on important communication from your customers.&nbsp; 
 If you don’t promptly deprovision the user’s accounts from third-party applications, you might be paying more in license costs than you need. 
 
<p>Luckily, it’s not all up to you to remember every step. Here’s how you can handle employee offboarding in YeshID.</p>
 Easier employee offboarding in YeshID 
<p>To offboard someone in YeshID, select that person from your Organization, and in the side car that opens, click ‘Offboard.’ From here, you can choose:&nbsp;</p>
 
 What action you wish to perform (suspending vs deleting) 
 Who, if anyone, to assign access to the employee’s Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc. data 
 Who, if anyone, should receive new email sent to the old address 
 When you would like the process initiated 
 
<p>As long as you are <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/3-reasons-to-ditch-the-access-management-spreadsheet-for-yeshid-access-grid/">managing application access</a> in YeshID, we will also create subtasks for applications which need to be deprovisioned. This is a big differentiator from how you can manage this process in the Google Workspace console. Offboarding directly in the console only turns off “sign in with Google” accounts for the user. But what about accounts that use a work email and password? YeshID helps you track all application access to make sure the user is offboarded from any company applications they had access to.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now let’s dive into each option.&nbsp;</p>
 Offboarding with the intention to suspend 
<p>This is a good option if you want to remove access for a user but don’t want to completely delete them. For example, maybe the user was privy to critical business data that you don’t want to risk losing, or maybe it’s a seasonal contractor that you plan to reinstate later in the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when you suspend a user in YeshID:</p>
 
 The user’s data will be kept, but they won’t receive emails, calendar invitations, or files as long as they’re suspended (note: this does require you to maintain a Google Workspace license for the user).&nbsp; 
 Once you specify that the user is suspended, you will be prompted to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to.&nbsp; 
 Emails are sent to the application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at specified time. 
 You can “unsuspend” a user at any time, as long as they’re not deleted. 
 
<p></p>
 Offboarding with the intention to delete 
<p>This is a good option if you know that you want to remove the user entirely. When you delete a user, YeshID will:</p>
 
 Reset the Google Workspace password, which will revoke any application-specific passwords tied to the user’s account 
 Log the user out of every Google session across all of their devices by invalidating their session cookies 
 Delete the user’s account recovery email and phone numbers 
 Revoke all <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/navigating-the-oauth-maze-in-smb-identity-management/">OAuth grants associated with the user’s account</a> 
 Prompt you to create a task list to offboard the user from the applications they have access to 
 Send emails to application administrators, prompting them to remove access for the user at the specified time. 
 
<p>When you delete a user, YeshID will also create a list of tasks that an admin must manually complete. While the above steps will happen automatically, these steps require confirmation from the admin to continue:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Confirm that they have transferred all email from the account they wish to save, by using the Google Data Migration Service. 
 Initiate any data transfers that were configured in the YeshID offboarding dialog (Google Docs/Drive, Calendar, etc.). 
 Delete the account in Google Workspace. 
 Set the old email address as an alias on another account so you can continue receiving new email for the old account.&nbsp; 
 
<p></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the last step here, creating an alias, can’t be done until you delete the user. Then you have to remember to come back to create the alias. It’s an easy step to forget — thankfully you have that task reminder in YeshID. 😉</p>
 Easier offboarding with technology 
<p>The task of offboarding a user contains many distinct steps, each of which can lead to issues if forgotten. Why take the risk? YeshID uses ready-made procedures that ensure you follow offboarding best practices and keep your environment safe and running smoothly. <a href="https://yeshid.com/">See how easy it can be</a>.</p>

<p>A context note from Mary Camacho: </p><p>As the executive director of an organization exploring new models of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/revolutionizing-the-workspace/">human synergy and coordination</a>, I often think about how we can enable more inclusive collaboration globally.</p><p>So it was thrilling to have the chance to speak with Catherine Stihler, whose decades of experience in geopolitical relations has given her deep wisdom.</p><p>Our wide-ranging conversation covered many aspects of policy, technology, and governance. Fundamentally, it centered on a key question — how do we bridge the many divides that hinder human cooperation and collective problem-solving?&nbsp;</p><p>There were no simple answers, but identifying the barriers provided inspiration to keep striving for coherence across cultures. By exploring the intersections of technology, regulation, and how groups communicate, we identified commonalities underlying collective problem-solving. What follows is a summary of key noticings from the conversation.&nbsp;</p> Cultural Perspectives Complicate Collaboration <p>Successful <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/blending-physical-digital-collaboration/">collaboration</a> requires navigating varied mindsets and worldviews — a complex challenge. As Stihler noted, “How do you culturally navigate spaces and places?”</p><p>Her multinational career has shown that coherence demands understanding perspectives. Within the EU parliament alone, discussion happens in over 20 languages, demonstrating the diversity of communication styles. Even basic terms can mean different things across cultures.</p><p>Friction naturally occurs when bringing together people with different assumptions and motivations. As Stihler experienced, this tension is integral, if sometimes uncomfortable.</p><p>During negotiations, she focused on the ultimate policy aims that transcended cultural barriers. She focused on finding common purpose-centered compromises. Still, bridging divides can be challenging, given subjective identities and priorities. We must accept messiness in sharing space.</p><p>Keeping communication open despite discomfort aids progress. And the groups who govern play a key role in establishing incentives towards mutual understanding.</p> Inclusive Governance Requires Uncomfortable Coherence <p>Governance and policy processes necessitate navigating conflicting interests to reach collaborative decisions. As noted, this process contains inherent “tension” and “discomfort.” When representing constituencies with varying needs and values, perfect solutions fail.</p><p>Progress means reconciling disagreements.&nbsp;</p><p>Stihler recounted challenging EU regulations where health priorities competed with economic ones. Compromising entailed painful sacrifices on multiple sides. However, with shared underlying aims, adversaries transformed into collaborators united by a common purpose</p><p>While universal access to collaboration and information is ideal, Stihler noted that some limitations can spur healthy competition, stating:</p><blockquote>“Not all barriers are bad. Some can encourage innovations.”</blockquote><p>For example, within a single economic market, preventing total domination by one company allows space for newcomers and alternate models like co-ops. Rules ensure stability while still providing openings for diverse contributors.</p> Overcoming Persistent Digital Divides <p>Despite the connectivity promised by digital tools, barriers still limit access and divide users. As Stihler explained, restrictions like “geo-blocking” prevent sharing media across country borders, hindering collaboration. While the EU’s “Digital Single Market” intended seamlessness, gaps remain, frustrating users across member states and other countries.</p><p>For non-EU countries, these false boundaries are especially visible. From a UK or US perspective, the borders seem technical and arbitrary, given the ability to instantly share data globally. However, preventing access contradicts the spirit of open digital space. We must keep pioneering tools giving users agency and accessibility.</p><p>While some limitations aim to encourage market competition, others serve little purpose beyond denying availability. More and more people cross borders because families, friends, and now businesses are moving. And the digital tools they use also evolve alongside this change. This is a sweet spot for Holochain because the architecture requires the consent of the users and apps built with it — rather than centralized server hosting to connect groups together.</p> Bridging Divides Through Understanding <p>Technology alone cannot solve barriers to cooperation stemming from varied cultural perspectives and incentives. However, frameworks that help build bridges and foster mutual understanding can assist with reconciliation.&nbsp;</p><p>As the EU demonstrates, keeping communication open across cultural divides provides critical conduits for compromise, even if tension persists. Institutions play a vital role in sustaining conduits for exchange.</p><p>While universal inclusion remains an ideal, moderate limitations sustaining diversity also prove essential for progress by preventing stagnant monopolies and stimulating competition. With open, equitable rules of engagement, such friction engenders innovation rather than isolation.</p><p>As remote and hybrid work evolve, integrating the magic of embodied teamwork with virtual capabilities remains imperative to human progress. For it is amidst the messiness of the human experience that the future unfolds.</p><p>If you enjoyed this article, feel free to share it or drop a comment and share your thoughts. We want to hear from you!</p>

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has emerged as a pivotal tool in cybersecurity, a security key to bolstering the fortifications guarding sensitive information and systems. Essential to comprehending the broader discussion on MFA security is an understanding of the phenomenon termed “MFA Fatigue.” This concept encapsulates the exhaustion and inconvenience experienced by users due to repetitive and cumbersome multi-factor authentication and processes. Addressing this issue is instrumental in cultivating a cybersecurity environment that is both secure and user-friendly.</p>
 What is MFA Fatigue? 
<p>MFA Fatigue is a multifaceted challenge with various contributing factors. The core of this issue lies in the repetitive and often cumbersome login process and processes that users must navigate to authenticate their identities, compromised credentials, mobile device, username and password, and account. This can lead to exhaustion and frustration, diminishing the overall user experience and potentially leading to lax security practices.<br>
An in-depth examination of MFA Fatigue requires exploring its manifestations and impacts on user behavior. Recognizing the signs and symptoms is essential to preemptively addressing potential challenges and mitigating risks. It is crucial to analyze how MFA Fatigue influences user interactions with security protocols and its subsequent impact on user credentials and overall cybersecurity hygiene.</p>
 How does an MFA Fatigue Attack Start? 
<p>MFA Fatigue attacks begin by exploiting users’ weariness from engaging with multiple, repetitive authentication processes. Attackers anticipate that tired and frustrated users are more likely to make mistakes or bypass security protocols, making executing attacks like phishing or account and password hijacking easier.<br>
The attacker’s goal is to take advantage of these moments of vulnerability, where legitimate users might overlook suspicious activities or ignore security alerts because they desire a more straightforward authentication process.<br>
In these attacks, adversaries mimic legitimate authentication requests or login attempts, creating a sense of urgency, forcing the users to act quickly and without much thought. Users already fatigued by numerous authentication steps are more prone to fall for these tactics, giving attackers the access or information they seek, thus compromising the security defenses set by the MFA processes.</p>
 What is an example of a MFA fatigue attack? 
<p>One typical example of an MFA Fatigue attack is a phishing scheme where the attacker impersonates a trusted service with stolen credentials with which the user frequently interacts, such as an email provider or a corporate system.<br>
The user receives a message urging them to log in and attempt to confirm their identity by clicking a link. Since users often encounter multiple authentication requests, they might proceed without thoroughly evaluating the request’s legitimacy, potentially exposing sensitive information.<br>
Another example could be an attacker exploiting the users’ familiarity with authentication processes to make a login attempt to gain access or create a spoofed login page. Users, tired of repeatedly entering credentials and going through MFA procedures, may not meticulously check the URL or the page’s security, entering their information into a fraudulent site, which then captures their credentials and potentially bypasses MFA protections.</p>
 Is MFA fatigue social engineering? 
<p>MFA fatigue indirectly fosters a conducive environment for social engineering attacks. Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.<br>
MFA fatigue contributes to this by making users more susceptible to attacks due to their weariness and frustration from constant authentication requests. Most users might be less vigilant and more willing to comply with unusual requests, thinking it is just another part of the authentication process.<br>
However, it’s important to clarify that MFA request fatigue is not a social engineering attack. It is a state of user exhaustion and frustration due to repetitive MFA request processes, which attackers exploit using social engineering techniques, like phishing or pretexting, to deceive users into lowering their defenses and revealing sensitive information or access.</p>
 Evolving Landscape of Cybersecurity and MFA 
<p>Tracing the trajectory of MFA technologies provides valuable insights into their current state and future directions. Initially, MFA emerged as a groundbreaking approach to secure authentication, offering robust defenses against unauthorized access to login credentials, security keys, and authentication messages. However, as cyber threats have evolved, so have the demands on MFA technologies to provide enhanced security without compromising usability.<br>
The present landscape presents a crucible of challenges and opportunities. Technological advances and signs in a heightened threat environment necessitate continuous evolution and adaptation of MFA strategies. Organizations must be agile and responsive to maintain sensitive data integrity and security postures while mitigating MFA Fatigue.</p>
 Technological Innovations Targeting MFA Fatigue 
<p>Emerging technologies present promising avenues for alleviating MFA Fatigue. Innovations continually reshape the landscape, aiming to simplify authentication processes without compromising security. Evaluating the effectiveness of these technologies and their reception by users is integral to understanding their role in combating MFA Fatigue.<br>
Many technologies, such as biometrics and adaptive authentication, have been heralded as transformative in enhancing user experience. By staying abreast of these technological trends and their implications, organizations can make informed decisions that bolster their cybersecurity while easing user fatigue.</p>
 Legal and Compliance Considerations in MFA 
<p>In the labyrinth of multi-factor authentication (MFA), legal and compliance considerations are one example of pivotal guideposts. These elements delineate organizations’ boundaries and obligations to implement and manage MFA processes. The organization’s multi-factor authentication and legal landscape encompasses various facets, including data protection regulations, user rights, and industry-specific compliance mandates.<br>
Understanding and adhering to legal and compliance considerations are non-negotiable facets of responsible MFA deployment. Organizations must stay abreast of legislative developments, regulatory requirements, and industry best practices. This adherence is instrumental in safeguarding organizational integrity, user trust, and the overall robustness of cybersecurity defenses.</p>
 User Experience (UX) Design Principles for MFA 
<p>Incorporating User Experience (UX) design principles into MFA strategies heralds a reimagined approach focused on the user’s identity-centricity. This involves designing MFA processes prioritizing ease of use, intuitive interaction, and overall user satisfaction. Effective UX design in MFA seeks to reduce complexities and frictions contributing to user fatigue and dissatisfaction.<br>
By leveraging UX design principles, MFA processes can be transformed into seamless user journeys that harmonize security and usability. Such a design ethos fosters a positive user interaction with security protocols, encouraging compliance and enhancing the security keys overall effectiveness in authentication processes.</p>
 Organizational Strategies for Implementing MFA 
<p>Deployment strategies within organizations play a critical role in the reception and effectiveness of MFA processes. Thoughtful implementation involves careful planning, stakeholder engagement, and continuous improvement mechanisms. Crafting strategies that consider organizational dynamics, technical infrastructures, and user needs are paramount.<br>
Adoption and usability are key considerations in the strategic deployment of an MFA system. Organizations must foster environments supporting user education and adaptation, providing necessary resources, training, and support. Such comprehensive strategies pave the way for the successful integration of MFA as a robust and user-friendly component of organizational cybersecurity.</p>
 Continuous Improvement: Analytics and Feedback 
<p>Embracing a philosophy of continuous improvement propels MFA strategies toward evolving excellence. Utilizing analytics offers a lens into user interactions, behaviors, and challenges within the MFA processes. With user feedback, analytics forge a pathway to insightful enhancements and refinements.<br>
Feedback loops, encompassing user insights and analytical data, become the bedrock for informed decision-making. They facilitate the identification of areas for improvement, user challenges, and opportunities for optimization. By nurturing a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can maintain MFA processes that are both contemporary and user-centric.</p>

<p>Over the years, the ways in which we get from A to B have changed based on how the mobility industry has developed as well as major world events impacting travel choices and decisions. However, finding the fastest and easiest way to get to our final destinations still remains the major priority. But not only do we want fast and easy travel but also convenience paired with cost savings, and we want to be able to know all our options.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">Shared mobility</a> such as car sharing and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility</a> will continue to see growth <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/carsharing-market">over the next 10 years</a> due to increasing environmental regulations, there are plenty of choices for consumers, but how can they find the best based on their immediate needs?</p>



<p>Enter Mobility as a Service (MaaS)—a one-stop traveling shop, which takes every type of transportation into account and provides its users the best optimized route to their destination. A concept focusing on a “bundled service model,” consumers are in a sense buying into mobility, instead of investing in transport equipment such as personal vehicles.</p>



<p>With the global Mobility as a Service market projected to <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/mobility-as-a-service-maas-market-102066">grow from $236.42 billion in 2022 to $774.93 billion by 2029</a>, companies need to bear in mind where MaaS is headed and how they can become part of this growing movement.</p>



 What is Mobility as a Service (MaaS)? 



<p>Mobility as a Service (MaaS) is an emerging trend that is transforming the way we use and access transportation. The overarching idea of MaaS is that it is an integration of various forms of transport and transport-related services into a single, comprehensive and on-demand mobility service. Basically, everything at the touch of a button. This in effect allows users to access all types of transportation (walking, car sharing, public transportation, micromobility, etc.) in one application with a single payment channel. Say goodbye to the multiple ticket purchasing stress.</p>



<p>Instead, services are <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">becoming consolidated</a> by having one application for all their travel needs.</p>



 Why is MaaS important? 



<p>The importance of MaaS lies in the concept itself. By reducing the inconveniences associated with accessing individual transportation services, MaaS provides a one travel service from planning to booking to paying, creating a more fluid and integrated experience of transportation. This results in less congestion, fewer emissions and lower operating costs all while providing a more accessible and inclusive journey for those individuals with limited mobility. Plus, MaaS allows for the integration of smart city data to create efficient and cost-effective traffic management systems. In the long run, MaaS holds great promise for improving accessibility, affordability, sustainability and efficiency in our transportation networks.</p>



<p>Additionally, every person has their own unique needs based on their job, interests, financial profile, physical capabilities, behaviors, relationships, personal preferences and more. Putting these all together creates a specific identity that can be tailored to when it comes to transportation and exactly what MaaS will provide since alternative transport options will be available in a one-stop shop.</p>



<p>In short, MaaS could be the final puzzle piece needed to make urban life smoother, faster and cheaper for everyone.&nbsp;</p>



 What are Mobility as a Service examples? 



<p>Mobility as a Service can sometimes be confusing when wondering which apps and operators fall under which category. Some MaaS providers, such as ride hailing apps (Uber) and peer-to-peer rental services (GoGet &amp; FlexiCar) are currently good examples of MaaS that focus on one or two areas. However, with the <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/mobility-as-a-service-market">expected CAGR around 7.43% over the next five years</a> and Asia-Pacific the fastest growing market, major players in the MaaS industry include Enterprise, Hertz and Moovit.</p>



<p>However, the future of MaaS looks toward apps that can provide all services in one place such as Whim based in Helsinki, but also available in the UK, Belgium, Austria, Japan, etc. Whim combines over 2,500+ taxis, car rentals and public transport options, helping users plan and book better journeys through smartphone technology. This can also be seen from the business side as well. UK-based company Mobilleo is a Mobility as a Service app specifically for businesses. Whether a self-employed business or a fleet manager, Mobilleo combines thousands of travel providers into one app to help businesses find, book and pay for their journey in one solution.</p>



 



 

 



 Digital identity: the building block of MaaS. 



<p>But what does this mean exactly for users and operators? Well, for one it means the importance of data. In order to provide what consumers are looking for data must be shared. However, security concerns arise from both the consumer and operator when it comes to data collection and could keep MaaS from growing. Consumers fear the attractiveness this service would be for fraudsters, while also doubting the legitimacy of ID verification platforms. On the other hand, operators worry about the challenge of proper driver’s license verification and preventing minors/fraudsters from using their services.</p>



<p>In a way, the root of the problem is the lack of security on both ends and the possibility of the mishandling of data, which would put the fate of MaaS in jeopardy. A strong <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/mix-maas-mobility-service-final.pdf">framework for data sharing</a> and identity verification therefore needs to be put in place in order for MaaS ro be successful. But there’s really no need to worry because there is a solution.</p>



 The missing link: security through identification. 



<p>The key to this new service is what connects the various modes of transportation and their service operators in order to support MaaS and provide a smooth multi-leg and multi-modal journey for customers. But what exactly is the key? Simple. Digital identity verification.</p>



<p>With all transportation options listed in one area, having digital identity verification is crucial so providers know who is using their services. Plus, providers want to offer the best service to their customers (in hopes that you will use them again) and can do that by way of having the digital identities of its users. But consumers also benefit by seeing what the mobility providers can offer them. Basically, it’s a two-way street where both parties can be satisfied.</p>



<p>But why exactly is digital identification necessary? Not only does it provide consumers and companies the benefits of this two-way street, but it offers trust, which is the foundation of any relationship.</p>



<p>Because MaaS is a platform displaying various modes of transport, there are some services that will need to know if a customer possesses a valid driver’s license or is the appropriate age to use their application. Additionally, any leasing contracts for car-sharing also can require a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">qualified electronic signature</a> or proof of bank account. But no matter what they may require, a one-time, fast, seamless and automated identity verification is all that is needed.</p>



<p>Plus, as more and more services become digitalized, companies will offer the opportunity for users to store their digital identities in a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> so verification can become even more simplified and efficient while traveling. Since MaaS is housed all in one application, all needed documents, tickets, etc. will be in one place while on-the-go. Travel will be like it never has before. &nbsp;</p>



 







 Convenience is the goal. 



<p>Though still a new concept, MaaS will become more popular in the future due to its main function. It provides convenience for all its users. Mobility doesn’t need to be a hassle or stressful and people don’t want it to be. Instead, it should be easy and smooth. MaaS provides exactly that with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">assistance from digital identity verification</a>.</p>



<p>Not only is MaaS convenient, but so is proving your identity. IDnow offers automated solutions which require only a quick photo snap of your ID or driver’s license. Even a qualified electronic signature can be added when necessary. With a process that only requires a few minutes, users can do so from on-the-go, wherever they may be. IDnow is the solution for knowing customers’ true identities so they can carry on with their journey.<br><br>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">Fueling the demand of convenient mobility</a></p>



 A partnership leading us into tomorrow. 



<p>In today’s growing mobility sector, having a digital identity is essential for both consumers and businesses. Both want to authenticate the other and feel secure in their relationship. Thus, these digital identities are at the core of MaaS since it is a one-stop shop. It truly is a digital identity solution partnership that will lead us into the world of tomorrow’s transportation.</p>

 In 2023, new entrants to the financial system reached a monumental milestone, for all the wrong reasons. 



 



<p>Last year, for the first time ever, crypto firms and fintechs received more fines than traditional financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f2a8c1e4-30f2-49c7-939b-73e0d1a22033">data analysed by the Financial Times</a>, crypto and digital payment companies paid an eye-watering $5.8 billion in fines due to a multitude of reasons, including non-compliance in anti-money laundering checks and failing to uphold sanctions and other financial crime issues.</p>



 Findings and failings. 



<p>In total, crypto firms recorded 11 separate fines in 2023 compared to an annual average of just two over the last five years. Meanwhile, payments firms recorded 27 fines, which was a huge increase on their annual average of five per year from 2018 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most fines levied against payments groups were to fintech groups that were less than 20 years old.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is a surprising shift in the global payments space, and just goes to show that such punishments can be levied out to even the most digital-savvy sectors.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow</blockquote>



<p>“Gone are the days where bad behavior will be tolerated by newcomers to the financial industry. With major players like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-first-hit-1-bln-assets-2024-01-19/">Blackrock recently launching its bitcoin ETF</a>, which boasts huge compliance operations as well as general risk aversion, the industry is likely, and will need to, grow up quickly in 2024 and beyond,” added Rayissa.</p>



<p>The main contributor to the astronomical amount of 5.8 billion in fines was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/binance-settlement-crypto-exchange">$4.3 billion penalty</a> levied against crypto exchange Binance, which was set “purposefully high.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reasons for the mammoth fine were attributed to violations of:&nbsp;</p>



  The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)<br>  Failure to register as a money transmitting business<br>  Violations to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).&nbsp;  



<p>“Binance became the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange in part because of the crimes it committed – now it is paying one of the largest corporate penalties in US history. The message here should be clear: using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor, it makes you a criminal,” said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen was even clearer in her <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/binance-and-ceo-plead-guilty-federal-charges-4b-resolution">damnation of the crypto platform</a>, stating how Binance’s “wilful” failures to adhere to AML and sanctions compliance allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, this was not the only wake-up call that should have set off alarm bells in the crypto community in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The much-publicized decision to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/24d153b0-0c28-4946-acbe-2e93329bca52">convict the founder of FTX of money laundering</a> and fraud sent further shockwaves through the industry. Despite such turbulence, there were also significant steps taken to stabilize crypto in 2023, such as the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Market in Crypto Assets regulatory framework (MiCA)</a>, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer of Funds regulation (TFR)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">UK’s proposed regulatory regime</a>, which neared ever closer to completion. As the regulations are finally likely to be enforced in 2024, this could not happen at a more crucial time.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">Discover which trends are likely to affect the crypto (and gambling and financial services) industry in 2024.</a>  



<blockquote><p>2024 may very well prove to be a watershed year for the crypto industry. It’s likely that the upcoming crypto regulations will have a positive impact and act as a stabilizing force, while the fines should serve as a deterrent and remind crypto firms that AML laws and regulations apply to them too.</p>Rayissa Armata, Director, Global Regulatory &amp; Government Affairs at&nbsp;IDnow&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>“However, there’s also a very real chance that firms, especially new entrants to the crypto and fintech market that are in a rush to establish themselves and onboard as many customers as possible, may bypass certain steps in customer controls. This is not advisable. KYC processes, and rigorous identity checks are in place for a reason – to protect the business and the customer.”</p>



 Light at the end of the tunnel? 



<p>Besides the aforementioned regulatory frameworks due to be enforced later this year, 2024 has already started with some reassuring developments regarding crypto regulation. Chief among these was guidance issued by the European Banking Authority (EBA), which extended its <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-guidance-crypto-asset-service-providers">guidelines on money laundering and terrorist financing</a> to crypto asset service providers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The European Council and European Parliament also recently announced that it had reached a provisional agreement on the decision to create the brand-new <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2023/12/13/anti-money-laundering-council-and-parliament-agree-to-create-new-authority/">Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA)</a> – a European authority with the expressed purpose of countering money laundering and financing of terrorism. Technical negotiations are expected to be ongoing for months, with a tentative aim of formally adopting final agreement by 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proposals put forward include:&nbsp;</p>



  Requirements for financial institutions to conduct <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/enhanced-due-diligence/">enhanced due diligence</a> on wealthy individuals, or on transactions involving high amounts.<br>  Enhanced due diligence for cross-border crypto transactions.&nbsp;  



<p>While obliged entities, including financial institutions, banks, real estate agencies, asset management services, casinos, and merchants traditionally enforce AML requirements like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC</a>, the new rules now cover most of the crypto ecosystem. All crypto-asset service providers will now be required to conduct due diligence on customers, including verifying personal KYC data, with such data required to accompany transfers under the Travel Rule when transactions exceed €1000 or more.</p>



 Stronger together. 



<p>In February, 2024, we joined a consortium of five partners, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a>, with the aim of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;[Read more about TFR in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">blog, ‘EU extends TFR to crypto, requiring KYC for all crypto transactions.’</a>]</p>



<p>A major challenge for CASPs will be to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the consortium has proposed a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII.</p>



<p>Discover more about the consortium by reading the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">press release </a>and watching the explainer video below.</p>



 



 

 



 Putting the KYC into crypto and fintech. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also an important requirement to comply with AML, MiCA and other crypto-related regulation. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The bottom line is that KYC and Know Your Business is at the nexus of this world and people are catching up to this reality – you have to know who is out there – as people go on or off chain or in and out of the traditional banking world,” warned Rayissa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s highly configurable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">identity verification solutions</a> work across multiple regulations, industries and use cases, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">crypto</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">fintech</a>. Whether automated or expert-assisted, our online identity verification methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversion or consumer experience.</p>

			 Year of Tokeny: 2023’s Milestones &amp; 2024’s Tokenization Predictions 
 
<p>I hope you kicked off the new year with great energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, our people are what make us outstanding. As a remote-first team, we prioritize coming together each year for retreats to forge physical connections, align our visions, and simply share great moments.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, our journey led us to the picturesque Puigcerdà in Spain. Amidst breathtaking mountain hikes, indulgent spa experiences, and delightful culinary adventures, we also found time for some highly efficient meetings. It was truly amazing, and we had the pleasure of meeting one of our first members, Nida, who finally joined us in person after six years of dedicated work at Tokeny from Turkey.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the achievements of 2023, we are thrilled to share the highlights that have propelled us to the forefront of tokenization.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>? Tokeny’s Triumphs:</p>
<p>2023 marked Tokeny’s 6th year, a milestone that brought numerous celebrations, including:</p>
 
 45 new financial institutions as customers and partners 
 Apex Group Investment: We secured new investment from Apex Group, which underscores institutional support for tokenization, enabling us to scale further. 
 Security Focus: We continued to demonstrate our commitment to the highest security standards, earning a perfect&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/hacken-grants-tokenization-protocol-erc3643-a-10-10-security-audit-score/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWJvQCv5Tmn4PFraBdAJfM5dPEqyzi3LMCaA0aSR2YexP0dbsuLhW18K2gWtTTmmrvwpC">10/10 audit score</a>&nbsp;from Hacken and obtaining&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-tokeny-became-the-most-secure-tokenization-platform-worldwide/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8TWJvQCv5Tmn4PFraBdAJfM5dPEqyzi3LMCaA0aSR2YexP0dbsuLhW18K2gWtTTmmrvwpC">SOC2 Type 1</a>&nbsp;certification. 
 Revenue Boom: We increased our annual revenue by a stellar 100%. 
 176k readerships of our newsletter. 
 5,679 companies contacted us to collaborate or learn from us.

 And, two of our team members expanded their family by welcoming a newborn ?.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>? Eventful Year:</p>
<p>We gained global presence by attending 52 events worldwide, and speaking at 38. Additionally, we participated in 16 webinars, and featured in 2 podcasts.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>We selected some of the most interesting digital content for you:</p>

<p>? Growing Network of Issuers, Asset Managers and Servicers:</p>
 
 LinkedIn Reach: We saw a 48% growth in our follower base, reaching over 8k followers on LinkedIn. 
 Newsletter Expansion: We welcomed 2.4k new subscribers, our newsletter community now stands at 9.9k, including influential institutional subscribers from top asset managers like JP Morgan, State Street, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs. 
 
<p>? ERC-3643 Standardization Contribution:</p>
 
 Association Launch: We successfully launched the ERC3643 Association with 45 prominent actively participating members, including top-tier financial institutions, global law firms, and blockchain leaders like SS&amp;C, Invesco, CMS, Apex Group, and Polygon. 
 EIP Recognition: Achieving final status in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), the ERC-3643 was officially recognized as the de facto token standard for compliant tokenization. 
 
<p>Predictions for 2024</p>
<p>The upcoming year promises to be full of tokenization breakthroughs. Our predictions are:</p>
 
 5 out of the top 10 asset managers will tokenize assets:&nbsp;Tokenized products will be introduced by half of the top 10 asset managers. 
 Standardization with ERC-3643:&nbsp;The entire industry will start to build valuable use cases and form a dynamic ecosystem with a validated token standard ERC-3643 instead of reinventing the wheel. 
 Regulated entities will start tokenizing cash: A few large financial institutions will issue stablecoins, e-money or deposit tokens. 
 US regulation will open up:&nbsp;The US market is set to open up, compelling others to hasten their initiatives. 
 Institutions go public blockchain:&nbsp;It opens the door for interoperability with DeFi, driving demands from investors by adding utility to their assets and innovation. 
 
<p>As we kick-off 2024, we are prepared for the challenges and opportunities in the tokenization landscape. Your support has been pivotal, and together, we are set for an even more dynamic year ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a crucial part of Tokeny’s journey!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/quicktake/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence</a> (AI) has many upsides, but a significant downside is its role in creating <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fakes</a> and other identity theft fraud mechanisms. The technology is increasingly accessible and affordable, manipulatable media is freely available across the internet, and detecting real from fake is growing more difficult by the day.</p>



<p>A ‘deep fake’ is a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">video</a>, image, or audio of a real or fictitious person’s likeness or <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165448073/voice-clones-ai-scams-ftc">voice</a> that was substantially modified or generated using <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-machine-learning-everything-you-need-to-know/">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-generative-ai-and-why-is-it-so-popular-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/">generative AI</a>. The result is convincing content that looks and sounds like it comes from a specific person. In the case of the popular <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated">grandparent scam</a>, that ‘specific person’ is the victim’s grandchild whose voice and image have been manipulated to convey a fearful message, while in the growing number of corporate or <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/regulating-ai-deepfakes-and-synthetic-media-political-arena">political deep fakes</a>, the subject could be a CEO, political opponent or even a president.</p>



<p>Deep fakes are used to defraud money and spread disinformation. They threaten privacy, reputation, finances, and peace, potentially on a global scale.</p>



<p>The US government is moving to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">regulate</a> deep fakes, and some commercial operations have introduced <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-20/deepfakes-what-are-fake-ai-video-dangers-and-how-to-spot-them">deep fake detection technology</a>, so there are solutions on the horizon. But a solution we see enormous potential in is <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity technology</a>, grounded in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">blockchain</a>.</p>



<p>In a nutshell:</p>



 
 Web3 and DI technologies would deliver some secure content “locks” that could be quickly checked and verified as irrefutable proof of authenticity. 



 Blockchain would make it incredibly difficult for malicious actors to manipulate or tamper with digital content since every change would be permanently recorded and verifiable. 
 



<p></p>



<p>There are a few ways to leverage this technology:</p>



 
 A person would possess an official <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identifier</a> (DID) (which includes a public key) on a public blockchain. Any piece of content that person creates would be cryptographically hashed and signed with a digital signature created by the private key associated with their public key, proving its authenticity, or 



 A person would hold verified credentials for their digital persona in a digital wallet, which again would prove the authenticity of their created content. In the digital wallet, they would also store other verified real-world credentials for their digital persona, such as driver license, passport, proof of residency and so on, or 



 A person could store in their digital wallet <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFT ) backed by blockchains to prove ownership of digital assets including video and voice recordings.&nbsp; If a recording is protected by an NFT owned by a reliable person or organization then the recording can be trusted and is not subject to fraud. 
 



<p>With all these solutions, anyone watching a video or listening to or reading a piece of content could be assured of the content’s author and that the content has not been modified. This provides protection against deep fakes, including those created using AI.</p>



<p></p>

<p></p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/decentralized-signature-countering-deepfakes-julien-maldonato/">great article</a> from Deloitte summarizes the 6 ways Web3 and DI would act as a safeguard against deep fakes and other generative AI scam mechanisms:</p>







<p>1. Provenance tracking: Cryptography and distributed ledger technology makes it almost impossible to conceal manipulated origins of content.</p>







<p>2. Self-sovereign identity: DI gives the user complete control over their identity, including their content, shutting out the potential criminal element.</p>







<p>3. Tamper-proof meta data: Embedding cryptographically verified metadata such as timestamps, location, and device information, readily distinguishes authentic content from manipulated versions.</p>







<p>4. Authenticity certificates: Digital certificates attached to validated original media act as irrefutable proof of authenticity.</p>







<p>5. Algorithmic detection: Blockchain-based platforms can use deepfake detection software that algorithmically flags suspected fakes and deters bad actors.</p>







<p>6. Incentives alignment: Leveraging tokenized incentives and reputation staking, common in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/what-is-web-3-0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-privacy/">Web3</a> models, may discourage the production and dissemination of manipulated content.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more …</p>



<p>Interestingly, on the flip side of AI is its potential to combat the scams it actually helped create by shoring up Web3 and DI systems. AI can help secure identities and monitor social networks for suspicious activity or profiles, weeding out forgeries and inauthentic content.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/28/how-ai-and-web3-id-tech-can-defeat-deepfake-frauds/?sh=158ec8394814">Forbes</a> writer describes this “quid pro quo” arrangement between Web3/DI and AI this way: “Blockchain-verified profiles can offer a type of ‘proof of humanity,’ a place to store digital assets and identifiers, and a single point of access into the Web3 ecosystem—all while keeping the user’s privacy under their control. Meanwhile, AI can work to monitor and secure these profiles, keeping people from becoming the next victims of AI-wielding criminals.”</p>



<p>We can act right now</p>



<p>This is an interesting and rapidly evolving topic. For now, the key takeaway is that AI-driven fraud will likely remain a threat for some time, but leveraging Web3 and DI technology grounded in blockchain and even pairing it with AI technology presents a viable solution that’s available right now. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Explore the solutions we offer in Sudo Platform</a>.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Decentralized identity governance covers both the traditional remit of governance —&nbsp;who is in control and therefore accountable — with the technical policies, rules, and procedures that apply to any given use of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>This hybridity can be a source of confusion. Those from the business world may think in terms of corporate governance and those from the engineering world may think in terms of technical stacks. In merging the two, the goals of clarity and simplicity — hallmarks of good governance — run into the complexity of technology, which in the case of decentralized identity, is compounded by its recent emergence, protean capabilities, and unfamiliar concepts and terms.</p>
<p>Our goal here is to simplify and help you understand the basics so that you can start implementing the technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>Let’s assume that you’ve already decided that you want to use decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology to share and verify data without the need for direct integrations or third parties.</p>
<p>To implement your solution, you need to ask yourself/team/partners the following question: Do you want to—</p>
<p>create an ecosystem of your own (by ecosystem we mean a complete system for issuing, holding, and verifying credentials/data/identity for a specific use case)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only issue credentials on an existing ecosystem</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>only verify credentials on an existing ecosystem?</p>
<p>Answering “yes” to the first means you are the governance authority (or you and a partnering organization or government will co-create the governance if the solution has multiple stakeholders).</p>
<p>A “yes” to the second or third means you need to evaluate the governance of the ecosystem you’re joining to see if it meets your needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are creating an ecosystem and the use case comes with a regulatory requirement to run your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network, you’ll need to create network governance.</p>
<p>The image below illustrates the decision process.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>One thing to note is that most solutions do not require creating and running your own verifiable data registry/distributed ledger network. There are global networks to choose from, including the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, which is purposefully designed for enterprise grade solutions. The point is not having to create a distributed ledger network radically simplifies the amount of governance you have to create and manage, something that’s not always apparent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 One solution, three governance elements, 
<p>For the next step, we’re going to borrow a visual aid from St. Patrick, a shamrock. Right now, any implementation of decentralized identity is going to have the following governance elements.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Ecosystem governance applies to the Issuers, holders, and verifiers of verifiable credentials. A governance authority establishes rules for participation and interaction. If you’re creating an ecosystem, as we’ve noted, you are the governance authority for all these participants.</p>
<p>Machine-readable governance is a way to encode ecosystem governance rules — that is, who is a trusted issuer, what attributes must be presented — in a file that agent software (the software used by issuers, holders, and verifiers) can access and cache. It enables human governance rules to be automated. And because the rules are cached, credential verification is possible in offline situations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Network governance comprises the governance for a distributed ledger network, which includes the legal agreements for credential issuers to write to the ledger. As noted, you’re unlikely to need to create this, but you will have to evaluate other networks based on their governance and, if issuing credentials, you’re likely going to have to sign agreements to write to a network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the key governance issues in each of these elements?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To implement governance, you are going to have to make a series of policy and technical decisions on each of the bullet points in Ecosystem Governance, and evaluate competing networks on the bullet points in Network Governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the important decisions you are going to have to make when creating governance for an ecosystem&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity assurance —&nbsp;are you issuing credentials to people, organizations, or things? How much information in the credential will identify the person compared to describing&nbsp; the credential? For the personal identity attributes, do you need an identity assurance process?</p>
<p>Credential issuers — Will there be multiple credential issuers in your ecosystem? If so, how are they to be onboarded?</p>
<p>Credential types — what credential type should you use for people, organizations? Do you need selective disclosure? What are the policies and procedures for credential expiry, revocation? Are there any restrictions on who can verify credentials?</p>
<p>DID methods — What DID methods for which participants? Should you use a DID method with communication endpoints? How much durability do you need in your ecosystem?</p>
<p>Protocols — Do you need secure protocols for notification and confirmation? What device capabilities will your participants have?</p>
<p>Cryptographic keys — How will you manage key rotation?</p>
<p>Wallets — What are your options and requirements? Do you have a recognizable brand?</p>
<p>Networks — Will you use a network? Which one will you choose and how will it benefit your solution? (Learn more about the networks Indicio offers and <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-deep-dive-into-the-indicio-networks/">how to choose the best one to fit your needs.</a>)</p>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of things to consider or the place to dive in and provide analysis and recommendations. But looking at these issues and making decisions is not an Everest-summiting task. In all likelihood, you will make them in consultation with one or more partners who will likely have specific requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The net result will be a set of approved credential issuers (a trust list) and a set of rules for interaction between all participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We strongly recommend encoding these rules in machine-readable files that can be downloaded by each participant in the ecosystem/use case. Why? It’s simple, it’s flexible, it makes governance portable —&nbsp;and it has provided the best solution for our customers (we’ve created a <a href="https://indicio.tech/governance-editor/">governance editor</a> to help automate the process).&nbsp; </p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Those are the basics. You should have a broad idea of what you need to address in order to implement or evaluate governance for your solution. It’s the starting point for understanding the decisions you need to make, and we’ll cover those decisions in future blog posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is one thought to end with, it is to choose options that provide the most flexibility for future development. Technology is not static and with something as powerful as verifiable data, the only thing you can be sure of (besides the data) is that people will innovate in ways that cannot be anticipated. We always recommend building solutions that are capable of managing multiple credential formats, easy key rotation, and (quite essentially) provide communication endpoints so that you won’t find yourself at a sudden competitive disadvantage.</p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://medium.com/@finclusive/verida-and-finclusive-bring-private-verified-identity-to-web3-and-defi-ef9ffac656fc">successful Proof of Concept (PoC) between Verida and FinClusive</a>, we are excited to announce the launch of an end-to-end solution for reusable and verifiable Known Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) credentials. This solution streamlines client onboarding and associated compliance, reduces onboarding costs, increases operational efficiency and meets existing and emerging regulatory requirements for both traditional and growing alternative and decentralized financial services.</p><p>We are continuing to build on the initial PoC with <a href="https://finclusive.com/">FinClusive</a> and <a href="https://cheqd.io/">cheqd</a>, who provides the infrastructure for credential issuance, verification, suspension and revocation. Together we can scale this combined application and enable financial services of all types to condense client onboarding times, while enabling portability and privacy controls for&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Interested organisations from traditional and web3 sectors, please <a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">book a call</a> with our joint representative Alex to capitalise on the benefits of reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p><p>Combined, this solution provides a plug-and-play platform for financial services’ KYC/KYB needs while providing reusability, client privacy, portability, and embedded compliance controls. The technology and capabilities provided through this alignment result in the following benefits for organisations that adopt this solution:</p>  Cost Savings: Significantly reduced costs for KYC and KYB verification, by a factor of&nbsp;10x.  Efficiency: A simplified customer experience, reducing customer drop-off rates and friction during onboarding, and making re-validation and monitoring real time. Simultaneously, for companies, it reduces manual document verifications and time-sinks through instantaneous verification and trusted&nbsp;checks.  Regulatory Compliance: Full regulatory compliance for customer onboarding and associated KYC/KYB, background due diligence (basic to enhanced and bespoke), with full real-time AML checks, risk scoring and background screenings, and an ongoing monitoring engine in keeping with global best practices and requirements.  Interoperability: Full compatibility and interoperability with other organisations issuing or accepting digital credentials, with no vendor lock-in–with a growing ecosystem of vendor/partners, our combined platform can enable multiple vendor engagement, and importantly accommodate financial institutions’ individual risk profiles and methodologies.  Enhanced and Embedded Privacy: Improved data sovereignty and privacy for customers, via holding their credentials in a self-custodied wallet and explicitly consenting to when they are shared, with whom, and what data is verified. Digitally verifiable KYC/KYB-backed credentials protect sensitive underlying personal and entity identifying information (PII/EII), as well as sensitive accounts and payments information (e.g. account numbers, wallet addresses, payments flows), that can be attached to these credentials — providing essential proofs while eliminating continual data disclosures in current practice.  Standardisation: Future-proofed technology in line with the upcoming eIDAS 2.0 regulation, and in keeping with ongoing international data standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and International Organization of Standardization (ISO).  <p>Within Q1 2024, FinClusive will be rolling out the first verifiable credentials for KYC and KYB to streamline onboarding for financial services in web2 and also regulated organisations such as Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) within&nbsp;web3.</p> Solving onboarding challenges, while reducing&nbsp;costs <p>There are currently significant challenges for companies around customer onboarding and verification where it is too costly in terms of time and money, leading to inefficiencies, to build trust in their customer-base.</p><p>This “verifiable” KYC/KYB solution positions itself to solve three major challenges faced by most companies which require identity verification checks in their course of business.</p>  High costs for KYC/KYB. With digital credentials that can be reused, this solution significantly reduces the costs for onboarding and verifying customers, for industries such as financial services, as well as opening up KYC/KYB into new&nbsp;markets  Challenging and costly compliance requirements. With an instantaneous check feature for AML assurance, risk scoring and other background screenings, compliance requirements can be met more easily than ever&nbsp;before  Time inefficiencies spent on identity assurance. With verifiable data sharing, secured by cryptographic primitives, we can provide a high level of assurance without any manual effort, saving employees and employers time.  <p>Through addressing each of these problems, we are bringing significant value to the market, with reduced costs and improved efficiency.</p><p>Amit Sharma, Founder and CEO of FinClusive has commented “The rising cost of inefficient compliance in the client onboarding, KYC/KYB and verification process is both crippling for service providers and detrimental to customers’ experience and privacy. Integrating the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet to allow users to store and share their FinClusive credentials sets an industry benchmark for a regulatory-compliant digital credential application and introduces a more efficient model for the traditional finance&nbsp;sector.”</p><p>“Expanding our partnership with Verida with the support of cheqd is very exciting as we work to build a ‘consortia’ of partners. Together, we intend to securely issue compliance credentials across a decentralized finance network, modernizing the existing process. We are excited to grow these capabilities with partners in expanding a robust, globally transportable KYC/KYB verifiable credential that streamlines essential compliance processes and brings needed privacy controls and efficiencies to client onboarding and engagement in both traditional and decentralized financial services.”</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Book a chat</a> with our joint representative Alex now to create a seamless client onboarding and engagement experience while enjoying the pros of reduced cost for your organisation.</p> A feature-rich solution that meets global standards <p>As a full end-to-end solution, FinClusive integrated with cheqd and Verida can offer the following capabilities for achieving the first regulatory compliant process for verifiable KYC sharing and reliance:</p>  Identity verification: FinClusive currently supports identity verification coverage in over 170 countries.  Digital credential issuance: Through cheqd’s <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/identity/credential-service/get-started">Credential Service</a> we can issue reusable and verifiable digital credentials based on the results of these identity verification checks — for both individuals and entities (including their beneficial owners and control persons).  Credential storage and backup: Users can securely store their KYC/KYB credential in their <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Vault</a>, backed up on the decentralized <a href="http://verida.network">Verida storage&nbsp;network</a>.  Endpoints for applications and services: Applications and services can request access to this KYC credential, validating users without requiring them to repeat the KYC, creating a seamless user experience, and a value-added identity asset for clients as they engage more services from their providers and work to enable cross-services and open banking opportunities.  Real-time suspension and revocation checks: Using cheqd’s decentralized infrastructure, we provide instantaneous lookups for AML screenings and other background checks. Combined with automated ongoing client monitoring from FinClusive, credentials can be issued, managed, shared, verified, revoked as necessary in keeping with a client’s status at any given time. Further, multiple credentials can be issued and monitored in keeping with a client’s risk profile or a service provider’s risk appetite.  <p>All of these capabilities solve pain points for both traditional bank and nonbank financial institutions as well as decentralized and web-native services providers. Moreover, they facilitate a full end-to-end compliance solution while also giving customers “self-sovereign” control of their own KYC/KYB data. Not only does this have benefits in terms of data reusability, costs and data efficiency, as illustrated above, but it also meets existing and upcoming best practices for data protection requirements and eID, including:</p>  GDPR and CCPA: Achieving data minimisation and providing data subjects their rights by&nbsp;default  eIDAS: Meeting emerging European eIDAS 2.0 standards and digital credential requirements for service providers, which will set a global benchmark.  <p>In combination, this solution modernizes existing processes for both web2 and web3 regulated industries. Customers no longer need to go through a KYC process multiple times for each service they onboard to, and can be verified near instantaneously, while assuring the requisite privacy protections of their personal and financial information, which traditionally is disclosed by and between verifying institutions. This creates a more efficient market for identity verification and reduces the replication and storage of sensitive personal identification documents, while providing client control of their sensitive data and embedding the necessary protections for financial system integrity.</p> A first-of-its-kind differentiator for regulated industries <p>For most regulated industries, such as financial services, companies are obligated to put in place AML and KYC/KYB controls for their customers. However, many service providers are unaware of their obligations to conduct essential KYC/KYB beyond initial onboarding.</p><p>These extra obligations include ongoing client monitoring, dynamic risk scoring and continuous AML screening checks — required to meet various regulations across jurisdictions.</p><p>These post-onboarding obligations are vital because when sharing KYC data between two organisations, the relying party may also require “real-time” data on the client to satisfy a requisite level of assurance, minimize their counterparty risk, and to meet regulatory requirements.</p><p>Our combined solution provides such needed modernization across:</p>  Client onboarding;  Ongoing monitoring and essential compliance for regulated service providers;  Real-time compliance checks for relying&nbsp;parties.  <p>For client onboarding, our solution automates and fully digitizes the onboarding experience using digital credentials issued upon successful KYC to a users’ wallet (with FinClusive and cheqd facilitating the issuance and Verida providing the wallet and storage capabilities for the&nbsp;user).</p><p>For regulated entities and financial services, our solution automates client monitoring for dynamic risk scoring by ‘embedding’ monitoring and screening controls into an easy-to-use dashboard (using FinClusive’s existing compliance suite and tooling).</p><p>For relying parties, our solution provides real-time verification of the KYC credential AND a live “double check” of the data, feeding from on-going monitoring of the client data happening in the background (using cheqd’s decentralised and privacy-preserving status list infrastructure, in conjunction with FinClusive’s compliance suite).</p><p>“This collaboration has allowed us to innovate with real-time monitoring and verification checks in a fully decentralized and privacy preserving format. This is completely new to the market and enables us to provide a fully regulatory compliant solution for customer onboarding and monitoring, while simultaneously being future proofed for the new eIDAS 2.0 regulation for digital credentials. This can revolutionise the existing paradigm for customer data sharing, reducing costs and friction within existing regulated industries and emerging markets where identity verification is currently too costly” says Alex Tweeddale, Product Lead at&nbsp;cheqd.</p><p>Using the existing infrastructure with FinClusive, cheqd and Verida, this verifiable KYC/KYB solution can be used across various use&nbsp;cases:</p>  Financial Services: Onboarding at any bank or nonbank financial service, lowering costs and friction. Sharing reusable and trusted data between financial services, while meeting counterparty risk and compliance requirements.  Web 3.0: Reusing “Web 2.0” KYC and ongoing monitoring compliance processes to onboard to regulated Virtual Asset Service Providers at low cost and with increased efficiency  eCommerce and Online Retailers: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to purchase goods online, reducing the risk of fraud and phishing.  Age Restrictions: Reusing verifiable KYC/KYB to access age restricted content, such as alcohol, gambling or gaming — meeting upcoming compliance requirements for&nbsp;vendors.  Government Services: Government agencies can use reusable KYC/KYB to streamline processes for citizens accessing various public services, reducing the administrative burden on both the government and citizens.  Cross-Border Transactions: Reusable KYC/KYB can be beneficial in cross-border transactions and international business dealings, where having a standardized and recognized identity verification process can facilitate smoother collaborations.  Others: Combining KYC/KYB credentials with other credentials (e.g. employment, accomplishments, loyalty, heath) to build higher levels of assurance and digital reputation.  <p><a href="https://calendly.com/alex-tweeddale">Schedule a meeting</a> with our joint representative Alex to become a pioneer in your industry by offering a fully decentralised and privacy preserving way to verify reusable KYC/KYB credentials.</p> A truly global collaboration <p>“We are thrilled to have successfully integrated the cheqd network into the Verida Wallet and work closely with the Finclusive team to provide a seamless user experience to end users to receive, store and share their reusable Finclusive credentials. This successful proof of concept is a showcase of what industry standard best practice looks like for regulatory compliant credential activities, while also demonstrating a more streamlined and efficient model for the traditional finance sector. We are incredibly excited to continue working with FinClusive and cheqd to roll this technology out across the wide range of global use cases.” says Chris Were, CEO at&nbsp;<a href="http://Verida.io">Verida</a>.</p><p>Verida, based in Australia, provides a mobile wallet used by a Holder to receive, store and present their VCs.

<p>One of the biggest security weak points for organizations involves their <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/authentication">authentication</a> processes. According to <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/gcat_threathorizons_full_jul2023.pdf">Google Cloud’s 2023 Threat Horizons Report</a>, 86% of breaches involve stolen credentials. Our own research found that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-state-of-passwordless">60% of organizations reported authentication-related breaches</a> in the past year. Context-based authentication offers an important tool in the battle against credential stuffing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>, MFA prompt bombing, and other attacks on authentication systems.</p>  
<p>Also referred to as <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-adaptive-authentication">adaptive authentication</a> or <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/risk-based-authentication">risk-based authentication</a>, context-based authentication layers on dynamic security controls that use contextual signals and other indicators of risk to make access decisions. When used in conjunction with secure passwordless authentication, it helps better protect your resources while providing better employee and customer login experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Context-Based Authentication?  
<p>Context-based authentication goes beyond traditional methods by controlling access and user authentication flows based on dynamic risk calculations. It analyzes information such as user behavior, device signals, and risk signals from other security tools to dictate access policies. This is a departure from traditional authentication, which relies solely on presenting the correct credentials. Based on this risk information it may, for example, prompt users for an additional authentication factor, require them to re-affirm their identity through a proofing process, or block access altogether. Incorporating context and eliminating insecure passwords from the authentication process significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, thereby lowering the chances of a potential data breach.</p> 
<p>In its simplest terms, context-based authentication involves two parts:</p> 
  
  Establishing a baseline: In order to determine what behavior and scenarios are suspicious, the systems must first establish a baseline for each user that defines what is normal.  
  Responding to anomalies: Once a baseline is set, the context-based authentication system evaluates each login attempt against this norm. It actively scans for potential anomalies, such as login attempts originating from unusual geographic locations or suspicious VPNs, during periods of user inactivity, if the device is rooted or jailbroken, and other factors that indicate a higher risk. It also takes into account the type of access requested — for example a high-risk transaction. If elevated risk levels are detected, the system triggers additional authentication factors or verification steps.  
  
 Key Components of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Any context-based authentication system contains these basic components, although they will vary in both how they are constructed and how they get used. The best context-based authentication processes assess multiple layers and signals in order to effectively optimize for both security and user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Risk Engine  
<p>The heart of context-based authentication is the risk engine. The risk engine continuously collects and analyzes data to determine the risk level associated with each user access request. Modern authentication risk engines use machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence to detect malicious behaviors and threats in real time. The broader and more varied the information sources and risk signals, the more accurate and effective the risk engine.</p> 
 Context Sources  
<p>As mentioned, the effectiveness of the risk engine fully depends on its data sources. Sources include things such as device health posture, mobile, web and browser contextual signals, real-time events, user behavior and access patterns. Ideally, your sources also include risk data from EDR systems and other cybersecurity tools deployed in your organization.</p> 
 Action Orchestration  
<p>Real-time risk information holds little value if it cannot also be actioned upon in real time. Context-based authentication systems use the risk insight to enforce access policies. This can range from simply denying access, to requiring additional authentication steps, to requiring the person to prove that they are the person they claim to be using identity verification technologies.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Benefits of Context-Based Authentication  
<p>Context-based authentication provides multiple advantages for organizations.:</p> 
  
  Prevents attacks: Context-based authentication operates as a continuous gatekeeper, actively scanning for anomalies and high-risk activities. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized access attempts and significantly reduces the risk of successful attacks, protecting sensitive data and fortifying the organization's security posture against evolving threats.  
  Improves User Experience (UX): By leveraging contextual cues to streamline access, it ensures that legitimate users can navigate seamlessly through the authentication process. This not only enhances overall user satisfaction but also minimizes friction, making security measures more user-friendly without compromising on protection.  
  Ensures Regulatory Compliance: Context-based authentication allows organizations to continuously assess identity threats and mitigate risks as required by NIST, ISO, HIPAA, GDPR and other regulations. It also can ensure only authorized users access sensitive information in accordance with requirements underPCI, FISMA, FRCP and HITECH.  
  Enables Zero Trust Architecture: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/risk-based-authentication-essential-to-zero-trust">Context-based authentication aligns with Zero Trust</a> “never trust, always verify” principles. It assumes that no user or system is inherently trustworthy, requiring continuous and ongoing verification. When used in conjunction with phishing-resistant AAL3-compliant authentication methods, it provides a strong foundation for building a Zero Trust architecture.  
  
 Implement Context-Based Authentication With HYPR Adapt  
<p>Context-based authentication employs risk-based analysis to determine and adjust authentication security controls in real time. The level of security it delivers depends on multiple factors including the sophistication of the risk engine, the breadth and depth of contextual information it uses, and the range of security controls it can affect.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> leverages a cutting-edge identity risk engine for real-time threat assessment, dynamically adapting security policies to deliver a personalized yet secure authentication experience. HYPR Adapt operates in tandem with HYPR's industry-leading, FIDO-based passwordless MFA solution, delivering a powerful <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-power-of-risk-based-authentication-with-hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> solution that tailors workflows to each user's context, effectively mitigating risks.

 FAQs  
<p>Q: What is context-based authentication?</p> 
<p>A: Context-based authentication utilizes risk-based analysis to determine the appropriate authentication level, adjusting security measures based on real-time user actions and threat assessments.</p> 
<p>Q: How does context-based authentication enhance security?</p> 
<p>A: Context-based authentication enhances security by dynamically adapting to changing risk levels, providing a personalized authentication experience tailored to each user's unique context, thereby effectively mitigating potential risks.</p> 
<p>Q: What are some real-world scenarios for using context-based authentication?</p> 
<p>A: Adapting authentication flows to contextual information becomes especially crucial in situations such as remote worker access, to evaluate and act on indicators of elevated risk. Another important scenario is to add extra levels of security on financial transactions, such as transferring or withdrawing funds.</p>

  <p>Today, I’m excited to share with you several new developments in the journey towards phishing-resistant authentication for all users!&nbsp; This isn’t just essential for compliance with <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order&nbsp;14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</a> but is increasingly critical for the safety of all the orgs and users who bet on digital identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR? Here’s the cheat sheet!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Authenticator announces phishing-resistant passkey support. 
 More configuration options for PIV/CAC authentication. 
 FIDO2 support for iOS and MacOS applications. 
 Managed policies help you with “secure by design, secure by default.” 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Authenticator is becoming phishing-resistant! 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/identity-at-microsoft-ignite-securing-access-in-the-era-of-ai/ba-p/2747279">announced</a> at Ignite 2023, in the first half of 2024, Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to register and sign in with device-bound passkeys managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app. This is a cost-effective, phishing-resistant credential available to anyone with the Authenticator app! Passkeys provide you with the latest and greatest security enhancements that will come to the FIDO standard over the next many years – and Authenticator integration lets you take advantage of the security innovations and advanced features Authenticator provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Passkey managed in the Microsoft Authenticator app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: In new updates from the previous version of this blogpost: Microsoft Authenticator is not yet FIPS 140 compliant on Android. Microsoft Authenticator on Android is currently pending FIPS compliance certification to support our customers that may require FIPS validated cryptography.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS is already FIPS-140 compliant, as announced in December of 2022. Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app#fips-140-compliant-for-microsoft-entra-authentication">FIPS 140 complaint for the Microsoft Authenticator app.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Improved configurability for organizations that uses PIV / CAC 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last year since we announced the General Availability of Certificate-based Authentication (CBA), we’ve seen an increase of over 850% in Entra ID CBA usage for US Government customers. CBA helps our customers in their Zero Trust journey, migrating from on-premises IdPs such as AD FS, while continuing to provide familiar end user experience using PIV / CAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We continue our investments in cloud-based CBA with recently added capabilities that allow you to tailor authentication policies by certificate and resource type, as well as user group. You can now select certificate strength for different users, use CBA with other methods for multifactor or step-up authentication, and set high affinity (strong) binding for either the entire tenant or by user group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Additional phishing-resistant authentication options for mobile: FIDO2 support for iOS and macOS applications 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the summer of 2023, we announced support for <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/advancing-modern-strong-authentication/ba-p/3773135">FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS web browsers</a>. Today, we’re excited to announce the public preview of FIDO2 authentication on iOS and macOS . With this release, users who have Microsoft Authenticator installed on iOS or Microsoft Intune Company Portal installed on macOS can sign into Microsoft applications using a FIDO2 security key. This feature is available now on iOS and will be available early next year on macOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO2 authentication is also available in MSAL-enabled third-party apps on iOS and macOS that meet the requirements listed in <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/support-fido2-authentication">Support passwordless authentication with FIDO2 keys in apps you develop</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about the supported platforms <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/fido2-compatibility">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Adopting secure defaults, aligned with “Secure by design, secure by default” approach outlined by CISA 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>. As part of this initiative, we will start <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/?p=132044">Auto-rollout of Conditional Access policies</a>. These initiatives align with the “Secure by design, Secure by default” approach called out by The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), to ensure consumers can trust the safety and integrity of the technology that they use every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that tackling cybersecurity challenges is a collective effort. We're dedicated to collaborating closely with government agencies, security experts, and the broader community to strengthen our collective defenses against cyber threats. Our aim is to provide government customers with the tools and knowledge they need to stay ahead of evolving risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent releases and ongoing commitment to enhancing cybersecurity will support our broad set of customers, including the U.S. government customers who are working to meet the Executive Order. Together, we can build a more secure digital future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

In an era dominated by digital interactions, online connectivity, and ecommerce, Data Privacy Week is the perfect time to reflect on such an important topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2023, Ping Identity conducted an important consumer survey titled <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">Brand Loyalty In the Age of the Digital Economy</a>. One of the most startling findings from this survey is that only 10% of respondents trust the organizations that manage their data. While Ping is proud to offer solutions to data privacy problems with innovations like decentralized identity, we also want to spread the message about ethical data practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With digital transformation now touching every corner of the world, the responsibility to safeguard user data is paramount. As such, Ping Identity is thrilled to observe Data Privacy Week in 2024 with the global IT community.</p>

 How inclusive are your services? We explore how video verification can help give your company a competitive edge. 



 



<p>Inclusiveness escaped mere buzzword status and took some significant steps into the mainstream in 2023. This year, it’s sure to become an even more important competitive differentiator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Being able to offer a truly inclusive workplace; one that is respectful of a team’s differences, whether that be gender, race, sexuality, or disability is a non-negotiable for the modern workforce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture has been shown to create multiple benefits, including:</p>



  Bigger talent pools<br>  More ‘heard’ and satisfied staff<br>  Better reputation among peers<br>  <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/why-diversity-matters">Optimal business performance</a><br>  Improved understanding of customers  



<p>But, what about a company’s actual customers? Besides the carefully crafted core values, and specific selection of stock photographs on a company’s website, how accessible are their products? How easy do organizations make it for customers to register, to use, and to integrate their services into their daily lives?</p>



 Accessibility for all. 



<p>With over <a href="https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-genders-list/">80 different cultural descriptions of gender</a>, amid growing sentiment that people should be able to self-identify, the challenge to offer fully inclusive identity verification has become increasingly complicated. Nobody should be denied access to online products; whether that’s opening bank accounts, renting scooters, or any other service that requires users to verify their identity.</p>



<p>There are many factors that can lead to inequality and a lack of inclusiveness in identity verification. For example, deeply entrenched racial bias has been discovered in many AI-based identity verification systems. Facial recognition software, in particular, has a long history of failing to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">recognize certain ethnicities.</a> Other incidents of racial bias include black applicants receiving a disproportionate percentage of rejections via an AI-based applicant screening process. In 2022, the UK data watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) began a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/14/uk-data-watchdog-investigates-whether-ai-systems-show-racial-bias">three-year study</a> into ‘AI-driven discrimination’ by analyzing the effects of using algorithms to sift through job applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of AI has also revealed a worrying trend to discriminate against women by, for example, continuing to use gendered terms like policeman or fireman in text creation. In AI-prompt video generation, traditionally female roles, like carers, are <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/sponsored/4148316/gender-biased-ai-sending-us">still depicted by females</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There has also been evidence of <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/4-ways-to-address-gender-bias-in-ai">higher gender identification error rates among female subjects</a> by AI-enabled computer vision systems.</p>



 Fighting bias, one face at a time. 



<p>In a bid to break down the barriers of bias, IDnow is collaborating with 12 European partners, including academic institutions, associations and private companies, as part of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ai-bias-facial-verification/">MAMMOth project.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Funded by the European Research Executive Agency, the goal of the project is to study existing biases and offer a toolkit for AI engineers, developers and data scientists so that they may better identify and mitigate biases in datasets and algorithm outputs.</p>



 Great UX for all users. 



<p>Additional factors such as age, disability, and neurodiversity are other areas that pose usability and inclusivity challenges, as is low proficiency in technology, or poor internet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is also the issue of those who do not have identity documents. Populations without paper or photo ID face an uphill struggle to verify themselves digitally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lack of identification has always been a barrier to economic and social inclusion, and in the digital age, without access to digital IDs and digital verification solutions, this is still the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Approximately <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/articles/women-in-identity-launch-code-of-conduct-project-challenging-digital-identity-teams-to-create-more-inclusive-solutions">one in four people</a> in the UK do not have traditional identity verification, yet smartphone ownership is on a steady march to capacity.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>As we prepare for the European Identity and Cloud Conference 2024, it is crucial to recognize the pivotal role that regulation and policies play in shaping a secure and trustworthy digital identity landscape. These frameworks provide the necessary guidelines for developing and implementing digital identity solutions that respect individual privacy, promote data protection, and foster innovation within the sector.</p>
<p>Balancing innovation, security, privacy, and user empowerment</p>
<p>The insights and expertise shared by the four esteemed speakers below will undoubtedly contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between regulation and policies in shaping the digital identity landscape. As we navigate the evolving digital identity landscape, it is imperative to strike a balance between innovation, security, privacy, and user empowerment. By embracing a holistic and well-regulated approach, we can ensure that digital identities serve as instruments of empowerment and trust, enabling individuals to participate fully in the digital world of the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a> is a prominent figure in the digital identity field, with extensive experience in industry standards development, policy formulation, and technology evangelism.

At EIC 2024, she will share insights into public approaches to regulating digital identity, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between government, industry, and civil society organizations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a>, a Senior Policy Officer at the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, is a seasoned expert in the digital identity realm. With a remarkable career spanning policy development, regulatory implementation, and technological advancements, Rob has played a pivotal role in shaping the Dutch policy framework for eIDAS Trust Services. He is also actively involved in international initiatives, representing the Dutch Government in the EWC and POTENTIAL consortia.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moritz Heuberger</a> holds a key position in the German government's efforts to advance digital identity initiatives.

In addition, he serves as the technical coordinator and leads the German working group in the LSP consortium POTENTIAL, a collaboration dedicated to fostering innovation in digital identity solutions across Europe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a> is the Head of the office of a Member of the European Parliament and a policy adviser in the European Parliament.

 The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI. Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI? <blockquote>TLDR: The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote><p>This blog is the first part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?  Part 2: What exactly is KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  Part 3: How do you use KERI? (Coming&nbsp;soon)  Deep Thought, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (2005&nbsp;film).<p>In Douglas Adams’ science fiction series “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” a supercomputer named Deep Thought took over 7.5 million years to calculate the “Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything” and humorously gave out the number&nbsp;“42”.</p><p>Without Deep Thought (or even ChatGPT) and million years of computation, we may answer a slightly different question:</p><blockquote>What is currently the best technology for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Decentralized Identifier (DID), and Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)?</blockquote><p>This guide argues that the answer to this not-so-ultimate question is Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI).</p> KERI Why/What/How <p>Since its invention in 2019, KERI has been one of the most misunderstood technologies and concepts in the SSI space, given its technical complexity and seemingly steep learning curve. As an attempt to demystify KERI, here, this three-part series will answer three simple Why, What, and How questions, as&nbsp;follows:</p>Adapted from “The Golden Circle” in “Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action” by Simon Sinek&nbsp;(2009).<p>Part 1 starts with the Why question. The following sections outline the evolution of digital identity systems from a centralized to a decentralized model. We will delve into the reason why blockchain is not a necessary component for building a decentralized identity system and put forth an argument as to why a KERI-based model is a better alternative and is potentially a candidate for the next generation of digital identity&nbsp;systems.</p>The evolution of digital identity. Centralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_identity">Digital identity</a> is defined as the information utilized by computers to represent external entities, including a person, organization, application, or device. Hence, digital identity has been around since the early days of the Internet when a computer system needed to know with whom or things it interacted.</p><p>Dated back to the 1960s and 1970s, the earliest form of digital identity was the use of usernames and passwords that allow multiple users to access shared computer resources and online services. These systems independently and centrally manage their interactions, resulting in a model known as Centralized Digital Identity. Nowadays, centralized digital identity has evolved into Federated Digital Identity in the 2000s where digital identities used by multiple computer systems are federated to a single trusted centralized entity, called an Identity Provider (IdP). Despite their prevalence, there are two major concerns with the centralized identity&nbsp;model:</p>  Single Point of Failure: A centralized identity system relies on a single centralized entity. If the central entity is compromised, all associated systems and services also become vulnerable.  Privacy Concern: IdPs with large user bases, like Google and Facebook, can collect a vast amount of user data, tracking all aspects of the users’ digital lives. These IdP platforms may monetize these data as well as abuse it, e.g., influencing the geopolitical opinions of the&nbsp;public.   Blockchain-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Decentralized Digital Identity—also known as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)—promises to give “control” back to the users from the centralized platforms—enhancing trust while preserving individual privacy. Seminal works that lay the foundation include The <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Laws of Identity</a> (2005) by Kim Cameron and <a href="https://www.lifewithalacrity.com/article/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity/">The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (2016) by Christopher Allen.</p><blockquote>Note: The terms “Decentralized Digital Identity” and “SSI” are often used interchangeably. However, SSI is more commonly used to describe the principles and community while Decentralized Digital Identity is more commonly used to describe the technology based on the principles of this movement.</blockquote><p>By 2015, the rise of blockchain technology started to capture the attention of the digital identity community, and several sessions on “blockchain identity” were hosted during the Spring 2015 <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> (IIW). A seminal paper on “Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI)” by C. Allen, et al. was also published in the same&nbsp;year.</p><blockquote>“The goal of DPKI is to ensure that, unlike PKIX, no single third party can compromise the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Trust is decentralized through the use of technologies that make it possible for geographically and politically disparate entities to reach consensus on the state of a shared database.” — <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot1-sf/blob/master/final-documents/dpki.pdf">Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure</a>, C. Allen, et al., Rebooting the Web of Trust I&nbsp;(2015).</blockquote><blockquote>Note: PKIX stands for Public Key Infrastructure that is based on X.509 certificates.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: Here, we specifically refer to the term “blockchain” as a “distributed-consensus ledger with a global ordering of records”. This is because the term “blockchain” is sometimes used to refer to a hash-chained verifiable data structure.</blockquote><p>The development of blockchain-based digital identity kickstarted the SSI revolution and resulted in multiple communities of practitioners including the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> in 2017 and the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP Foundation</a> in 2020 as well as multiple standards including <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a>.</p><p>Over the years, the popularity of blockchain has made the term “decentralization” synonymous with the term “blockchain” to the public. Unfortunately, this gave a false impression to many people that any decentralized system requires the use of blockchain technology. For example, the Internet Protocol (IP)—which was invented in the 1970s and predates the invention of blockchain—is also decentralized since there is no single entity controlling the global Internet&nbsp;network.</p><p>Blockchain indeed possesses multiple properties that make it suitable for decentralized digital identity systems, including security, availability, programmability, transparency, etc. However, blockchain is not a silver bullet without any drawbacks and is simply one implementation of decentralized systems among many. For example, one of the most common drawbacks of blockchain is its scalability due to the unsolvable problem known as the blockchain trilemma.</p><p>While you can certainly build a decentralized identity system using blockchain, it turns out you don’t have to. The following sections give a detailed reason for why this is the&nbsp;case.</p> Double Spending&nbsp;Proof <p>In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin whitepaper</a>. At its core, Bitcoin solves the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending">double-spending problem</a> in a decentralized manner using a distributed consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW). Later iterations of blockchain technology proposed other consensus mechanisms such as Poof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA).</p><blockquote>Note: The double-spending problem is a problem in a cryptocurrency system where the same single digital token can be spent more than&nbsp;once.</blockquote><p>In essence, blockchains address the double-spending problem by establishing a network of validators, which are distributed geographically and are not controlled by a single entity. These validators collectively maintain a shared ledger with a total ordering of transactional records. Updates to this shared ledger occur through a consensus mechanism agreed upon by the validators.</p><blockquote>Note: In distributed systems, a “total order” refers to a consistent and agreed-upon sequence or ranking of all events or transactions in a system. In a total order, every pair of events can be compared, and it is clear which one occurred before the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>While double-spending is a fundamental problem in a cryptocurrency system, it does not generally apply to an identity system. In a cryptocurrency system, if Alice transfers the same amount of money to Bob twice, Alice is twice as poor, and Bob is twice as rich. On the other hand, if Alice performs identical authorization operations on Bob repeatedly, their internal states may be affected by only the first operation and remain unaffected by all subsequent operations.</p>The necessity of double-spending proof for a cryptocurrency system vs. an identity&nbsp;system.<blockquote>Note: This is the property called idempotence. It is defined as follows: “An operation is idempotent if it can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.”</blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency operations are not idempotent and require double-spending proof property. On the other hand, most operations in identity systems are idempotent. This can be summarized below:</p><blockquote>“An identity system does not need to provide double-spending proof of an account balance. It merely needs to provide consistency.”</blockquote> Bypassing the blockchain trilemma <p>The blockchain trilemma is a well-known fundamental problem in blockchain technology, which is widely believed to be unsolvable. It highlights an inherent trade-off among decentralization, security, and scalability in blockchain systems. Implementations of blockchain—including blockchain-based identity systems—cannot simultaneously achieve high levels of all three components. Any attempt to improve one aspect always comes at the expense of the&nbsp;others.</p><p>A good example is Bitcoin itself, which is extremely secure and decentralized while having poor scalability. Another good example is the Terra blockchain which was designed to be highly scalable at the cost of security, leading to its collapse in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The root cause of the blockchain trilemma is the fact that a blockchain network fundamentally consists of validators that must come to a consensus to make an update to a shared totally ordered ledger. Such a consensus mechanism is an essential component in a cryptocurrency system where double-spending proof is a critical property.</p><p>As outlined in the previous section, as a double-spending proof is not a necessary property for an identity system, a consensus mechanism is thus not a required component. Hence, the blockchain trilemma can be entirely bypassed—not solved—for a decentralized identity system by giving up the double-spending-proof property.</p><p>As it turns out, a means for building such a decentralized identity system already exists, and it is known as&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI-based Decentralized Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In a nutshell, <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a> is a decentralized protocol for the management of persistent self-certifying identifiers.</p><blockquote>While blockchain was initially invented for the construction of a cryptocurrency system, the KERI protocol was specifically designed for building a decentralized digital identity&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>While, we will discuss in detail what KERI exactly is in the next part of this series, here are a few reasons why you should adopt&nbsp;KERI.</p> KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain <p>One of the most common problems with blockchain-based identity systems is their scalability. For example, Hyperledger Indy—one of the most popular blockchain protocols for decentralized identity—<a href="https://github.com/lissi-id/acapy-load-test-results/blob/main/AcaPy_0-7-4/Endurance_Test/04-0_7_3_indy-200rpm/report-test-results-0-END.pdf">takes around 4 hours to issue 18,000 credentials</a>, as discussed in detail by Kaliya Young in her blog “<a href="https://identitywoman.net/being-real-about-hyperledger-indy-aries-anoncreds/">Being “Real” about Hyperledger Indy &amp; Aries / Anoncreds</a>”.</p><p>In short, blockchain is slow, and one can only make it faster by reducing security and/or decentralization due to the blockchain trilemma. This is not at all the case for&nbsp;KERI:</p><blockquote>The KERI protocol does not have a distributed consensus mechanism and is not subject to the blockchain trilemma. KERI is designed to be scalable, secure, and decentralized — all three at the highest&nbsp;level.</blockquote><p>Since security and decentralization are often not a concern for most implementations of blockchain-based identity systems, the most important reason for adopting KERI is as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>KERI is a more scalable alternative to blockchain for building decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</blockquote> Other reasons to adopt&nbsp;KERI   KERI may leverage blockchain for discovery and verification. KERI’s ledger, called a key event log (KEL), may be embedded in an arbitrary blockchain network. As a result, KERI may leverage all the advantages of using blockchain — including availability, transparency, and programmability.  KERI is portable across blockchains. KERI does not ultimately rely on blockchain. Once a KERI-based identity system utilizes a blockchain network, it may switch to another blockchain network. This solves the ledger lock-in problem where a decentralized identifier is locked to a specific blockchain network.  KERI is recoverable from a quantum attack. If a quantum suddenly becomes available and is used to attack a KERI-based identity system, the KERI protocol has the means to recover control from the attacker via a mechanism called pre-rotation.  KERI supports the right to be forgotten. Transactions in blockchain are recorded in a shared totally ordered ledger, which makes it impossible to delete a transaction that contains personally identifiable information (PII). This is not a problem for KERI since KERI’s ledgers—i.e., KELs— are not&nbsp;shared.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

Trust registries can quickly become a powerful tool for the discovery of services, including digital credential exchange services.</p>
<p>There’s a common misconception that trust registries are only necessary once digital credentials become widely adopted. However, I think the reality is quite the opposite. Trust registries are not just supporting systems; they are enablers of digital credential adoption.</p>
<p>What is a Trust Registry? In simple terms: Some list of authoritative identifiers that are governed. In the context of digital credentials, when a person presents a credential from their digital identity wallet to a verifier, the verifier might question the legitimacy of the issuing entity behind the credential presented. This is where a trust registry becomes invaluable. It can provide verifiers with the information needed to confirm whether the issuer is authorized by a governing body, under a governance framework.</p>
<p>The Dual Role of Trust Registries. Trust registries serve a dual purpose. Yes, they can be used by entities, such as verifiers, seeking inputs to help them make trust decisions. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly to where we’re at in the adoption cycle of digital credentials: trust registries act as discovery mechanisms. For example, if I’m looking for an authorized auditor for a specific function, a verified auditors list in a trust registry can provide essential information to initiate contact and potentially help me form business connections.</p>
<p>In the digital trust context, this could lead to forming direct connections or requesting credentials to further business processes. Therefore, trust registries are not only useful for making trust decisions during credential exchanges but also serve as powerful tools for decision-making prior to any credential exchange, acting as a strong discovery mechanism.</p>
<p>Investing in trust registries is crucial for the broader adoption of digital credentials – that’s why we’re spending a lot of time at Northern Block building foundational infrastructure for trust registries. They provide the necessary infrastructure for trust decisions and discovery, facilitating smoother and more reliable digital interactions in various business contexts.</p>

<p>The age old method of keeping track of who has access to different applications is typically a spreadsheet. People on the left, and apps on the top. A new person comes or goes, and you update the spreadsheet. Easy enough, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except that your head of engineering gave Jira access to someone and forgot to tell you.</p>
<p>And then there was that time that you were on vacation and didn’t get to personally handle offboarding, so who knows what did or didn’t get deprovisioned. Oh, and of course, there’s that one contractor who just needs access to a few things — wait, are they still doing work for you?</p>
<p>Suddenly what you’re calling access management doesn’t feel reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2024, it’s time to ditch the spreadsheet in favor of technology that makes your life simpler. Today, we’re excited to introduce Access Grid for YeshID, the only identity and access management platform purpose-built for companies running in Google Workspace.</p>
<p>Access Grid might look like what you’re used to, but it’s much more powerful and easier to maintain. By reducing the orchestration of access management, we make it easier to be efficient and compliant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three reasons to ditch your spreadsheet this year.</p>
 
  A spreadsheet is static. 
 
<p>Your spreadsheet is just that — a spreadsheet. It’s simply a list you have to maintain. Your spreadsheet doesn’t automatically send an email or remind someone of a provisioning task.&nbsp; Updating a field in Access Grid, on the other hand, kicks off a workflow, allowing you to track access as it’s being granted or revoked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you check a box to indicate that a user should have access to an app, a task is automatically created and assigned to the administrator of the app. Access Grid shows a grayed box, indicating that it’s still to be provisioned. Once the administrator confirms that they’ve granted access, Access Grid is automatically updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is manual. 
 
<p>Unlike with your spreadsheet, Access Grid has the ability to automatically identify <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshid-integrations-an-easier-way-to-manage-app-access-for-smbs/">users for commonly used applications</a> that YeshID is integrated with. That means you don’t have to manually input who has access to your organization’s instances of Slack, Notion, and Hubspot. Depending on the size of your organization, this can save tons of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
  A spreadsheet is “all you.” 
 
<p>Access Grid’s centralized workflow makes your spreadsheet a living access table — and that means it’s not solely on you to ensure it’s always current. Once you kick off that workflow, you can set, forget, and let Access Grid handle the rest. By automating requests to your internal application owners, you can take yourself out of being the middleman.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Ditch your access management spreadsheet 
<p>The spreadsheet method had its day, but you can see how it might prevent SMBs from leveling up and even unintentionally add operational, technical, and security debt to take care of later. What’s more, access management isn’t just about ensuring internal accuracy. It presents a <a href="https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2">security and compliance risk</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re ready to ditch the spreadsheet for a more <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/what-to-look-for-in-an-employee-onboarding-tool-for-small-businesses/">streamlined way to onboard/offboard</a> and a more secure way to manage app access, look no further. YeshID is <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-new-era-of-secure-it-identity-management-yeshid-soc-ii-and-you/">SOC II compliant</a>, in the <a href="https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/yeshid_onboard/456377342688">Google Workspace Marketplace</a>, and has a big ol’ DELETE button if you decide it’s not for you. <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">Learn more</a>!&nbsp;</p>

 Stakers can claim DF72 rewards. DF73 runs Jan 18 — Jan 25,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 72 (DF72) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 11, 2024 and ended 12:01am Jan 18. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF73 is live today, Jan 18. It concludes on Jan 25. 150K OCEAN and 20k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF73   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF73 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  Read how to optimize Predictoor rewards&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/rewards-mechanisms-of-ocean-predictoor-6f76c942baf7?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">here</a>.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Identity forms the foundation of the modern workplace. Nearly every task depends on the ability to securely access systems using valid digital credentials linked to verified employees. Identity and access management (IAM) must constantly balance between security on one hand, and convenience and productivity on the other.</p>  
<p>The increasing interconnectedness and decentralization of systems, together with the surge in digital identities, are placing tremendous strain on these IAM processes, and attackers have been quick to take advantage. The past year saw regular reports of identity-related breaches, with increasingly severe consequences. Take the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">2023 hack of MGM Resorts</a> — their systems were down for ten days after hackers impersonated an employee and tricked service desk personnel into granting them access.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In order to better understand what we can expect in 2024, the research team at Vanson Bourne surveyed IAM security leaders across the United States about the current <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> practices and pain points in their organization.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Security Trends: Key Findings  
 Identity Challenges Abound  
<p>Our research shows that all organizations still struggle when it comes to securing their workers’ identities. The top pain point, cited by 40%, is employee <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a>/verification. Many organizations use a series of manual processes that are disconnected from their primary identity systems. Authentication comes in at a close second challenge, with 37% admitting that their authentication processes are vulnerable to phishing and credential attacks. Other top challenges include implementing continuous risk assessment and reducing authentication application sprawl, both named by 35% of organizations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Organizations Contend With Frequent Identity Risks  
<p>The findings show that employees engage in risky activities on a regular basis. Around seven in ten organizations (71%) report detecting risky user behavior or unexpected changes in the risk environment multiple times each week; nearly a quarter experience daily risks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Moreover, In all likelihood, these risk figures skew much higher. Organizations admit their visibility into identity risks remains incomplete. On average, they monitor fewer than half (49%) of their employees’ identities on a daily basis for risk or indications of compromise. This potentially leaves a large swath taking risky actions that go undetected.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Employee Identity Fraud: Organizations Find It Difficult To Verify Employees in Real Time  
<p>More than ⅔ of organizations spend over two hours performing <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification checks</a> when an employee needs to replace a device, when a risk is flagged by security systems or when employees change roles. In some cases the average time spent is much higher. For example it takes an average of 8.52 hours to verify identity when an employee changes roles.</p> 
<p></p> 
 Identity Fraud Is Rampant and Costly  
<p>The widespread reliance on insecure identity security solutions is leaving the door wide open to security threats, with undeniable consequences. Identity fraud is so prolific among organizations that over three quarters (77%) report falling victim multiple times within the last 12 months.</p> 
<p>Organizations are feeling the impact in their balance sheets. On average, identity fraud cost organizations an average of $4.33 million in the last 12 months.</p>

</h3>

   Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;

<p>Account takeover fraud (ATO) is a form of identity theft where fraudsters overtake an online account and pose as real users. Typical means for ATO include compromised credentials, session-hijacking, social engineering, and device takeover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, ecommerce sites are common targets for ATO fraudsters for a variety of reasons, including the fact that quite a lot of sensitive and financial data are stored there, and yet individual users may be less vigilant with their security than in some other verticals. Once bad actors gain access to an ecommerce account, they can make purchases with the card on file, but they can also view sensitive personal data such as credit card numbers, home addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses. Not only does this example show how an ecommerce platform can be damaged by ATO, but it also highlights how ATO is used for identity theft. Similarly, a bad actor may seek access to an online banking portal in order to transfer funds or to harvest enough PII to use elsewhere – for example, at another financial institution to apply for a loan under a stolen identity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ATO is a problem in most industries that do business online. The following industries are especially common targets for ATO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Financial services</p>
 
 <p>Online retail &amp; ecommerce</p>
 
 <p>Healthcare</p>
 
 <p>Social media</p>
 
 <p>Video streaming &amp; entertainment</p>
 
 <p>Online gaming</p>
 
 Utilities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common ATO Red Flags 
 &nbsp; 
 
 <p>Odd Login Behavior: Logins from new devices, new locations, new times, or anything outside of previous common behavior is considered a red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Large Number of Failed Login Attempts: When multiple login attempts occur in a short period of time, this may indicate a brute force attack, which involves repetitive attempts to “guess” a password based on minimal pieces of PII.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Login Spikes: Bots are commonly used to flood the system, similar to a brute force attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>Account Detail Changes: If there are changes to an account’s preferred email, phone number, or security/account recovery details, especially all at once, this can indicate an ATO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Suspicious Activity: High volumes of chargebacks or purchases from new locations should be considered suspicious.

				  2024 will be a huge year for verifiable data. As the industry continues to develop, our team wanted to call some interesting trends to your attention and put together some predictions for what we think will happen this year.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</p>
<p>AI technology exploded in 2023, with <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-ais-breakout-year">60% of organizations</a> reportedly using generative AI in some capacity. Two major categories of AI use cases are when an AI does things on a human’s behalf—such as an <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-trusted-copilot-using-decentralized-identity-to-manage-an-ai-virtual-assistant/">AI assistant</a>—and when a human uses a generative AI to create things—such as <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT</a>, which can create written documents or images. Our team believes that as AI grows in popularity, particularly in business deployments, the need for identity integrations for both of these categories will grow with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to acting as an assistant and doing things on a user’s behalf, AI will need to be able to prove that it is authorized by a human to act on their behalf. It’s very usefulness as an assistant&nbsp; is tied to whether you can trust it with your secure information. For example, an AI that you can ask to play music for you is useful — but an AI you can trust with your credit card and ask to buy groceries, pay a bill, or even book a vacation? That is what people will pay for. To achieve this level of trust in a robot will require more security than passwords have proven they can provide; it will need mutual authentication and verifiable identity from both the user and the AI.</p>
<p>Generative AI has already caused quite a stir, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2023/12/30/ai-generated-art-was-a-mistake-and-heres-why/?sh=cc26b683fef3">particularly from artists</a> whose work these platforms have been trained on. While the internet has always been somewhat murky on the origins of work, the ability to give a&nbsp; computer a series of prompts and some guidelines and have it generate a visually-believable image or a plausibly correct article creates a whole new level of skepticism. This problem can also be solved by using verifiable credentials at the point of creation to record a digital “signature” that will allow anyone to check with certainty where a piece originates from and if it has been altered since that creation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multi-Credential Systems</p>
<p>Recently, organizations have realized that there is no one “golden” credential type that fits every use case. In fact, our team has seen several platforms moving to support combinations of JSON-LD, SD-JWT, and AnonCred credentials as projects using multiple credential types gain traction. As ecosystems grow and begin to overlap, we will continue to see multiple credential types being used due to their unique benefits, not just due to competing ideas and organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials Will Be Folded into Existing Systems</p>
<p>Businesses have begun and will continue focusing on combining verifiable credentials with their existing systems, rather than approaching decentralized identity as an independent technology. Verifiable credentials almost always need to be paired with existing workflows to unlock the value of verified data — once you are certain of the data, then you need to do something with it. In addition, once you have established a trusted digital relationship using the inbuilt secure, bi-directional communication features, a series of other powerful use cases become possible. Some examples include mutually authenticated chat (confirm it’s a real Nigerian prince before you engage with him), faster, more secure interactions with organizations such as your bank, and a better way for employers to manage access for employees.</p>
<p>One real world application that Indicio has been working on in partnership with SITA and the Government of Aruba is verifiable credentials for travel. Using verifiable credentials as the underlying means of data transfer and authentication, travelers can store all the information they need to get through the airport quickly and efficiently, including their passports, VISAs, and boarding passes. Any of these credentials can be stored and verified with a single scan, resulting in a much faster experience at various touch points in a travel journey. And because these credentials draw on the information embedded in an official document, they eliminate the errors that inevitably occur when people are asked to fill in paper forms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While credentials are an integral part of the equation, many travelers will never think twice about them, and may not even realize they are using decentralized technology.&nbsp; We see this simplicity and speed driving adoption in many other industries, as they realize the time and cost savings to be gained.</p>
<p>Better Awareness of Full Ecosystems</p>
<p>Our team predicts that, as we move through 2024, more people will realize the idea of credential ecosystems as ways to unlock all the benefits&nbsp; of decentralized identity. Being able to verify the integrity of a credential is a huge step forward, but equally important is being able to verify the issuer. For example, if you have a digital driver’s license and you use it as proof of identity to take out a loan, the bank would need to trust that your driver’s license hasn’t been tampered with AND know which authority issued it. From there the bank can make the human decision of whether or not we trust that source. As we continue to build this technology, more people will realize that without a mechanism to decide if you can trust the issuer, a credential alone is insufficient</p>
<p>Organizations Will Learn That They Can Go to Production with What They Have Now</p>
<p>Many organizations have been hesitant to openly adopt this technology or go to market for a&nbsp; variety of reasons, including a feeling that the technology isn’t ready or complete and concerns about needing permission to proceed or authorization from central gatekeepers, such as governments or standards bodies. But this technology is ready right now, and is already in use today. It doesn’t require a huge lift and shift, can be rolled out at whatever scale comfortable with to start, and most importantly, it provides a better way for organizations to manage their tremendously valuable data and implement the governance of their ecosystems. In 2024 our team sees many realizing that they can move forward without the need to wait for others to solve root trust issues or grant them permission to manage their own ecosystem.</p>
<p>Overall 2024 will certainly be one to watch for decentralized identity!</p>

Instead, it leverages cryptographic techniques and private keys to ensure that users are who they say they are.</p>
<p>This approach fundamentally differs from traditional authentication systems. Unlike conventional password-based methods of authentication, where users must remember and input passwords, FIDO facilitates authentication by verifying the user’s device or biometrics.<br>
This ensures direct communication between the user’s mobile device, computer browser, and the server, minimizing the risk of phishing attacks and data security breaches.</p>
 
The Importance of Secure Authentication 
<p>Password-dependent authentication has long been a vulnerability relying solely on passwords for securing accounts, and sensitive data has led to a surge in cybersecurity incidents, including data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access, stolen credentials used to user’s identities elsewhere.<br>
By focusing on only secure authentication methods, the FIDO passwordless and universal authentication framework also emphasizes reducing password-associated risks.<br>
It addresses the vulnerabilities of username and password-dependent authentication methods alone, making it challenging for attackers to compromise the user’s computer accounts, thus fortifying online security.</p>
 
Overview of How FIDO Works 
<p>FIDO (Fast Identity Online) offers a revolutionary take on user authentication through the security keys and its nuanced, cryptographic approach, differing substantially from traditional password-based systems. Here’s a more in-depth technical breakdown of how FIDO operates:</p>
 
 Asymmetric Cryptography: FIDO relies on a pair of cryptographic keys — a public key registered with the online service and a private key securely stored on the user’s device. This pair is used to authenticate users securely. 
 Local Device Authentication: Before the cryptographic process begins, the user must unlock the local device through a secure action such as entering a PIN, using a fingerprint sensor, or leveraging facial recognition technologies. 
 Authentication Request and Response: When authentication is needed, the service challenges the user’s device. The device then responds using the private key to sign the challenge, which the service verifies using the public key. 
 User Verification and Key Pair Generation: During registration with an online service, the user’s device creates a new key pair on behalf of the user, keeping the private key securely on the device while registering the public key with the service. 
 Limited Reliance on Centralized Servers: The private keys never leave the user’s device, limiting centralized servers’ necessity and minimizing the attack surface. 
 
 What is the FIDO Alliance? 
<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/">FIDO Alliance</a> is a robust consortium of leading international companies and organizations dedicated to establishing and promoting authentication standards that reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords.<br>
Through a collaborative approach, the FIDO Alliance aims to create secure, user-friendly, and universally applicable authentication methods that seamlessly integrate across various online platforms and systems.<br>
Members of the FIDO Alliance contribute to the development, standardization, and widespread adoption of passwordless authentication practices. These contributors range from tech giants and financial institutions to government entities and other industry players, collectively driving innovation and fortifying global online security landscapes.<br>
The FIDO Alliance’s pioneering work nurtures a resilient digital ecosystem where businesses and users can interact confidently, benefiting from enhanced security and a simplified user experience.</p>
 
Advantages of Implementing FIDO Passwordless Authentication 
 
Enhancing User Experience 
<p>FIDO’s passwordless authentication significantly improves the user experience. Users find the authentication and registration process more convenient and less cumbersome without remembering and managing multiple passwords. This reduction in friction enhances user satisfaction and fosters a more streamlined and efficient user account and journey.<br>
Implementing FIDO’s username and passwordless approach simplifies the user’s interaction with digital platforms, security devices, and services, encouraging more frequent and confident use of online services. It marks a considerable step forward in creating an even online service environment where security and usability coalesce.</p>
 
Boosting Security Levels 
<p>One of the fundamental advantages of FIDO passwordless authentication lies in its enhanced security levels. Using cryptographic principles such as public key cryptography and private and public key two pairs, FIDO passwordless sign ensures that user credentials remain secure, minimizing the potential attack vectors typically associated with traditional password-based security usage.<br>
FIDO reduces the vulnerability of authentication processes by more user attempts and eliminating the dependence on passwords for user attempts. It mitigates common attack strategies like password cracking and phishing, contributing to a fortified security framework that confidently safeguards the user’s account data and privacy.</p>
 
Reducing Costs and Resources 
<p>The implementation of FIDO passwordless authentication can result in substantial savings for businesses. Reducing the reliance on passwords decreases the number of password reset requests and the associated administrative support, thus saving time and resources.<br>
Moreover, enhanced security mechanisms considerably reduce the risks and potential costs associated with data security breaches and cybersecurity incidents.<br>
In doing so, FIDO passwordless authentication presents itself as a cost-efficient alternative to password theft that optimizes user identity security and resource allocation.</p>

  <p>There’s a plethora of data connectors for Microsoft Sentinel, from Microsoft and Azure services to third party sources and custom logs. This data is only as good as the analytical value it brings. During investigations – both proactive and reactive – visualizing data in different formats offers value into finding anomalies, patterns, and insights difficult to spot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When working with data which includes geographic related information such as Microsoft Entra sign-in logs, visualizing the data through a proper medium is essential to making the most use of the data. This is where using interactive maps for Sentinel and Log Analytics workspace comes into play. As of the writing of this blog article, it’s not possible to use the interactive map directly within the Logs section of Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace. Instead, the Azure Data Explorer web app or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer">Kusto Explorer desktop app</a> must be used. This article will use Azure Data Explorer for all examples. The setup required for this is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to go to the <a href="https://dataexplorer.azure.com/">Azure Data Explorer</a> web app and click on Add in the top left of the screen, and then select Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Adding connection to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, a window will appear asking for a connection. To connect to a Sentinel instance (it’s actually the Log Analytics workspace), the following information is required:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Subscription ID 
 Resource group name – this is the resource group where the Log Analytics workspace is in 
 Log Analytics workspace name 
 
<p>All of these can be found simply by clicking on Settings in the Sentinel menu and then clicking Workspace settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clicking on Workspace settings, the information required will be available on the screen as shown below. This is also true if you’re connecting to a Log Analytics workspace without Sentinel. By going to the Log Analytics workspace’s page, the page below will open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3 Workspace settings of the Sentinel instance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The connection URI needs to be in the following format:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://ade.loganalytics.io/subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourcegroups/&lt;resource-group-name&gt;/providers/microsoft.operationalinsights/workspaces/&lt;workspace-name&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection URI has been updated with the required values, it can be added to the section in Azure Data Explorer, and once a display name has been entered click Add. Ensure that the Log Analytics workspace configured in the connection URI is in the tenant shown at the bottom of the window. If the Log Analytics workspace is in a tenant other than the one signed in as in Azure Data Explorer, the tenant can be switched on this screen as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Adding the connection URI to Azure Data Explorer (ADX)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the connection has been set up, it should be viewable under Connections in the left menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 5 A table from the newly configured connection</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To query the tables, select the workspace and enter the query as you would normally do in the Sentinel Logs screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 6 Running a query in ADX</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using the interactive map 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use the interactive map, the data must contain longitude and latitude data. Mapping based on country, state, or city names will not work. The format of the longitude and latitude should be in decimal degrees. This means that 41.40338 and 2.17403 will work but 41°24'12.2"N and 2°10'26.5"E will not work. Most tables in Sentinel will have geographical data in the correct format already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The render operator must be used followed by “scatterchart with (kind=map)” to generate the interactive map. There is documentation about parameters which affect <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/geospatial-visualizations">geospatial data visualizations</a>. One rule is the first two columns of the query output must be the longitude and latitude values, in that order. While the specific columns for longitude and latitude can be selected manually after running the query, it adds an extra step that’s easily skipped by ensuring the proper order of columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will take count of Entra sign ins from each location and then visualize it on an interactive map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the map is interactive, you can zoom in and move around freely. Clicking on the objects will show the values based on the query output. In the query example above, the number of sign ins from that location were being calculated and therefore this is shown when clicked on the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 8 Interactive map result of query</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After running the query in the Azure Data Explorer page, a menu will appear to the right of the results. This section will allow you to change settings of the visualization of the query results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible to set the circle sizes proportional to the number of sign ins (or any other numerical value that may exist in the query output). To do this, the Size section needs to be turned on by toggling the Hide toggle and then the column which will determine the size can be selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The effect of configuring the Size section can be seen below. Note how the circle sizes are now different.</p>

 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visualizing geographical data can give insights that may be difficult to find when using other visualization methods. Once a connection has been setup from Azure Data Explorer Sentinel logs such as Entra ID, sign-in logs can be queried and visualized on an interactive map, making investigations much more effective.</p>

  <p>One of the best practices for securing your organization's data is to follow the principle of least privilege, which means granting users the minimum level of permissions they need to perform their tasks. Microsoft Entra ID helps you apply this principle by offering a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">wide range of built-in roles</a> as well as allowing you to create custom roles and assign them to users or groups based on their responsibilities and access needs. You can also use Entra ID to review and revoke any role assignments that are no longer needed or appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be easy to lose track of role assignments if admin activities are not carefully audited and monitored. Routine checks of role assignments and generating alerts on new role assignments are one way to track and manage privileged role assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chances are that when a user with privileged roles is approached, they’ll say they need the role. This may be true; however, many times users will unknowingly say they need those permissions to carry out certain tasks when they could be assigned a role with lower permissions. For example, a user will be able to reset user passwords as a Global Administrator, but that does not mean they can’t do that with another role with far less permissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Defining privileged permissions 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#terminology">Privileged permissions in Entra ID</a> can be defined as “permissions that can be used to delegate management of directory resources to other users, modify credentials, authentication or authorization policies, or access restricted data.” Entra ID roles each have a list of permissions defined to them. When an identity is granted the role, the identity also inherits the permissions defined in the role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to check the permissions of these roles. The permissions defined in all built-in roles can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference">here</a>. For example, there are a few permissions that are different for the Privileged Authentication Administrator role than the Authentication Administrator role, giving the former more permissions in Entra ID. The differences between the authentication roles can be viewed <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#compare-authentication-roles">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example of having differences between similar roles is for the end user administration roles. The differences and nuances between these roles are outlined in detail <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/privileged-roles-permissions?tabs=admin-center#who-can-reset-passwords">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auditing activity 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To decide if a user really needs a role, it’s crucial to monitor their activities and find the role with the least privilege that allows them to carry out their work. You’ll need Entra ID audit logs for this. Entra ID audit logs can either be sent to a Log Analytics Workspace or connected to a Sentinel instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two methods that can be used to get the events of carried out by admin accounts. The first will make use of the IdentityInfo table, which is only available in Sentinel after enabling User and Entity Behavior Analytics (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/enable-entity-behavior-analytics">UEBA</a>). If you aren’t using UEBA in Sentinel or if you’re querying a Log Analytics Workspace, then you'll need to use the second method in the next heading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Using Microsoft Sentinel 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To ingest Entra ID audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, the Microsoft Entra ID data connector must be enabled, and the Audit Logs must be ticked as seen below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1 Entra ID data connector in Sentinel with Audit logs enabled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IdentityInfo table stores user information gathered by UEBA. Therefore, it also includes the Entra ID roles a user has been assigned. This makes it very simple to get a list of accounts that have been assigned privileged roles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The query below will give a unique list of activities an account has taken, as well as which roles the account has been assigned:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs 
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will give results for all accounts that carried out tasks in Entra ID and may generate too many operations that were not privileged. To filter for specific Entra ID roles, the following query can be run where the roles are defined in a list. Three roles have been added as examples, but this list can and should be expanded to include more roles:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let PrivilegedRoles = dynamic(["Global Administrator", 
                               "Security Administrator", 
                               "Compliance Administrator" 
                              ]);

| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(90d) 
| extend ActorName = iif( 
                         isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                         tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                     ) 
| extend ActorID = iif( 
                       isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                       tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                   ) 
| where isnotempty(ActorName) 
| join kind=inner (IdentityInfo 
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(7d) 
    | where strlen(tostring(AssignedRoles)) &gt; 2 
    | summarize arg_max(TimeGenerated, *) by AccountUPN 
    | project AccountObjectId, AssignedRoles) 
    on $left.ActorID == $right.AccountObjectId 
| where AssignedRoles has_any (PrivilegedRoles) 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, Identity, tostring(AssignedRoles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, AssignedRoles, Operations, OperationsCount, ActorID, Identity 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the query is run, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant and what roles those accounts have. In the example below, the top two results don’t pose any problems. However, the third row contains a user that has the Global Administrator role and has created a service principal. The permissions needed to create a service principal can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, this user can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>

 Using Log Analytics Workspace

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because there is no table that contains the roles an identity has been granted, you’ll need to add the list of users to the query and filter them. There are multiple ways to get a list of users who have been assigned a specific Entra ID role. A quick way to do this is to go to Entra ID and then select Roles and administrators. From there, select the role and export the identities that have been assigned to it. It’s important to have the User Principal Names (UPNs) of the privileged users. You’ll need to add these UPNs, along with the roles the user has, to the query. Some examples have been given in the query itself. If the user has more than one role, then all roles must be added to the query.</p>

]

        | extend ActorName = iif( 
                                isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["userPrincipalName"]), 
                                tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["displayName"]) 
                            ) 
        | extend ActorID = iif( 
                            isnotempty(tostring(InitiatedBy["user"])),  
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["user"]["id"]), 
                            tostring(InitiatedBy["app"]["id"]) 
                        ) 
        | where isnotempty(ActorName) ) on $left.UserPrincipalName == $right.ActorName 
| summarize Operations = make_set(OperationName) by ActorName, ActorID, tostring(Roles) 
| extend OperationsCount = array_length(Operations) 
| project ActorName, Operations, OperationsCount, Roles, ActorID 
| sort by OperationsCount desc 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you run the query, the results will give insights into the activities performed in your Entra ID tenant by the users you have filtered for. In the example below, the top two results can cause problems. Both have the Global Administrator role, but their operations don’t necessitate to have that role. The permissions needed for these operations can be found in roles less privileged than the Global Administrator role. Therefore, these users can be given a less privileged role. To find out which role can be granted, check <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/delegate-by-task">this list</a>, which contains the least privileged role required to carry out specific tasks in Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4 Actions taken by users in Entra ID</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this user still requires the Global Administrator role then the Security Administrator role will become redundant as the Global Administrator contains more permissions than the Security Administrator role.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping accounts with privileges that are not required is keeping your attack surface greater than it needs to be. By ingesting Entra ID Audit logs, you can query and identify users who have unnecessary and over-privileged roles. You can then find a suitable alternative role for them.&nbsp;</p>

			 What is a digital signature and how does it work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In the form of a coded message, a digital signature securely links a signer to a document in a recorded transaction. Digital signatures employ a standardized and widely accepted format known as Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the utmost levels of security and universal acceptance. PKI entails the use of a digital certificate for identity verification.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How do digital signature works? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>Digital signatures, similar to handwritten signatures, are unique to each signer. Providers of digital signature solutions, such as InfoCert, adhere to a specific protocol known as Public Key Infrastructure, or PKI. PKI mandates that the provider utilizes a mathematical algorithm to generate two long numbers, referred to as keys. One key is public, and the other is private.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When a signer electronically signs a document, the signature is formed using the signer’s private key, which is securely held by the signer. The mathematical algorithm functions as a cipher, creating data that matches the signed document, known as a hash, and encrypting that data. The resulting encrypted data constitutes the digital signature. Additionally, the signature is timestamped with the time of document signing. If the document undergoes changes after signing, the digital signature becomes invalid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, John signs an agreement to sell a timeshare using her private key. The buyer receives the document along with a copy of John’s public key. If the public key cannot decrypt the signature (via the cipher used to generate the keys), it indicates that the signature either does not belong to John or has been altered since it was signed. In such cases, the signature is deemed invalid.</p><p>To uphold the integrity of the signature, PKI mandates that the keys be created, managed, and stored securely. This often involves the services of a reputable Certificate Authority (CA). Digital signature providers, like InfoCert, comply with PKI requirements to ensure secure digital signing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What’s the difference between an electronic signature and a digital signature? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A digital signature is a form of electronic signature that demands a higher level of identity verification through digital certificates.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The broader category of electronic signatures (e-signatures) encompasses various types of electronic signatures. This category includes digital signatures, which represent a specific technological implementation of electronic signatures. Both digital signatures and other e-signature solutions enable the signing of documents and authentication of the signer. However, distinctions exist in terms of purpose, technical implementation, geographical usage, and the legal and cultural acceptance of digital signatures compared to other types of e-signatures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the utilization of digital signature technology for e-signatures varies significantly between countries following open, technology-neutral e-signature laws, such as the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and those adopting tiered eSignature models favoring locally defined standards based on digital signature technology. This includes many countries in the European Union, South America, and Asia. In the European Union, governed by the eIDAS regulation, two levels of digital signatures exist: Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) and Qualified Electronic Signature (QES).</p><p>Furthermore, certain industries also endorse specific standards rooted in digital signature technology</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Navigating the Digital Identity Landscape 
<p>While eIDAS 2.0 centers on fostering interoperability and setting standards for digital identity, the EUDI Wallet serves as a tangible tool for users, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive digital identity ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Electronic IDentification and trust Services Regulation, more commonly known as eIDAS, aims to create a unified digital identity framework, promoting interoperability and trust in cross-border interactions. eIDAS 2.0 represents a paradigm shift, addressing key challenges that hindered the initial eIDAS regulation's widespread adoption. Its revision was triggered by low implementation of eIDAS by European Union (EU) member states. The revised eIDAS 2.0 plans to provide private individuals a trusted and secure means of sharing verified identity and data attributes with not just public but also private services.</p>
<p>Key to the eIDAS regulation is the digital wallet, with each member state responsible for providing a digital identity wallet to every citizen who wants one. With the ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2022)699491">80% of EU residents using a digital identity by 2030</a>, the idea is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials. As a result, a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5651">final agreement</a> on eID was reached by the European Parliament and the Council on November 8, 2023.</p>
 Things to consider 
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kuppingercole-analysts-predict-verified-identitys-market-/">KuppingerCole market sizing research</a> indicates that the financial, government, and health care sectors already see the highest use of a verified digital identity to remotely onboard and enroll users. While these may be the most frequent users of verified digital identity, other industries are rapidly showing interest. This expected growth is in line with the overall growth of this segment, marked by increasing maturity of technologies, increasing adoption across a wider range of industries, and an increased use of eIDs and digital wallets. However, the true potential lies not in restricting these technologies to specific use cases but in embracing their capacity to simplify a multitude of interactions.</p>
<p>Far from being a mere tool, the EUDI Wallet could serve as a means for the adoption of digital services by providing a unified approach to identity management. From e-commerce to government processes and beyond, the EUDI Wallet and eIDAS 2.0 have the potential to integrate decentralized identity principles into existing applications and build new digital services that benefit from them. Nevertheless, ensuring security and interoperability will be challenging - especially at the massive scale of users and use cases the EU is targeting.</p>
<p>In addition, the digital identity issuance and applicability must not just be for one organization or use case – if a user has access to a verified, digital identity, they must be able to use it for many different purposes, with many different service providers in disparate industries, and even with public institutions. Therefore, solutions must be flexible and extensible: flexible to provide adjustable levels of assurance to each use case or flow, and extensible to address the increasingly complex interoperability needs and security considerations.</p>
 Reaping the benefits 
<p>The wallet's full potential extends far beyond specific use cases, encompassing its applicability in e-commerce, organizational and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/leveraging-decentralized-identity-enterprise-eic2023">enterprise settings</a>, government interactions, and more. Key components to consider when selecting the right technology mix for a digital identity solution will include high functionality with exceptional user experience. The crucial factor here is the widespread acceptance of the EUDI Wallet, which hinges on its user-friendliness, security, and global functionality. Achieving acceptance becomes feasible when the system is easier to use and seamlessly works on a global scale.</p>
<p>Done right, the economy stands to gain significantly from the simplification brought about by the EUDI Wallet. One of the primary benefits is a reduction in drop-off rates, as the streamlined and user-friendly nature of the wallet ensures a smoother process, preventing potential users from abandoning digital interactions midway. Additionally, the simplification enabled by the wallet helps reduce overall process costs. Eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles and reducing in the time required for various transactions further bolster the economic benefits.</p>
<p>In essence, the key to unlocking the full potential of the EUDI Wallet lies not only in its technical capabilities, but equally in the investments made to educate users, promote transparency, and cultivate a user base that recognizes the transformative impact of digital wallets on both the personal and economic landscape. Emphasizing the versatility of the EUDI Wallet in various economic facets is critical for user adoption, which ultimately leads to a more efficient and connected economy. User education will therefore be an important part of success, as will an iterative approach.</p>

<p>Safety is core to social media. Transparency is essential to building trust in moderation efforts, and the data we are providing here is a first step towards full transparency reports. We hope these early disclosures provide some visibility into our behind the scenes operations, and we intend to deliver more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 High-Level Overview 
<p>Over the past year, the Bluesky app has grown from a handful of friends and developers to over 3 million registered accounts. We have hired and trained a full-time team of moderators, launched and iterated on several community and individual moderation features, developed and refined policies both public and internal, designed and redesigned product features to reduce abuse, and built several infrastructure components from scratch to support our Trust and Safety work.</p>
<p>We’ve made a lot of progress, and we know we still have a long way to go to deliver on the vision we set out — including <a>composable moderation</a>, mute words, temporary account deactivation, and collaborative programs to combat misinformation (such as Community Notes). We will have more to share in coming weeks! But first here is an overview of 2023.</p>
 Reporting By The Numbers 
<p>One of the most obvious and visible forms of moderation on Bluesky is the report-and-review feedback loop. Any user can report content such as posts, accounts, or lists through the app. We then review reported content and behavior against both the <a>Community Guidelines</a> and <a>Terms of Service</a>, and take action when appropriate.</p>
<p>Our team of proactive and very-much-appreciated full-time moderators have provided around-the-clock coverage since spring. We’re doing things differently than a lot of social media sites, and hired our moderators directly, rather than relying on a third-party vendor. While we might use automated tools to handle reports in the future, right now every single report filed has been reviewed by humans, with no automated resolution. In 2023 we reviewed 358,165 individual reports.</p>

The report categories in this graph&nbsp; are based on the `com.atproto.moderation.defs#reasonType` schema. Currently, these categories do not clearly align with the in-app copy for reports. The categories shown in-app will be updated and harmonized soon. <a>Download the raw data as a TSV file here</a>.
<p>A relatively small fraction of accounts was responsible for creating the majority of reports, and separately a small fraction of accounts received the majority of reports. In total 76,699 individual accounts (5.6% of our active users) created one or more reports, and 45,861 individual accounts (3.4% of our active users) received one or more reports (either on the overall account, or on a piece of content created by the account).</p>
<p>When we take action on a report, our interventions have ranged from sending warning emails, to labeling, to takedowns of content or entire accounts. Takedowns can be either temporary suspensions or take effect permanently. While we used all of our interventions over the course of 2023, this post only includes a breakdown of takedowns: 4,667 accounts taken down, and an additional 1,817 individual pieces of content taken down.</p>
<p>In addition to reports from the community, we have a number of automated tools to proactively detect suspicious or harmful conduct without a user first reporting it to the moderation team, such as slurs in handles and spam accounts. Some of these tools take direct action on visual content by applying labels like "gore" to violent imagery, while others simply file automated reports for human review. Users can appeal labels applied to their account through the same in-app reporting flow, which the moderation team will then take another look at. The numbers above do not include the large volume of reports created by our own automated systems.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), is obviously unacceptable anywhere on the Internet, including Bluesky. We built AT Protocol and Bluesky to ensure we can rapidly identify and remove this content anywhere it appears on our network, even when federation becomes available in the future. To help proactively detect, take down, review, and report CSAM to the applicable authorities (including NCMEC in the United States), we partnered with an established non-profit vendor who provides both hash matching APIs and specialist web apps for review and reporting. While any instance of this behavior is dangerous and warrants prompt action, to date we have thankfully not yet encountered a significant volume of such content in the network. However, our systems proactively identified four instances of potential CSAM, of which two were statistical false-positives, and two were confirmed to meet reporting requirements and were reported to NCMEC.</p>
<p>For this report, we are not yet including counts of legal requests and the fraction of requests serviced, nor are all of our moderation actions (such as labels) fully represented in the numbers we’ve shared here. We look forward to providing more granular data and reporting in the future. Given the transparent nature of the network, independent researchers also already have direct access to relatively rich data on labeling and moderation interventions.</p>
 Interaction Controls 
<p>No amount of reactive moderation will help if the base design of a product rewards abuse or inflames inter-community conflict. In 2023, we added a number of app and protocol features that give individuals and groups more control over their interactions in the network, with the aim of building safety options into the design of Bluesky itself.</p>
<p>Moderation lists can be used for muting and blocking. Individuals can maintain curated lists of accounts for an entire community, reducing duplicated efforts. Lists themselves are always public, and the behaviors of lists match the privacy of individual-level actions: blocking a list is public, while muting a list is private. Like all technical safety features, lists have both advantages and disadvantages as a moderation primitive. They can be a vector for harassment and abuse (and thus themselves require moderation), become difficult to maintain at larger scale, and have no built-in affordances for collaborative control or accountability. On the other hand, they are relatively familiar and easy to understand, have a low barrier to adoption, and integrate easily with everyday use of the app.</p>
<p>Self-labeling of individual posts lets authors ensure appropriate content warnings are in place for viewers. This feature is currently limited to posts with visual images and adult content, but there is a clear path to expanding the scope to more labels.</p>

  
  
    The self-labeling feature.

<p>Reply controls give authors choice over who can interact in their threads, including the ability to close all replies to a post.</p>

  
  
  
      The reply controls feature.

<p>There are several more basic interaction controls in development or on the horizon. The ability to hide individual posts and to appeal labeling decisions on your own posts are both available now as beta-quality features. We are also tracking requests for the ability to mute keywords, and for users to be able to temporarily deactivate their own account. We’ll share more about these planned features in the coming months.</p>
 Supporting Tools and Infrastructure 
<p>Trust and safety efforts rely on tooling — and a lot of our work has been building the supporting tooling and infrastructure for this work from scratch. We’ve made a lot of progress in 2023 behind the scenes to support our moderation teams and policies.</p>
<p>Our moderation review tools have gone through major refactors and workflow improvements over the year, based on feedback from our moderators and policy experts. What started as a minimal admin interface can now handle tiered review queues, templated email workflows, moderation event timelines, and more. From a technical perspective, the APIs driving this system, both reporting and review, are defined the same way as other atproto endpoints, which supports interoperability with other alternative clients and workflow systems. We named the front-end interface of the moderation review system Ozone, and we plan to open-source it soon. We’re also in the process of pulling out the moderation back-end as a standalone service that other organizations can self-host.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have developed a rule-based automod framework to augment our moderation team when battling spam, and to proactively flag unacceptable content before it gets seen and reported by human users. This has helped identify some patterns of engagement farming and spam, and we will continue to develop and refine abuse detectors as we move towards open federation and growing the network.</p>

 Proactive Cyber Security needs TDIR 
 
<p>Organizations and society in general have become more and more dependent on IT delivered services.&nbsp; This has increased the potential impact of risks from cyber-attacks.&nbsp; Cybersecurity needs to meet this challenge by moving beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response.</p>
 Limit Attacker Free Time 
 
<p>The old model of a risk arising from a largely static threat exploiting a known vulnerability to cause damage is no longer adequate for today’s cyber environment.&nbsp; The cyber “<a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed/data/corporate/documents/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf">Kill Chain</a>” explains how threat actors are active within the cyber infrastructure well before a vulnerability is exploited.&nbsp; Therefore, it is not sufficient simply to remove known vulnerabilities - it is essential to detect cyber threat activity prior to the attack to actively prevent this from succeeding.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: TDIR to Limit Attacker Free Time</p>
<p>The level of risk from cyber-attacks such as ransomware is now so high that it is a question of when not if a cyber-attack on your organization’s business critical cyber infrastructure will succeed.&nbsp; However, while most organizations have invested heavily in cyber prevention, surveys reveal that they are less well prepared to recover from a cyber-attack.</p>
<p>Authorities around the world have recognized these challenges and are imposing stricter requirements on organizations that their populations rely on for a wide range of essential services, which includes a wide and growing number of private companies that should be preparing now to meet their new obligations.</p>
<p>Notably the EU issued the&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Network and Information Systems (NIS) Directive in 2016</a>&nbsp;and the US saw the introduction of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">Executive Order 14028</a>&nbsp;on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity in 2021. But European authorities are now seeking to go even further with an update to the NIS Directive, known as NIS2, which is expected to go into force by the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, NIS2 has a much wider scope, going beyond the traditional critical national infrastructure providers to include a range of organizations that are essential for the normal functioning of society, which include both EU and non-EU organizations that will have to ensure their compliance in future.</p>
 Threat Detection and Incident Response 
<p>All these factors taken together have led to a growing market in Threat detection and Incident Response tools and services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80959/getting-ahead-of-the-cybercriminals-understanding-the-external-threat-landscape">Threat intelligence</a> – the threat actors reuse and repurpose the techniques, tools, and processes (TTPs) that they use. This makes it vital that where these are identified, this information can be securely shared amongst potential victim organizations. This information Information about threats, TTPs, and devices that adversaries employ; the systems and information that they target; and any other threat-related information that provides greater situational awareness.</p>
<p>Organizations should join the cyber threat intelligence networks relevant to their industry and location. They should also make sure that their cyber-security teams or service providers receive and share cyber threat intelligence from trusted suppliers.</p>
<p>Threat Detection – there is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80845/architecting-your-soc-to-defend-against-today-s-attack-vectors">a wide range of tools</a> that are intended to help to detect abnormal activity within and around the organizational systems. These include Security Event Information Monitoring (SIEM), Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR), Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection and Response (NDR), and Extended Detection and Response (XDR).&nbsp; In general, these tools ingest the vast amount of data logged by the various sensors around the IT infrastructure and provide capabilities to filter and analyze this data to detect anomalies.&nbsp; The challenges are the sheer volume of data and avoiding false positive overload.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations should implement or outsource these activities in a way that is integrated with relevant threat intelligence.&nbsp; Look for the application of Machine Learning (ML) / Artificial Intelligence (AI) based approaches to improve the detection of actual threats. Look for integration with attack path analysis and to help to prioritize the actions needed on threats detected.</p>
<p>Attack Surface Management – business applications and the cyber infrastructure upon which they depend will contain vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp; Many of these will already be known and documented as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) for which there are patches or workarounds to remove them. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">Attack Surface Management tools</a> help organizations to find these vulnerabilities and together with attack path analysis tools to prioritize and close them.</p>
<p>Organizations should implement a continuous vulnerability detection and assessment process to remove known vulnerabilities. They should subscribe to and act on feeds providing newly discovered vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Data Resilience – <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-resilience-is-key">data is the most important asset of the modern organization</a>, and it needs to be protected against ransomware as well as loss. Cyber adversaries use various techniques to infiltrate an organization’s IT systems and make changes that prevent the organization from accessing their data and using their IT services. Cloud services create challenges and cloud infrastructure is data defined.&nbsp; Organizations can misunderstand the shared responsibility model and believe data protection is the sole responsibility of the cloud provider.&nbsp; In addition, Big Data and massive data lakes held in cloud services create additional data resilience challenges.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80804/cloud-backup-for-ransomware-protection">Backup and Disaster Recovery tools</a> provide important controls that are needed to recover data and restore services following cyber-attacks. Organizations need to implement and regularly these tools as part of their Business Continuity processes.</p>
<p>Incident Response - <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb80209/responding-to-cyber-incidents">Organizations need a plan for managing incidents</a> and this must be prepared and tested in advance of an incident occurring. When a major incident is suspected there must be a clear process for invoking a major incident response. The key elements of this are having an incident response team who know what their roles are and that can be assembled when needed. A command structure with a clear chain of command and definition of responsibilities. A communications plan to manage communications with all those involved when and incident occurs. Recovery and restoration – the process for removing the vulnerabilities, restoring the affected systems and data, and then safely resuming their normal operation. Notification – the process for meeting your organization’s statutory obligations for notifying regulators and customers about the incident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hacked-72-hours-of-a-ciso-nightmare-cre23">Organizations should retest this plan at regular intervals</a>.</p>
 Dynamic Cyber Security 
<p>Cybersecurity spending will never be able to grow as fast as attacks increase. Just trying to defend is not sufficient – organizations must get ahead of the cybercriminals and move beyond current approaches to cybersecurity by understanding the external threat landscape. Cybersecurity needs to keep up with this rapid pace of change by taking their focus beyond the traditional approach of protection, detection, and response, to become proactive.</p>

<p>In writing the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">recent blog post</a> on W3C Verifiable Credentials and ISO mdocs, I found a rat’s nest of options and choices that made understanding the landscape ridiculously challenging. When talking about verifiable credentials, you’re actually talking about a collection of format and protocol specifications that sometimes overlap. In order to understand the space, I needed to sort out several points:</p>



 
 What is a digital credential? 



 What is the difference between a format and a protocol? 



 What are the formats and protocols that are most relevant when talking about verifiable credentials? 



 How does someone decide what technology to pursue, and where do they find out more? 
 



<p>Because of the competing use cases, siloed focus, and general market politics, some of the concepts below are more of a continuum than clear distinctions from one area to the next. And that is part of why the space is so confusing. As there is no single<a href="https://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/arbiter+of+good+taste"> arbiter of good taste</a> when it comes to how the Internet functions, all this confusion only gets sorted out through years of discussion, debate, testing, adoption, and evolution.</p>



 Digital Credentials 



<blockquote>
<p>A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.</p>
Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt</blockquote>



<p>To understand everything else in the world of verifiable credentials, first, you need to know what a digital credential is. Andrew Hughes and Dr. Torsten Lodderstedt described it in their <a href="https://pages.scmagazine.com/rs/188-UNZ-660/images/Identiverse%202023%20-%20Verifiable%20Digital%20Credentials%20Comparison%20and%20Analysis%20of%20Emerging%20Issuance%20Protocol%20Standards%20-%206.01.pdf">Identiverse 2023 presentation</a>: “A digital credential conveys data that is an authentic representation of information held in a registry at the time of issuance.” So many important words there! My translation is that a digital credential is a collection of information about a person or thing (in more generic terms, a subject) that has been packaged based on what was in a particular repository at a single point in time. How trustworthy the data is, how secure it is against tampering, all that is actually out of scope for what it is. A digital credential is the keystone to building an ecosystem; it isn’t all that interesting until we figure out how to use it.</p>



 Credential Issuance Formats and Protocols 



<blockquote>
<p>A format is a the structure of the data.</p>



<p>A protocol is how you move that data around.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you have a digital credential in a format, but you haven’t issued it to the entity that needs it, what good is it? This is where issuance formats and protocols start making verifiable credentials usable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the W3C’s specifications, issuance and presentation formats are all contained within the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model, described in more detail later in this post.</p>



<p><a href="https://openid.github.io/OpenID4VCI/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-wg-draft.html">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance</a> (OpenID4VCI, which is barely shorter than the name of the specification), is an issuance protocol. This issuance format can be used with just about any issuance format. ISO’s mdoc, W3C’s Verifiable Credentials, it’s open to most everything. The purpose of the protocol is to make sure that the credentials are transported in a standardized way. OpenID4VCI is still in draft, so it is something of a moving target for anyone not deeply embedded in the space already.</p>



<p>But OpenID4VCI isn’t the only issuance protocol under development. The&nbsp; ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 committee is working on <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/86783.html">23220-3</a> – Cards and security devices for personal identification – Building blocks for identity management via mobile devices – Part 3: Protocols and services for issuing phase. My expectation is that this work will align more closely with the mdoc/mDL work and its more restricted underlying assumptions, but I am not closely tied to the ISO efforts.</p>



<p>If you want to truly dig into the rabbit hole of comparing credential formats, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X93ptJcmfX1NZEo5E7ElnqJ-knDS4Dj6JOYSJ_2PsUw/edit#gid=1084392809">Credential Format Matrix</a> is the place to start.</p>



 Credential Presentation Formats and Protocols 



<p>Now we have the concept of a digital credential, it’s been issued, and we want to use it. That means putting it in a machine-readable format to present to something else and defining the protocols to use to get it there. There are a variety of requirements and constraints that influence what that format needs to be for any given use case.&nbsp;</p>



 W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 



<p>The W3C wants to create credential issuance and presentation formats for the web. The use cases this model supports are intended to allow for All The Things. From uber-secure data like government-issued credentials to meh-secure data like movie tickets, the W3C Verifiable Credential specification “provides a standard way to express <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#dfn-credential">credentials</a> on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.” They came out with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">official version</a> of their data model in 2022. However, specifications of this level of complexity rarely survive contact with reality. And so, people within the W3C are working on a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/">new version</a> that will include breaking changes from the first version.</p>



<p>My “ahHA” moment when researching this came from a conversation with <a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> when I asked if the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model was a credential presentation format or credential issuance format. He said, “The issuance format is called a Verifiable Credential.&nbsp; The presentation format is called a Verifiable Presentation.”</p>



<p>The format for a W3C Verifiable Presentation credential consists of three major parts: the metadata about the credential (e.g., who issued it, when it was issued, etc.), the claims that make up the credential (the details of the entity being described), and one or more proofs (see ‘digital signatures’ below).</p>



 Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token-based Verifiable Credentials (SD-JWT VC) 



<p>According to the IETF Internet-Draft abstract, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">SD-JWT VC draft specification</a> “describes data formats as well as validation and processing rules to express Verifiable Credentials with JSON payloads based on the Selective Disclosure for JWTs (SD-JWT) format.”</p>



<p>A few things make SD-JWT VC’s format different from the W3C’s Verifiable Credential format. First and foremost is its <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-01.html#section-1.2-6">explicit mention</a> that it does not use the W3C’s data format in v1, v1.1, or the draft v2. While both are general-purpose credential formats, the W3C requires the use of JSON-LD (described below in the section on data serialization). The SD-JWT VCs, on the other hand, focus on regular JSON payloads and the SD-JWT format. Some people find the restriction of JSON-LD too much to bear, which makes the SD-JWT VC format a more appropriate option for them.</p>



 ISO mdoc 



<p>As <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@aniltj/111692855215449887">Anil John</a> noted in a Mastodon thread, “The starting point for the W3C VC work and the ISO mDL work were radically different; the mDL work was directly focused on in-person use cases while the W3C work was focused on remote/online use cases. Both are trying to address the other at present, but the starting point has influenced the design choices that are inherent in both standards.” mdoc uses the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), a language that can be used either the CBOR or JSON data serialization formats. mdoc is standardized in ISO/IEC’s 18013-5, a specification on the in-person presentation of mobile driving licenses (mDL). There is a very readable description of mdocs and mDLs in ENISA’s <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/digital-identity-standards/@@download/fullReport">Digital Identity Standards</a> write-up from July 2023.</p>



<p>While this format can be used for other digital credentials, its standardization in the mDL specification results in people (like me) conflating mdoc and mDL regularly. It’s hard to pinpoint <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/download/attachments/17167105/20211005_ISO_IEC_18013_5_INTRO_W3C_CCG.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1633559852634&amp;api=v2">when standardization started</a> for mdoc; probably the best one to point to is 2014, when ISO/IEC kicked off the task force, resulting in ISO publishing 18013-5 in 2021. There is still plenty of work to do, particularly around how you’d take this credential presentation format and use it in a remote (rather than in-person) setting. That’s being covered in ISO/IEC 18013-7, still a work in progress.</p>



 Data Serialization Formats 



<p>You have a digital credential. You understand the choices you must make to decide what format it needs to be in. Now, you need the best way to transmit it to the thing that will consume it. That’s where data serialization formats come in. In the digital credential space, there are a handful that most people talk about.</p>



<p>If we’re talking more about tiny devices and digital credentials about things, then using something that focuses on keeping the format really, really efficient is critical. That’s something that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8152/">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</a> exists for. If that level of efficiency isn’t necessary and more features are required, then <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7165/">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> is probably better. Whether you find <a href="https://json.nlohmann.me/features/binary_formats/cbor/">one better than the other</a>, from an outside but still geeky perspective, is like arguing between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">emacs and vi</a>. If you’d like something more structured and optimized for an environment where the data pieces are related to each other (for example, all parts of a single schema), then <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON for Linked Data (JSON-LD)</a> is a great choice. Complicated, or so I’m told, but great.</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more! Continuing with the JSON theme, work is underway within the IETF that focuses on the selective disclosure (rather than all-or-nothing disclosure) of data in a JSON structure. That’s the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">Selective Disclosure for JSON Web Tokens </a>(SD-JWT) draft. If you’re more interested in work being developed within the European Union, the European Commission’s European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) project’s <a href="https://code.europa.eu/ebsi/ecosystem/-/blob/3f2d4283e5756c2cb0fe51119e00e496755dd0d9/drafts/sd-jws.md">EBSI Improvement Proposal (EBIP) on selective disclosure</a> might be a fit, even though it refers back to SD-JWT.</p>



<p>As individuals focus on their core use cases and the best formats to support them, they will drift apart in terms of the functionality supported and the terminology used. That, in turn, creates complications for people and organizations that need to support more than one use case that brings in more than one credential presentation format. Every additional format involves support overhead to maintain it. Wouldn’t it be better if we just … picked one?</p>



 Digital Signatures + Credentials 



<p>Now, let’s consider the security of all this. Looking at the fundamentals of security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability, what is the best way to secure the presentation and transmission of a digital credential? That’s where digital signatures come in. TechTarget has an excellent article explaining digital signatures. The tl;dr of it is that digital signatures are a way to cryptographically secure one or more pieces of data such that someone (or something) can look at it later and say, “Yep, that was signed and sent by who I expected and hasn’t been changed since it was sent.”</p>



<p>That’s important information, but now there are choices to make. What exactly should be signed when it comes to digital credentials? Do you include the signature in what you’re presenting so it’s a core part of the credential, or do you put a wrapper around it like an envelope? Or both? The answer to that is, as with so many things, it depends. Do you expect all the devices to be able to handle this kind of cryptography on the fly, possibly without access to the Internet? Are the devices powerful enough to handle all the math?</p>



<p>Taking this down a slightly different dependency path, depending on what data serialization format you’re using, you’ll have another set of specifications to learn about that tells you how to sign, encrypt, and decrypt the different possible formats.</p>



<p>The IETF created the JSON-based building blocks of JSON Web Token (JWT), JSON Web Signature (JWS), JSON Web Encryption (JWE), JSON Web Key (JWK), and JSON Web Algorithms (JWA). <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/blog/engineering/guest-post/what-are-jwt-jws-jwe-jwk-jwa/">LoginRadius</a> has a great article describing each of these and, at a high level, how they fit together.</p>



<p>Similarly, the IETF is working on similar building blocks based on CBOR, including the CBOR Web Token (CWT) rather than JSON. For those organizations more committed to a CBOR-based model, the COSE working group is where to learn more.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So much of this work is either still in draft or very early deployment. That means it is all subject to change. The descriptions of the technologies above may be lacking in several ways. My hope is that this post will help you understand where the debates are happening and the work is still in progress. If you think any of these efforts are going in the wrong direction, please engage in the conversation rather than creating Yet Another specification effort. The fragmentation in the space is not helping move this work forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is probably the least SEO-friendly post I’ve written in ages! Thanks for getting through it, and I hope it was as helpful to you as it is to me in understanding how all these parts are supposed to fit together. I encourage those more deeply involved in specification writing than I am to offer their feedback, either agreement or correction, in the post comments! It will help me learn and possibly help others as well.</p>

<p>It’s the start of another year and as I’m preparing for our annual sales kick off event it’s a great time to reflect on 2023 and look forward to where we are going in 2024.</p>
<p>Globally, I think it’s safe to say that 2023 was not the year that was hoped for, knock on effects from the war in Ukraine have seen inflation and interest rates rise. Beyond that we’ve seen large reductions in force across the IT sector as organisations correct their hypergrowth bets. Given all that as the backdrop we’ve had a great year in 2023, our growth continues on the same trajectory currently sitting at &gt;6x in 5 years, that certainly helps to keep our shareholders happy. &nbsp;Our profits continue to rise allowing us to power more growth in 2024.</p>
 The Organisation Identity Landscape 
<p>We’ve seen some disruption in the organisation identity landscape this year with the exit of GMEI as an accredited Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuer. This has settled down reasonably quickly and we’ve been quick to assist our customers in the consolidation of their LEI portfolios, simplifying their management and providing a more cost effective solution.</p>
<p>We have also maintained our position as number 1 in LEI Issuance and in December ‘23 we issued 28% of all new LEIs. This is a great testament to the team we have and the ‘platform’ they have created, which allows us to give best value to our LEI partners and customers.</p>
 Combining Organisation Identity &amp; Individual Identity 
<p>While we continue our mission to champion organisation identity as described by our shared vision for the future of digital identity:</p>
<blockquote><p>Combining highly assured organisation identity with strongly authenticated individual identity to show who you are, who you represent and the rights you have when representing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I explored in my last blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/general/the-value-of-identity-context/" title="The Value of Identity Context">The Value of Identity Context</a>, identity is contextual and it is critical to understand that context in a dynamic, fine-grained manner to ensure security, privacy accountability. It was great to see Gartner starting to embrace organisation identity as a discrete identity class at the 2023 IAM summit in London. We will continue discussing this important topic at the upcoming Gartner 2024 IAM summit, where we will be joined on stage by the Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF).</p>
<p>Our development team launched many new features into the IAM platform, both the on-premise and cloud deployments, throughout 2023. As a result we have seen a number of great successes and the growth of our existing customers. It’s a privilege to be working with them as they transition from national to international players in their respective areas. The continuing benefit and the globalisation assistance that is afforded by digital identity is clear to see.</p>
 The growing importance of Verifiable Credentials 
<p>2023 has seen an increasing awareness of the need to verify identity statements and correspondingly the increasing maturity of verifiable credentials is providing a framework to that end. We’ve seen this in our involvement in both EU Digital Identity (EUDI) and GLEIF verifiable LEI projects. vLEI especially, although early stage, is showing great potential with some significant interest from large regulators. We are seeing wider recognition of the underlying technology layer, a maturing of that layer and an increasing eco-system of supporting tooling and technology. I’d like to think we have played our part in this as we progress towards becoming a Qualified vLEI Issuer in 2024. The requirement on legal entities of having and being able to present a verifiable organisation identity will be a growing requirement by business and regulators.</p>
 Looking forward 
<p>Like everyone else, we are hopeful that the macro-economic situation will improve during 2024, we’ll know that when we see the interest rates start to drop, fingers crossed for H2-24. In the meantime, we will charge on regardless, growing our LEI footprint, becoming a qualified vLEI Issuer delivering the next evolution required to progress towards a universal implementation of our vision for the future of digital identity.</p>
<p>As we all look to increase security, reduce fraud, and simplify business interactions, having the correct rights for the context you are in, driven by the organisation you are representing will become a fundamental requirement.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule has been active in the US since&nbsp;2013.  The minimum threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule comes into force in the US is&nbsp;$3000.  To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, US VASPs must verify and share customer identities, ensuring compliance with AML and CFT standards.  <p>About <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/crypto-adoption-index-statistics/">33.7 million Americans</a> own cryptocurrencies in the US, whereas the crypto ownership rate in the country is 13%. Another <a href="https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report/">study</a> reveals that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in&nbsp;2023.</p><p>Even more interesting is the fact that about 63% of current crypto owners want to obtain more crypto, with 21% of non-owners saying the first Bitcoin ETF, which was finally approved in the US on Jan 10, 2024, makes them more likely to invest in cryptocurrency.</p><p>In light of the growing crypto adoption in the country, it is imperative to understand the regulatory aspect, especially the Crypto Travel Rule US. So, let’s get&nbsp;started!</p> Background of the Crypto Regulations &amp; the FATF Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>In the US, there is no formal regulation surrounding crypto as of yet, but they are the focus of both the state and federal governments.</p><p>The Treasury Department treats Bitcoin as a currency while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally treats crypto assets as securities, and the CFTC refers to Bitcoin as a commodity. For federal income tax purposes, crypto is classified as property.</p><p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they must adhere to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and have to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and terrorist financing (CFT) policies.</p><p>Then, there is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">Crypto Travel Rule</a>, which was introduced in June 2019 by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global financial watchdog. The FATF brought cryptocurrencies under the scope of Recommendations 10 to 21 and, most importantly, Recommendation 16 — the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>It’s not as if the Travel Rule itself was conceptualized in 2019, as it has been in existence for many decades as part of the US Bank Secrecy Act to strengthen financial rules and establish communications between traditional financial institutions and law enforcement across borders. In 2012, the FATF included it as one of its Recommendations, and soon, the rest of the world also adopted the FinCEN Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Key Features of the Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US <p>Initially, the FinCEN Travel Rule only applied to banks and required financial institutions to share information about their customers and report any suspicious activities. Then, in June 2019, it was also applied to the crypto industry to prevent illicit activities and ensure compliance with AML policies.</p><p>While the FATF doesn’t clearly explain just how virtual asset service providers (VASPs) should comply with the Travel Rule, the agency does provide general requirements.</p><p>Under the Crypto Travel Rule US, VASPs, including crypto exchanges, OTC traders, hosted wallets, crypto custodial solutions, banks, and other financial bodies, are required to share the identities of their users who are involved in virtual asset transfers exceeding a certain threshold. VASPs must obtain and verify customer identification as well as share it with one&nbsp;another.</p><p>A VASP is defined as a legal person who transfers, exchanges, or stores virtual assets or participates in or provides financial services related to virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The user information that a VASP has to share while processing crypto transactions depends on the transaction value. The Fincen Travel Rule requirements for a value below the $3,000 threshold include:</p>  The name of the sender, i.e., originator, and the recipient, i.e., beneficiary  Both the sender and recipient’s virtual asset wallet address or a unique transaction reference number  <p>If the value of virtual asset transfer exceeds $3,000, VASPs must&nbsp;collect:</p>  Originator’s name, date and place of birth, wallet address, physical address, national identity number, or customer identification number  Beneficiary’s name and wallet&nbsp;address  <p>VASPs must also carry out a counterparty VASP check to confirm that they are dealing with a registered/licensed VASP and that they have sufficient AML/CFT supervision. Moreover, VASPs also have to constantly monitor transactions in order to report any suspicious activity as part of a risk-based approach to AML and&nbsp;CTF.</p><p>VASPs must be licensed and registered in their jurisdiction. Additionally, they are required to screen customer wallets and to share any blacklists with other VASPs and relevant&nbsp;parties.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Through the Crypto Travel Rule, VASPs prevent malicious individuals and entities from using cryptocurrencies for their elaborate money laundering and terrorist financing plans.</p><p>This is achieved by requiring cryptocurrency businesses to collect and share customer information without exposing it to cybersecurity attackers while navigating its varied implementation from country to country. VASPs must also perform due diligence on beneficiary VASPs, maintain records, and report to relevant authorities.</p><p>However, the major challenge with the Crypto Travel Rule is that FATF only provides recommendations, which means it’s up to the member countries to decide whether to implement the rules and how, resulting in varying regulations.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">the United States</a> and Canada have been among the relatively early adopters of the Crypto Travel Rule, while <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the United Kingdom</a> only recently put the rule into&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Not only has the enforcement of the Crypto Travel Rule been at varying rates in different jurisdictions, but it is also interpreted differently and requires different information. Also, the threshold for affected transactions is different, with the FATF recommending $1,000, lower than $3,000 in the&nbsp;US.</p> Country <p>Implementation Year — Transaction Threshold</p> United States <p>2013 — $3,000</p> United Kingdom <p>2023 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over&nbsp;£1,000.</p> Singapore <p>2020 — No minimum threshold. More information is required for transactions over SGD&nbsp;1,500.</p> Japan <p>2023 — ¥100,000</p><p>To address these challenges, it’s crucial for VASPs to adopt a flexible and comprehensive approach, such as a fully automated Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>. This solution can adapt to the diverse regulatory requirements of different jurisdictions while ensuring compliance. Veriscope can provide a unified platform that simplifies the process of collecting, verifying, and sharing customer information securely across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>By implementing such technology, VASPs can effectively navigate the complex landscape of international regulations like the FATF Travel Rule, maintain high standards of customer privacy and data security, and ensure compliance with the varying thresholds and requirements set by different countries.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>As crypto adoption continues to grow globally, countries around the world have been ramping up their efforts to regulate the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>In 2023, over 40 countries engaged in myriad initiatives to develop crypto-focused regulations and legislation — targeting licensing and listing guidance, stablecoin regulation, Travel Rule compliance, and crypto framework development.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">a PwC report</a>, the vast majority of jurisdictions are discussing the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Besides the Travel Rule, regulators are taking a range of approaches to regulate crypto with varying degrees of strictness. Some common approaches adopted include licensing and registration requirements, AML/CTF regulations, consumer protection measures, and determining the appropriate tax treatment.</p><p>In 2023, the US enforced most penalties and took strong legal action against major crypto players, including Binance and Coinbase. This is despite the fact that the country still lacks a comprehensive regulatory framework and has taken the ‘regulation by enforcement’ approach. However, a lot of legislative progress is being made on crypto laws, though there remains a lack of guidance from US regulators.</p><p>This has resulted in a fragmented regulatory landscape in the US, where the SEC regards crypto as securities while the CFTC regulates crypto derivatives, and FinCEN sets the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/what-is-kyc-in-crypto-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it">KYC</a> requirements for crypto businesses.</p><p>The European Union is all set to apply its unified regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>, to ensure financial stability, market integrity, and investor protection. The law came into force in June 2023 and is expected to apply by 2024-end. Meanwhile, the UK plans to bring a range of crypto activities within existing laws governing financial services&nbsp;firms.</p><p>While China has taken a restrictive stance towards crypto, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> recognizes them as legal assets, and India is considering a comprehensive crypto regulation framework.</p><p>Meanwhile, the likes of Singapore, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">the UAE</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> are developing robust regulatory frameworks, demonstrating a global shift towards the regulation of digital assets. This trend is exemplified by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, which has launched a registration regime for digital asset businesses. Similarly, in the Middle East, Dubai has taken a proactive step by launching VARA, or the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, to offer specific zones and guidelines for crypto&nbsp;trading.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The regulatory crypto landscape is constantly evolving, with governments around the world trying to strike a balance between taking advantage of the nascent technology &amp; encouraging innovation and protecting consumers &amp; financial stability. Here, the Crypto Travel Rule aims to play a crucial role in preventing crypto’s usage in money laundering and terrorist financing. However, complying with the Travel Rule requires guidance, a comprehensive solution like Veriscope, and collaboration with other entities and global regulators.</p><p>As the rapidly growing crypto ecosystem continues to mature, we will be seeing regulatory developments and more clarity that will shape the future of this industry.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What is the minimum transaction threshold for the application of the Crypto Travel Rule in the&nbsp;US? <p>In the United States, the Crypto Travel Rule comes into effect for virtual asset transfers exceeding $3,000.</p> Q2: How must US VASPs comply with the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>The US-based VASPs must comply with the FATF Travel Rule by verifying and sharing customer identities to meet anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financing of terrorism (CFT) standards.</p> Q3: Does the Crypto Travel Rule apply to all types of cryptocurrencies and transactions in the&nbsp;US? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule applies to all cryptocurrencies and is triggered for transactions over the specified threshold of $3,000, regardless of the type of cryptocurrency involved.</p> Q4: What are the implications of the FATF Travel Rule for individual cryptocurrency users in the&nbsp;US? <p>While the Travel Rule directly impacts VASPs, individual users may experience stricter identity verification processes and data sharing when transacting amounts over $3,000 through regulated platforms.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 The market for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a>, and micromobility in particular, saw big changes in 2023. François Hoehlinger, former CEO of Troopy and co-founder of TOLV, talks to us about the obstacles facing the micromobility sector, and explains how to enter an industry facing many challenges. 



 What new mobility trends did you see emerge in 2023? 



<p>In 2023, we saw some strong counter-trends in mobility, starting with the micromobility market, which suffered from the market downturn and the drying-up of financing.</p>



<p>Inflation has clashed with micromobility’s recent business model, but there are still some positives: last-mile delivery and cargo bikes. Trends are turning toward green mobility, and battery repair services have also made their mark on the market.</p>



<p>On the software side, companies are increasingly innovating to optimize existing and future mobility business models. In particular, we have seen fund-raising for solutions to optimize journey times and carbon reporting.</p>



<p>We can also mention the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">regulations governing electric scooters</a>, which have <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">become stricter in Paris and have led to the extinction of many players</a>. Cities that have kept fleets of electric scooters have tended to reduce the size of these fleets to optimize their use, and other cities like Paris have cut off these types of services altogether, which is not necessarily the solution to adopt. If we want to make it work for everyone, we sometimes need to give ourselves the means to do so, notably by putting in place the right infrastructure and educating users. Unfortunately, we’re not there yet.</p>



<p>It took public transport 40 to 50 years to carve out a solid place for itself in the mobility landscape. Emerging services in the micromobility market, based on ultra-fast models, will also take some time to find their rightful place.</p>



 What can we expect in 2024? Where is mobility headed? 



<p>For some years now, mobility has not been at the forefront of investors’ minds, as it’s a complicated model to finance, and not always profitable. We’re also seeing a contraction in the market, with fewer startups being financed than in the pre-COVID era. 2024 will be the year of consolidation, as demonstrated by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/micromobility-startups-tier-and-dott-plan-to-merge-to-find-a-path-to-profitability/">TIER’s partnership with Dott in early January</a>.</p>



<p>On the investor side, more flexibility is needed. Mobility business models take time. Look at Uber, which took a long time to stabilize and is now a key player in the market. It’s essential to give mobility players more time to make their way toward the “network effect” and profitability.</p>



<blockquote><p>Today, governments need to agree on a common policy to enable regions and cities to roll out mobility solutions for their citizens, and mobility players to continue to exist. And this is undoubtedly what will take shape in 2024.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



<p>Would you like to know more about the future of mobility? Discover the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">perspectives that will guide mobility in 2024</a>.</p>



 Is there a particular micromobility service (e.g. electric bikes) that is most popular with users? 



<p>The e-scooter is a relatively attractive means of travel for users. Even if, from an ecological point of view, you’ll never do better than walking or cycling, in some big cities it’s simply not possible, or it would take too much time. The scooter is a good way to get around quickly, without too much effort, and at an affordable price.</p>



<p>As for the motorized scooter, it’s the best modal alternative to the car: not only can you cover long distances, but in cities like Paris, it’s much easier to get around than a car, especially during rush hour.</p>



<p>In Paris, the panorama of different means of transportation is vast, and to know what works best with users, we’ll have to wait for a little more insight, in order to better understand modes of transport and the actual modal shift away from individual car use.</p>



 Is collaboration between cities and micromobility operators growing as Mobility as a Service (MaaS) and multimodal travel becomes more popular? What impact is this having on the industry? 



<p>Micromobility players have built their businesses around their ability to get along with municipalities. Some cities, such as Munich and Stockholm, are pioneers in micromobility, while others find it more difficult to establish efficient collaboration with public authorities.</p>



<p>To overcome these inequalities between cities, we should now be able to offer them a catalog of solutions tailored to their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">specific mobility needs</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a>, which enables users to plan, book and pay for an intermodal journey on a single digital platform, will bridge these inequalities or, conversely, sometimes complicate them by adding an additional technical layer to existing systems.</p>



<p>MaaS is a formidable tool, provided it is properly implemented in existing IT systems, but it is costly and complex to set up.</p>



 In France, regulations have become stricter, particularly for the rental of electric scooters. Do you think this will help improve safety on the roads? Or, on the contrary, will it slow the sector’s growth by discouraging users and players? 



<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/01/1197329094/paris-rental-electric-scooter-ban-has-taken-effect">The situation in Paris has not been favorable to electric scooter services</a>. We could have tried setting up test zones to make their use safer and encourage people to work with one another. We are now aware that this sets a precedent that will necessarily be negative for European cities.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">safety issue</a> raised by the use of scooters is an important point; but what is the modal shift to buses or cars following the withdrawal of electric scooters? The aim of micromobility is to help open up cities; removing one of these new means of travel undoubtedly has an impact on citizens’ mobility.</p>



<blockquote><p>If these micromobility systems exist and are to continue to exist, it is imperative that they be integrated into a single, comprehensive approach.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



<p>A number of measures can be taken to provide a better framework for micromobility services.</p>



<p>With Troopy, scooter rental was only available to people over 21 years of age, who had to have a driver’s license and to pass certain additional tests, particularly relating to the vehicle’s motorization. Users who speeded repeatedly were excluded from the service.</p>



<p>Strict rules of use and prevention messages are essential. Let’s not forget that everyone is concerned by the use of the road and urban space, and so everyone needs to be educated, not just users of micromobility services.</p>



 In your opinion, is France a pioneer in micromobility compared to other countries? 



<p>France is a pioneer in the transport sector. Above all, we’re pioneers in terms of transport authorities such as Transdev and RATP.</p>



<p>The emergence of micromobility services was first seen in Northern European countries such as Norway, Sweden and Germany.</p>



<p>Take Stockholm, for example: the city’s bicycle lanes are protected and pedestrianized, and their bike-sharing system is one of the oldest in Europe. They also offer a Voi electric scooter service, a major player in the world of micromobility. Public space is very well shared, and this is what makes the difference between Stockholm and the way we operate in France today, where the approach is much more individualistic.</p>



<p>France has yet to find its own operating model for micromobility. This will require collaboration between transport authorities and mobility players. We need to make the most of our know-how, which has proved its worth to date, in the service of tomorrow’s mobility.</p>



 What are the major challenges facing micromobility players today? Particularly in terms of inclusivity and equality. 



<p>Today, mobility players are fighting to make inclusivity one of the spearheads of mobility in general. The various mobility services were created precisely to open up the countryside and the outskirts of cities.</p>



<p>The aim of micromobility is to enable citizens to move around freely, between metro lines for example, at a relatively accessible cost.</p>



<p>To convince the most reluctant on the topic, micromobility players will be relying on various aspects such as the safety of the vehicles made available, their availability at any time of the day or night and the speed of these means of transport.</p>



 What kind of solutions are micromobility players looking for to ease the use of their services? 



<p>A <a href="https://www.idnow.io/identity-verification/">KYC solution</a> like the one proposed by IDnow is extremely important in my opinion: it saves time and increases efficiency on the service side. Millions of micromobility journeys are recorded every year, which corresponds to thousands of accounts created that need to be verified to ensure the security of the services.</p>



<blockquote><p>Eventually, the creation of unique identifiers to access different mobility services in the same city, as with MaaS, will be the order of the day.</p>François Hoehlinger, co-founder of TOLV</blockquote>



 According to you and your market expertise, what makes the difference between a good KYC tool and a bad one? 



<p>Having compared several KYC solutions myself, the differentiating factors are time savings and the ability to deliver a high-performance tool. A good KYC tool should prevent fraud attempts and automate the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">identity verification process</a> when an account is created on a platform.</p>



 How can someone enter into the mobility market? 



<p>As a company director, you can negotiate with the municipalities and work with the regulators present on the market to make your way, but it doesn’t work every time.</p>



<p>To offer a better structure to all European players, I have created, with the help of five expert co-founders, a free European network called “Intermobility” bringing together over 800 decision-makers in mobility, transport, logistics and energy.</p>



<p>But we’re not stopping there: in February 2024, we’re launching a French “think tank” specialized in these sectors. This think tank will bring together all the decision-makers in the ecosystem, from politicians to financiers, with the aim of restoring the image of the world of transport and making France an economic engine for mobility.</p>



<p>The aim is to bring together the different points of view and visions of mobility players. In the future, this will enable us to make appropriate proposals to move the mobility market toward greater social inclusion, as well as greater ecological and profitable, sustainable business models.</p>
