<p>As a business, Ping Identity helps organizations protect their employees and customers across every digital interaction. But while our core mission is building software that helps keep people and businesses safe online, that’s just part of the bigger picture of building a safer, happier world for everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To that end, we’re committed to building a purpose-led brand that helps make an impact. When you work with Ping, you’re not just investing in software—you’re helping us work towards positive changes that will impact lives and communities around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all that in mind, last December we launched Ping4Good, a program that aims to channel our passion for diversity, inclusion, and sustainability—plus the contributions of our employees, customers, and partners—to support important social and environmental causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our first big project was to plant 26,000 trees across Rwanda, Peru, South Africa, and parts of Northern Africa. That partnership is now starting to bear beautiful fruit. To take a closer look, here’s how we’re supporting community employment, sustainability, and reforestation in Rwanda.</p>

  A recent World Economic Forum article highlighted how regulators had failed the crypto ecosystem, citing their inability to develop well-thought-out regulations.  The report noted that despite the setbacks, cryptography and blockchains would continue playing a crucial role in the interconnected global financial ecosystem.  The most significant damage that back-to-back failures of major crypto projects in 2022 inflicted was the waning trust in crypto&nbsp;finance.  <p>In preparation of its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/events/world-economic-forum-annual-meeting-2023">Annual Meeting in Davos</a> later this month, WEF published <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/future-of-cryptocurrencies-davos2023/">an article </a>that looks into what the future holds for cryprocurrencies, and whose responsibility is the current state of the industry.</p><p>We are in 2023 now, but the after-effects of the past year’s debacles, from the Terra/Luna crash and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) failure to the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, haven’t been fully realized&nbsp;yet.</p><p>These numerous setbacks have wiped out more than $2 trillion from the global crypto market cap, with the digital assets sector officially entering the bear phase, which according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), could be “more of an ice age” than just another crypto&nbsp;winter.</p><p>According to the author of the WEF article, Dante Disparte, Head of Global Policy at USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, while millions of consumers lost money due to the failure of large crypto protocols, the more worrying part is the “waning” trust in the promise of crypto-finance.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/ddisparte/status/1609919364215586817?s=20&amp;t=FvMG3Tu3BTGdD3X_ypeQCQ">Image Source</a>)<p>Despite the setbacks, there are no doubts that “cryptography and blockchains will continue to be integral parts of the modern economic toolkit,” the WEF article added. Countries that enable responsible competition in the crypto sector will likely shape the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Disparte further pointed out how global regulators failed the crypto ecosystem, as all they have done so far is just talk about sensible regulations instead of forming one. Yet, they never missed a chance to sound an alarm about crypto’s excessive risks.</p> Crypto to Remain a “Protagonist” <p>Cryptocurrency regulation is a complex and evolving area with different jurisdictions having different approaches.</p><p>Recently, India’s central bank called for a global crypto framework while mentioning that FTX and Terra crash highlight “inherent vulnerabilities” in the crypto ecosystem.</p><p>India’s apex bank recommended three options, viz: “same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome” approach, outright ban of crypto, stablecoins, and DeFi, and let the sector implode and become systemically irrelevant.</p><p>The US SEC has also been intending to boost crypto exchange enforcement as well as increase its scrutiny of virtual asset service providers. The agency has further called on companies to fully disclose crypto risks, citing “financial distress.”</p> A string of Failures: Is it a Death&nbsp;Knell? <p>The crypto industry setbacks emboldened the crypto critics, who are now blaming all major global problems on the rise of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>On top of that, the bear market has forced many crypto businesses to close their doors while others have been imploding.</p><p>All these has led to a lot of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bd850edf-9c4c-49b0-9449-e0da314f5729">negative press</a> for the industry, and many people are now questioning whether or not it is a viable investment.</p><p>Yet, the article argues, history is riddled with examples of otherwise good technologies being co-opted by bad actors and those ever-present human follies of greed, which are amplified in lightly regulated sectors.</p><p>We could now see the handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to more regulated and established institutions, much like how the dot-com bubble bursting saw the handover of the future of the internet to more durable companies.</p><p>“Indeed, as a test of the staying power of digital assets and blockchains at the core of financial services (and other areas of the global economy), watch what the big banks and mature financial services firms do, not what they say,” points out Disparte.</p><p>The adoption of crypto technology is inevitable, and “for all its faults, this technology remains a protagonist in the global financial world.”</p><p>The way to create a safer crypto industry, as the article concludes, is punishing errants at speed, “giving bad actors few places to&nbsp;hide.”</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to begin complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Every company has different needs. These will depend on company size, location, products they offer, not to mention the current infrastructure in place. Unfortunately, there is not a solution that “fits them all”, and the high maturity of the IT market leads to&nbsp;numerous vendors offering their services. In this context, the main issue is not to cover the needs of an organization, but to choose the best solutions and to understand their advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 
 Process phases&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>Evaluating and selecting vendors and solutions is not an easy task. It is a process and having a solid methodology in place will certainly mitigate the risks in this choice and allow you to evaluate the value of the wide range of options available more quickly. It is challenging to make decisions considering the job to be done, tasks to be completed and customers’ demands. Generally speaking, this process can be divided into five phases:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
  
 
<p>Definition</p>
 
  
 
 
 
<p>It is vital to define the goals of your organization and understand why you need to achieve them. In this sense, it is feasible to identify the priorities, learn about the context, know the vendors and evaluate their performance. At this stage, it is also necessary to establish a time frame. Moreover, businesses will have a clearer description to avoid issues or misunderstanding along the practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
  
 
<p>Framework creation</p>
 
  
 
<p>In order to find the best solution, it is necessary to understand the entire business model and the IT strategies of your organization. Creating a framework also allows you to spot vulnerabilities in your current strategy and tend to them. Thus, this stage should be considered as an opportunity to redesign and improve the practices, moving from good to great. In any case, and regardless the findings on the go, it is essential to keep the existing issues in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
  
 
<p>Request for information</p>
 
  
 
<p>Once the problems are defined, it is time to contact different vendors. There should be a minimum criterion to shortlist the suppliers, such as payment, contracting, disbursement, maintenance, and monitoring. Moreover, it is essential to analyse the services from the technical perspective and understand whether it matches the technical structure of the business that seeks for solutions. It is worth mentioning that having strong knowledge on the market is key to speed this stage up.&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
 
 
  
 
<p>Request for Proposal</p>
 
  
 
<p>At this point, your company already has an idea of the vendors that offer the – apparently - best solutions for your business, and thus final details are to be discussed. You and your stakeholders ask vendors for clarification and for the possibility to amend things in the contract in case they decide to move on. The answers of the vendors must be evaluated to decide for the most suitable supplier.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
  
 
<p>Implementation</p>
 
  
 
<p>Choosing a solution does not mean that the implementation will be a one-time task. There should first be a pre-implementation process, where the solution is tested, and professionals identify gaps. It is likely to change procedures, timing, number of employees, among other factors that might affect the final results. Once the changes are made, the operation runs again with these modifications and the process is tested again. Moreover, monitoring is part of the cycle and a vital procedure during the implementation phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>
 
  
 
<p>Proof of Concept</p>
 
  
 
 
<p>Every tool and process have weaknesses and advantages. It is vital to compare the reality with what was expected. Identifying that the solutions focuses on the problem to be solved is a priority to ensure a well-functioning of the processes. A fair evaluation is needed in order to make changes on time or improve the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 
 
 Can companies do it on their own?&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>There is nothing to indicate that companies cannot attempt to accomplish this process on their own. However, deep knowledge of the market and of its many vendors is undeniably necessary. There are also several risks associated with this process. One of the most common issues companies have is assuming that they do understand their needs, leading them to implement a solution which does not fully satisfy them – when at all. Additionally, implementing the wrong solution could be twice as expensive as implementing a solution which turns out to be inadequate and undoing the damage caused comes at a cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>On the other hand, organizations must consider their staff capabilities. Solutions are very complex and unique requiring training new or existing staff, which could be costly. It is important to keep in mind that every company will promise “the best”, but they do not consider every organization’s particular needs and competencies. In a similar vein, considering the compatibility between the solution offered and the organization’s architecture is crucial. Trying to implement a solution that does not fit properly would be both a waste of time and assets.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>In that sense, a company like KuppingerCole Analysts can help organizations like yours not only to find the best possible solution in the market, but it will also save you time, money, and resources. Structuring and carrying out an IT implementation process is a critical factor of success. Assuring the correct planning will minimize risks, maximize the outcome of endeavours, and consider affordability within the priorities too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>To support organizations in their search for the solution matching their needs, KuppingerCole Analysts launched KC Open Select, an interactive tool that allows users to map their organization's individual Cybersecurity &amp; Digital ID requirements to KuppingerCole’s Intelligence. This user-friendly, fully automated process provides the user with a shortlist of solutions best-suited to the particular needs of their organization from a wide range of services and solutions available. The tool also provides a rating for the vendors, which allows the user to know what other customers think about the services, and whether the vendor will be the best fit for the organization and to face the challenges. KC Open Select will enable organizations to save time, money and resources when researching industry leading vendors and solutions. Try KC Open Select for free: <a href="https://go.kuppingercole.com/open-select">https://go.kuppingercole.com/open-select</a>.</p>
<p></p>
 
 
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
 
 
<p>While no solution can guarantee a 100% efficiency, it is possible to find the best fit possible. Naturally, automation processes to acquire a shortlist of vendors and solutions is a huge help, nevertheless human expertise is also needed. At KuppingerCole our advisors have extensive experience negotiating with vendors, a clear understanding of the market, and proper knowledge about what leaders are doing. The combination of KC Open Select and advice from expert would undeniably support organizations to find what they need. KuppingerCole can offer this, and in the process to find and implement solutions, we will state hypotheses, validate them, and find the most efficient techniques for your organization.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>Are there cases where focusing on governance instead of identity helps achieve our same digital trust goals, while enhancing privacy preservation?</p></blockquote>
<p>In user-controlled digital identity, we often classify entities under the categories of Issuers, Holders and Verifiers. The issuers issue signed credentials to holders (verifiable credentials), while holders present proofs of these signed credentials to any verifier.</p>
<p>A lot of the excitement around this model is because it moves us away from centralized or federated identity management models. This means that identity assertions can now be made directly by the Holder/Prover, without having to ask a third party identity provider (IdP) if an assertion can be trusted. This model makes the Prover their own IdP, creating direct and controlled interactions for them, which should lead to increased privacy-preservation for everyone involved.</p>
<p>This new model that involves the exchange of verifiable credentials is resulting in the emergence of new trust frameworks that can specify things like:</p>
 
 Which issuers are authorized to issue what types of verifiable credentials. 
 Which verifiers are authorized to request what types of verifiable presentations. 
 
<p>If a Verifier no longer relies on the assertions of a trusted IdP, they must gain confidence that the assertions being made by the Prover are in line with the trust frameworks (or governance) they rely on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In federated identity systems, governance is more critical than identity to establish trust. Federated identity systems rely on trust relationships between identity providers, identity brokers, and relying parties. These trust relationships are established through governance mechanisms that ensure that the identity provider and intermediaries have robust processes in place for accurately authenticating user identities and issuing trusted assertions. Without strong governance, relying parties may not have confidence in the system and may be hesitant to accept identity assertions made through it. So can we think that perhaps the same will be true when Provers are their own IdP?</p>
<p></p>
<p>^ [A <a href="https://northernblock.io/governance-and-trust-with-scott-perry/">podcast episode</a> on Governance and Trust that Scott Perry and I did recently which you may find interesting.]</p>
<p>Inside the user-controlled model, the adherence to trust frameworks can be verified cryptographically. This means that a Verifier can gain confidence that an assertion being made by a Prover meets their policies, since it relies on credential data issued by what they would categorize as an authorized Issuer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as Verifiers know that credential data originated from an authorized Issuer, is Identity information then even required to be shared with them? In order to validate that my financial report was issued to my company by a certified audit body, must a verifier know the issuing firm’s identity, or can they gain enough assurance just by knowing that my company’s financial report comes from an audit firm within a trusted list that they use?</p>
<p>If there is a legal/policy requirement for the Verifier to know the Issuer, then of course their identity information can be exchanged. But should exchanging identity information be a baseline requirement? In a lot of cases, enough trust can be established simply by knowing that the assertion guarantees compliance to a set of governing rules that are important to you.</p>
<p>Being able to cryptographically prove adherence to trust frameworks is more valuable than proving an identity itself. I would have to prove adherence to a trust framework anyways, even if I divulge the identity information, whereas the opposite isn’t always true.</p>
<p>If there is no policy reason for a Verifier to know the identity information of the Issuer, can’t we achieve the same trust by (1) cryptographically proving credential data hasn’t been altered since issuance, and (2) cryptographically proving that the issuing entities who signed my credentials are within your accepted trust framework for the assertion that I’m making?</p>
<p>Doesn’t this model set a far better baseline for privacy preservation?</p>
<p>Just some thoughts..</p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.<p>The post <a href="https://northernblock.io/prioritizing-governance-assertions-over-identity-assertions/">Prioritizing Governance Assertions Over Identity Assertions</a> appeared first on <a href="https://northernblock.io">Northern Block | Self Sovereign Identity Solution Provider</a>.</p>

Random permutations of these attributes can create different NFTs.</p><p>*Image source:&nbsp;Internet</p><p>So, if you want to create a series of 1000 NFTs with 3 attributes of eyes, face ornaments and clothes, what you need to do is not to draw 1000 pictures, but 31 PNGs, i.e. 1 picture of the main character, 10 pictures of eyes, 10 pictures of face ornaments and 10 pictures of clothes, and then complete the combination of NFT pictures in batch (1*10³) by a random generation program.</p> Step 2: Upload to Marketplace <p>Once you have done so, you can publish your NFT work through the various NFT marketplaces.</p><p>Take Opensea as an example, after logging in with your own data client, click [Create] and fill in the information about the NFT to publish your NFT. When you want to sell it, you need to pay a certain amount of Gas fee to be able to auction it on the&nbsp;market.</p> Step 3: Display in the metaverse <p>Of course, NFTs areis not only showcased onin the NFT market, but metaverse projects such as Decentraland and Cryptovoxels also provide athe stage for&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>*Image source: Decentraland</p><p>If a visitor is interested in your work, and your work happens to be for sale on Opensea, there is the possibility of a direct transaction., Ffor example, Decentraland can jump directly to Opensea, and of course the metaverse is not limited to the work that can be shown in PFP (although PFP is still the most popular hottest at the moment). With the growing interest in the virtual land sector, NFTs and the metaverse are opening their doors to architects as&nbsp;well.</p> If you are an architect <p>For architects, the current phase of the virtual land and property boom is the perfect time to get in on the action, such as the creation of scenes in Decentraland.</p><p>Let’s take here the example of The Builder, a tool for creating 3D scenes in Decentraland that does not require writing&nbsp;code.</p> Step 1: Create a&nbsp;scene <p>After entering the official website and logging in, click on [BUILDER], you can start creating scenes on this page. The size of the scene can be adjusted by rows and columns (the current area cannot exceed 32). FAnd for the time being, only rectangular scenes are supported, irregularly shaped scenes can only be achieved through the&nbsp;SDK.</p><p>Also, the ground in the scene can be selected from the ‘Asset’ column with various ground textures. In addition to this, Decentraland itself offers a wide range of content for the creator to choose from. It is up to the user to decide how the contents of the scene are combined, displayed, etc. The user can simply click on the item and drag it to any location in the scene. If you want to add a 3D model built outside Decentraland, you can do the following:</p>  Create 3D models using SketchUp, Blender, Maya,&nbsp;etc.;  Use The Builder tool to import, the model format must be gltf or&nbsp;glb;  Click New Asset Pack in the scene&nbsp;editor;  Drag in the model&nbsp;file;  Select Import&nbsp;Assets;  After naming the asset pack, press 【Create Asset&nbsp;Pack】.  <p>After importing, there is no difference between using the new asset package and using the asset package that comes with the&nbsp;project.</p> Step 2: Release scenarios <p>When you have finished creating it and pressed [Publish], it means the publishing is successful. There are two options for the launch: one for the scene pool and one for your own&nbsp;land.</p><p>Note that if you have your own land, you can choose to use the created scene on your own land. Of course, you can also choose to publish it in the scene pool for display, and for others to use to earn&nbsp;money.</p> Conclusion <p>Whether you are a painter or an architect, there is a tremendous opportunity to take a shot at and cash in on the metaverse in the future. Such spontaneous opportunities are rare in the centralized Web2 and will be more readily available in a metaverse with fewer rules and strictures. In addition to the above areas, unprecedented directions like Digital Fashion are giving traditional apparel designers new options. But before this can begin, designers still need to create a decentralized account, and furthermore a DID, through decentralized Web3 portal clients like ONTO, MetaMask, etc., to help them accumulate personal value and data and achieve more economization of their behavior and&nbsp;data.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/lets-make-an-nft-a98391db97bd">Let’s make an NFT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Here we are again, the start of a new year. It does feel like 2023 arrived more softly than previous years. Maybe due to 2022 being a year that globally progressed very differently than we all expected.</p>
<p>At Ubisecure we’ve been pushing forward on many initiatives for the last 12 months, and now is a good time to surface and reflect on what has been achieved.</p>
 Continued Growth 
<p>Ubisecure is a private company and so we do not publish detailed financials, but we are pleased to announce that we are definitely the right side of the ‘<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/saas-and-the-rule-of-40-keys-to-the-critical-value-creation-metric">rule of 40</a>’. I think given the global economic climate and the continuing macro situation this is a great result and will serve us well into 2023.</p>
 The return of face-to-face events 
<p>One of the really positive aspects of 2022 has been the return of in-person events. In 2022 we were fortunate to meet identity ecosystem stakeholders and present at the Gartner IAM event in London (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/european-reusable-strong-identity/" title="read our event summary">read our event summary</a>), as well as cybersecurity events in New York, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Finland. We also attended our first face-to-face KYC in Banking event where we presented alongside the GLEIF on the value of organisation identity in client onboarding., The immediate feedback and connection you get from face-to-face presentations results in a far more fluid, engaged and valuable session. I do expect 2023 to continue and grow in that regard and we already have a number of speaking engagements booked.</p>
 And the rise of the vLEI 
<p>We were very proud to be working closely with the GLEIF back in May and June for the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/vlei-101/" title="Verifiable-LEI pilot">Verifiable-LEI pilot</a> that took place. Ubisecure acted as the Qualified vLEI Issuer for the pilot and the credentials issued were used to sign the GLEIF 2021 report. This is a great step forward for the wider LEI eco-system and directly supports our previous predictions of the convergence of classical identity and Verifiable Credentials. During 2023 we will be working with the GLEIF to become a full QVI that can deliver commercially consumable and scalable credentials, so watch this space for more details.</p>
 New Logo Wins 
<p>Taking great care of our existing customers is always a #1 priority for us but growing that customer base is a close #2. We’ve welcomed some great new customers in 2022 – ranging from global media giants to several of the world’s largest banks. UK innovation and Nordic excellence are a winning combination and serving us very well as we expand beyond our Nordic footprint.</p>
 Organisation Identity growth 
<p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/">LEI registration</a> through our RapidLEI brand is going from strength to strength. We remain the #1 issuer of validated LEIs per month, every month. We are the leading provider of GLEIF Validation Agent services through our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> proposition, which is now being used by several of the top ten largest banks.</p>
<p>The LEI eco-system itself is growing well through a number of initiatives, the <a href="https://iccwbo.uk/blogs/press-releases/icc-centre-for-digital-trade-innovation-launches-preparations-for-uk-trade-to-go-digital">UK paperless trade bill</a> and the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/cbp-customs-border-protection-lei/">US Customs &amp; Border Protection global business identifier program</a> clearly mark the LEI as the essential identifier of 2022.</p>
 Spreading the word 
<p>Being at the center of a number of digital identity initiatives we have a wide array of connections into the broader identity industry who we think have plenty of interesting things to say, and it seems many of you agree with us. Over the last year our ‘Lets talk about Digital Identity’ podcast series has doubled its listenership, thanks to the many fantastic guests and introduction of the innovative “Identity Stories Series”. If you have not heard it yet, please have a look and listen to our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/lets-talk-about-digital-identity-podcast/" title="#LTADI podcast episodes">#LTADI podcast episodes</a> and see why so many people are subscribing. </p>
 Looking forward in 2023 
 Driving the vision 
<p>Our belief in the power of digital identity to precisely express who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have when representing them through a combination of highly assured Organisation Identity and strong authenticated Individual Identity defines the core of our focus as we navigate 2023. Read about the Ubisecure <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/corporate/vision-the-future-digital-identity/" title="vision for the future of digital identity">vision for the future of digital identity</a> or watch the short video below:</p>
 
  
 
<p></p> 
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Driving growth through global initiatives 
<p>There are a number of global initiatives in play that intersect with our vision, from the cross-border EU ID to GAIN to vLEI. These global efforts all leverage the LEI as the underlying Organisation Identifier and go some way to enabling an expression of representation. The derived, most often through delegation, expression of rights connected to that representation is where Ubisecure delivers a step change in value to these propositions.</p>
 Driving pace 
<p>We have a lot to do but we have a growing team of experts who are working hard on pushing us forward, both technically and commercially. It’s the Ubisecure people that really make the difference to what we do. If you would like to be part of the journey, please speak to us, we are always looking for great, like-minded people to <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/about/careers/" title="join the team">join the team</a>.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year, wherever you are, and look forward to what 2023 brings to the world of identity management.</p>

<p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>내년 상반기 예정된 DEX(탈중앙화 거래소) 런칭에 앞서, 여러분의 이해를 도울 수 있는 아티클을 준비했습니다. DEX란 무엇이고 왜 DEX가 필요한지 메타디움 앰배서더의 아티클을 통해&nbsp;소개합니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p> DEX란 무엇이고, 왜&nbsp;필요한가 <p>안녕하세요 여러분! 메타디움 앰배서더 Cyber G입니다. 오늘은 메타디움에 처음 생기는 DEX와 관련하여 여러분께 설명드리고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>암호화폐를 거래해보신 분들이라면 업비트, 빗썸과 같은 암호화폐 거래소에 익숙하실거라 생각합니다. 이메일을 통해 가입을 진행하고, 강력한 비밀번호를 지정하고, 계정을 인증하고, 암호화폐를 거래하는 방식의 거래소 말입니다. 이러한 중앙화 거래소의 경우, 자산을 거래하기 위해서는 플랫폼 내부로 먼저 입금 과정이 이루어져야 합니다. 그런데, 최근, 세계에서 두번째로 큰 FTX 거래소의 경우, 사용차 예치금의 일대일 준비금을 보유하지 않은 것으로 보여집니다. FTX 거래소 측은 사용자 자산을 FTX 경영진에게 개인 용도로 빌려주거나 자회사인 알라메다 리서치에게 빌려주는 등 다양한 방법으로 자산을 유용하였으며, 결국 사용자들은 인출이 불가능하게 되고 FTX 거래소가 파산하는 등 국내에서도 많은 피해자가 생기는 등 글로벌적으로 큰 이슈가&nbsp;되었습니다.</p>그림 1. 암호화폐 거래소 FTX의 급속한&nbsp;붕괴<p>이러한 사건 이후, DEX에 대한 관심이 급격히 늘어나고 있습니다. 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 거래량은 2022년 11월에 이미 910억 달러에 이르렀으며, 이는 10월 전체에 비해 79% 증가한 것입니다. DEX는 중앙화 거래소를 제치고 현재 현물 거래량이 2022년 9월의 10.8%에서 16.7%로&nbsp;증가했습니다.</p>그림 2. 유니스왑의 일일 DEX 거래량 볼륨&nbsp;차트<p>이더리움 체인 위에서 이더리움과 ERC-20 토큰 간의 자동 교환 거래를 용이하게 하도록 설계된 탈중앙화 거래소(DEX)의 대표주자, 유니스왑의 거래량 차트를 보면 이를 확인할 수 있습니다. Uniswap은 거래량과 사용자 수를 기준으로 최고의 DEX입니다. 설립자 Hayden Adams는 최근 Twitter에 Uniswap이 이더/미국 달러 거래 쌍의 일일 거래량에서 Coinbase를 능가했다고 게시하기도 했는데요. 초기 탈중앙화 거래소는 과도한 가스비 초래, 확장의 한계성, 부족한 유동성 등의 문제가 있어 큰 관심을 받지 못했습니다. 유니스왑은 이러한 한계성을 보완하여 출시하였는데요. 특히 AMM(유동화된 마켓 메이커) 알고리즘 기반으로 유동성 풀(pool, 스마트 컨트랙트 내에 동결되어 있는 자금)을 제공하여 낮은 유동성이라는 한계점을 보완하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성을 공급하는 자들에게 별도의 보상을 지급하는 방식으로 유동성 공급 문제를 해결하였습니다. 유니스왑은 유동성 마이닝이라는 시스템으로 성립되어 있어 토큰을 특정 풀에 맡기면 전용 거버넌스 토큰인 UNI를 보상으로 받을 수 있습니다. UNI는 일종의 거버넌스 토큰(Governance Token)으로서 가격이 결정되어 있으며 디지털자산 거래소에서 간편하게 교환할 수 있습니다. 또한, 유니스왑은 중앙관리자가 없어 디지털자산의 상장 이라는 개념이 존재하지 않습니다. 이에 누구나 유니스왑에 ERC-20 토큰의 유동성을 공급하여 해당 토큰의 교환을 용이하게 만들 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p>그림 3. 중앙화 거래소와 탈중앙화 거래소의 차이점&nbsp;제시<p>이처럼 DEX에서는 개인 자산을 중앙화 기관인 제3자에게 맡기지 않고 본인의 암호화폐 지갑에 보관하고, DEX 사용시에만 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 자산을 거래하게 됩니다. 그렇기에 귀찮은 가입 과정을 요구하지 않습니다. 대부분의 경우, 암호화폐를 입금 또는 출금할 필요도 없습니다. 거래는 두 사용자의 지갑 사이에서 직접 진행되며, 제3자의 개입 또한 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해 제한되게 됩니다. 따라서, 자신의 자금에 대한 통제권을 넘겨주지 않아도&nbsp;됩니다.</p> 그렇다면, Metadium에 DEX가 생긴다는 건 어떠한 의미를&nbsp;가질까요? <p>첫번째로, 메타디움 2.0에서 많은 Dapp을 생태계로 온보딩시키기 위해 각 Dapp들의 생태계를 이어주는 징검다리 역할을 DEX가 하게 됩니다. A라는 프로젝트가 있다고 가정해볼께요. DEX에서는 해당 프로젝트의 토큰을 구매하거나, 혹은 유동성 풀에 유동성을 제공하여 프로젝트에서 제공하는 A 토큰을 에어드랍받는 등 각 프로젝트에 참여할 수 있는 기회가 DEX를 통해 생기게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>두번째로, 다양한 체인의 자산들이 Metadium 생태계로 들어오게 됩니다. 체인별로 암호화폐 자산을 전송하는 브릿지를 통해 메타디움 메인넷 안의 DEX에서 각 자산들이 활용되게 되면서, 생태계 내 유동성 볼륨은 더 성장하게 되고, 이는 메타디움 메인넷에 크게 기여하게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>마지막으로, DEX 사용을 통해 투명하고 안전한 거래를 할 수 있습니다. 모든 거래는 메타디움 블록체인 상에 기록되며, 누구나 그 정보를 열람할 수 있습니다. 또한, 자산의 거래는 P2P 방식으로 진행되며, 스마트 컨트랙트에 의해서만 구동되게&nbsp;됩니다.</p><p>이처럼 탈중앙화 생태계의 확장에 기여하게 될 DEX. 그리고 DEX를 통해 온보딩되어 성장하게 될 다양한 프로젝트들. 여기의 주인공은 메타디움을 사랑해주시고 이용해주시는 여러분입니다. 국내 최정상급의 블록체인 기술 기업 Ozys와 함께, 메타디움 재단은 생태계 확장에 도움이 될 DEX 런칭에 최선을 다하고 있습니다. 이전 메타디움의 로드맵 중 하나였던 Defi 서비스 “MSPACE” 관련 기획 경험과 암호화폐 시장 현황을 토대로 분석하여, 최적의 시기에 최고의 DEX서비스를 런칭할 것입니다. 메타디움 2.0의 빛나는 미래. 지금 함께&nbsp;시작합니다!</p> 참고문헌 <p>1. “DEXs Gain Market Share As Faith In Centralized Crypto Players Erodes”, Forbes, last modified Nov 23. 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40">https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2022/11/23/dexs-gain-market-share-as-faith-in-centralized-crypto-players-erodes/?sh=44cde3b33f40</a></p><p>2. “Uniswap의 대응 가능한 시장 확대”, messari report, last modified Nov 21. 2022, <a href="https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market">https://messari.io/report/expanding-uniswaps-addressable-market</a></p><p>메타디움 공식 채널 팔로우하고 메타디움의 최신 소식을&nbsp;확인하세요!</p><p><a href="http://metadium.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://discord.gg/2dhC5Zfay7">Discord</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Medium</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metadium">Facebook</a> | <a href="http://t.me/MetadiumNotice">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadium">LinkedIn</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/%EB%A9%94%ED%83%80%EB%94%94%EC%9B%80-%EC%95%84%ED%8B%B0%ED%81%B4-dex-%ED%83%88%EC%A4%91%EC%95%99%ED%99%94-%EA%B1%B0%EB%9E%98%EC%86%8C-ff7d58ee9694">메타디움 아티클: DEX(탈중앙화 거래소)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I promised an update on the status of all the moving pieces of the Holochain development experience. I wanted to do it once it was ready for hApp devs to port their existing codebases over to the new beta release candidate, and while it took longer than we expected, it’s finally here. And not only that, but the new scaffolding tool is ready for new devs ready to build their first hApp!</p><p>Here’s a full list of things that are ready for existing and new devs:</p>  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2  HDI 0.2.0-beta-rc.1 and HDK 0.1.0-beta-rc.1  The <code>hc</code> command-line tool, including <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code>  Tryorama, the hApp testing framework  The JavaScript client  Integration of all the above into Holonix, the Holochain development environment  <p>Here are the things that are still being updated:</p>  Holochain Launcher for end-users  The DevHub hApp for distributing hApps  The Rust client   Holochain release notes  Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0: Signed zome calls, API and gossip changes <p>Release date: 15 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: admin API, app API, network protocol</p><p>The developers have packed a fair number of changes into this release in order to present a first release candidate that resembles our vision for the beta release as closely as possible. Read on to learn what you need for refactoring your hApp and tests.</p><p>Breaking (app API): The change with the biggest impact is that all zome calls must have a valid capability and be signed. The end-user Launcher hosts UIs in a WebView and signs calls with the author key using the built-in Lair keystore, which lets it use the author capability for all calls. That means you don’t need to worry about hApps deployed for use in this context. The Holo-hosted context has also had support for built-in signing and now applies it to zome calls. Finally, the web browser context lets you authorise a browser-generated public key for signing calls. There are some other changes to the RPC message envelope format, but the JS client lib already supports those. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1510">#1510</a>)</p><p>Breaking (admin API, app API): The two conductor APIs have had name changes and removals of some deprecated endpoints. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1704"> #1704</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1707"> #1707</a>,<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1719"> #1719</a>) In the admin API:</p>  The deprecated <code>InstallApp</code> has been deleted, and <code>InstallAppBundle</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.InstallApp">InstallApp</a></code>. (Note: this endpoint can receive app bundle manifest blobs or filesystem paths.)  The deprecated <code>ActivateApp</code>, <code>DeactivateApp</code>, <code>ListActiveApps</code>, and <code>ListEnabledApps</code> have been removed.  <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> and moved to the app API.  <code>DeleteArchivedCloneCells</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.DeleteCloneCell">DeleteCloneCell</a></code>, which only allows the deletion of one cell at a time.  <p>In the app API:</p>  <code>ZomeCall</code> has been renamed to <code>CallZome</code>.  <code>ArchiveCloneCell</code> has been renamed to <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.DisableCloneCell">DisableCloneCell</a></code>.  <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.EnableCloneCell">EnableCloneCell</a></code> (formerly <code>RestoreArchivedCloneCell</code>) has been moved here from the admin API.  <code>GossipInfo</code> has been replaced with <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AppRequest.html#variant.NetworkInfo">NetworkInfo</a></code>, which now returns only the number of ops a node expects to receive and their combined size. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)  <p>Breaking (admin API, app API): All data structure names (struct names and fields, enum names and variants) are serialised to snake case over the WebSocket ports. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1694">#1694</a>)</p><p>Breaking (network protocol): Gossip rounds no longer transfer ops; they only share information on what ops should be transferred, for later transfer via a processing queue. This is intended to break up network bottlenecks as part of our ongoing real-world performance improvement work for beta. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1662">#1662</a>)</p><blockquote>We’ll keep testing the impact of this change in the coming weeks, but preliminary automated and human testing with simulated and real networks is looking very good. The DHT feels more ‘live’, which is exactly what we want to see as we get Holochain ready for production-ready hApps serving real users.</blockquote><p>New: The <code>hc</code> command has gotten the ability to run subcommands — any commands in your system’s <code>PATH</code> that start with <code>hc-</code>. This includes the new <code>hc launch</code> and <code>hc scaffold</code> commands: <code>hc launch</code> uses the Launcher in CLI mode to start a hApp and open up a WebView window, and <code>hc scaffold</code> is a powerful new tool that lets you build out boilerplate code really quickly. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1680">#1680</a>)</p> Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.1: Bug fix in app installation <p>Release date: 16 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.0<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>Bugfix (admin and app APIs): This is exactly why we have release candidates, folks — to find and fix bugs. As part of the work getting the Launcher updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, we discovered some bugs in a couple API functions. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1725">#1725</a>)</p>  The admin API’s <code>InstallApp</code> was returning an empty set of cells; now it returns the cells that were installed.  The app API’s <code>CallZome</code> would let you call functions in disabled clone cells; now it returns an error.   Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 23 December 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.2.0-beta-rc.1<br>HDK compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.1<br>Breaking changes: HDI, HDK, admin API</p><p>Breaking (HDI, HDK, admin API): The <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/holochain_types/prelude/enum.GrantedFunctions.html"><code>GrantedFunctions</code></a> type in a capability grant has changed to an enum, with which you can specify either a list of functions (as before) or a wildcard. This was prompted by the need to make Tryorama tests easier to write after signed zome calls became mandatory, but it can also be useful for UIs. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1732">#1732</a>)</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20221223034701">Read the full release notes</a> for the last three releases.</p> Known issues   The ‘latest’ version of the documentation for the release candidates, including <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdi/0.2.0-beta-rc.1/hdi/">hdi</a></code>, <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.1.0-beta-rc.1/hdk/">hdk</a></code>, and <code><a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.1.0-beta-rc.2/holochain_conductor_api/">holochain_conductor_api</a></code>, are pointing to the pre-beta-RC version; use the version selector at the top of the page to choose the latest version.  The standalone <code>holochain</code> binary sometimes crashes on macOS after startup.  Holochain occasionally errors out on startup when there’s no network connection — if you can reproduce this, please let us know. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/1580">#1580</a>)  If a countersigning session fails, the results returned by <code>must_get_*</code> in the middle of the session (either in the zome call or during validation) are inconsistent with the actual DHT state.  macOS builds of the Lair keystore are currently having troubles. We intend to officially support macOS (and Windows via WSL2) for developers by the beta in January.  Passing <code>InstallApp</code> a large hApp bundle as a blob over Websocket can fail; we believe this is because of a WebSocket transfer limit.   Client release notes  JavaScript client 0.10.0 to 0.10.4: Holochain/Holo API unification <p>I’m going to collapse the 0.10.x release series into one changelog, because (a) none of these releases support Holochain 0.1.x (the only supported version is 0.0.175), and (b) the work all pertains to the unification of the Holochain JavaScript client with the Holo Web SDK. Once this work is done, you’ll be able to code to one API and swap out the connection backend based on the environment the app is running.</p>  0.10.0, released 7 December 2022, updates the client to work with Holochain 0.0.175, which included some<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-approaching/#holochain-00175-renaming-things"> changes in the HDK and conductor APIs</a> that ripple out to the client. It also introduces <code>AppAgentClient</code>, a common interface for accessing hApps via a local connection or the Holo hosting network. (Currently the only implementation is <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code>, which uses a local connection.) As the changelog says, “hApp devs will now be able to write the majority of their client code using the <code>AppAgentClient</code> interface, completely agnostic as to whether they're in a pure holochain or holo context.” Support has also been added for the admin API’s <code>GossipInfo</code> endpoint, which lets a UI display DHT health info. (Note: this endpoint will change in Holochain 0.1.0-beta.rc0, which means it’s incompatible with this client release.)  0.10.1, released 8 December 2022, changes the event emitter library from <code>events</code> to <code>emittery</code>, to make bundling easier.  0.10.2, released on 12 December 2022, makes the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> object available to consumers (note that this is hidden again in 0.11.7).  0.10.3, released on 12 December 2022 as well, replace a dependency on lodash with lodash-es to give better compatibility with modern ECMAScript implementations.  0.10.4, released on 14 December, changes the <code>getLauncherEnvironment</code> function to synchronous. This function is exposed by the backend object representing the Launcher environment with its embedded WebViews in place of spawned browser windows.   JavaScript client 0.11.0: Holochain Beta-RC support, signed zome calls <p>Release date: 18 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>In addition to the breaking conductor API changes that came with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 (see above), this client also supports the new requirement that every zome call have a valid capability. In general, this is handled automatically or nearly automatically for all three client contexts that this library supports:</p>  In the Launcher and Holo-hosted contexts, the environment will handle signing using the author capability (that is, all calls are signed using the private key of the source chain owner).  In the web browser context, there’s a new async function <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair()</code> that generates a key in-browser and asks the conductor to authorise it using the admin API. This is not secured right now; the conductor will always approve the request. In the future, conductor managers (such as the Launcher) will likely show some sort of popup asking for authorisation, and the in-browser keypair will be secured with a password on page close. Note that this function has a name change in 0.11.4.   JavaScript client 0.11.1 to 0.11.9: Maintenance, bugfixes, and breaking changes <p>Once we released the updated JavaScript client we discovered some issues that necessitated a series of bugfixes. There are also some refactors of previously introduced functionality. Versions 0.11.1 to 0.11.8 all support Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, while 0.11.9 supports 0.1.0-beta-rc.2.</p>  0.11.1, released on 18 December 2022, introduces a breaking change: the provenance field has been removed from <code>AppAgentCallZomeRequest</code>, because the provenance is provided by the backend in all three contexts (Launcher, web browser, and Holo-hosted).  0.11.2, released on 20 December 2022, fixes a bug in bundling the client module, where the WebSocket serialisation module (written in WASM) wasn’t getting bundled. It also introduces a breaking change, in which all deprecated conductor API functions (see release notes for Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 above) have been removed. Finally, it adds a TypeScript type definition for the new <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> function.  0.11.3, released on 21 December 2022, fixes a bug in serialisation.  0.11.4, released on the same day, refactors the in-browser signing key machinery and introduces one breaking change, renaming <code>authorizeNewSigningKeyPair</code> to <code>authorizeSigningCredentials</code>.  0.11.5, released on the same day, fixes a bug in the Launcher context implementation.  0.11.6, released on the same day, reverts some of the changes introduced in 0.11.3 that caused a regression in compatibility with the Launcher.  0.11.7, released on the same day, introduces a breaking change, re-hiding the <code>AppAgentWebsocket</code> implementation introduced in 0.10.2.  0.11.8, released on 21 December 2022, reorganises some code involved in the new signing code and introduces breaking changes as a consequence.  0.11.9, released on 23 December 2022, introduces a breaking change in the introduction of the new wildcard option for capability grants, bringing it up to date with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2’s admin API.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases">Read the full changelogs.</a></p> Test framework release notes <p>Note: if you’re writing Rust-based tests with Sweettest, the version included in the <code>holochain</code> crate is always up to date.</p> Tryorama 0.9.1 and 0.9.2: TryCP additions and Holochain 0.0.175 <p>Again, I’m collapsing the 0.9.x series of Tryorama because they target older Holochain versions.</p>  0.9.1, released 26 October 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.165 to 0.0.171, features two additions to TryCP, the distributed test orchestrator. <code>ClientsPlayersOptions</code> can take a partial config parameter, allowing you to specify defaults for all players and fill in specific missing config for each player later. And the shortcut function <code>stopAllTryCpServers</code> lets you shut down multiple servers at once.  0.9.2, released 12 December 2022 and compatible with Holochain 0.0.175, bumps the JavaScript client to 0.10.3 and breaks compatibility with previous Holochain releases. The TryCP orchestrator also now exposes the conductor admin API endpoints <code>get_dna_definition</code> and <code>grant_zome_call_capability</code>.   Tryorama 0.10.0: Holochain Beta-RC support <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 and 0.1.0-beta-rc.1</p><p>This is the release needed to test your hApp against the updated Holochain — and test Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.* and report any bugs you find! Building on the newest JavaScript client, it reflects all the changes to the conductor APIs that I described above.</p> Tryorama 0.10.1: Wildcard cap grants <p>Release date: 21 December 2022<br>Holochain compatibility: 0.1.0-beta-rc.2</p><p>Breaking: After updating Tryorama to the new beta release candidate of Holochain, tests became much more challenging to write because of the requirement to sign all zome calls. Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 introduced wildcard function matches for cap grants for this very reason. This version adds support for wildcards, allowing you to generate a single wildcard grant at the beginning of your test script.</p><p>To update your tests for the Tryorama 0.10 series, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/pull/152/files">check the diffs</a> to see all the name changes, removals, and additions, and read the excellent<a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.10.0/docs/tryorama.md"> documentation</a>.</p> The new scaffolding tool: like Rails, but for dApps! <p>Guillem Cordoba, creator of the previous scaffolding GUI tool, has applied his skill once again to this tool after receiving feedback from other devs in the community.</p><blockquote>Now it’s a lot &nbsp;like Ruby on Rails’ celebrated scaffolder, which empowered a generation of developers to create basic, working web apps in just a few minutes. This brings that same power to distributed web apps!</blockquote><p>It’s all driven by the command line, and it lets you create and edit project folders, DNAs, zomes, UIs, entry and link types, and collections. It’ll even update existing code as you add new features to your hApp.</p><p>We think this scaffolding tool will be a game-changer for hApp development. Now, newcomers to Holochain who are comfortable with the command line can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">create and run a demo forum hApp</a> in less than a minute, and create the basic code for their own hApp in less than an hour. Because the design decisions involved in building a hApp are slightly different from what devs are used to, it guides you through sensible default choices. It’ll also likely have contextual help in the future.</p><p>What it makes accessible for new hApp devs, it also makes quick and easy for experienced ones. A lot of boilerplate code can be generated in moments with the various scaffolding commands available.</p><p>I’ll feature the scaffolding tool in the next Dev Pulse, but until then, try <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/#scaffold-your-first-holochain-app">generating a sample hApp</a> learn more about its <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/happ-setup/">project structure</a> in the Holochain developer website, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_scaffolding_cli/latest/holochain_scaffolding_cli/">check out the full documentation</a>. I think you’ll like what you see, no matter your level of experience.</p> Go forth and code! <p>If you’re a hApp developer with existing code, now is the time to update your zome, UI, and test code and look for bugs and rough edges in Holochain. Your <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/">feedback</a> will help us get Holochain ready for its beta release.</p><p>If you’re a newcomer with some Rust and JavaScript experience who wants to start building hApps, I invite you to <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">install Holochain</a>, read the Core Concepts, and try creating something this weekend!</p><p>If you’re an end-user who’s eager to start using a real hApp, we have a working-but-unreleased version of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/">Launcher</a> with greatly improved network performance. We're testing it internally and fix any bugs before we release it. Once that happens, you’ll find a sample sticky notes / kanban app in the hApp store, and you can expect to see more apps as devs update them.</p><blockquote>Happy new year to everyone who follows the Gregorian calendar. I wish you great success whatever you’re up to, and I’m excited about all the ways that a rapidly maturing Holochain might be able to support your endeavours.</blockquote><p>And by the way — I love talking with people about this stuff. If you’ve got a plan for a way to use Holochain to support new ways of creating, sharing, connecting and doing business, come to the <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Holochain developers’ Discord</a> and share your ideas. I’ll be there to help you figure out how Holochain can fit into your plan.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@philton88?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Parker Hilton</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/JqDNL8vBsHs?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 Shyft Veriscope — What, Why,&nbsp;How <p>During the last two months of the past year, we ran an extensive social media campaign to educate our audience on everything about Veriscope and why it matters to the ecosystem’s future. Before continuing with our educational series, we want to sum up all the key insights we covered during the campaign for a better understanding of what Veriscope actually is and why it&nbsp;matters.</p> WHAT  The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>First things first: the Travel Rule. With more countries enforcing the Travel Rule, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) have no choice but to comply. To be compliant while respecting user privacy, VASPs must solve two critical issues: address attribution and data transfer.</p><p>The attribution problem refers to the need to identify &amp; provably verify the owner of a beneficiary wallet address accurately. As for the data transfer issue, it arises because there is no global framework for securely transferring Travel Rule data between&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Shyft Discover <p>Shyft Discover, the first component of Shyft Network’s critical Travel Rule infrastructure, enables a VASP to know who their counterparty VASP is. This is crucial as VASPs share critical user data along with the crypto transaction to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Sharing critical information with a wrong VASP having dubious intentions would constitute a data privacy breach. Here’s where Shyft Discover can make a difference, as it can save VASPs from such a predicament.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1592616375113195522?s=20&amp;t=-V4SQXgM31xRKaB1SbYkmg">Click here</a> to learn all about Shyft Discover.</p> Attestations <p>Attestations enable Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to transmit user data along with a transaction while keeping user data confidential.</p><p>Analogically, the attestation workflow resembles sticking confidential notes on a public bulletin board. <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1594873575336710144?s=20&amp;t=-V4SQXgM31xRKaB1SbYkmg">Click here</a> to learn all about attestations.</p> Address Proofs <p>When VASPs send or receive digital assets, they must share certain information with their counterparty to comply with the FATF Travel Rule, such as their users’ names and wallet addresses.</p><p>Sending such sensitive data to the wrong VASP could have devastating consequences.</p><p>This is where Address Proofs come in. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Click here</a> for more information on Address Proofs and how they can help VASPs protect critical&nbsp;data.</p> WHY  Shyft Discover: A Global Address Book of&nbsp;VASPs <p>Virtual Asset Service Providers can register and create a profile on the Shyft Network in order to participate in the network and take advantage of its features. However, to create a profile, VASPs must provide certain information about themselves.</p><p>The information can then be verified and validated by other parties on the network. The fundamental idea behind this step is that the more attestations a VASP’s profile have, the higher the level of trust it has on the&nbsp;network.</p> Veriscope Share: Answer to Data Transfer&nbsp;Issues <p>Some Travel Rule solutions do handle the data-sharing part, but they process the sensitive user data through their servers before sending it to the relevant&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>While this may seem convenient, it also carries certain risks. Veriscope Share solves these problems by enabling VASPs to share user data in a P2P, VASP-to-VASP mode. Head over to this Twitter thread to learn more about Veriscope Share: <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1595598374643941376">The Basics of Veriscope Share</a>.</p> The Veriscope Share&nbsp;Workflow <p>Veriscope Share’s workflow begins when an originator VASP (oVASP), or the crypto business whose customer has requested a withdrawal, posts an attestation on the Shyft Network. The following flowchart describes the entire&nbsp;process:</p><p>We have covered the workflow of Veriscope Share in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1600309816865464322">Part-3(4)</a> of the Veriscope campaign.</p> HOW  Shyft Veriscope-the Only Frictionless Travel Rule Compliance Solution <p>The HTTPS-based Shyft Veriscope is an end-to-end solution designed to help virtual asset service providers (VASPs) comply with the crypto Travel Rule. All its payloads are encrypted.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605571878256627712?s=20&amp;t=m_ykOHfZCr9233hJ0VXjDw">Image Source</a>)<p>Its impressive features include RESTful APIs, webhooks, and the option for on-premise installation. There are several advantages of using Shyft Veriscope, which you can find in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605571878256627712">Part-5(1)</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1605020855528030209?s=20&amp;t=Evvm4flbhlAhq6Pn7oVviQ">Part-5(2)</a> of our Veriscope social media campaign.</p> The Current State of Travel Rule Compliance <p>Outside Shyft Veriscope, facilitating user data transfer between VASPs for Travel Rule compliance is a complex and often suboptimal process.</p><p>One of the major issues with the current state of Travel Rule compliance is the wrongful interpretation of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, which causes various problems for&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Transaction Workflow From VASP’s&nbsp;POV <p>Both Originator VASPs &amp; Beneficiary VASPs have to engage in Name Screening, Wallet Screening, Know Your VASPs, and Transaction Threshold checks throughout the Travel Rule transaction workflow.</p><p>We looked into three unique cases to understand the workflow better in <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1606107783061016578">Part-6</a> of the Veriscope campaign.</p> How to Download Shyft Veriscope? <p>To download Shyft Veriscope, VASPs must first visit the <a href="https://docs.veriscope.network/docs/3.0.0/install/introduction.html">Veriscope Github repository</a>. It contains the complete installer and various components needed to download Veriscope.</p><p>However, before VASPs start the installation process, they must ensure they have access to a server that meets specific requirements, as shown&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1606289432331620358">here</a>.</p> Shyft Veriscope Testing and Onboarding <p>There are two ways to test the Shyft Veriscope API: the Postman Collection and the Sandbox Environment.

For example, someone could prove they live in an eligible city to qualify for a program without revealing the actual city. </p><p>2) White Label Wallet Service </p><p>Organizations that don’t want to spend resources building their own wallet can simply use &nbsp;the functionality of the Dock Wallet and offer their own branded wallet to their customers.</p><p>3) New Feature: Communication Between EVM Module and Native Modules</p><p>This release will enable developers to <a href="https://blog.dock.io/enhanced-evm-contract-capabilities/">build richer dApps</a> with the flexibility of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) smart contracts and use Dock's native features like DIDs. This was not possible before because the smart contracts didn’t have direct access to the data on the Dock blockchain. With our new feature, the EVM smart contracts can now read data like DIDs, revocation statuses, and more in addition to being able to verify signatures from DIDs and credentials.</p><p>4) Circom Language Integration: Anonymous Credentials Protocol Update</p><p>Previously, the expressivity of our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/circom-language-integration/">anonymous credential proving system</a> was limited. The holder could prove things like “I have a credential” or that “certain attributes across my credentials are the same”. But verifiers couldn’t request proofs for more complicated conditions like the sum of certain attributes should be less or more than a certain value.</p><p>Examples of these more complex requests:</p>  Someone wants to prove that his yearly income is $20,000 or less to show that he qualifies for a government benefit  Someone wants to prove that her yearly income is $200,000 or more to show that she is eligible to access an investment fund  <p>Because of these limitations, we updated our anonymous credentials protocol to enable developers to express "predicates" (checks that return true or false) on credential attributes using the Circom language. This language is a developer-friendly programming language that could also be used with our proving system. </p><p>Here are examples of applications that demonstrate the use of Circom along with credentials: </p><p>1.

Image by Jakub&nbsp;Novacek<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>It’s an extraordinary mystery. Despite all the incredible technologies developed to smash atoms and build telescopes able to see billions of years into the universe’s past, scientists are unable to see or measure 85 -95% of everything that exists. Yes, 85% of it, which is why it’s called ‘dark matter’ and ‘dark energy’. We know it’s there because of its immense gravitational pull. Everything else in the universe revolves around it. But we cannot see it, touch it, or measure it. Amazing. And extremely challenging for theories about how the universe&nbsp;works.</p><p>Modern economics has its own dark matter and dark energy. Virtually all economic activities revolve around it, pulled by its immense gravitational force. But it remains largely unseen and unmeasured. This economic dark matter/energy is called&nbsp;people.</p><p>Economics textbooks are full of endless discussions of entities such as firms, markets, products and prices. Now and again you might find a reference to ‘consumers’, but these are just an abstract entity used to explain something else called ‘demand’, which is far more convenient because it can be turned into a number and used as part of mathematical equations where people somehow get forgotten.</p><p>In economics, real people do not exist. Their lives are not seen and their activities remain unmeasured. For example, the concept ‘Gross Domestic Product’ ignores all the work done by individuals and households to maintain homes, bring up children, care for loved ones, and so on. These activities are not traded for money in markets and they are not undertaken by ‘firms’ or organisations so, in economics-land, they don’t get&nbsp;counted.</p><p>Likewise, every activity undertaken by organisations is investigated and measured down to the finest detail. How to improve its productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and performance? But meanwhile all the complex things that individuals have to do to manage their lives remain unseen and unmeasured, just like the physicists’ dark matter. We all know it’s there lurking in the background. But somehow it never comes into&nbsp;focus.</p><p>If you read our last three blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">productivity</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">joined up services</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">go-to-market processes</a> you might think we are falling into the same organisation-centric trap. These blogs seem to focus on organisations’ efficiency and productivity — and the way we talk about them there, they do (mostly).</p><p>But they account for less than half the picture, because the immense benefits we are highlighting don’t stop there — and don’t even start there. They are a byproduct, a part of something much bigger: a change taking place in the dark matter of the economy itself, outside of organisations’ sight and control, in the lives of individuals and the unexplored realms of household management.</p> Working the dark matter of the&nbsp;economy <p>For Mydex as a Community Interest Company this isn’t a problem. It’s our bread and butter. Our mission and our purpose is the community we serve: individuals and their households and communities. It starts with and exists inside the economy’s dark matter, empowering people with their own data via personal data stores that help them access, hold and use their own data for their own purposes independently of organisations that may have collected data about them, so that they can manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>For those mesmerised by traditional organisation-centric economic theories this is alien and baffling. If everything that matters and counts is done by organisations and happens inside organisations, why bother with anything that happens elsewhere, in the dark&nbsp;matter?</p><p>We have two answers to&nbsp;this.</p><p>First, the ultimate purpose of all economic activity is people — not profit, or productivity, or growth. That may sound like a sentimental cliche but it’s a simple fact. If an economic activity doesn’t in some way alleviate human suffering or enable and enrich their lives, it’s pointless. Profits, productivity and growth are just a means to this&nbsp;end.</p><p>It’s hardly a new idea. Aristotle (who died in 322 BC, 2300 years ago) stated it perfectly in his Nicomachean Ethics when he said “wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else”. So why not address the end directly, rather than focus only on the&nbsp;means?</p><p>Second, because when the dark matter stirs it triggers earthquakes in the organisational part of the economic universe that we can see and measure. Mydex’s purpose is improving the lives of people, which takes us inside the economy’s dark matter into individuals’ lives, independently of and beyond the reach of the organisations that seem to dominate&nbsp;it.</p><p>But it was in the process of doing this that we discovered something important. Helping individuals and households improve their personal productivity and capabilities can also help service providers do the same thing: by enabling safe, efficient, privacy-protecting data sharing (which is what Mydex’s personal data logistics infrastructure does). Transforming the economics of organisations is a byproduct of transforming the economics of the household, not the other way&nbsp;round.</p>  When we highlight the ways in which data sharing helps service providers <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost)</a> these benefits arise from work done elsewhere to help individuals eliminate their own FERC: all the time, effort and (sometimes) money they have to spend seeking and accessing information about themselves, gathering it, presenting it and proving it to service providers.  When we highlight the way better data logistics <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">helps service providers to deliver better, more joined up services at lower cost</a>, this arises from our efforts to reduce the frustration and effort individuals experience in being forced to provide the same information again and again (often to the same organisation), just to complete one, single&nbsp;task.  When we highlight the way PDS-based data sharing can <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-struggle-to-connect-f233bd480d44">streamline organisations’ go-to-market costs</a>, it comes from our efforts to help individuals find and access the services they need, when they need&nbsp;them.  <p>Yes. We are talking about an economic revolution that will transform how organisations work. But this revolution doesn’t actually come from inside organisations. It is not one of their ‘innovations’. It starts inside households, with individuals trying to manage their day to day lives better. It comes from inside the economy’s dark matter (which is one of the reasons why traditional organisations struggle so hard to see it and comprehend it).</p> The economy’s unseen, unmeasured gravitational force <p>What we are doing isn’t new by the way. It’s not as if the dark matter of individuals and households has only just popped into existence. Far from it. It’s always been there, exerting its gravitational pull.</p><p>Take food. The money price that people pay for food in shops is just a fraction of what this food costs them: all the time and effort spent planning meals, shopping, cooking, eating, washing up, acquiring and maintaining utensils, and so on. Likewise, the value of this food isn’t limited to its taste or nutrition either. Preparing and eating food is a deeply emotional, social thing. It’s got countless dimensions of non-priced, non-material value including sociability and bonding with other people, demonstrating love, the joy of developing and using a skill, demonstrating status, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>The measures, processes and purposes that explain households’ use of food have got very little to do with the measures, processes and purposes that obsess food producers. The latter hardly touch the former, which remain like dark matter: a mysterious gravitational force in the producers’ background.</p><p>Yet it’s this dark matter of the personal, human costs and the personal, human dimensions of value that has shaped the food industry over decades. Ready meals, fast food outlets, posh restaurants, home deliveries: they all different ways of addressing this personal, human cost/value equation. It is this invisible gravitational pull — of what it costs the person in terms of time, energy and emotion and the value it brings to that person (also in terms of time, energy and emotion) — that shapes everything the food industry&nbsp;does.</p><p>This is true for the economy as a whole. The 20th century was defined by the rise of the ‘consumer society’. This novel economic arrangement revolved around households acquiring and using thousands of manufactured gadgets: washing machines, fridges, vacuum cleaners, kettles, motor cars, radios, TVs, microwaves, computers and so on — a far, far cry from earlier times that revolved around land and agriculture.</p><p>Why were consumer products so popular? Because they transformed personal and household productivity, freeing up time and energy that enabled people to enrich their lives in other ways. The washing machine saved (mostly) women seven hours of labour a week. Central heating removed six hours a week shovelling coal and dust. Fridges helped people reduce time spent shopping, improved access to fresh healthy food, and reduced food waste. The motor car gave individuals and households freedoms and opportunities that were unthinkable before it became affordable.</p><p>It was this impact on peoples’ day-to-day lives that made this economic revolution so compelling and exciting, and it happened because of one basic thing. It was achieved by taking the machine out of the factory and making it available as a tool in the hands of individuals and households — empowering people in their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>In the early days of the industrial revolution the machine remained inside the factory. Cotton mills may have transformed clothing production, but what people purchased was the cotton product, not the machine. But with the 20th personal productivity revolution they also bought machines in the form of household gadgets to use for their own purposes.</p><p>The personal data revolution is doing the same with personal data. It is taking data out of the organisation and domesticating and democratising it, turning it into a tool in the hands of individuals and households, empowering people to use their data to eliminate FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) and to organise and manage their lives&nbsp;better.</p><p>This is worth doing in its own right, regardless of its impact on organisations. But when it impacts both, the effects are economically transformational, just as the consumer goods revolution was transformational.</p> A critical&nbsp;insight <p>Returning to the potential benefits for service providers, there is one crucial point that stands out. Without grasping this point it’s impossible to see or understand what’s going in. None of the benefits to organisations we’ve been talking about can happen without individuals first being empowered with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The elemental force driving this economic revolution is not more of the same — organisations empowering themselves to do more, better — but something new and unfamiliar: citizen empowerment. Organisations benefit only as a byproduct of citizens being empowered with their own data. Without citizens’ ability to gather, store and use their data for their own purposes, independently of organisations that may be collecting data about them, this revolution simply cannot&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To this degree, the revolution is taking place outside of organisations jurisdiction, sight and control. In the dark matter. For those immersed in organisation-centric views of the world, where everything that matters is generated inside organisations and done by organisations, this can be utterly baffling and disconcerting. Like dark matter. But that doesn’t make it any the less&nbsp;true.</p><p>Yet this is still just scratching the surface. The 20th century consumer goods revolution created entirely new industries, employing millions of people. The personal data revolution will do the same. We turn to this in our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

				  Indicio’s public benefit mission is to advance decentralized identity. How did we do in 2022?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio began as a conventional corporation, but its founders made the decision, a little over a year ago, to reincorporate as a Public Benefit Corporation: Our founding mission — advancing decentralized identity — would be our public benefit mission.</p>
<p>The rationale for this was simple: decentralized identity technology has the capacity to protect individual privacy, enhance digital security, enable consent in data sharing, and provide a pathway to formal identity for hundreds of millions of people currently without any legal means of proving who they are. In short, it can deliver significant material benefits to society besides serving as the missing verification layer to the internet.</p>
<p>Reincorporating as a Public Benefit Corporation means that these material benefits must shape how we do business—that shareholders and stakeholders must align when it comes to business decisions so that we stay on mission.</p>
<p>What does this mean in practice? How did we advance decentralized identity as a public benefit? The answers are laid out in our first Public Benefit Report — along with our assessment of what we want to achieve in our public benefit mission in 2023.</p>

<p>Modern cyber threats require dynamic and evolving security countermeasures, especially regarding authentication.</p>
<p>What is adaptive authentication? It is a dynamic, risk-based approach to authentication that can use real-time information to guard against system breaches.</p>
 How Does Adaptive Authentication Work? 
<p>An adaptive authentication is an approach to identity verification that relies on risk assessments of users and their activity to determine whether or not to allow access. Furthermore, adaptive authentication enables systems to dynamically assign specific types of authentication to users based on several criteria to increase security based on real-time events.</p>
<p>The goal? To address the ever-evolving challenges to identity fraud and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> that can threaten sensitive IT systems. In many contexts, authentication is seen as a one-time activity–the user seeks to enter a system or a sub-system, and the security infrastructure requires that users provide credentials to identify themselves.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to this approach. For example, if an employee’s work credentials are stolen due to a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attack</a>, then any authentication requirements will prove primarily useless.</p>
<p>Adaptive authentication attempts to solve this problem by addressing some of the limitations of traditional authentication through a specific set of features:</p>
 
 Risk Profiles: Adaptive authentication relies on evaluating risk in a system and applying criteria to that risk to determine authentication results. In extremely simplistic authentication schemes, the system may assign different access requests with high, medium, or low-risk profiles based on specific criteria. 
 
<p>Based on these profiles, the authentication system may require different verification forms (biometrics, PINs, etc.) or automatically reject the request.</p>
 
 Real-Time Assessments: These risk profiles and evaluations are conducted in real-time. That is, there isn’t a straightforward approach to risk that relies on a prior knowledge of an account or user. Instead, the system can compile information regarding risk categories and apply them to specific user requests as they happen. 
 Automated Decision-Making: To build more sophisticated authentication systems, risk-based systems will use machine learning and AI to monitor user and system activity to apply risk profiles dynamically. 
 
<p>AI can learn from these activities and risk profiles and more effectively and securely apply different authentication requirements to specific requests… if not outright denying them due to risk.</p>
 
 Trust: Trust is a significant factor in adaptive authentication… by assuming different levels of risk, an organization can then define who they trust and how they develop that trust. Furthermore, zero-trust security schemes can leverage adaptive authentication to strengthen their underlying security without relying entirely on standard authentication. 
 
<p>To summarize, adaptive authentication is a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to identity verification that addresses some of the limitations of traditional and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p>
 What Are Some Risk Factors Used in Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Adaptive authentication can use several approaches to monitoring and identifying risk in an authentication system. These approaches provide sufficient information to provide any risk-scanning or AI systems to decide how, or even if, to allow users to authenticate themselves.</p>
<p>Some of these factors include:</p>
 
 Location: If a user attempts to access system resources from a specific city, state, or country, then risk-based authentication can take steps to require additional identification factors to mitigate fraud. Once the user is verified, the system can include their location information in a directory of accepted locations for authentication. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">Behaviors</a>: Dynamic systems can monitor user behaviors, including purchases made, files or resources accessed, or login attempts to influence risk profiles. If a user’s account behaves in ways that align with fraudulent activities, the system can automatically require additional authentication or outright reject the user’s access. 
 Attributes: Attributes are more static than dynamic and require administrators to set policies around account information. These attributes can include roles, permissions, or devices used to attempt access. 
 Risk: The authentication system can combine the above-listed criteria with the sensitivity of the resource being accessed to determine specific risk attributes used to specify authentication requirements. 
 
 What Are Some Examples of Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Based on applying these risk factors (and upon deciding regarding risk and authentication), an adaptive authentication system can apply different factors or authentication not only to a specific user, but to a user based on the actual request being made.</p>
 
 Low Risk: If a user has previously authenticated with the system, it may consider their following verifications low risk. For example, suppose the user has verified and authenticated a device like a work laptop, and they attempt to access system resources using that laptop. In that case, the system may only require a PIN or password. 
 Medium Risk: Suppose the system determines that the user request poses a moderate risk. In that case, however, the authentication system may require some factor of MFA in the form of a biometric scan or a one-time password over SMS. 
 High Risk: The system picks up on a user account, raising red flags–this could mean a combination of repeated bad authentication attempts, changes to core account information, or account access from a non-standard IP address or geographic location. 
 
<p>At this point, the system might read these activities as signs of fraud and deny further authentication from that account. Follow-up action might include direct contact with the user, a reset of login credentials, and verification of MFA.</p>
<p>In any of these cases, the utility of adaptive authentication is in assessing these factors and providing appropriate security measures.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Adaptive Authentication? 
<p>Any evolution in security technology will come with some benefits, and adaptive authentication is no different. Specifically, adaptive authentication provides a level of flexibility and adaptability that can only be achieved through intelligent, risk-based security systems.</p>
<p>Some of the key benefits of adaptive authentication include</p>
 
 Frictionless Authentication: Adaptive authentication can provide organizations with a way to streamline identity verification for trusted users and devices. While this approach might throw up more challenges for non-standard or unrecognized devices or user variables, it also allows for streamlined authentication for trusted users. 
 Sophisticated Risk Management: With a smart risk assessment system (and even some AI capabilities), adaptive authentication provides a more sophisticated approach to resource access versus static policies and complex, role-based schemes. 
 Up-to-Date Security Policies: Adaptive authentication can better adjust to a shifting security landscape. Instead of building new security policies and access schemes, this approach can better adjust to new vulnerabilities or attacks based on behavioral criteria. 
 Easy Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD): Smart adaptive systems can adjust to different devices, applying new and evolving policies around mobile, desktop, and IoT devices seeking access to network resources. Following that, the system can apply different levels of security to each to ensure secure access. 
 
 1Kosmos and Passwordless Security for Strong Authentication 
<p>To bolster a comprehensive authentication scheme that relies on adaptive authentication, you need a foundation of features that you can deploy based on assessed security risks. Strong MFA, biometrics, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">passwordless</a> security, and decentralized identity management allow an adaptive system to utilize different levels of risk-based authentication security. And, 1Kosmos BlockID brings all of these to the table.</p>

 We sit down with our new Head of Crypto Sales, Jason Tucker-Feltham to discuss the hidden costs of regulations, upcoming crypto trends, and why 2023 is set to be crypto’s coming out year. 



 



 With the launch of region-wide regulations, 2023 is predicted to be crypto’s coming out year in Europe. Do you think the upcoming regulations (e.g. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>) go far enough to protect consumers and crypto exchanges from nefarious activities? 



<p>Absolutely. As of now most crypto assets are unregulated. The key segment captured by MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) are security tokens, but that is a relatively small subset of the overarching crypto asset class. So, the likes of Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. are generally unregulated, and the EU was very sensible in identifying the need for there to be a strong regulatory framework that can capture those instruments that are currently unregulated. MiCA starts where <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/policy-rules/mifid-ii-and-mifir">MiFID</a> ends in the crypto industry, and it has been described as the MiFID of crypto regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some say it goes too far, and you’ll mostly hear that from crypto businesses and crypto entrepreneurs. One of the reasons they say it’s going too far is the substantial cost of implementing MiCA. This may play to the benefit of TradFi firms that are looking to go into the crypto space, but for those crypto firms that are building emerging technologies, it may dissuade them from building, and it may lead to a certain number of crypto firms opting for other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, to do so might be short sighted because MiCA, as the biggest crypto regulatory framework that has ever been built, is not going to be the last piece of regulation for crypto. As other major jurisdictions are considering their own regulatory frameworks, by complying with MiCA now you are future-proofing your business and opening yourself to one of the biggest financial markets worldwide. In my opinion, MiCA does go far enough for now. Indeed, the big banks have already invested a lot of resources into lobbying for proportionate crypto regulation. For smaller players, however, they may say it goes too far.</p>



 So, would you say that the costs associated with implementing the MICA framework is prohibitively expensive? 



<p>Yes, absolutely. Even as of now, in the UK for example, a lot of crypto firms have estimated that the cost of implementing and getting on the FCA’s Money Laundering Registration is between £100 – 200,000, so that’s just one sunk cost on anti-money laundering compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore, the cost of MiCA, as an incredibly comprehensive suite of regulatory requirements, is going to be significantly higher than that, which is going to put off a lot of crypto businesses from implementing the MiCA framework. However, MiCA is undoubtedly going to protect consumers, reduce risk in the markets, and be conducive to institutional adoption of this asset class. So, there is a real purpose and need for this regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>



 The European Central Bank recently warned European countries against the premature finalization of national crypto rules before EU regs were implemented, for fear of a patchwork system of regulations. Are there major differences in national crypto rules? If so, how will the euro zone be able to reconcile this? 



<p>Some jurisdictions have seen the inevitable implementation of MiCA as an opportunity to get ahead of the curve, and by sharing how applicable its national crypto regulations are, to attract crypto business. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Some jurisdictions have even gone as far as to offer certain tax advantages. A notable jurisdiction would be France, where two major crypto exchanges – Crypto.com and Binance – have shifted their European headquarters to, because there’s a certain amount of regulatory certainty, and research and development tax credits available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These jurisdictions are trying to futureproof themselves and cement their presence in the EU, which, of course, is a significant market for their business operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses themselves, it could be operationally inefficient to implement MiCA-esque requirements before the full implementation of MiCA, but trying to make progress in the direction of MiCA could be very beneficial for certain players in the long term.</p>

 What do you see as the major challenges currently, or in 2023, prohibiting further mass adoption of crypto assets? 



<p>I think the key thing at the forefront of people’s minds is going to be the actual security of those centralized exchanges and custody providers. As of now, it is very much an unregulated space, and so we’ve seen huge, catastrophic casualties in the industry, and that is partially as a result of it being pretty much a “free for all” for those companies that decide to build technologies and offer services in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, I think custody and protections for consumers is at the forefront of people’s minds and that is something that needs to be resolved in the near term. Big losses in the crypto industry are nothing new, fraud in the crypto industry is nothing new, but what we need to see is more corporate governance and structures to act in favor of consumers, even in the absence of regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I am fully of the opinion that we need to have similar controls and processes that you would see in a traditional financial institution.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>From the get-go, you would expect there to be strong onboarding processes to ensure you’ve got a client set that you are willing to take on per your risk tolerance, and you are operating in jurisdictions that you wish to operate in, given there are varying considerations depending on the jurisdictions of your clientele. In addition, I think it’s a case of rebuilding trust, and that will not happen overnight. People are going to be thinking about what happened with FTX and a whole host of other industry titans, where trust was strong until relatively recently. Trust needs to be built up within the industry over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of that is ensuring there are controls and solutions and technologies that help rebuild that trust, yet do not detract from the user experience too much.</p>



 What role will KYC, and in particular, eKYC play in the future of cryptocurrency, with regards to a) ensuring operators adhere to multijurisdictional regulations, and b) ensuring operators know who their customers are? 



<p>It is a common misconception that everything is harmonized across the EU in terms of regulatory frameworks and data protection etc. Each jurisdiction has its own interpretation of EU regulatory requirements, meaning there is regulatory divergence, even within the EU. In general, these are relatively minor deviations, but there are some notable differences, like in Germany, with the requirement for video verification, and video conference-style onboarding. However, with the right solution, there are more streamlined processes available, even for Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, solutions need to offer a certain amount of flexibility, yet this cannot fall below the regulatory standards. So it’s an evolving landscape and providers need to closely track regulatory change and where required they need to adapt their solutions to that change so that their customers can remain in full compliance with local regulatory requirements, and then when it comes to the point where the likes of exchanges or crypto businesses are applying for licenses, be it from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">BaFin</a> or other major competent authorities, they are going to be well positioned to attain those licenses, because ultimately regulators around the world want to be assured that crypto businesses are doing the right thing; in particular observing local regulations, and selecting the right solutions in order to achieve regulatory compliance. The likes of IDnow are well poised to work with crypto businesses, to move their business in the right direction.</p>



 Increased levels of transparency and accountability is sure to appease the mass market and newcomers to the sector, but how about ‘old school’ crypto consumers, and so-called ‘cypherpunks’, how have/ are they likely to react to the new regulations and requirements? 



<p>I think a lot of the “old school” users of crypto are more likely to have libertarian values and, in some cases, enjoy the privacy afforded by crypto protocols. The likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum are pseudo-anonymous, and that gives a certain amount of privacy. There are numerous tools for users to enhance that privacy if a user so wishes, but ultimately all centralized crypto platforms must onboard users using KYC solutions, which obviously requires the verification of identity as part of that process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those who are really against revealing their true identity, a certain populace is moving to decentralized exchanges that do not require KYC, because as of now there is no generally accepted KYC platform for decentralized platforms, even though there are some undergoing development as we speak. The days of anonymous on-chain crypto usage may be numbered, especially as institutions want to gain exposure to decentralized finance yet are not going to operate with anonymous actors on-chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>I believe it’s only a matter of time before KYC is just an accepted hurdle to getting access to crypto, even though as of now there may be some individuals who dislike that identity must be revealed as part of that process.</p>Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</blockquote>



<p>Obviously, it’s a necessary step for crypto businesses to understand who their customers are, and without understanding who your customers are, you don’t know what risks you are taking on; you could be transacting with criminals, or with sanctioned entities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, exchanges want to reduce their US exposure because there are stronger punitive measures for that territory than in most other jurisdictions, so it’s a case of businesses establishing what their risk tolerance is, and if their risk tolerance means they need to understand who their customers are, they need to go through KYC, there’s no other option.</p>



 Why do you think fraud and other illicit activities are so rife in the crypto world? 



<p>I would disagree – this is a misconception in the industry. The percentage of fraud in the crypto industry is significantly lower than traditional finance. Chain Analysis and Elliptic – market leaders in understanding on-chain activity – have conducted a lot of research and established that a <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">relatively low percentage</a> of crypto trading and crypto transactions are attributed to fraudulent activity or illegal activity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, there are bad actors in crypto, but there are bad actors in any industry, and it should not be the technology that is blamed. It is always going to be the responsibility of the people that use the technology. The optics of crypto have improved over the years, and I think this is part of the reason why larger corporates and institutions are more receptive to the technology and this emerging landscape. But there are still opportunities to reduce incidents of fraud and reduce the ability of bad actors to engage in the space. It just takes the right technology and solutions to be built to create a more secure perimeter in which people can transact. To say there is a negligible amount of fraud or criminal activity in traditional finance, done using traditional financial instruments, is therefore incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What are the major risks and rewards of integrating crypto payments, or launching as a crypto exchange? 



<p>One of the major risks and challenges is safeguarding the privacy and custody of crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A major issue with crypto custody is that if crypto assets are lost by a third party such as a crypto custodian, the owner can’t go to a bank or intermediary and say, “reverse that transaction, that was an error.” There’s no safety net in that regard; once a mistake is made and it’s a catastrophic mistake, there is very little recourse, and significant amounts could be lost as a result. In addition, with decentralised finance, there have been several protocols that have had security deficiencies and led to a loss of funds. Ultimately, the risks in&nbsp; storing crypto assets are significant, and I think this is an area which needs to a lot more work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There needs to be a lot more work done in terms of providing custody solutions that are battle-tested and can be relied upon for significant holdings of crypto. Although fraud, percentage wise, is lower in the crypto industry than in TradFi, there is still a significant risk of fraud, as evidenced by the recent disaster with FTX, which appears to be displaying the tell-tale signs of fraud. Given the sheer scale of that event, I think a lot of eyes are going to be on ways of reducing the risk of fraud, especially with major exchanges. So, a lot of work does need to be done to safeguard consumers, and I think over time, regulatory frameworks and improvements in the technology will play a massive part.</p>



 If crypto exchanges manage to meet the aforementioned challenges and implement all the different measures, what is awaiting them at the other end of the rainbow? 



<p>Increased adoption! The safer people feel with crypto, the more likely they’re going to open an account with an exchange and start procuring crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately adoption requires a certain amount of trust and this needs to be established over time, and so by opening the crypto market to those individuals who currently feel safer within the confines of TradFi, you’re going to see increased volume come to your exchange once there is a shift in perception.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the overall equities, commodities, derivatives, and other markets are huge in comparison with the crypto asset market, which is currently hovering around the trillion-dollar market cap level, if you want to have a bigger piece of the quadrillion dollar derivatives market for example, you’re going to need to establish yourself as a trusted asset class, and that will take time.</p>



 Why do you think online gambling and crypto has struck up such an unhealthy relationship? 



<p>The online crypto gambling industry started in 2012, with an online casino called SatoshiDice (a homage to the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto). It was the first online casino to feature bitcoin payments and soon became highly popular.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Part of the attraction of SatoshiDice was that by using Bitcoin instead of traditional payments mechanisms, those who chose to gamble online could do so with relative privacy. For those bad actors who are intent on using crypto for money laundering have long viewed this privacy aspect to be advantageous. However, most platforms nowadays mandate KYC which, when implemented effectively, reduces the risk of illicit activity.</p>



 What crypto trends do you envisage for 2023? 



<p>What is happening and will continue to happen is a lot of people who operate in crypto will fully migrate to decentralized finance, as DeFi is fully transparent; you can’t hide financials in DeFi platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As there is instant proof of reserves and the code is auditable, DeFi is the most transparent way of transacting in the crypto market. Many of the major brands that have gone under are centralized crypto operators, not decentralized crypto operators.&nbsp; Binance, crypto.com and others have been doing what they can to reassure the public by demonstrating proof of reserves, showing what they hold on their balance sheet, but that is still often reliant on humans providing audited financials, and so on. As such, it’s always going to be prone to human error. With DeFi, it’s all written in code, and participants in DeFi get that transparency in real time, and that is a major benefit of operating in DeFi. We’re already seeing trends of individuals that are going for DeFi protocols over CeFi just because they don’t know who they can trust in CeFi, until such a point where trust has been rebuilt.</p>

<p>Another year is coming to its end, and what a year it has been — one like no other in the over-decade-long history of cryptocurrencies. As hard as it is to say, this time is actually different. Not only did it test our resilience, focus, and determination, but it also rewarded us for all our perseverance.</p><p>Despite the ups &amp; downs and almost back-to-back hacks, rug pulls, collapses, crashes, etc., crypto enthusiasts and supporters remained steadfast in their belief that digital assets will continue to change the world for good. We continue to move forward through the calamities, the coldest of all winters, and do whatever it takes to see our mission of global adoption complete.</p><blockquote>Amid all the challenges the crypto industry has been facing in 2022, Shyft Network continued driving discussions with governments, regulators, and key stakeholders to strengthen the future of the entire crypto ecosystem and ensure that regulation of the space does not obliterate the ethos that drove us to innovate in the blockchain industry.</blockquote><p>The immense failures resulting from over-leveraged counterparties have led to the reality of accelerated pressure. Being in a position to guide policy and regulation, the most critical job for us is to ensure that failures are defined independently at all costs and regulations — stipulated adequately.</p><p>There is a great risk and an opportunity in front of us, while the timeline has drastically accelerated. We will do whatever it takes to ensure our mission is accomplished as we continue to ensure that open, decentralized, and censorship-resistant protocols can continue to build a better future, even when regulations are required.</p><p>Now, let’s look at what we achieved in 2022 in a bit more&nbsp;detail.</p> Strategic Partnerships <p>We inked many partnerships in 2022 and onboarded many Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) on Veriscope, which includes <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/dla-piper-partners-with-shyft-network-through-toko-platform">DLA Piper</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-network-partners-with-cointelegraph-to-throw-light-on-growing-institutional-demand-for-cryptocurrencies">Cointelegraph</a>, etc. Veriscope also went live <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/were-live-veriscope-launches-on-mainnet-with-binance-bitfinex-tether-huobi-moonpay-deribit-gate-io-and-more">on the Mainnet</a> this year, endorsed by Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io, and&nbsp;more.</p> A String of Critical Developments <p>Keeping in mind the Shyft community and our end users, we undertook many critical changes this year. The most significant development of the year was the launch of Shyft DAO, which was formed after the Shyft Community voted in favor of&nbsp;it.</p><p>We also rolled out many new features in line with the demand from VASPs, which include <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscopes-address-proofs-enable-vasps-to-protect-critical-data">Address Proofs</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-launches-open-source-validator-to-help-vasps-verify-their-ivms-files">IVMS Validator</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/announcing-the-launch-of-veriscope-2-0-a-state-machine-with-an-enhanced-vasp-experience">Veriscope State Machine</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p> Growing Shyft&nbsp;Family <p>Increasing the scope of Shyft Network operation demanded changes and expansion in the team. We surrounded ourselves with top professionals — Malcolm Wright (Head of Strategy), Irena Mihova (Chief Marketing Officer), Nilang Vyas (Head of Technology), and Bryan Bishop (Core Development Team).</p> The Community: Campaigns &amp;&nbsp;Growth <p>In the midst of all developments, we kept growing and educating our community; we launched a series of initiatives where education was combined with a dose of fun. We celebrated the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom?61d0acf8_page=10">Lunar New Year</a> together, learned for almost two months about everything Veriscope, and recently hosted <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-special-competition-for-creatives">Shyft Special Competition for Creatives</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-networks-holiday-raffle">Shyft Network’s Holiday&nbsp;Raffle</a>.</p><p>One of the most impactful series we launched this year was Veriscope Regulatory Recap, which today has become one of the most insightful weekly newsletters in the crypto regulations space.

<p>Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol, comes back for Ocean’s latest release, the future of data ownership and&nbsp;crypto</p><p>In our 21st episode, we bring back Bruce Pon, Founder of Ocean Protocol Foundation, to discuss the future of Web3. During this episode, Bruce talks about overcoming crypto downturns, establishing a free, new data economy, and the future of data ownership. Here are edited excerpts from the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>Why is Bruce optimistic about Web3 at&nbsp;present?</p><p>If you look back at 2014, Bitcoin was just a meme, an idea for a movement to own your money and be your own bank. By 2018, about 200 ICO projects were funded. The first tentative apps were coming, but nothing hit the Product-Market-fit except Ethereum. From that period, only 20 or 30 teams survived, and Ocean Protocol was one of&nbsp;them.</p><p>In 2022, dozens of unicorn projects and thousands of projects were funded, with countries opening up access to crypto and making Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies legal tender. There is nothing but optimism. Don’t be like Paul Krugman, who mistook temporary setbacks as something that would kill innovation and adoption. All you need is time. So when there’s blood on the streets and everyone’s tapping out because it feels like it just cannot get any worse, that’s when you enter the ring. That’s when it takes conviction, courage, some adventure, and a lot of fortitude.</p><blockquote>“Being through this two times already, I’ve seen how it happens. I am betting it all, personally, within this company because I have been there, and I know that anybody who sticks around will be rewarded. I have nothing but optimism for this space because if you look back to 2014 or 2018 and where we are now–it’s an exponential curve, and we’re still&nbsp;early.”</blockquote><p>Keeping the Ocean Community motivated through&nbsp;2022</p><p>Bruce points out that what’s good at Ocean is that there have not been a lot of unforced errors. While they tried out AMMs for pricing, minting, and more, he considers it more experimentation than unforced&nbsp;errors.</p><blockquote>“I think we’ve done well by the community. We devote a lot of time to just cleaning up everything and preparing for the downturn, which will last another year or so. The ethos that carries us forward now is that we are very conservative.”</blockquote><p>From the community perspective, it’s natural that there’s fatigue, frustration, and pain from losing money. There are so many ways that you could have lost money this year, and not a lot of ways that you could have made money. The same has been felt in the previous two downturns. What this moment does is take away the tourists and the dilettantes. It keeps the people who are really into crypto and have a long-term horizon. It’s not bad that people leave and find other things–this space moves so fast, and it’s so intense. Some people just need to pause and explore other&nbsp;things.</p><blockquote>“We’re going to be there when the crypto winter ends because we’ve been trying to be as conservative as possible to make sure that we are successful as one of the next projects that come out of this phase kicking and screaming.”</blockquote><p>FTX incident and Trust in the Crypto Community</p><p>The first thing that comes to mind is to take money off the table. Remember the feeling that you have right now and the gut-wrenching hole in your stomach because you didn’t take enough off at the peak. It’s important to keep that in mind because the next cycle is coming, and we are all going to have a shot&nbsp;again.</p><p>People outside have a hard time distinguishing between crypto and FTX. Still, FTX embodied the worst of the existing financial system: centralized control, opaqueness in the books, buying political influence in cover, outright fraud, lies, and virtue signaling while robbing&nbsp;people.</p><p>Crypto, on the other hand, has had complete transparency of the books, unwinding billions of dollars time and again, and the ability for people to withdraw to hard wallets when it got too hot and they felt insecure.</p><p>There’s a two-year run-up, and everything’s great. Then you have a two-year detox to eliminate the tourists and the scammers. Those who know, know. With every cycle, the curve becomes more compelling and unstoppable, and crypto will be adopted. What do we learn from this? Take money off, stay humble, keep building, and don’t lose sight. Tourists come and go, but in the end, the people who stay will be&nbsp;alright.</p><p>Is VC money good for&nbsp;Crypto?</p><p>Is VC industry’s foray into crypto good for Web3? Bruce tells us his point of view, having been on both sides of the&nbsp;table.</p><p>Unfortunately, VCs are former investment bankers, people who have high net worth or have very well connections to do their own type of signaling. They follow a pack, and they don’t necessarily do proper due diligence on projects–that’s good and bad. It means that some projects that should never have gotten funding to get funding in the hype, and frauds can continue to do their&nbsp;thing.</p><p>It also means that projects that don’t get to be looked at by more established VCs get funding to continue. If you look at something like Polygon, the founders asked for $5–6 million and got laughed out of Silicon Valley. In the end, they put together a friends-and-family round in India, and look at them now, they are one of the biggest successes out there, and that’s&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>You look in Romania, Elrond (the country’s first Bitcoin exchange platform), they got a little bit more backing, but nobody knows who they are. They have over and above delivered because of their network and the VCs who believed in&nbsp;them.</p><blockquote>“So yes, VC money is good. Yes, VC money corrupts and lets many frauds and scams through the gate that should not be let through. But I would always err on destroying the capital of many VCs in order to get two or three gems that contribute to the world. When Ethereum came out in 2014, it was overwhelming, and most people said it was a scam–probably one of the worst bets you could have done from a financial perspective.”</blockquote><p>VC money is money–we need money for innovation, and we need it for other things. There are dark sides to VCs and corrupting influences, but as a founder and a community member, VCs are your friends because they bring money. As long as we get 20 unicorns out of all the funding rounds, it pays for all the losses in aggregate.</p><p>A Free, New Data Economy on the&nbsp;Internet</p><p>Speech, money, data: there is no distinguishing factor between them. They’re all currencies; they’re all value. They’re all something that you can transport, own, and digitize that you were never able to before. We just learned that with Bitcoin where it was a fringe concept of owning your own&nbsp;money.</p><p>A free and open data economy has just free and open speech and free and open money–the ability for someone from Iran to communicate, share, and have commerce with anybody else on Earth. It’s for people to get agency in a world where there are a lot of shadowy powers that control large portions.</p><blockquote>“I want individuals to have the ability to take control of their own data and to monetize it in whatever way. I want for data scientists to then access it in an ethical manner, where people opt-in, where we have the provenance of the data, so when AI is trained, we know where the biases lie, but also who owns that&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>Global borderless micro-payments, monetizing IP, transferring value, all the things speech, money, and data–it’s the same thing. Ocean focuses mainly on the data side. The world that has been created in the structures that were designed to exclude more people than they protect. A free and open data economy is fully decentralized.</p><p>As a team, Ocean looks to make our stack more decentralized so that people don’t have to trust the Ocean team members; rather, they just have to look in the code and know that it’s decentralized.</p><p>Why Data Scientists should be interested in&nbsp;Web3</p><p>It is going to be a 10-year process to educate. We’re still early and it’s a blue ocean–the data economy is just starting. Just like Bitcoin was a fringe concept. Just 10 years later, people understand the value of Bitcoin as this uncensorable form of money. It’s the same with data. It’s a little bit different in that we have copyright laws and intellectual property laws–but there are hundreds of tools emerging for data and&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There are challenges in training the data: What’s the provenance? Where does it come from? What are the biases? Just as an example, pharmacological data from the past 50 years has been mainly biased toward the white European male around 40 years old. That ignores ethnic differences, genetic differences, and a host of other types of differences. Training data provenance through a data economy that is blockchain-secured helps to understand that we need to go back to those pharmacological studies and figure out what those biases are. Then, we may need to retest many of the drugs that are out there to identify the impacts on, say, a small woman at 45 kilograms versus a man at 60 kilograms.</p><p>Another thing is orchestrating data flows across multiple tools and platforms. If you are a data scientist, you work on multiple tools and platforms. Ideally, Ocean is designed well so that you can orchestrate between all of that. There’s a menu that allows you to do this transformation, process its analytics, and dump it somewhere else. It’s an orchestration that&nbsp;is:</p>  Managed through a decentralized manner so that there’s provenance and there’s a tracking process that’s never forgotten  Owned completely by you: that intellectual property of a process of 25 steps through multiple tools, you can actually sell that as an industrial process.  <p>Everything blockchain does nowadays is not geographically bound–that’s the Web2 world. The world we operate in is borderless. If I have to use Visa or Mastercard, I have to enter my address for whatever&nbsp;reason.</p><blockquote>“That’s not the world I want to live in. I want to create a world, where if I’m a data scientist and somebody needs to use my data, they have filters on who can use the data or how they can use it, or at least the choice to do&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>Monetizing intellectual property, transferring value–there are many things where Ocean as an orchestration layer helps to solve problems, which we have not really thought of because we just assumed it was not possible until&nbsp;now.</p><p>Ocean for Data Scientists</p><p>We spoke to Bruce about the stakeholders that Ocean will focus on in 2023. Moving forward, Ocean is focusing on data scientists, AI researchers, as well as users. It will be use-case driven. It will be what a data scientist needs to set up a data orchestration pipeline. What does a user need in order for them to have a privacy-preserving computation for their algorithm? How do they load the algorithm? How do they get an indicator that their algorithm is completely safe? There’s some sort of cryptographic bond that tells them what has happened and is provable–that’s the angle Ocean is going&nbsp;for.</p><blockquote>“I just want to focus on use cases that really simplify and make Web3 more natural and organic, and integrate with the existing tools in the Web2 space. I think we will just focus on the narrow case of data scientists and AI researchers. If we can do that and execute that plan, Ocean will be successful and that will make all the crypto enthusiasts happy.”</blockquote><p>How far are we from having a dream data&nbsp;economy?</p><p>Crypto blockchain is a general-purpose technology. There are 30 technologies that have driven humanity, and from these 30, you can develop thousands of innovations that build on each other. Blockchain crypto is one of them. Rolling out a general-purpose technology takes about 30 years–it takes one generation.</p><p>So money, speech, data–we are going to be talking about this for a long time, we are still early. Somebody else is going to pick up the baton, but the power of what we are doing is immense. We are going to give agency to people–not everybody will take it, and only a small fraction are actually going to take control over their data, speech, and money. We are building toward the ability for people to have that option when they realize it’s important and there’s a utility to&nbsp;it.</p><p>Has General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&nbsp;worked?</p><p>We asked Bruce whether the European Union’s GDPR has worked in protecting internet consumers. He says, “Yes and&nbsp;no.”</p><p>Putting a stake in the ground and saying people should own their data and have the right to have some sort of control is good. In terms of implementation, the GDPR leaves a lot to be desired. Take website cookies, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>What is better is that when your data is generated, it goes into your data vault. In that data vault, there are different segmentations–freely shareable, partially shareable, and under certain conditions, not shareable at all. If we go to a world like that, you don’t need GDPR, because, by default, when you have a smart contract that matches up with an opposing smart contract, you have cryptographic certainty on the tracking of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Ocean is trying to go for an implementation of GDPR that was not as prescribed as what the EU tried to do, but rather something more organic and gives people true control. It will not be just clicking a button to accept or reject cookies. Whatever you click does not help you. It shows how little control you have over what it essentially exposes you to what people were already doing before. Do you have more power? No, you&nbsp;don’t.</p><p>Message on Data Ownership</p><blockquote>“It’s a long journey–we have decades ahead of us, and it is unknown how it all looks. We are in an experimentation phase, and as long as the community has the patience for us to experiment and experiment with us, we will move forward. We are going to make a data economy happen one way or another. The only question is, how good is it going to be? How empowering is it going to be for people, or how dystopian is it going to be? That’s why my hat is in the ring, so I can fight for the one that gives the most people the most opportunity and control.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>1:43 to 2:43 — About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>3:00 to 6:03 — Ocean Protocol’s achievements in the past few&nbsp;years</p><p>6:05 to 9:34 — Getting through the crypto winter of&nbsp;2022</p><p>9:41 to 12:10 — What makes you optimistic about&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>12:20 to 15:41 — What the Web3 community needs to do for trust in the aftermath of the FTX incident?</p><p>15:42 to 19:15 — On the VC industry putting money into&nbsp;Web3</p><p>22:15 to 25:06 — Vision for a new, free data economy in&nbsp;Web3</p><p>25:07 to 29:31 — Why data scientists should invest in learning about blockchain and&nbsp;Web3?</p><p>29:43 to 32:15 — Who are the stakeholders that can come on board&nbsp;Ocean?</p><p>32:18 to 34:09 — How far is the new, free data&nbsp;economy?</p><p>34:13 to 37:09 — Has GDPR&nbsp;worked?</p><p>37:10 to 40:15 — What kind of projects does Ocean look at for giving&nbsp;grants</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 A year of growth and innovation: Our product highlights from 2022 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>🎉 Happy New Year! As 2022 draws to a close, we are proud to reflect on all the progress we have made with our product this year. We have made significant improvements in security, scalability, user experience, and connectivity for liquidity and DeFi. Below, we’ve listed the key achievements:</p>
 Security and scalability are essential 
<p>We have accomplished great strides in terms of security and scalability. To ensure security, we have conducted comprehensive security audits of our smart contracts and platforms, including penetration tests, code reviews, and preparation for the SOC2 certification. Additionally, we implemented innovative scalability features:</p>

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Blockchain Indexer 
<p>We launched our own indexer and nodes management system to interact with blockchain and eliminate any downtime. It increases our capacity to handle thousands of tokens in parallel.&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/from-start-up-to-scale-up-how-tokeny-prepared-for-large-scale-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 ERC3643 Onchain Factory 
<p>This feature enables issuers to deploy all of the ERC3643 smart contracts with one single blockchain transaction, as well as use the same address on every EVM compatible blockchain if issuing multichain tokens. <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Upgradable ERC3643 V4 
<p>The version 4 of the ERC3643 smart contracts provides upgradability via proxy smart contracts that delegate their logic to an implementation contract to add more functions or fix any vulnerability. <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-v4/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 Enhanced UX for issuers and investors 
 
 
 
<p>The T-REX platform is now the most user-friendly tokenization solution on the market, even for those unfamiliar with blockchain technology. We have streamlined the process of issuing tokens and onboarding investors, making it easier and more intuitive than ever before.</p>
 
 
 

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/"></a>   <a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 LEGO-like onboarding modules 
<p>Qualification:</p>
<p>This module enables platform owners to set up a customized website with smart workflows to check the eligibility of investors.</p>
<p>Subscription:</p>
<p>This module allows qualified investors to purchase tokens with different currencies and payment methods.</p>
<p><a href="https://tokeny.com/introducing-lego-like-onboarding-solutions-for-digital-asset-investors/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
                   
	 
		 
			 Vertical menu 
<p>As the T-REX Servicing now has a lot of features, we had to switch from a horizontal menu to a vertical menu to improve the UX. By doing so, it improves the organization and navigation of the platform.</p>

		 
	 
                   
	 
		 
			 Token agent management 
 
 
 
<p>This feature allows issuers to easily add or remove agents with specific permissions, enabling them to delegate responsibilities to the appropriate parties.</p>
 
 
 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 Connectivity for the ecosystem to access liquidity and DeFi 
<p>As a technology enabler for our customers, we have to ensure that tokens issued with the ERC3643 standard can connect and interact with the service providers they need, from issuance to secondary trading.</p>
<p>We are proud to have achieved this, and we are now going even further by enabling DeFi. This allows our customers to access a wider range of services and opportunities, strengthening their position as leading innovators to quickly conquer the new market.</p>

		 
	 
      <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 Built an interoperable ecosystem 
<p>We integrated dozens of service providers to the ERC3643 ecosystem, which now covers the entire value chain. Tokens issued with our solutions are interoperable with all of them. <a href="https://tokeny.com/how-we-are-building-an-interoperable-ecosystem-for-private-markets/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

		 
	 
          <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/"></a>       
	 
		 
			 DINO distribution network 
 
 
<p>Assets tokenized with the ERC3643 standard are immediately interoperable with DINO to access liquidity provided by trading venues and distributors in the network. Partners are regularly being added. <a href="https://tokeny.com/dino-the-largest-distribution-network-for-tokenized-securities/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

			 Permissioned DeFi SDK 
<p>The ComplyDeFi SDK is an easy-to-integrate tool that enables Web3 developers to launch permissioned DeFi protocols via verifiable credentials of identities to restrict participation, paving the way for institutional DeFi. <a href="https://tokeny.com/complydefi-the-compliance-sdk-for-defi-protocols/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8S0VIvaA8PZZ3PNfA_m5Mh9WJWThAg73-iZX7oJsERwXjxC5d60kxKlYgbIYIXdeNzgKb1">Read More</a></p>

DF Beta’s aim is to test the effect of larger incentives, learn, and refine the technology. DF Beta may run 10–20 weeks. In any given week of DF Beta, the total budget may be as low as 10K $OCEAN or as high as 100K&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>Some key&nbsp;numbers:</p>  Total budget is 50K&nbsp;$OCEAN  50% of the budget goes to passive rewards (25K $OCEAN) — rewarding users who hold veOCEAN (locked&nbsp;OCEAN)  50% of the budget goes to active rewards (25K $OCEAN) — rewarding users who allocate their veOCEAN towards productive datasets (having&nbsp;DCV).  Ocean currently <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/">supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.  <p>As usual, the Ocean core team reserves the right to update the DF rewards function and parameters, based on observing behaviour. Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Further Reading <p>The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>, or<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> for project announcements.

<p>Modern threats are evolving rapidly in both scope and scale. Hackers are targeting governments and businesses alike with increasing sophistication.</p>
<p>What is an APT? It’s a complex, long-term attack against an IT system that intends to steal information, focused on obfuscation and concealment.</p>
 Modern Attacks and Advanced Persistent Threats 
<p>The concept of hacking or cybercrime has evolved significantly over the past decades. What was once seen as the world of strange loners and savants is now an underground economy of elite consortiums and state-sponsored criminal groups.</p>
<p>Types of threats have evolved as well. Sophisticated attacks, rather than looking to cause maximum damage, will use deception and little-known flaws to embed themselves into massive cloud systems for weeks or months.</p>
<p>Consider some of these notorious attacks:</p>
 
 Stuxnet: The Stuxnet worm is a widespread Windows work found in the wild in 2010. Its origin was traced back to a long-term attack against Iranian nuclear centrifuges and is generally believed, via deduction and direct evidence, to be the product of cyber warfare. 
 Hydraq: In 2010, Google disclosed an attack against their systems the previous year using a zero-day exploit in Internet Explorer. Considered a state-sponsored attack, the Hydraq trojan was able to infiltrate Google systems and steal their IP. 
 GhostNet: Researchers at the Information Warfare Monitor uncovered a large cyberspying ring with controls from China. Security experts detected its presence in the systems of high-ranking officials in 103 counties. 
 Cozy Bear: A long-term hacker group generally believed to operate under Russian military sponsorship. They are responsible for attacks on SolarWinds network management products that led to widespread infiltrations of private and public sector systems. 
 
<p>Advanced persistent threats aren’t simply a type of attack in the traditional sense. Because of the resources and time involved, an APT is often considered a group of hackers leveraging a specific approach to cyber espionage. At the same time, they are often simultaneously referred to as the collection of tactics and strategies that these groups use.</p>
 How Do Advanced Persistent Threats Work? 
<p>Some key aspects of an advanced persistent threat are its sophistication, multi-pronged approach, and time is taken to infiltrate a system.</p>
 
 Reconnaissance: The attacking group will begin to plan their infiltration. This will include understanding the systems in question, the personnel running these systems, the software the organization uses, and so on. In some instances, this may take weeks or months of in-depth research to understand the minutiae of every moving piece of the system. 
 Establish System Access (Incursion): The initial attack. This often comes from targeted spear <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/types-phishing/">phishing attacks</a> or some combination of phishing and sophisticated zero-day exploits. 
 
<p>Once the group finally gains access, they will work to install trojan software as far as they can without alerting security. Often, this includes disguising the APT as benign software and using existing network traffic to hide communications between the trojan malware and the controlling group.</p>
 
 Deepen Access: Once the APT group has infiltrated the system and gained its foothold, they will take time to gather information about the system and its users. At this point, the primary goal is to deepen their access through elevated privileges. They can use these to dig deeper into protected infrastructure if there are weak authentication or authorization programs in place or poorly configured IAM solutions. 
 Move Laterally: In the world of cloud computing, everything is connected. As such, the hacking group will start to push their infection out into any connected services. This can include internal servers, private and public cloud systems, vendor systems, and client systems hosted on managed cloud platforms. 
 Watch, Wait, and Learn: If the APT group has evaded detection thus far, the goal is to sit and wait. With the right controls, the group can have unfettered access to any information they want in real-time as it moves through a network. At this point, they can work to broaden their reach, gather resources for other attacks, or find ways to infect other software created by the group (for example, patches for new versions). 
 
 What Are Some Signs of an APT Attack? 
<p>Unfortunately, one of the primary threats that APTs pose is that they are so sophisticated and hard to detect. Even as common cybersecurity tools and strategies change, modern advanced threads evolve rapidly. The fact that many of these threats are typically well-resourced (either through successful ransomware attacks or through state sponsorship) only makes them harder to get ahead of.</p>
<p>There are, however, some practices you can use to identify APTs in your organization:</p>
 
 Investigate Recent Phishing Attacks: Many APTs begin with a well-coordinated phishing attack, often targeting someone or some group with enough seniority to have significant IT access. Suppose your security team ever identified a phishing attack at any level. In that case, it’s crucial to determine if credentials were accessed or if users were directed to malicious websites where browser-side code could have compromised local business machines. 
 Follow Up on Malware and Trojans: A single security breach should never be considered an anomaly. If your team finds malware, always take steps to investigate the full potential impact of the breach and its spread. 
 Track Anomalous Account Behavior: APT activity may look non-suspicious at first, but there are almost always some strange patterns that emerge. This might include rapid or remote logins to local accounts or attempts by specific user accounts to escalate privileges or access confidential information. 
 Information Moving Unexpectedly: A surefire red flag of some security issue involves tracking data flow throughout an internal network. 
 
<p>If there is a sudden transfer of data from one location to another, to a location outside the network, or from archival systems, this could be a sign that a malicious actor is at work. This tell-tale sign can also include the movement of smaller pieces of data into large, unnecessary files that could be a staging ground for external transfers.</p>
<p>Actionable prevention of APT’s involves a coordinated effort across all technical aspects of your organization. This includes comprehensive policies and procedures around functions like:</p>
 
 Ongoing monitoring and logging of system and user events. 
 System-wide <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/zero-trust-identity/">zero-trust architecture</a> that eliminates security holes due to mismanaged privileges and system access controls. 
 High-level tracking and logging of data movements and security events. 
 Regular systems scans and annual penetration tests. 
 In-depth forensics analysis immediately following a breach or attempted attack. 
 Robust anti-phishing solutions and education. 
 
 Resist APTs with Strong Authentication from 1Kosmos 
<p>One of the most prominent attack surfaces for APTs is social engineering–namely, a phishing attack. The inherent weakness of traditional password-based security can exponentially increase your organization’s risk of falling victim to a sophisticated attack.</p>
<p>With a platform like 1Kosmos, you can resist APTs through decentralized identity management, strong passwordless authentication, and streamlined onboarding with verified identity assurance. Without passwords to compromise or a central honeypot to hack, your organization can close several attack surfaces forever.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can leverage the following protections against Advanced Persistent Threats:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/sim-binding-definition/">SIM Binding:</a> The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>We’ve been talking about NFT technology and industry changes, with new people/brands/companies entering the NFT industry every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Karissa Bell, senior editor on the well-known electronic technology blog Engadget, tweeted that Mark Zuckerberg’s entry into the NFT space is working to bring NFTs to Instagram in the near future, and that users can cast their own&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Coinbase NFT announced earlier this year that it has contacted over 100 creators. Perhaps we will see its live NFT product&nbsp;soon.</p><p>While new products are mushrooming, already popular NFT pieces have gone through a round of waves, and those that remain have risen in value. According to the Nansen NFT-500 Index, the price of 500 premier NFTs denominated in ETH rose 68.5% between January 1st and March 9th,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>For example, according to the NFTGO platform statistics, as of writing, the The Bored Ape Yacht Club series NFT 24-hour trading volume was over $4.33 million, an increase of 48.55%, the series NFT floor price was 92 ETH, a 24-hour increase of&nbsp;5.03%.</p><p>Despite this booming trading market, the fact is that most NFTs are “asleep”. According to the NFTGO platform, there are over 2 million total NFT holders, but the average number of daily trades recently is only about 40,000. What’s the&nbsp;problem?</p> NFT is difficult to&nbsp;realize <p>In terms of functionality, what added value can a PFP bring beyond a collection and avatar? Considering the high price of NFTs, it may not be worth it for the average person to pay for an avatar that can only be collected (when they may not even be able to sell🤷🏻‍♀).</p><p>To put it bluntly, for most existing NFTs, they function more like a permanent collection; or they are too expensive to realize&nbsp;quickly.</p><p>In response, the resourceful Web3 developers have found another way, and the EIP-2615 NFT rental program has been launched!</p> Simple Logic of&nbsp;EIP-2615 <p>To realize NFT leasing, there is a problem that must be solved — how to transfer the right to use an NFT while keeping the ownership of the NFT in the hands of the&nbsp;lessor.</p><p>As a result, the EIP-2615 protocol was proposed. The ERC-2615 standard extends the original ERC-721 by defining additional roles to support leasing and collateral functions. In order to facilitate understanding, next I will show you a simple example of the NFT leasing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Step 1 Suppose Alice wants to lend an NFT that she owns, then she will create a blank [tenant] role on the Lease Agreement.</p><p>Step 2 Bob wants to rent this NFT, then he needs to fill out the rental request and pay the&nbsp;rent.</p><p>Step 3 Alice fills in the [Tenant] role with Bob’s&nbsp;name.</p><p>After this simple process, the NFT is ready for Bob’s use. During this time, Alice cannot transfer the [tenant] role, protecting Bob’s usage rights. However, if Bob violates the lease agreement or the lease expires, then the contract will revoke Bob’s [tenant] role and reset it to&nbsp;Alice.</p> Advantages of&nbsp;EIP-2615 <p>The EIP-2615 makes NFT leasing possible, depending mainly on the following EIP-2615 function&nbsp;points：</p> Unsecured lease <p>ERC-721 cannot separate the right of use and ownership, so to achieve a trustless lease, funds must be deposited as security. EIP-2615, on the other hand, realizes the separation of the right to use and ownership, and the ownership of NFT will not be transferred, so there is no need to deposit funds for security.</p> Finding the value of NFT&nbsp;usage <p>In conventional realization interactions, NFTs are usually blocked in the agreement as collateral and are not available to all. The EIP-2615, on the other hand, enables a leasing model that not only realizes NFTs for the holder, but also allows the tenant to fully utilize the NFTs during the lease&nbsp;term.</p> Enhance the security of business management <p>This separation of ownership and usage rights provides convenience and security for the management of the company, especially the management of DAOs. For example, if a company needs to provide a new employee with the right to operate a certain account, it can provide the employee with an NFT as the management credential of the account. The EIP-2615 allows the new employee to obtain the right to use the NFT, but the ownership still belongs to the company, thus playing a role in guaranteeing the security of the&nbsp;account.</p> Conclusion <p>Leasing is one of the rigid demands in human social activities, both for owners to cash in and for renters to use. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, NFT leasing will become an important part of the ecology as the industry develops. Especially in GameFi and Metaverse, NFT leasing brings asset management and asset liquidity for game guilds in GameFi and Metaverse real estate investors, and these empowerments will feed the ecology toward prosperity and encourage continued development.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/nft-for-rent-mind-opened-f428c93b4789">NFT For Rent?

 Context Matters for Identifiers <p>Identifiers as we know them are paired with and understood by the service that is providing them. For example, I might have a unique identifier for a bank account, and each bank provides a unique identifier for all of the bank accounts they issue. But as the world and therefore the services we use become more interconnected, what happens to the identifiers that are outside of the services they are being used&nbsp;in?</p><p>For example if I gave you an identifier, RQFCVKROOZGLC, there’s nothing in that identifier that tells you where it belongs or what it’s for. You could try to search for this identifier through various online services, and they would probably tell you they don’t know what this is for or that it could be an identifier for many things such as package tracking or an order confirmation. But what if I told you the context of this identifier was an Amazon Review? Then you would be able to resolve this identifier to find a glowing<a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/RQFCVKROOZGLC"> review of Blast Knuckles</a>.</p><p>This is one of the values that Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) provide. DIDs tell the system where to look to resolve the resource for the identifier, that is they provide&nbsp;context.</p> Using a DID Document to Resolve a&nbsp;DID <p>In the above section I provided an example of an identifier providing context for resolving a resource. With DIDs, we would expect to obtain a specific resource called a DID document to resolve the identifier and provide the context for the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>The DID did:web:transmute.industries resolves to the URL<a href="https://transmute.industries/.well-known/did.json"> https://transmute.industries/.well-known/did.json</a>. That URL resolves to the following DID document shown in the figure&nbsp;below.</p><p>A DID document contains three sections that we want to focus&nbsp;on:</p>  verificationMethod  assertionMethod  authentication.  <p>Their relationship is pretty straightforward: verificationMethod provides a list of public keys. AssertionMethod and authentication contain references to public keys in the verificationMethod list. Basically this means you can use those sections to allocate different keys for different functionalities.</p><p>The ability to define one or more keys for a specific purpose is a massive benefit of DIDs. In addition to telling you where a DID document can be referenced, a DID document also shows who has control of an identifier.</p><p>Anyone can claim control of any identifier, but with DIDs the ability to prove control over the identifier is built into the standard.</p><p>If I claimed control of the did:web:transmute.industries identifier, I could also prove that I have control of that DID if you provided me a challenge to sign. You could then retrieve the list of public keys from the did:web:transmute.industries DID document in the authentication section. If my signature with my private key can be validated by the public key in the DID document, it proves that I really am who I say I am, a person with control over that particular DID.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@benjamincoll875">Benjamin Collins</a>, Transmute’s Technical Product Owner, spent 10 years working with Linux and Open Source as the creator of DashGL.com, a site which provides tutorials for writing simple games for Linux in C using OpenGL and the GTK&nbsp;toolkit.</p><p>Connect with Ben on <a href="https://twitter.com/kion_dgl">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/BenjaminMoe">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

You can be more optimistic because you have optionality, and you cannot be coerced.”</blockquote><p>Successful release and adoption of the Impervious Browser has demonstrated that there is no tradeoff between privacy and performance with the P2P internet standard.

When you <a href="http://www.impervious.ai">download the Browser</a> and look at all of the functionality, I think that you’ll be impressed.”</blockquote> A Lightning Round with Kevin Rooke Strikes at the Importance of P2P Communications and Defeating Censorship <blockquote>“If you don’t need intermediaries to have a great user experience, then why am I compromising my data to begin with? What unique value proposition do they have?”</blockquote><blockquote>“If you’re streaming content, as an educator or anyone else, anywhere in the world, you can <a href="https://youtu.be/81QB9d-3NzM?t=1105">enjoy borderless and permissionless streaming payments</a>. That is a whole new economy.”</blockquote><p>All four podcasts above address the significance of the Peer-to-Peer internet and how you can harness the freedom-tech tools built into the Impervious Browser.</p><p>In our our next newsletter, we will discuss major Impervious product developments and provide additional tutorial videos.

<p>Many words<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/#basic-features-of-holochain-alpha"> have</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-beta-approaching/#what%E2%80%99s-on-the-roadmap-holochain-beta-and-more">already</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/full-featured-holochain-beta-rc/">been</a> said about last week’s Holochain release. And it’s finally here! The first release candidate for the upcoming Beta of Holochain! We’re not quite ready for most devs to jump in, but we’re very very close — we plan to release the official 0.1.0 beta in late January, and the constellation of developer and end-user tools around Holochain are being updated as we speak. In fact the core team has already published a second release candidate, 0.1.0-beta-rc.2, to support new needs discovered as components were being updated.</p><p>What makes it very, very close but not quite there? A number of things changed in this release — anticipated functionality was turned on, deprecated functionality was turned off, and APIs changed in subtle ways. We prepared for this leap in many ways, but couldn’t anticipate every single dependency. As the developers working on components and tooling updated to Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc, they uncovered some issues with functionality they’d depended on. This triggered some Holochain core updates to make the new release candidate functional in each of these situations.</p><p>One example is that Holochain now requires all zome calls to be signed. This is a huge leap in maturity, as it means that a user can protect their running hApps from malware on their device. But it also means big changes to every client that accesses Holochain. It took a few rapid iterations to smooth out incompatibilities and nail down a good dev experience.</p><p>We’re also working on integration of all the dev and userland tooling. From our developers’ perspective, many things are ‘done’, but they wouldn’t feel mature to a new dev visiting <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">https://developer.holochain.org</a>. There are also some rough bits for existing developers accessing the dev tools via Holonix, the Holochain dev environment— while the code may be tested and working, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re integrated into the dev environment consistently, and some components are only available and working if you enter Holonix via a particular GitHub branch.</p><p>While individual changes might have been surprising to devs working on core components, at a high level it’s not a surprise. This is exactly what a release candidate is about — creating a hypothesis that a certain bundle of functionality is ready for release, then testing that hypothesis. This means we’re actually tackling the heavy integration and tooling work now, with the intention that it will be complete well ahead of actual beta in January.</p> Component status <p>Here’s a list of all the most important components and their current status.</p>  Holochain: currently at 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 and available on crates.io and via Holonix (note: the version at <a href="https://holochain.love">https://holochain.love</a> is still at 0.1.0-beta-rc.1).  JavaScript client: currently at 0.11.8 and available on NPM, compatible with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.1 but not 0.1.0-beta-rc.2.  Rust client: the <code>beta-rc-untested</code> branch is working with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2, and one Linux-related bug needs to be fixed before a release is made.  Tryorama, the testing framework: The code has been updated and a new release has been cut, but it was discovered that the new zome call signing requirement made it challenging to write tests. Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2 allows you to grant a capability for all functions in a zome at once, which resolves this problem, and Tryorama is being updated to eliminate the need for adapting existing tests to signed zome calls.  Launcher CLI, a new <code>hc</code> subcommand that spawns a running app in a Launcher window: Complete and integrated into Holonix, but requires better integration for a smooth dev experience.  DevHub: bug-free but requires the most up-to-date versions of Holochain and the Launcher, and further testing, before a release will be cut.  Launcher: A version is ready for internal testing using Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.2. Our next steps are to update DevHub integration and test everything together before creating a release with downloadable installers.    The new scaffolding tool: currently waiting on a Tryorama release and a few bugfixes.  <p>Happy holidays! Very soon (probably next week) we'll be ready to invite you to start using Holochain, whether that means updating and testing your hApps, getting started with hApp development, or using a hApp via the Launcher. I’ll be back next week to report updates to this list, along with release notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://login.xyz/">Sign-In with Ethereum</a> (SIWE) has become the dominant standard for web3 login. It empowers any user to begin the journey to control their own identity not rely on "Big Login," or centralized identity providers that have incentives to extract value from users. At Spruce, we authored the Sign-In with Ethereum standard, <a href="https://docs.login.xyz/">p</a>rovided multiple libraries to simplify integrations, and led community support for any developer interested in integrating SIWE.</p><p>Back in November, we released SSX to further our mission to build a future where users control their identity across all their digital interactions:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/announcing-ssx/">  Announcing SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything  We’re happy to announce the release of SSX: Self-Sovereign Anything - the easiest way to get started with decentralized identity and install Sign-In with Ethereum  SpruceSpruce    </a><p>After talking to a number of developers about SIWE, one of the largest problems we heard was that it's difficult to integrate with <a href="https://docs.login.xyz">just the core libraries</a>. We built a number of basic libraries to make it possible across multiple languages, but it made sense to give developers an even easier way to integrate it into their applications. </p><p>The other problem we found was a lack of additional tools that truly made SIWE an experience for users, rather than just a signing operation. We started to explore additional ways we could build something where users could bring their identity and data across applications, with SIWE as the first necessary touchpoint. </p><p>We can revisit our friend Steve from a previous post on decentralized identity.</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/decentralized-identity-and-web3/">  Decentralized Identity and Web3  Decentralized identity is the continual catalyst that will unlock a new host of use-cases on top of those existing paradigms.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Steve is now a web3 developer, building a dapp exclusively for people who own the paintings of Steve created by Alice. He's interested in adding Sign-In with Ethereum to his dapp, but there are other functionalities he is looking to add to his dapp as well.</p>SIWE: Batteries Not Included<p>Steve, in this case, has manually configured everything from the Sign-In with Ethereum library to all the other bespoke functionality derived from a few packages he found on the internet. He spends time carefully adding Sign-In with Ethereum through a library, and has to figure out how to add each additional feature he wants, such as his desired web3 provider, ENS resolution, and credentialing. Throughout this process, he's encountering endless documentation and joining endless Discord servers to find answers and get help troubleshooting.</p><p> With <a href="https://docs.ssx.id">SSX</a>, this gets a lot easier.</p><p>SSX is the functional equivalent of a Sign-In with Ethereum: Special Edition that includes the base game plus all downloadable content, add-ons, optional cosmetics, and more. For example, do you want to enable DAO logins or ENS resolution? Instead of doing the full configuration in your app from a number of disparate guides, just enable a feature flag – for example:</p> <code>const ssx = new SSX({
      enableDaoLogin: true,
    });</code> <p>We also never wish to limit developers in either flexibility in their code or the functionality they're interested in. Going back to our previous analogy, SSX doesn't just become Sign-In with Ethereum: Special Edition, but it also opens the door to modifications via extensions. </p><p>At Spruce, we're an open-source first organization that welcomes developers to have access to our code and also extend it as they please. There's no limit to what can be added regarding decentralized identity and data functionality with SSX.</p><p>For example, Steve would be able to add any functionality to SSX that wasn't available yet, such as imbuing users with decentralized chat functionality after they Sign-In with Ethereum.</p>Big closed-source software HATES this. Find out how Steve went from developer to contributor with this easy trick.<p>The core purpose of SSX is to be the foundation for what's possible with decentralized identity in web3. It doesn't just end with authentication; it's only the start of an entire journey for a user to own and control their identity and data across the web. </p> Getting Started  <p>Interested in getting started with SSX?

Therefore, the <a href="https://cybernews.com/">Cybernews</a> team has interviewed David Alexander, the CEO and Chief Platform Architect at <a href="https://mydex.org/">Mydex</a>, a Cloud-based platform security company focusing on personal and identity data management. Here, he will point out the most important measures we should consider to maintain our data safe&nbsp;online.</p><p>How did the idea of Mydex originate in 2007? What has your journey been&nbsp;like?</p><p>Mydex founders held two core beliefs: 1) that how personal data was being collected and used by organizations was often unfair. Individuals were being excluded from participating in decisions about their data and were failing to access the benefits of their data; 2) that the resulting loss of trust and conflicts would undermine the efficient workings of the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>We founded Mydex to empower individuals with their data — to provide a foundation for personal safety, trust, and&nbsp;agency.</p><p>We have learned since then that practical benefits such as reduced friction, effort, risk, and cost, for both citizens and service providers, are powerful reasons for adopting a different, citizen-empowering approach to the collection and use of data. We have designed our platform to deliver these benefits along with multiple quality improvements e.g. improved access; improved quality of service and outcomes; practical help for people wanting to get things done e.g. applying for something, accessing a new service, or communicating changes in preferences and&nbsp;status.</p><p>Our API-based data sharing technologies allow data to be accessed and used without the need to fill out forms or repeat information, and for trust (e.g. metadata about individual pieces of data) to travel with data as it is accessed and used. This enables radical reductions in duplicated effort, cuts out delays, and reduces risks for both&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Can you introduce us to what you do? What methods do you use to protect personal&nbsp;data?</p><p>At the heart of our platform lies a personal data store that enables individuals to safely assemble electronic copies of data held about them by many different organizations. They can also add information that only they know (for example about plans, goals, and preferences), and can share selected portions of this data with service providers when they need it, and always under their complete&nbsp;control.</p><p>Our services are free to individuals. Organizations wishing to interact with these citizens pay subscription fees to do so. Our platform services&nbsp;include:</p>  Personal Data&nbsp;Services  Identity Services  Next-generation two-way engagement services  <p>The protection of personal data is built into everything we do. All data is encrypted in motion and at rest. Each individual’s personal data store is separately encrypted, with each individual holding their key: we do not, and we do not want to, know what data individuals have in their PDSs. By distributing the data rather than creating one big centralized database, we greatly reduce hackers’ incentives to hack while greatly increasing the costs and complexity of their doing so. Mydex as a company has been independently audited and certified under ISO 27001 for Information Security and Management for the last nine&nbsp;years.</p><p>In your opinion, what data privacy issues should more people be concerned about?</p><p>We think the term “privacy” is often unhelpful when discussing issues relating to the collection and use of personal data. It is much more helpful to think of these issues in human terms of safety, agency, and fairness.</p><p>These are the key points to have in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Agency/utility. Looking at data through the lens of personal utility addresses the universal human need and desire for agency: the need to act effectively in their&nbsp;world.  Safety/”Safe by Default”. Humans have an instinctive desire for safety. When it comes to the collection and use of personal data this desire is best addressed by adopting “safe by default” processes. Much data sharing occurs as part of the normal provision of services to individuals by service providers.  Transparency. Transparency is needed for Safe By Default to work effectively: it should be easy and simple for individuals to see which organizations they have shared their data with, and for what purposes.  Data Empowerment. It should be simple and easy for individuals to exercise their rights under GDPR. For this, they need consent and data management dashboards where they can see all the data relationships they have in one&nbsp;place.  Fairness. It is best addressed by fair processes — e.g. processes that give individuals the right and the ability to shape what gets done and how to fit their own needs and preferences; that give them effective voice and mechanisms of control/influence.  <p>How do you think the recent global events affected your field of&nbsp;work?</p><p>Portable proof of claims and status has never been more important as people migrate across the globe whether driven by conflict or economic hardships. This is a trend that will not&nbsp;change.</p><p>Every man, woman, and child needs to be equipped with a portable repository of their lives and the data about their lives that is theirs and theirs for life that can travel with them and be protected from deprivation, loss of access to their devices, or single-point-of-failure reliance on state and local systems. Such a repository is essential to ensuring people are not left destitute or unable to rebuild their lives wherever they end up. Examples of the data held by such repositories are qualifications, experience (e.g. at work), assets, identity, marital status, parental status, DNA, and biometrics.</p><p>Recent events have shown that independent cloud-based storage that is resilient and independent of state or commercial actors is a fundamental requirement, as is the protected legal structure for any entity providing citizens with such services.</p><p>What are some of the worst mistakes organizations tend to make when it comes to handling large amounts of personal&nbsp;data?</p><p>These mistakes fall into three categories: mindset, purposes/priorities, and tech&nbsp;design.</p><p>Mindset. Many organizations see personal data as a corporate “asset” like any other — to be owned and monetized as efficiently and effectively as possible. But because personal data is about people, these organizations get sucked into treating people like&nbsp;things.</p><p>Purposes. Many organizations have fallen for the “insight myth”: the belief that the more data they can gather about an individual the more insights they will generate, making their resulting actions more efficient, effective, and profitable.</p><p>However, very often these activities do not require “more” data. They require exactly the right data for the task at hand. This makes data logistics — getting exactly the right data to and from the right people and organizations at the right times — the core driver of data value. Again, we are building the infrastructure and tools to enable this to&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Tech design. In their quest to build better customer experiences (and to access more personal data), many organizations expose internal systems that hold large amounts of data to the internet. This may make them part of the web or app experience layer, but most large systems holding high volumes of personal data were never designed to be available to the outside world, have not been designed to work at scale with high volumes of transactions, and often depend on perimeter-based protection which is all too often compromised.</p><p>What types of threats do you think can arise in the near future as digital identity becomes a significant part of our&nbsp;lives?</p><p>The risks we are currently dealing with are created mainly by this process of transition. The main risks&nbsp;are:</p>  Linking the wrong person to a set of credentials represents a real risk of fraud, identity theft, and all the bad things that could happen if this process is compromised or poorly executed.  Not linking a person to a set of verified digital credentials in an interoperable and portable manner that is independent of any specific scheme. In the dash for establishing markets and identity ecosystems, we see states, sectors, and large corporations seeking to define and take control of identity. The underlying proofs are not interoperable or portable across different use cases. This creates risks and huge inefficiencies, mostly arising from unnecessary duplication of&nbsp;effort.  <p>Mitigation of these risks can be achieved&nbsp;by:-</p>  Linking digital identity credentials with different factors (one or more sets of credentials) with other factors such as devices, email addresses, mobile numbers, and biometrics. There is a lot of interest in the processes being undertaken to bind these things together and then make those bindings irrefutable so that they can be trusted and monitored for any changes and used to secure multiple means of authentication.  Seeking real-world identity assurance linked to digital credentials. This is the next level of consideration where specific forms of proof of existence and status in the real world can be captured in a way that others can trust. These include relationships with the state (central and local government), and service providers (Banks, Credit Cards, Energy Suppliers, Health and Social Care, Third Sector, and Membership organizations).  <p>What are some of the best practices that organizations should adopt to protect their workforce and customer&nbsp;data?</p><p>Data should be encrypted in motion and at rest. Following the 12 principles of <a href="https://www.mrs.org.uk/fairdata/principles">Fair Data, Trust Mark</a> is a very good place to start. Mydex is certified under FairData as well as ISO27001 for information security management.</p><p>The Fair Data principles apply to any organization that works with personal data. Organizations that are certified under FairData are audited independently so they can demonstrate that they work in adherence to these 12 principles.</p><p>Talking about individuals, what actions should average Internet users take to protect their data&nbsp;online?</p><p>Individuals’ ability to protect themselves online is limited by the nature of the systems they are operating within: the rules and regulations, the policies and priorities adopted by organizations, the technologies used, etc. Most of the necessary solutions lie at the level of system design, not that of individual actions.</p><p>Take the parallel of driving a motor car. Individuals can drive safely and carefully or dangerously and recklessly. But they do so within the context of all the safety technologies that have been developed over decades by car manufacturers, and by all the rules and regulations relating to car safety, road safety, road infrastructure, driving tests, etc. Most individuals will do what they can to be safe and responsible. The question is, does the context in which they are operating help them or hinder them in this&nbsp;quest?</p><p>The issues we face with personal data are not limited to “online”. Huge amounts of personal data are held in legacy systems “offline”. We need ways forward that address all collection and use of personal data, both online and “offline”.</p><p>To this end, every individual should be provided with a personal data store where they can aggregate their data about themselves independently of any of the organizations they are currently dealing with. And they should not share information with any party outside of an authenticated relationship. We need systems and processes that routinely, safely, quickly, and cheaply authenticate the identities of the individuals who are asked to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Share with us, what’s next for&nbsp;Mydex?</p><p>Over the past 15 years, we have built personal data store infrastructure and supporting services that are now in operation and capable of operating at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Scaling up and out is what is next for Mydex — multiplying the number, type, and range of services, organizations, and people using personal data stores as the infrastructure for data collection and&nbsp;use.</p><p>As a Community Interest Company, we are asset and mission-locked. We are not chasing a trade sale or flotation. Our only focus is the fulfillment of our mission. As we grow our network expands and more and more citizens and service providers will operate under our trust framework and secure network of platform services. These place the citizen at the center, in control, acting as the point of integration and empowered to get things done faster, better, safer, and&nbsp;easier.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/interview-with-mydex-ceo-david-alexander-ed90e8259660">Interview with Mydex CEO David Alexander</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  NYDFS issued guidelines to tighten the pre-license verification process for banking organizations planning to engage in crypto activities.  The guidelines will apply both to local financial institutions as well as local branches of foreign financial entities with NYDFS licenses.  Banks need to provide information &amp; &amp; documents across six broad segments.  <p>Adrienne A. Harris, Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS), issued crypto-related guidelines for all banking organizations in New York on December 15th. It applies to both US-based financial entities and local branches of foreign banks with a DFS&nbsp;license.</p><p>The aim is to tighten the review process before granting licenses to banks for engaging in crypto operations.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/NYDFS/status/1603407999170760704?s=20&amp;t=CxQ4D8_opSjEeJBg1B1-Xw">Image Source</a>)<p>The FTX collapse prompted NYDFS to take precautionary measures against any future fallout of such&nbsp;scale.</p><blockquote>NYDFS insists this step would protect the hard-earned money of common investors while maintaining the competitive edge of financial institutions in a fast-changing financial market.</blockquote> Key Points <p>Any financial institution that wants to engage in any crypto activities will have to furnish a business plan with six categories of information at a broader level to the&nbsp;NYDFS.</p><p>These six categories are assets/currency, risk management strategy, corporate governance and oversight mechanism, consumer protection strategy, financials, and legal and regulatory analysis.</p><p>According to the agency, this information would enable it to properly assess the plans and proposals.</p><p>The guidelines also include a supplemental checklist of initial documents and information that a financial entity should provide the NYDFS while applying for a crypto&nbsp;license.</p> Regulatory Trends <p>NYDFS insists that it is crucial to set the expectations clearly and “communicate in a timely, transparent manner” as the regulatory approach keeps evolving.</p><p>And to play its part efficiently, the DFS claims to have analyzed the regulatory landscape minutely, assessed the prevailing trends in the market, and talked to consumer advocates, state and federal regulators, industry analysts and experts, and academics.</p> What’s Expected From Institutions Already Engaged in Crypto Activities? <p>Institutions already involved in crypto-related activities must “notify its point of contact at the Department if it has not already done&nbsp;so.”</p><p>Then, “The Department will seek further information or clarification and impose supervisory requirements, as needed,” says the&nbsp;release.</p> Reaction to the&nbsp;Proposal <blockquote>Surprisingly, the industry reaction to NYDFS’ guidance for banks to engage in crypto activities has been quite positive, with some users <a href="https://twitter.com/IosifPeterfi/status/1603754534597234692?s=20&amp;t=CxQ4D8_opSjEeJBg1B1-Xw">calling</a> it a “much-needed” move and another user <a href="https://twitter.com/gorbunov_vl/status/1604818314206662656?s=20&amp;t=CxQ4D8_opSjEeJBg1B1-Xw">saying</a>, “this decision looks&nbsp;good.”</blockquote><p>Some users also <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniobrasse/status/1603448014412169233?s=20&amp;t=CxQ4D8_opSjEeJBg1B1-Xw">welcome NYDFS’ latest guidelines for banks</a> as they believe cryptocurrencies significantly impact the risk profile of traditional financial institutions.</p><blockquote>That is not to say there is no criticism. For instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/SPIShiba/status/1604740742684893189?s=20&amp;t=CxQ4D8_opSjEeJBg1B1-Xw">one user said</a>, “This is huge. Why is nobody in Crypto talking about this? NY — DFS is saying that if you touch or do anything with Cryptocurrency, you need to have their direct approval if any residents of New York are involved. CEX providers are going to be out of compliance, quick.”</blockquote><p>Overall as of now, the positive responses are predominant.

<p>Modern authentication has involved the use of biometric data for years. However, maintaining privacy without sacrificing security has remained a challenge.</p>
<p>What is biometric encryption? Biometric encryption uses biometric data to encrypt and decrypt security keys to maintain user privacy and security.</p>
 How Does Biometric Encryption Work? 
<p>Biometric encryption is the use of a biometric template combined with a key for use as a method of authentication. This approach relies on the uniqueness of biometrics to ensure that hackers cannot reverse-engineer a password or key.</p>
<p>The process of biometric encryption includes:</p>
 
 Key Generation: The system will create a digital key when the user enrolls, distinct from a password or PIN. The user then provides their sample (a fingerprint scan, for example), which is bound to that digital key to creating a new “private template” that represents the key encrypted using the biometric itself but cannot be reversed into either the key or the original biometric. 
 Verification: When users seek verification, they provide their biometric sample. This sample serves as the decryption key that decrypts the original digital key. 
 Application: The released key can now be used as part of an application, either as a password or as an identifier for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate system. 
 
<p>In this process, biometrics can remain on private, local machines (like a mobile device) without disclosing unwanted private information.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Biometric Encryption? 
<p>The benefits of biometric encryption invoke the strengths of both strong encryption and biometric authentication. Security experts planned the creation of this encryption process to help minimize attack surfaces involved in authentication, namely the storage of biometric information or the use of passwords.</p>
<p>Some of these benefits include:</p>
 
 Privacy: Biometric storage presents a significant ethical and security challenge for organizations, both centered around the undesirable practice of storing large quantities of private biological information in a single place. Biometric authentication helps mitigate that by removing the need to store biometrics in a server. 
 Security: Biometrics is generally considered far more secure than traditional passwords. Biometric authentication adds a layer of protection by foregoing the need to store or transmit a password or biometric template. 
 Speed: Biometrics are simply easier to use. With the proliferation of scanners and cameras, it’s almost impossible not to have some device that can process biometric data. Accordingly, users can have faster and more reliable access to secure authentication without remembering passwords. 
 Compliance: Biometrics, including encrypted biometrics, are typically specified as an acceptable (often necessary) part of most security and compliance frameworks. 
 
 Is Biometric Encryption the Same as Private Biometrics? 
<p>Private biometrics, or encrypted biometrics, uses encryption algorithms to obfuscate biometric information while rendering it searchable. Algorithms using machine-learning-driven transformations involving encrypted feature vectors render the biometric data entirely unintelligible for humans while still useful as an authentication and identity verification tool.</p>
<p>Biometric encryption addresses two challenges with biometrics more broadly:</p>
 
 It’s generally considered unsafe to have biometric information in a database, serving as a honeypot for potential attacks. Stolen biometric data is a massive security concern, not the least, because it would allow hackers to undermine MFA and biometric authentication systems potentially. 
 Stored, centralized databases of personal and biological information present an ethical problem where data privacy and ownership run up against commercial concerns. 
 
<p>The suggested solution is to encrypt biometric data so that it cannot be publicly revealed to organizations managing authentication databases.</p>
<p>However, the challenges come when you consider the biggest application of biometrics–identification.</p>
<p>Private biometric methods ensure that the biometric template remains helpful in that capacity by utilizing an irreversible encryption process to render the template data much more minor and utterly unrelated to the original data. This encrypted information, however, is readily searchable in an authentication database and just as useful for authentication.</p>
<p>The benefit of this practice is that it allows users to continue to use biometric authentication without disclosing their private biological data–a key concern for privacy and human rights activities that worry about growing databases of personal biological data.</p>
 1Kosmos BlockID: Encryption and Biometrics for Modern Authentication 
<p>Biometrics are a staple of modern authentication, but depending on their implementation, they aren’t perfect. They can be spoofed or stolen, risking the security of user accounts and enterprise systems. With 1Kosmos, you can deploy biometrics bound to the user at the time of identity verification. Our biometrics ensure the user is the same user that initially enrolled their account. It can be no other. There is no possibility of compromise – can’t be stolen or spoofed.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can leverage biometrics and strong, decentralized authentication using the following features:</p>
 
 <a>SIM Binding</a>: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 <a>Identity-Based Authentication</a>: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 <a>Identity Proofing</a>: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 <a>Private and Permissioned Blockchain</a>: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain, encrypts digital identities, and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out-of-the-box integrations or via API/SDK.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>In the <a href="https://northernblock.io/converging-towards-a-common-trust-spanning-protocol-with-drummond-reed/">previous podcast episode</a> that Drummond and I recorded together in October, 2022, we touched upon the hourglass design model for digital trust applications, which was just about to be proposed as a new Technology Architecture Specification by the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP)</a>.</p>
 <p>Taken from THE TOIP TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION: https://trustoverip.org/our-work/technical-architecture/</p> 
<p>The hourglass model is perhaps the most widely recognized hallmark of the Internet protocol suite. The single “spanning layer” at the “waist” of the hourglass is the IPv4 protocol. Much of the success of the Internet is attributed to this “hourglass” design in which the spanning layer protocol maximizes interoperability by providing a common way for all the higher level layers to communicate with all the lower levels. For those interested, I discussed how this relates to digital trust in more detail <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip-foundation-the-first-public-review-draft-of-the-technology-architecture-v1-0-specification/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since we recorded that last podcast, I’ve spent time carefully reading through Kim Cameron’s 2005 whitepaper entitled “The Laws of Identity” (<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">PDF version</a>). I found it to be one of the most well written, and concise papers about (1) the impacts of not having trusted digital identities on the internet; and (2) seven laws to follow when designing digital identity systems if one wishes for it to be successful on the open internet.</p>
<p>It was interesting to then start visualizing how this ToIP hourglass model could start to embody the seven laws defined in Kim’s paper, which still resonates today, some 17 years after its publishing.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Drummond Reed, we discuss,<br><br></p>
 
 Does the new ToIP Technology Architecture Specification address the questions posed by Kim Cameron in his 2005 whitepaper? 
 If we agree that one identity system cannot rule them all, how then can an identity metasystem solve interoperability across identities, identity systems and contexts? (hint: a trust spanning protocol!) 
 What are the leading contenders for becoming the trust spanning protocol? 
 What are some examples of trust tasks, other than credential exchange, that are possible to unlock? 
 How does a trust spanning protocol x trust tasks lead to advancements in how we manage our relationships, and help us move away from phone numbers and emails as our most valuable identifiers? 
 Where can governments participate within the hourglass model framework to accelerate digital trust on the open internet?

<p>It can be said that in the Web3 space, you’re not truly involved if you haven’t been involved in a DAO. Without having set up a DAO, then Web3 applications seem to be behind the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Are DAOs really that important? 🤔</p><p>DAOs are very much like a blockchain based “company”. They encode management and operating rules on the blockchain in the form of smart contracts, thereby avoiding centralized control or third-party intervention. In today’s Web3, where DAOs are the trend, building a well-established DAO is a key part of many organizations and applications. When forming a company we may need to consider tax, finance, organizational structure, compensation system, etc. In fact, the formation of a DAO will also encounter such&nbsp;issues.</p><p>This article will focus on the construction of a DAO, to introduce the problems you will encounter in setting up a DAO, and the tools and products needed to solve these problems.</p> Establishment of&nbsp;DAO <p>In real life, setting up a company requires registration with a business bureau, and setting up a DAO will probably also require a realistic legal framework. Of course, you can choose to skip this step, but as a DAO that wants to grow in the long term, it will inevitably involve signing legal documents and other issues, and will then need a body to do all of the&nbsp;above.</p><p>Of course not all DAOs have the capacity and funding to put together a legal team, so there are now related projects on the market to help DAOs with the formation problem, such as Syndicate and Upstream Collective. Syndicate, for example, is a protocol that simply creates an organization for the user, adds its members, designs a legal structure for the DAO organization based on the needs of the creator, and creates the legal subject as well as providing a template for the protocol document.</p> DAO’s Communication <p>Since DAO members are located all over the world, participation is mainly online. Therefore, DAOs need a tool for convenient and timely communication among members. At present, there are two main communication tools used within DAOs, Discord and Telegram, and most projects prefer&nbsp;Discord.</p><p>The advantage of Discord is that it can subdivide the channels and classify the DAO members, complete a simple organizational structure, and have a simple bot service to solve some administrative duties and process routine affairs. The disadvantage is that the number of channels is too many, and the “noise” generated by them is easily distracting, so that participants cannot get the news in time. Therefore, some DAOs use Telegram for daily communication. Recently, the security of Discord is now being questioned.</p> Collaboration in&nbsp;DAO <p>Since the epidemic, the “work-from-home” approach is increasingly accepted by companies. In order to ensure the collaboration and efficiency of this way of working, remote collaboration tools are becoming more and more abundant and useful. Therefore, the current DAO collaboration tools mainly rely on traditional office software, such as Notion, Google docs and other tools. Of course, with the development of DAOs, there will definitely be collaboration tools specifically for Web3, such as Dework and Layer3, which have the trend of development in this&nbsp;area.</p> Incentives for&nbsp;DAOs <p>DAO participants are not all “do it just by love” type of people, “salary” is also one of their motivations. Nowadays, the mainstream DAO incentive model is usually to pay participants the “salary” corresponding to their contributions, and the overall logic is like PoW — more work= more pay. Therefore, the acceptance of DAO members’ work results and the corresponding incentive payment are especially important.</p><p>Among the existing products, Utopia labs and Parcel are the tools that can help DAOs to pay contributors and assess their contributions.</p> Conclusion <p>Of course, in addition to the above tools there are also decentralized multi-signature data clients for financial management, decentralized identity-based reputation scoring systems for membership management, and so on. As DAO is accepted in more fields, the application tools dedicated to DAO construction and management will be gradually enriched and refined, helping DAOs to develop&nbsp;better.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/if-there-is-no-suitable-dao-why-not-build-one-yourself-38cebf100b36">If There Is No Suitable DAO, Why Not Build One Yourself?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  The public sector is rarely seen as a driver of technological innovation; but when it comes to decentralized identity, some governments have been quick to embrace verifiable credential solutions. In our recent Indicio Meetup, we talked to three officials about why they chose this technology, how they implemented it, and why it created value.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Wherever you are in the world, you’ve probably heard that your government is “behind the curve” in technology, probably from your media and perhaps even from your own political representatives. But this isn’t the case with decentralized identity technology — at least, for some governments. In a recent Meetup, Indicio CEO Heather C. Dahl asked three officials to talk about why they chose the technology, how they implemented it, and what was the result.</p>
<p>The officials were:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nancy-norris/">Nancy Norris</a>, Senior Director of ESG &amp; Digital Trust in the Ministry for Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation for the Government of British Columbia</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-m-tanner-esq-95a7546/">Elizabeth M. Tanner, Esq.</a>, Rhode Island Secretary of Commerce</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andin-c-g-bikker-6361739/">Andin C.G. Bikker,</a> Former member of the Parliament of Aruba and Former Minister of Justice and Integration of Aruba.</p>
<p>The Fear of being first</p>
<p>Governments are risk averse, which is unsurprising when it comes to IT; no one wants to be the author of an expensive disaster that could have been avoided with a little research or a more mature solution. But waiting for something to be well-vetted and a safe choice is also a source of inertia, particularly when it comes to technology that is constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With government,” said Tanner, “what we hear is ‘we’re afraid of blockchain.’ They don’t know what it is, they’re afraid of any kind of security glitches, they’re not sure how it works. There is this fear of being first. Often the thinking is along the lines of ‘why don’t we let one of the other states try it out first?’”</p>
<p>Tanner spearheaded a project that used a distributed ledger network to store the records of those who had obtained a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) license. This would make it easier for CPAs to work across state lines and improve their professional standings, particularly when handling matters like tax returns in other states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way they overcame the generalized fear of the new going wrong, she said, was by starting small. They only tackled the CPA license; they ensured the user experience was as simple as possible, only consisting of a few forms; and they kept the old system for obtaining a license, so they had something to fall back on if there was a system failure.</p>
<p>Meeting the needs of business and the economy</p>
<p>In the case of British Columbia, the government was responding to the business community lobbying for the technology. Canadian companies wanted to use verifiable credentials to improve responsible mineral and natural gas sourcing, reduce carbon emissions, and to share that information with the marketplace. Verifiable credentials provided a secure, tamper-proof way of recording and sharing that information. “It’s a good news story for them,” said Norris, “it makes them more competitive. This is an opportunity to showcase the results of their hard work.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Aruba, an island economy entirely almost entirely dependent on tourism, Covid was a disaster. “All of a sudden,” said Bikker, “everybody realized… that we had to reinvent ourselves and that the technology would help us greatly in that aspect.”</p>
<p>Bikker was already investigating using verifiable credentials to make travel more appealing to tourists when the technology handed them a pandemic lifeline — a tamper-proof way to allow <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">tourists prove their health status</a> before arrival without complex integrations or data privacy issues.</p>
<p>What public sector use cases have in common</p>
<p>Uniting these diverse use cases was a common thread: Governments need to create easily verifiable data. That means tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and securely-transmitted data. That means avoiding complex IT integrations and third party data management. That means data which can be shared and verified across different domains and ecosystems, which means interoperable technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open-source decentralized identity technology provides all this—and in a way that is easy to deploy, meaning that government departments can quickly layer verifiable credentials into their existing systems, start with simple solutions, and then scale as needed. Indeed, Indicio designed <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> as a complete solution for simplifying the process of building solutions.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to watch the full conversation, which goes into much more detail on the projects and advice for others interested in starting their journey into decentralized identity. You can find a recording of it on the Indicio <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om5eCKV6Jh0&amp;t=4s">YouTube channel.</a></p>

<p>2022 has been an amazing year of growth, with many of our initiatives gaining momentum. Let's review what we accomplished this year and then take a look at what we have planned for 2023. </p> 2022: A Year in Review <p>2022 was an exciting year at Fission. We continued to build out our signature edge app developer toolkit, Webnative SDK, and laid the foundation for our database and virtual machine. We celebrated several research breakthroughs and grew our company's presence and team. </p> Templates Added to Webnative SDK <p>Webnative SDK is Fission's core product suite for edge app developers. It is a true local-first edge computing stack, enabling passwordless accounts and secure, user-owned public and private data.</p><p>This year Fission introduced a few templates to the SDK. The first was <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/enabling-ipfs-encrypted-storage-walletauth/">WalletAuth</a>, which lets users sign into webnative apps using their Ethereum blockchain address. There are two versions of the WalletAuth template - <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/walletauth">Svelte + TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/walletauth-react">React + TypeScript</a>. &nbsp; </p><p>The second is <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/webnative-app-template/">Webnative App Template</a>, which empowers developers to build edge apps in the browser without building all of the infrastructure from scratch. We launched WAT with built-in passwordless login and device-linking (which uses UCANs for authentication), powered by the Web Crypto API. We also included encrypted IPFS storage (by integrating WNFS). There are two versions of the Webnative App Template - <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template">Svelte + TypeScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/webnative-app-template-react">React + TypeScript</a>. </p><p>Third, we created a <a href="https://github.com/webnative-examples/create-webnative-app">CLI-generator</a> for both WalletAuth and WAT. </p><p>Finally, we launched a new website for <a href="https://webnative.dev/">Webnative SDK</a>, packed with resources including these game-changing templates, demos, and developer documentation.</p>Fancy new Webnative branding! Research Accomplishments <p>We were able to make an exciting contribution to distributed systems data management by inventing the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-the-skip-ratchet/">Skip Ratchet</a>. The skip ratchet enables developers to move more efficiently across data in a hash chain. It builds on the idea of deterministic skip lists and has built-in security enhancing features, like the ability to limit read access.</p><p>We also submitted the first IPIP for IPFS that helps improve the protocol itself. <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/introducing-redirect-support-for-ipfs/">Redirect Support for IPFS</a> makes it easier to host web applications by telling the Gateway to intercept missing paths and treat them as rewrite rules, letting the single HTML file and the JavaScript it loads handle all of the routing. In other words, no more ugly error messages. Hello, redirected pages! </p> Conferences We Attended <p>2022 was the year of the conference! Now that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic has mercifully subsided, we've been able to travel and present in person at conferences again! This year we went to Portugal, Germany, The United States, Iceland, and France to give talks on our work building Webnative SDK.</p><p>Here is a list of the conferences and their corresponding blog post recaps:</p><p>CoD Summit</p>

 Plans for 2023 <p>Now that we've reviewed 2022, let's look ahead at our plans for 2023. As a leader and contributing member in a robust community, we have many initiatives in the works! Here are a few we're excited about: </p> Webnative SDK Additions <p>IPVM, our VM that brings content addressed computation to IPFS, is coming along nicely! Our CTO Brooklyn Zelenka is working on the spec now. If you'd like to learn more about IPVM, check out this <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">breakdown</a> from Brooklyn's presentation at IPFS Thing earlier this year.</p><p>Dialog, our far edge database for local-first applications and autonomous computing agents, is now RhizomeDB! <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/why-rewrite-it-in-rust/">We are focusing on Rust</a>, however others will certainly be able to create implementations in other languages. The repo will be private initially, but we'll be sure to keep you updated as we hit significant milestones! In the meantime, do check out these posts that provide a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-reactor-dialog-first-look/">first look</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">explain our approach</a> in more detail. &nbsp;</p> Ecosystem Projects <p>Commons Funding: Fission is a fiscal host and contributor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and is currently spearheading several fundraising initiatives, including one to bring <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission/contribute/ipfs-media-support-for-mastodon-48315">IPFS support to Mastodon</a>. </p><p>CASA: Fission is a member of the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CASA">Chain Agnostic Standards Alliance</a>, working to make blockchains interoperable. We initiated <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> in response to MetaMask deprecating ETH encrypt/decrypt, and we are working with others in CASA to document a secure way for blockchain key material to be used for encryption and decryption. </p><p>Permissioned Data Working Group: This is a new working group focused on enabling permissioned and private data on Filecoin.</p><p>FIL Accounts Working Group: We will continue our work to integrate UCAN and WalletAuth into FIL Accounts in 2023.</p><p>WhoCAN / NNS: WhoCAN and the Name Name Service introduce a new way to share UCAN permissions with keys without knowing what those keys are.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>The role of Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is still massively undervalued by many organizations. Both drop-off and churn rates are heavily impacted by cumbersome registration and outdated authentication options. Despite this fact, CIAM still is frequently treated as a side-show by the teams creating digital experiences. This also leads to disparate approaches across digital services, and in consequence to a negative user experience. CIOs must put close collaboration of software engineers and DevOps teams high on their agenda. CTOs need the right tools for rapidly delivering digital services. CISOs request unified security architectures. CDOs and CMOs care for customer experience. Thus, CIAM must become a standard architecture component and service in every organization. This integrated perspective is fundamental for success in the digital age.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thank you for joining this new episode. We often talk about digital transformation in this podcast. Actually one aspect that still needs to become more digital is commercial trade documents, in which there’s still a lot of paper. Today, our guests will tell us more about a game changing piece of legislation. So let’s welcome our guests, we have two guests today.</p>
<p>First of all, Chris Southworth, he is Secretary General at the International Chamber of Commerce, ICC, in the United Kingdom. Prior to joining ICC he was Executive Director for Global Partnerships at the British Chambers of Commerce, BCC, Head of the International Chamber of Commerce unit at the UK Trade and Investment, UKTI, and a Senior Policy Advisor to Lord Heseltine for his independent review of UK Competitiveness. Hello, Chris.</p>
<p>Chris Southworth: Good morning.</p>
<p>Oscar: Good morning. And our second guest is Oswald Kuyler. He’s currently the Global Head of Strategy for MonetaGo, a FinTech focused on global fraud prevention. Oswald is also a Digital Standards Adviser to the International Chamber of Commerce, UK. And he’s also the former Management Director of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, DSI. He has worked on initiatives covering blockchain, electronic documentation in trade, data and analytics, and automation. Hello, Oswald.</p>
<p>Oswald Kuyler: Hi, how are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you both in this conversation.</p>
<p>Oswald: Thank you for the invite. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>Oscar: My pleasure. So, Chris and Oswald, let’s talk about digital identity. I would like to hear first from you, from both of you, tell us about yourself and your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Chris: Sure, I mean, I should say that in the class of this conversation, I’m the co-chair of the Legal Reform Advisory Board and part of the leadership group at the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, and also the ICC representative to the Commonwealth, which is super relevant when we start talking about legislation and English law.</p>
<p>I mean, my background in digital trade really goes back to when I started getting really active around 2016-17, where we helped put together the ICC digital trade roadmap to get a framework in which we could be very clear with the actors of which there are many in the trading system of what needed to be done, by who, by when. And that was the beginning of, I think, a more structured conversation about how we go about the big task of digitalising world trade and ultimately contributed to the creation of the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, amongst other things, but also the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. So, it was quite a seminal piece of work.</p>
<p>And then since then, been very focused on our responsibility in the UK, because every jurisdiction needs to tackle this legal barrier in the document, trade documentation space, which is where national laws stipulate that commercial trade documents, that’s bills of lading, bills of exchange, promissory notes, those sorts of documents, there are eight actually in total, have to be handled on paper. And that’s largely because the laws in which we operate in trade go back a long time. In our case, in English law, it goes back to 1882 in the bills of exchange act.</p>
<p>So, it’s not surprising that that bill, which is a great piece of law, and we’re not proposing changing the law actually. All we’re doing with Electronic Trade Documents Bill is putting digital documentation or documents handled in digital form, I should say, on the same legal footing as paper documents. So, it’s actually quite a minor amendment in that, but there’s a lot more complexity behind that from a legal point of view, which is why it has taken, you know, nearly four or five years to come to fruition. So, we’re absolutely delighted that the bill has come into place.</p>
<p>And then alongside that, really working with the global community in the ICC Digital Standards Initiative, Oswald, and then in the UK case, with the creation of the UK Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation. You know, and the big questions there is how do we help drive a global campaign to every single government now asking them to very clearly to say that we need to remove the legal barrier to the handling of commercial trade documents. And then we need to align our national legal frameworks to what’s called the UNCITRAL Model or Electronic Transferable Records or MLETR in abbreviation terms. That’s really, really important. And unfortunately, you can’t do that at global level. Or, if you do, it have to be through the World Trade Organisation. And in the current political environment, that’s not realistic. So, it is a big task.</p>
<p>What I am really pleased to see now sort of forward tracking, you know, two or three years is we’re seeing real momentum, the G7 are really driving forward, the UK is obviously part of that, but the US have legislation, the Germans have legislation, the Chinese actually outside of the G7, are actively working on legislation. So, we’re starting to see the big economies now, really grasp the issue that we need to not just digitalise customs and trade facilitation where a lot of the focus has been. We need to allow the private sector, which is actually the largest share of trade, of course, because it is ultimately businesses that trade, to digitalise those documents. And that means we can get scale, we can start to really get interoperable systems into place where information can move in standard formats across platforms, systems, and processes across borders.</p>
<p>For anyone who’s not a sort of trade aficionado, it’s very easy to miss the sort of the reality of trade. You know, in our consumer lives, we all operate on mobile phones these days, life is pretty easy, you can tap your phone, you can get your bank details, you can do everything off your phone. And that’s simply because the systems are interoperable. It’s all standardised, doesn’t matter who your provider is, what network you’re on, the hardware and software all connects. Well, in the trade environment, none of it connects. It’s like, you know, the consumer world was 30, 40 years ago. And so, I call it the sort of Apple-Microsoft moment in trade where those two companies, and for anyone old enough to remember what it was like when those two didn’t talk to each other, it was – you had to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>You know, we’re at that moment when those two companies sat down, standardise their systems, and then our Word documents and all these other sort of practical pieces of information could just move across our hardware, software. Well, that’s the cusp we’re at so its super exciting. It’s, you know, effectively, we’re in the biggest transformational stage in world trade that I think we’ve ever seen in terms of the way we go about trade. It’s not just about digitalising eight documents, it’s about fundamentally changing the way we trade so it’s more efficient, you know, it’s click of a button money, goods, services, all move at the same time. And then ultimately, it’ll be about things like atomic settlement, digital currencies, you know, the transactions will happen in real time as the goods ship across the borders, rather than having to wait for two to three months at extraordinary cost and bureaucracy, because we’re all operating on paper.</p>
<p>And then I should just finalise, you know, just say how important this is to sustainability, because that also sometimes gets a bit missed. We can’t deliver a sustainable global economy until we get off paper. Because you can’t get transparent systems into place, you can’t aggregate the data, you can’t get a sense of real time what’s going on, where it’s going on in the trade corridors and supply chains until we get higher volume, accurate data, in digital systems. So, it’s a really important enabler to allow us then to kind of support the shift and transition towards ultimately a net zero economy but certainly more sustainable global value chains.</p>
<p>Oswald: Yeah, and maybe to build off of what Chris has just said, like, if I reflect a little bit on my journey on getting to the point where we are today, I used to work at a really big mining firm. And one of the key things we were actively trying to do is figure out how do we actually digitise whether it is our creative processes, with our customers, or with our suppliers and kind of what’s required to actually get that done. And we realise that if one of the largest miners in the world can’t achieve this, how are smaller companies actually going to enable the digitisation of these processes?</p>
<p>And to Chris’s point, there are many business cases and reasons why you actually want to do that. You know, whether it is for working capital reduction, whether it’s for ESG, and transparency, the list goes on and on and on. And a lot of these things just can’t be done using traditional paper mechanisms. And so, as a part of the journey, one of the things that Chris and I worked on a few months ago, was to try and put a lot of these things in context. And when you think about global trade, you know, 80%, and it sounds like a funny statistic, but I promise you it’s on the internet, 80% percent of global trade is actually supported by what we call trade finance. And if you have a look at trade finance, and it’s super important because it helps the world businesses actually execute business which is again foundational to having societies operate.</p>
<p>Now, when you think about trade finance. So how do banks really enable that? And it really comes down to really two core kind of buckets of things. The first is really, do I trust, or can I trust and identify the company or the companies that are involved in a trade transaction? And so, this is where identity and specifically the evolution of identity towards digital identity will play an absolutely key role.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you don’t solve identity, a lot of the inefficiencies generally won’t go away. And so, it’s fantastic seeing, even after the big global financial crash a few years ago, one of the first things that happened was GLEIF was formed, the LEI was established, you know, a lot of investments went into that. There are some additional standards that have matured and come out on the identity space, things like the W3Cs, DID specification. So, one of the things that motivated me quite a bit is this recognition that it’s not that we, as a society, need to spend another 10 years figuring out how do we solve identity. There’s a lot of great things out there. It’s more how do we actually mobilise people and businesses to actually adopt what’s out there and actually leverage it.</p>
<p>And the second bucket, which is just as important when you think about trade finance is the actual documents that are involved in trade. And Chris hit the nail on the head, the reality is, it’s very difficult to digitise trade documents if you don’t actually have some form of legal foundation, where you can actually transfer the possession of the documents in a way that is safe, a way that you can go into a court of law and dispute it, et cetera, et cetera. So, these two key areas are fundamentally critical. And it’s been a part of the journey that we’ve gone on, at least as a part of trying to figure out how do we contribute into the space.</p>
<p>Now, for your listeners, one of the key things I would highlight that Chris also touched on, because I think it’s so important, is the ICC produced a digital roadmap about four years ago. And I’ll never forget, when I left the mining company and I joined the International Chamber of Commerce, basically, it was such a fantastic foundational piece, because it highlighted all the key areas that required work, that required solving for, that industry, and government, public and private sector can actually focus on and say, “This is what we all need to do to solve the challenges so that not just the big companies can digitise trade but the smaller ones.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, who don’t have big innovation teams, who don’t have huge technology functions, who don’t have millions of dollars that they can allocate towards digital transformation agendas can actually digitise too as a part of this journey. And that’s been refreshed. I’m not sure Chris, if it’s yet released or not, but there’s a new roadmap, that is just brilliant. Again, it helps us all focus our efforts.</p>
<p>So that’s a little bit, at least at the macro level view from my side. You know, we need global trade to work. Businesses need that. Trade finance is foundational to enabling the world to trade. And digital identity and documents are the core pillars that enable global trade globally.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, this is touching on some really important points. I mean, and it links to what I was saying as well around antiquated systems. So, the role of the banks here is really important. I don’t think this is fully appreciated, actually, outside of the banking community. But in 9/11, that’s 20 years ago, at 9/11, I mean 2001, in came, you know, a huge wave of anti-terrorist financing regulation and legislation. We all understand why.</p>
<p>And then in 2008, financial crisis, in came another wave, anti-money laundering legislation, amongst other things. And again, capital requirements, you know, market stabilisation mechanisms. Again, we all understand why. But it came at an enormous cost. And ever since then, this particularly the financial crisis, we’ve been running at a 1.5 trillion trade finance gap. And what’s happened is the regulations have effectively tied the banks up in knots, in bureaucracy, having to verify, identify, and that’s all for legitimate reasons. The difference is, is the world’s moved on in terms of technology. All of those processes that the banks have to undertake, which nobody’s arguing with, can just be done so much more intelligently, with smarter use of technology, and it all hinges on identity.</p>
<p>If you can identify a company at the click of a button on a transparent register, you’re saving yourselves days, weeks, hours in time in checking, rechecking, verifications, duplication, every bank, there’s no central registry, outside of – well, I’m sure we’re going to talk about the GLEIF LEI register amongst other things.</p>
<p>So, you have to just – everybody has to check the same company in their own systems. And nobody gets transparency, what the other banks and other financial institutions do. None of that is necessary if we just use the Legal Entity Identifier model, which is digital identities. That’s absolutely crucial. And then it allows you, of course, to then start tackling other wider issues like fraud, VAT gaps, you know, governments are running huge VAT gaps in many areas, even in the UK, it’s 9 billion pounds. You know, in a world where government is short on public finance, like all governments, you’re looking for ways to generate more growth, economic growth and trade growth.</p>
<p>You know, we have a wonderful opportunity here by simply adopting, you know, the digital identity system and getting ourselves fit for purpose for the modern way of working in the trading system. And the digital identity is the absolute foundational core of that system. Without the identity, you can’t tackle the bureaucracy on verifications and anti-money laundering and KYC, all of this kind of stuff. You can’t tackle the fraud question well enough; you can’t tackle the VAT gap issue. It ticks multiple boxes in one go, and it’s not expensive.</p>
<p>The issue actually, that we get most feedback on in the corporate community is companies just don’t know they exist. And so, the first job is really to raise awareness, what is a digital identity? How can it help your business? And then importantly, how can you use it in your global supply chains? How do you work with your suppliers? So, you get total transparency, you can strip out all of that inefficiency, you can still meet all your regulatory requirements, but you’re just doing it in so much more efficient ways. And it’s just about using those technologies, enabling technology to help you run a more efficient, faster, quicker, simpler operation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see definitely a lot of benefits and why we’re talking about this. So, it’s so important. Let’s go to the details. So, what is this bill? What is the Electronic Trade Documents Bill?</p>
<p>Chris: Well, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill is really an amendment of the two pieces of law, the Bills of Exchange Act in 1882, in English law, I should say, and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act in 1992. Now, clearly, those are out of date in the modern world of using technology.</p>
<p>So, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill is really quite simple. It’s putting commercial trade documents in digital form. And it’s important, it’s not digital documents, we’re not talking about PDFs here. We’re talking about getting the information off the paper and into the IT system. That’s basically what we’re talking about. But what the bill does is it puts commercial trade information in digital form on the same legal footing as paper. So, if there’s a dispute or companies are in a disagreement in a court, if you’re working on a blockchain platform, or a technology platform or system, that will stand up in court. That’s not the case at the moment. It has to be on paper. It has to be written, signed, and so on, and so forth.</p>
<p>And then it also stipulates which is important, the need for secure technology platforms to handle that information. And of course, that’s where solutions like blockchain come in. I don’t think actually blockchain is the only solution. But it is clearly a major part of the solution in the current trading system. But that’s obviously very, very important in terms of data security.</p>
<p>So, the law really doesn’t do much more than that. It’s only a page and a half, actually. People are surprised when they see it, because it looks deceptively small. It looks like really, almost a non-piece of legislation. But, you know, what’s important here is the disproportionate positive impact that will have, because it allows us to digitise the whole transactional space. So, at the moment, you can deal with digital certificates of origin, customs declarations, all of that kind of thing can pretty much be handled in digital form, that you can’t do the commercial trade transaction, which is actually the bigger more important aspect because that’s the actual handling of the goods, the finance, and the ownership when goods are crossing over borders.</p>
<p>So once those that legal barriers removed, it allows industry and government to start to really standardise the whole ecosystem. And that’s where we get paperless borders, frictionless borders. We still have to undergo the processes, you still have to do a transaction but you can do it in a radically shorter periods of time. You can do it without any of the process that you currently have to do. You know, there are 27 documents, 30 documents in total that companies are having to handle. It can take up to two to three months. It can cost in total, easily $80,000 or more plus, when you add it all up. It’s an extremely expensive business. And obviously, it’s hugely bureaucratic.</p>
<p>There was one example in the pandemic that really just highlighted all of this in one situation. And that was when the first wave of the pandemic was hitting the global economy. We were all going into lockdown, but our ships had left the ports. So, in the UK context, you know, our ships have left the southern ports, and we’re heading out to the east, to the Chinese ports through Singapore. And then three weeks later, we all got bombarded across the media with, you know, this huge logjam, traffic jam of ships sitting in Singapore. None of them could dock in, none of the goods could get in to port. And that was because all the documents were sitting in brown envelopes at Heathrow Airport, because all the airplanes had been grounded.</p>
<p>Well, that was completely unnecessary. Really, all of those documents, that information should have been in the system, the digital system, and then the transactions could have actually happened in real time. And that delay, and all the disruption which we’re still feeling today for consumers, businesses, and everybody should really have never happened at that scale. That’s the kind of impact we’re talking about by the Electronic Trade Documents Bill.</p>
<p>And then in the English context, English law context, obviously, this is going to be – have a dramatic effects and positive effects on the UK trading system. But actually, the more exciting aspect of this for me is the Commonwealth. Because we have 53 countries who all share almost word for word the same pieces of English law. And so, the Electronic Trade Documents Bill suddenly opens up the opportunities to accelerate that legal reform process across 53 countries. I think faster than any other global network can achieve it. Because we simply share the same legal basis. That’s one of the huge advantages of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>So, then it starts to get really exciting because it starts to happen at scale across big economies like India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, obviously, and then actually huge swathes of Africa as well, don’t forget. So that’s the big opportunity come mid next year, once we’ve got the law in place in the UK, certainly my mind is absolutely switching on to that global environment. And by the way, even the Chinese, the Thais, we’re working with the Thai government at the moment on helping them with their legislation. You know, they’re also interested in the Electronic Trade Documents Bill. There are translatable aspects of that bill, that can be not necessarily copied and pasted but certainly the principles can be drawn across into other legal systems.</p>
<p>So, you know, to put this in context of documents, 80% of bills of lading worldwide are all operating on English law. So English law, and that’s a part of our heritage, our history, our legacy in the world. English was a disproportionately larger impact on trade than any other law in the world. So, the English law piece is crucially important. And that’s why we’ve put so much energy into it.</p>
<p>So, it’s really exciting in terms of stage, we’re at the second, what they call, the second reading it’s the second, you know, the sort of series of committees and forums that you have to go through in Parliament. It’s on a fast-track procedure through Parliament, which is good. We don’t have to have a whole year in Parliament discussing it. We’ve had two readings, we’re into the third, but by the middle of next year, we’re expecting it to come into force. And that means no more requirements for paper on any documentation in the UK. The whole UK system can go digital, and then we can really switch on to work with our trading partners.</p>
<p>By the way, the UK Government is wiring all of this into our trade corridors. So, every single trade negotiation at the moment with UK has commitments in the negotiations to go digital to adopt, align our legal systems, I should say to the MLETR framework. So, you know, it’s pushing out digital corridor, just like the Singaporeans have been doing for quite some time. You know, the UK is now starting to do that in the western hemisphere. And then obviously, in due course, the Germans, the US and everyone else will start doing it too. And then the world system will start changing at a rapid, more rapid pace.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s something that clearly, I was thinking of asking you, OK, this is in the UK, it’s going to be in place next year in the UK, thinking first one single country, but now that you explain that already spills to many countries, and with the influence that you mentioned, that has the English law in even more jurisdiction is quite impressive.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, it’s not just jurisdictions actually because like, say sort of bills of lading, 80% of those operate in English law. But a lot of international contract law is actually using English law. So, there’s a lot of private sector transactional work in all parts of the world that is actually operating on English law. I mean it’s a bit deceptive in a way because you naturally think English law is England, or even Wales, I should say. It doesn’t operate like that. English law kind of has this enormous global reach into sectors, industries, jurisdictions. That’s the really exciting aspect of this Electronic Trade Documents Bill is the scale, the scale of opportunity that it opens up.</p>
<p>Oswald: And maybe Oscar, to double click on what Chris was just said and to build on that is today, there’s a bunch of form platforms that enables people to try to digitise, you know, trade processes. And fundamentally, what they all are based on are these private law agreements, where the two of us sign a contract and say, sure, you know, if I email you this document, or if my system says you possess it, based on the private contract you have some form of recourse. But the problem with that at the top end, so if you imagine you’re a big multinational companies, you have to go convince your entire ecosystem. So, all your suppliers, all of your banks, all of your customers, everyone to sign up to the exact same legal agreement to say this is how we’re all going to operate. And what we’ve seen is really two or three consequences of that.</p>
<p>Firstly, the banks are sitting in a position where they are almost forced to sign up to every single one, because they fundamentally enable trade, and it’s exceptionally difficult to navigate that complexity. The second challenge is, when you think about it in practical terms, if you have, let’s say, two of the largest mining companies in the world, one deciding to use Platform A and another one deciding to use Platform B. You end up in a situation where suppliers and especially the smaller companies are put in a position where if they wanted to engage with those mining companies, now all of a sudden, they have to be onboarded onto multiple platforms, pay more money, teach a smaller workforce how to deal with more systems, and it just doesn’t scale. And the reality is, if you don’t sign up to all of the agreements, you have no legal recourse. And that’s why we’ve been stuck at about 1-2% of trade digitisation globally for the last two decades.</p>
<p>The second portion, and again, this is where identity really comes in. It blows my mind when you think about it. Every single one is the existing digital trade platforms, whether its internal supplier relationship management systems, customer relationship management systems, ERP, identity is done in completely different ways today. It’s not standards based. And some of these systems were designed 20 years ago. So, a lot of the cases identity was designed by some architect that just went and said, “OK, it’s going to be a string 256 field, and people can type in whatever they want to.”</p>
<p>And so, what ends up happening is as you go through a supply chain, to Chris’s point, every single part of that supply chain has to recheck identity, there’s no sharing of it, because there’s no, you know, there’s no alignment, agreement, governance, et cetera, on how that needs to be done. And by using digital identity and all the promises that it entails, again, you can remove a lot of that inefficiencies. And it’s not just that we want to remove that just purely for the banks, who I firmly believe are desperate for servicing more customers. It’s not like bankers wake up in the morning and saying, “I don’t want to serve more businesses.” But this is important for those SMEs who are just so small that when a bank looks at them, and goes, “I really want to finance this, but if it’s going to cost me that much just to verify the identity of a company, it’s very difficult to extend financing into that space.”</p>
<p>So, my closing thoughts on what Chris also said is, when it comes to English law, let’s also not forget that, and I would argue the vast majority of trade digitisation systems are either UK-based or leveraging English law too, which is another component of this. So [A] for all of those companies who have already invested in trying to digitise trade, once English law moves, they’ll get that benefit because it would be baked in. But then more importantly, those smaller companies who go, “You know what? I don’t necessarily potentially want to use a FinTech to digitise my trade. Maybe I just want to use email, WhatsApp, SharePoint, whatever it might be.” English law will give them the freedom to make those decisions with their supply chains, which I think is desperately needed.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, we’re not the only ones of course here. So, there’s a couple of important points here. The France is important. So, France is actively now moving to working on legislation. They’ve already identified the legal barriers. That’s the first stage. The second stage is now to draft a legislation. But of course, you know, surprise, surprise many of the Francophone countries around the world like West Africa, they’re following the same laws as France. So, and then Hispanic, huge parts of Latin America following the same basis in law.</p>
<p>So English law obviously operates in a slightly disproportionate impact beyond just the legal jurisdictions as Oswald has just said. But other parts, other country and other countries and their legal systems playing a crucially important role here. If we’re going to have changed in Latin America at scale, legally, then we really need to kind of have that model like the Electronic Trade Documents Bill equivalent, you could almost replicate or at least use that as a reference point.</p>
<p>It’s a very, very good point that Oswald just referenced. And this is a core, really for corporates so if there’s anyone who’s listening to this, as a corporate, from my perspective, I’m very much looking at this whole digital identity in the UK context, because I think it’s a great case study. And it helps us understand what’s going on and other markets. So, we know every listed company has a digital identity, because the regulation says they have to, in order to trade on the market. So, we know the corporate is gone.</p>
<p>So, the first question is, who registered for that digital identity? That’s a board director. So that’s upstairs, somebody has done the process and put their signature and got an LEI. The person who manages that, is the company secretary, also upstairs in the boardroom environment somewhere. And then we also know, they’re not using it in the supply chain. So, they’re fulfilling a regulatory requirement. Absolutely right. But they’re not utilising it to its full benefit. And that’s because that digital identity hasn’t travelled downstairs to the procurement managers, the supply chain managers, the buyers, and so on, and so forth, who can then deploy this at scale through their global supply chain to Oswald’s point, really. And then really encouraging all that supply chain to adopt an LEI. And then you’ve got full transparency, you know, exactly who is who in that system at the click of a button on one transparent register. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>By the way, it’s 30 pounds a year. Cost, it’s not a cost issue. This is not expensive at all. It’s just understanding what a digital identity is, how you get one, and importantly, how you utilise it. But if you imagine 30% of the major listed companies in the FTSE 100, for instance, big international trading companies all use the digital identity through their global value chain, that would be the equivalent of what half a million up to a million businesses, all using LEIs and digital identities. That’s the sort of transformational impact that we’re talking about. And that’s the kind of strategic thinking that we need to apply in order to really get momentum around the use of these digital identities. And then with all the growth benefits that come with it, which Oswald has already set out.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s really impressive. And thanks a lot for enlightening us about this very influential bill that it’s already almost flying, right? So, I will ask a final question for both of you, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Oswald: So in practical terms, what I would say is, have a look at your five-year plan, one-year plan, whatever your projects are for the next five years that you’re going to do, especially for at a big company, look at them, and recognise that quite a few of the opportunities in front of you are ecosystem-based opportunities where you need to work with whether it’s customers, banks, your carriers, your, you know, governments or whatever. You need to work with a broader group to actually get to that value.</p>
<p>And so, my view would be is go into, tell your teams say, “Hey, there’s an ICC standards toolkit. And this toolkit, it highlights all the standards, whether it’s identity of objects, identity of subjects, whether it’s title documents, whether it’s non-title documents. Build off that. Whatever we’re building because it means that we can engage an ecosystem way more efficiently.”</p>
<p>And then the second item is if I am a smaller company, and I don’t necessarily have these innovation budgets and projects, et cetera, et cetera, to Chris’s earlier point, there is something like an LEI, for example, which is digital identity, leveraging that and baking that into either getting it today, or putting it in your budget for next year so you can get it next year. These things will become increasingly more important for banks because it will help them shorten the amount of time required to do KYC on you so you will get the value benefit. Just make sure you’ve budgeted for it, make sure you understand it, and you’ll get the value from that.</p>
<p>Chris: Yeah, I completely agree with that. You know, in terms of a call to action, you’re a CEO, a CFO, a supply chain manager, in the legal department, General Counsel, you’ve got a massive opportunity here to really improve the way that you’re trading across your supply chain. And that means doing things cheaper, faster, simpler in the main but ultimately also about moving to a more sustainable system where you get more transparency and security through your value chain.</p>
<p>The answer is simply if you’re a listed company, go find your LEI, sit down with your supply chain manager and your bank and finances, and then really talk, have that utilisation conversation. How can I use this number to better effect to drive those sorts of benefits through the business? If you’re not a listed company, go get an LEI, you can do that through the Centre for Digital Trade and Innovation, that’s <a href="https://ubisecure-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chloe_hartup_ubisecure_com/Documents/Documents/Podcast/Episodes/Episode%2082%20-%20Chris%20Southwater%20&amp;%20Oswald%20Kuyler/www.c4dti.co.uk">www.c4dti.co.uk</a>. It’s 30 pounds to register. You can do it through the centre very, very easy. We’ve tried to strip away that ease.</p>
<p>If you’re in another jurisdiction, you can go to the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, GLEIF as it’s called. There’s a global register, there’s a list of all the issuers in the world, there are 35 of those. So, you can find the issuer of digital identities in your jurisdiction or region. About eight of those are global issuers. It’s very, very easy. Go get your LEI. It’s cheap, it drives massive benefit to your system. And most importantly, all trade will require in due course, digital identities. So that is 100% the future, the quicker we start to adopt them and use them, the faster we can get to that end outcome, which I think we all want.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, thank you. And if someone would like to get in touch with you or learn more about the work you’re doing, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Chris: Well, for me, it’s as simple you know, just get in contact, I think in the context of this conversation, the Centre for Digital Trade Innovation, you can do that through <a href="https://ubisecure-my.sharepoint.com/personal/chloe_hartup_ubisecure_com/Documents/Documents/Podcast/Episodes/Episode%2082%20-%20Chris%20Southwater%20&amp;%20Oswald%20Kuyler/info@iccwbo.uk">info@iccwbo.uk</a>. We’re easily findable on the websites, on social media, just get in touch, LinkedIn, happy to help. We’re here to support industry. Ultimately, our job is to try and accelerate that digital transformation over the coming years. Users, we’re set up here to help you, come ask and let’s do it and we’ll help make that happen.</p>
<p>Oswald: So, fully aligned to Chris, the Centre for Future Trade and Innovation, reach out. If you can’t find the website, find us on LinkedIn, both Chris and I are there. We can kind of move you towards that. That should be your go-to.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Again, thank you for this very interesting conversation and all the best.</p>
<p>Oswald: Thank you.</p>
<p>Chris: Thank you, thanks.</p>

				  Proven Works was created to reduce the time consuming and expensive process of employee verification and provide easy-to-use, tamper-proof employee identity. Here’s how Proven Works, works.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Mike Ebert</p>
<p>The benefit of Proven Works is that it allows companies and organizations to issue proof-of-employment credentials to their employees. Why would companies and organizations care? Because by including employee, employer, and employment information in a portable verifiable credential, Proven Works unlocks a host of benefits — including enhanced security, a reduction in wasted time, and lower costs for all of the parties involved in an employment ecosystem.</p>
<p>By storing employee, employer, and employment details in a verifiable credential, you can quickly verify and trust that data. For example, if you have trusted employment data, you could avoid fraud or phishing attempts by using a verifier to prove that an individual is an employee of the company before taking a sensitive action. Some basic authentication and authorization workflows are also included with the solution, such as using an employment credential to open a building door or access a zoom call, further increasing the security of your offices and meetings.</p>
<p>Another major benefit is the reduction in time and money wasted entering and duplicating the same employment details over and over again, such as when applying for benefits, working with a payroll company, or when applying for a loan with a financial institution. This reduction in redundant work also has the additional advantage of lessening the likelihood of human error that can occur when quickly entering great quantities of information.</p>
<p>Legacy systems often rely on papers, human interactions, and purpose-built tools. Paper documents can be forged, human interactions can be gamed, and purpose-built tools can be constrained, meaning they are often not interoperable or useful in other contexts. Proven Works makes forgery nearly impossible, replaces some human interactions and augments others, and opens up employment data for use in a variety of other contexts and systems without the need for direct integrations.</p>
<p>This technology is still new, and one of the challenges many organizations have told us they face when using verifiable credentials is the “chicken or the egg” problem — who goes first in the ecosystem? Proven Works was designed to be deployed with all the parts of the early ecosystem coming into existence at the same time, solving the chicken or the egg problem by providing both.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a company is using Proven Works, other partners can be added to the system&nbsp; — insurance providers, payroll companies, 401ks, banks, etc. — to share the benefits of employment credentials, leading to a growing, vibrant network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven Works is built on interoperable open source standards and technologies, so as Proven Works ecosystems start to overlap with other Trusted Digital Ecosystems, they will be able to interact and enable even richer experiences and benefits.</p>
<p>But how does it work in practice?</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple — organizations that choose to use this tool would set up an Issuer and a process (whether human or API driven) to collect employment details and then issue them to employees as verifiable credentials. Employees would connect to the Issuer, receive the credentials, and store the credentials in an Aries-compatible agent application such as <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+. </a>Various departments and systems within the company or from its partners would request credentials from the employees, who would review the requests and consent (or decline) to share the data from their agent application.</p>
<p>Proven Works is a quickly expanding solution, and we have two improvements coming soon that I am confident telling you about. The first is secure messaging — employers and employees need to be able to communicate with each other with less risk of impersonation or phishing. The second is that employment credentials will be able to be used as part of a passwordless login system to offer much richer authentication and authorization workflows.</p>

<p>Biometrics have come a long way, but the humble fingerprint scan still provides excellent security for enterprise systems.</p>
<p>What is Fingerprint Authentication? It uses the unique characteristics of the human fingerprint as a form of strong authentication.</p>
 What Is Biometric Authentication? 
<p>Biometric authentication uses factors of inherence (physical features or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/what-is-behavioral-biometrics-authentication/">behavioral traits</a>) as a form of identity verification.</p>
<p>In the earliest days of computing, it was considered sufficient to use a single factor for authenticating users accessing local machine resources. Even with the rise of the early Internet, most <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication</a> was done through a simple username/password combo.</p>
<p>The combination of advanced security threats, mobile devices, and scanning devices has led the security world (both consumer and business to adopt widespread multi-factor authentication (MFA), specifically using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/biometric-authentication/biometric-password">Biometrics</a> inherently comes with a few distinct advantages, namely:</p>
 
 Uniqueness: Physical features, especially those tied to human fingerprints and facial features, are unique compared to a large population. As such, using these patterns as an ID is incredibly effective in asserting identity. 
 Liveness: Most biometrics shortcut a weakness of text-only authentication–namely, the user doesn’t have to be present. Instead, a fingerprint or facial scene requires (outside of sophisticated spoofing tactics) that the user be physically present at the point of authentication. 
 Simplicity: No one has to remember biometrics. Unlike passwords, which, in truth, many people shortcut by reusing phrases or using weak phrases, biometrics are readily available and require no engagement, just scan and authenticate. 
 
<p>Some of the most common forms of biometric authentication used today include:</p>
 
 Fingerprint Matching 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-iris-biometrics/">Iris Matching</a> 
 Facial Recognition 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-voice-authentication/">Voice Recognition</a> 
 
 How Does Fingerprint Authentication Work? 
<p>Fingerprint authentication, also called fingerprint biometrics, uses the unique characteristics of the human fingerprint.</p>
<p>The human fingerprint is composed of ridges and lines that represent a pattern wholly unique to the person when taken as a whole. Fingerprint uniqueness has been a cornerstone of law enforcement and media regarding law enforcement, and even in 2022, forensic science has not come across two identical fingerprints, even across identical twins.</p>
<p>Because of this, fingerprints are a great category of features for biometric identification. Furthermore, because modern fingerprint scanning technology has become both sophisticated and widely available, it’s relatively easy to use, find, and integrate into a security system.</p>
<p>Four basic steps are involved in the fingerprint authentication process:</p>
 Onboarding 
<p>For users to actually benefit from fingerprint authentication, they must onboard. At this stage, the user will typically interact with the device to provide fingerprint information through a fingerprint scanner. The scanner will often require the user to repeatedly scan their finger to get an accurate picture of the patterns contained therein.</p>
<p>On the backend, this fingerprint information will be encoded into a biometric schema or a data representation that can be used as a comparison point during authentication sessions in the future. This template is stored in a database for future reference.</p>
 Scanning 
<p>Users who want to access a system via a fingerprint authentication-enabled device place their finger upon the fingerprint scanner.</p>
<p>Currently, there are four types of scanners:</p>
 
 Optical: Optical scanners, as the name suggests, use visible light to take the image of a fingerprint placed on a glass plate. It then creates an inverted image that represents the fingerprint. These scanners are fairly accurate and inexpensive, but it’s critical that the surface remains clean or there could be reduced performance. 
 Capacitive: Capacitive scanners use small electrical charges to “charge” the fingerprint and use the capacitive potential of human skin against air gaps between ridges to map the print accurately. A little more sensitive than their optical counterparts, these are much more resistant to fraud due to the inability of hackers to use prosthetics. 
 Thermal: Thermal scanners use heat much the same way as capacitive scanners use electricity. With heat differentials between parts of a fingerprint, the scanner can construct a schema for the fingerprint with solid accuracy. However, it requires the device to generate heat, which may be a no-go for most devices. 
 Ultrasonic: Rather than use light, ultrasonic scanners use sound pulses as a sort of “sonar” reading the surface of the fingerprint. This is a slower authentication method than light-based solutions, but it is highly accurate. 
 
 Comparison and Authentication 
<p>Once the fingerprint is scanned, it is transformed into a biometric schema, encrypted, and sent to the authentication service, where it is compared against the user’s original schema. If there is a match, then authentication is given.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that some flexibility is provided in the comparison process. That is, the authentication mechanism will usually compare and approve fingerprint schemas within a failure rate. This is because changes to the scanner (scratches, dirt) or to the finger (dirt, sweat, cuts) could change the fingerprint enough to throw a false positive, even if the print is mostly visible.</p>
 What Are the Benefits and Drawbacks of Fingerprint Authentication? 
<p>Biometrics are the cornerstone for authentication and MFA, but there are many differences between the different types of biometrics. Accordingly, Fingerprints come with significant benefits and drawbacks, depending on what the enterprise needs.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Fingerprint Authentication? 
 
 Added Security: No biometric is 100% secure, and fingerprints are no different. They are, however, pretty darn secure, and for everyday use, fingerprint scans are more than sufficient for protecting devices. 
 
<p>If your organization needs more security or something more in line with certain compliance standards, then other forms of biometrics might be a better choice.</p>
 
 Simple to Deploy: Devices with fingerprint scanners aren’t hard to find or deploy. While fingerprint authentication is a bit more expensive in terms of initial investment, the overall cost compared to other biometrics is pretty low without sacrificing much. 
 Cost-Effective: Alongside the ease of deployment, the low cost is also a great bonus. Your business won’t break the bank by buying laptops or phones with fingerprint scanners. 
 
 What Are the Drawbacks of Fingerprint Authentication? 
 
 Fingerprint Damage: Fingerprints are unique but also subject to damage and degradation over time. Cuts, burns, or simple aging can transform a fingerprint into an unrecognizable pattern over time. Unfortunately, this can present a problem because once the print is damaged, there’s no reusing it. Most of us come with multiple prints to use. 
 Stolen Patterns and Schemas: Fingerprint scans are typically theft-resistant, but only partially. Hackers can steal schemas from security databases to use as a way to fool authentication systems. 
 
<p>Additionally, while incredibly difficult, it’s also possible for creative hackers to craft synthetic fingerprints to use at the point of scanning. The use of thermal or capacitive scanners mitigates this latter approach.</p>

 Eight Models of Blockchain Value <blockquote>The sector is getting written off as an irredeemable dumpster fire of radioactively toxic proportions</blockquote><p>With the latest round of crypto industry horror stories reverberating around the space and highly leveraged crypto exchanges getting written off as an irredeemable dumpster fire of radioactively toxic proportions, what is happening is a clear out of the grifters and incompetents that rush to any new, potentially lucrative, field to try and grab as much of the cash as they can before they get found out or the roof caves in. That does not mean the field is intrinsically cratered, the underlying structures remain sound, their value is in how they are used, so let’s look at “theories of value” for crypto — why is this industry worth working in, what’s going on and what went&nbsp;wrong.</p><p>There are a variety of theories about how crypto might make you money, some pathological, some reputable</p><p>Let’s start with the primal&nbsp;root:</p><p>There are a variety of theories about the different ways crypto might make you money. Some of those ways are pathological, some reputable.</p><p>1) Bitcoin is a hedge against US dollar inflation — Lots of people have believed that, but it’s not been borne out in practice.</p><p>2) Transactional efficiency — a wire transfer takes four days and goes wrong 5% of the time. It’s simply easier and cheaper to send tokens. This is truer than ever because of&nbsp;L2s.</p><p>3) Speculation — as traders try to out-guess each-other and “the market” (an aggregate of many others traders). Zero sum: every dollar made was lost by somebody else, unfortunately. It is essentially gambling, it needs both skill and luck to work. Tough, risky but&nbsp;legal.</p><blockquote>Bear Stearns and FTX had almost exactly the same business model, and&nbsp;failings</blockquote><p>4) Exchanges, market makers and so on — taking a little slice off the top of crypto-to-crypto transactions and crypto-fiat transactions. This is not new, it is what currency exchanges have been doing since the dawn of time. This is fine if that is actually what the exchange is doing, FTX was not. Basically FTX was not *really* a crypto company. FTX was a tradfi company that was buying and selling crypto assets. <a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/too-clever-by-half/">Bear Stearns </a>and FTX had almost exactly the same business model, and failings, at the end of the day, and it took both of them down, flamboyantly torching vast amounts of value on the&nbsp;way.</p><p>5) Collectible digital property (NFTs etc.) — in which inherently valuable new things are created on-chain and sold. Also covers play to earn and similar things. The risk here is that the things don’t necessarily remain inherently valuable.</p><p>6) Lending and particularly flash loan - good old fashioned usury, but for flash loans, a 100% guaranteed return because if the smart contract does not return the capital, the smart contract aborts the transaction and the loan is never made in the first place. Uses old school banking skills, minus all that cumbersome regulation. What could possibly go&nbsp;wrong?</p><p>7) Ponzi schemes — Why take a slice when you could just eat the entire cake? Something that looks like an investment, but is just using the capital from people who think they are investing to steal other people’s capital. Flat out crime — hugely profitable until they get found out, then very&nbsp;bad.</p><p>8) Novel security services - like ENS and using Metamask to log into things. Self Sovereign Digital Identity fits here. And, of course, crypto “itself” — that’s bitcoin mining, Ethereum staking, hardware wallet manufacture, and all the&nbsp;rest.</p><p>I want you to note how much of the action in crypto is things *pretending* to be one kind of value, when in fact they are Ponzi schemes and zero-sum trade&nbsp;games.</p><blockquote>The distinction between Ponzi schemes and regular trading is important</blockquote><p>Take most NFT projects: the NFT has value for three&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>A) It’s art and you’re buying some kind of a right/licence (transferrable proof of patronage +&nbsp;legals)</p><p>B) It’s an object for a Ponzi scheme to attach&nbsp;to.</p><p>C) And there’s also “legitimate” speculation on future&nbsp;value.</p><p>The distinction between Ponzi schemes and regular trading is important. If people are “wash trading” (buying their own NFTs to make it look like they’re selling better than they are) then usually the NFT collection has Ponzi-like characteristics. Wash trading is simply&nbsp;fraud.</p><blockquote>This is where the Perez Cycle comes&nbsp;in</blockquote><p>So, where does that leave us now? Well, this is where the <a href="https://medium.com/invao/blockchain-quo-vadis-applying-the-perez-surge-cycle-c15ba685c831">Perez Cycle</a> comes in. To sum it up, essentially what happens with a new technology is there’s an installation phase where new technologies create new ways of doing business and solving problems, everyone gets very excited, stuff gets hyped, bubbles happen, and grifters and scammers jump on board and exploit the tech to make quick bucks in dubious ways. Everything becomes overinflated and unstable, the bubble eventually bursts, a lot of people lose a lot of money and a few go to jail and everyone else says ‘phew, thank god that’s over, we’ll never go near that stuff again’. Once the dust clears and the madness dies down, rational actors look at what’s left standing and take over the tech to do something unflashy and useful that actually makes money in a sensible way over the long term. We saw it with the dotcom boom, and no doubt we’ll see it again with whatever creates web&nbsp;4.0.</p><blockquote>humungous amounts of value have been torched…the authorities are rounding up the&nbsp;felons</blockquote><p>In the meantime, we’re at the point where the hype has happened, the bubble has burst, truly humungous amounts of value have been torched, all kinds of people are trying to put as much space between themselves and the blockchain as they can, and the authorities are rounding up the&nbsp;felons.</p><blockquote>The ‘Great Disinfection’ is in&nbsp;progress</blockquote><p>The ‘Great Disinfection’ is in progress — this is going to flush out the dubious use cases and leave the legitimate ones standing ready for the grownups to move in (would you really trust your money to someone who dresses like a toddler, even when <a href="https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/1591496451884040193?lang=en">interviewing presidents</a>, and apparently can’t tie his<a href="https://twitter.com/sbf_ftx/status/1468688160460877836?lang=en"> shoelaces</a>?).</p><blockquote>The actual architecture of the blockchain is&nbsp;sound</blockquote><p>The actual architecture of the blockchain is sound, it’s just a really good ledger, just as NFTs are just very useful receipts. Even the blockchain’s harshest critics admit that the technology works perfectly.</p> Frances 'Cassandra' Coppola on Twitter: "You may have taken it to mean that, but Casey Newton was clear that he was talking about the collapse of crypto companies, about which crypto sceptics repeatedly warned. No-one, absolutely no-one, ever said the technology didn't work. I'm tired of your straw manning. / Twitter" <p>You may have taken it to mean that, but Casey Newton was clear that he was talking about the collapse of crypto companies, about which crypto sceptics repeatedly warned. No-one, absolutely no-one, ever said the technology didn't work. I'm tired of your straw manning.</p><p>The problem has been that to date it’s been loaded with shonky assets with a propensity to blow up in investors’ faces. Moving forward it has potential to facilitate trade in stable, reputable, long established real world assets like <a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf">gold</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a>, and <a href="http://mattereum.com">Mattereum</a> will be there to help make that&nbsp;happen.</p><p>My presentation to the London Blockchain Summit that gives some more context to all&nbsp;this:</p><p>…and the transcript</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">At the Turning Point — How Crypto Interacts with Real World Assets</a></p><p>To contact Mattereum<a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/"> https://mattereum.com/contact-us/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/crypto-and-theories-of-value-b505d560c7f2">CRYPTO AND THEORIES OF VALUE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The tension between interoperability and innovation holds IDtech products hostage. Here’s my take on what to do about&nbsp;it.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/es/@sgoodgame?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Sam Goodgame</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/boulders?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>New technologies need to provide unique value to be adopted. Web5, which I use as shorthand for verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores, offers “an extra decentralized web platform.” Unfortunately, simply being more decentralized or “self-sovereign” doesn’t generally lead to unique value being realized by end-users. The real end-goal of web5 is a universally-accepted and useful digital ID–a goal only achievable through interoperability. Thus, the unique value of web5 is interoperability, or more precisely, the extreme convenience and high trust interoperability delivers to identity products.</p><p>But herein lies a “<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/catch-22">Catch-22</a>”: developers won’t adopt new technology unless it adds unique value, but interoperability requires widespread adoption to pay dividends. It’s the classic network effect, or chicken-and-egg, problem. I call it the Catch-22 of Adoption.</p><p>But there is another, highly-related, highly-pernicious, and less-obvious Catch-22 keeping web5 from breaking out and realizing its true potential. I call it the Catch-22 of Interoperability.</p> The Catch-22 of Interoperability <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is simple: A direct conflict exists between interoperability and innovation–but both are mandatory for web5 to become a breakaway success and achieve its vision of a self-sovereign future.</p><p>Let’s first clarify: by innovation, I’m referring to a particular technology’s search for “product/market fit” which involves iterating until it solves a unique problem well. By interoperability, I’m referring to the near-universal acceptance of websites, regardless of browser; email, regardless of which client sent it; bluetooth, regardless of headphone manufacturer; or Visa cards, regardless of merchant. (Juxtapose these examples with the silos and inconveniences resulting from the lack of messaging interoperability–a fate nobody wants identity to conclude with–where iMessage can’t communicate with What’sApp or Signal or Line or Telegram or dozens of&nbsp;others.)</p><p>To understand why a conflict exists between interoperability and innovation, it’s helpful to understand that the core tenants of web5 (verifiable credentials, decentralized identifiers, and personal data stores) each have numerous incompatible variants competing* for adoption:</p>  verifiable credentials: AnonCreds, W3C VCs, SD-JWT, ACDC, ISO 18013–5,&nbsp;etc.  decentralized identifiers: 100+ DID methods, KERI/ADIs, DNS/x.509-based, etc.  personal data stores: ID wallets, DWNs, Solid Pods, crypto wallet + decentralized storage,&nbsp;etc.  interaction protocols: DIDComm, CHAPI, OIDC4VC, WACI-PeX, CESR, DWN routing,&nbsp;etc.  <p>Theoretically, if the teams working on these divergent approaches agreed to converge on a single standard, we’d quickly reach a critical mass sufficient to realize the value of interoperability. I’ve seen people campaign for such an outcome — but prematurely standardizing is a dangerous prospect for a new technology. Standards move at a snail’s pace, and new technologies need to quickly evolve until a “product/market fit” is reached. Standardizing before adoption puts the cart before the&nbsp;horse.</p><p>On the other hand, unfettered innovation leads to divergence. The free market will adopt technologies based on their merits — and better technical innovations will lead to better products that lead to more adoption. For example, despite several existing options for using selective disclosure in verifiable credentials, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-01.html">SD-JWT</a> has been introduced as an alternative innovating on simplicity and ability to integrate with existing JWT-based authentication systems. But despite divergence being a healthy part of new technologies finding “product/market fit,” its downsides are obvious: confusion in the market, duplication of efforts, and delaying the benefits of interoperability.</p><p>Thus full interoperability leads to minimal innovation, and full innovation leads to no interoperability. So what is the solution? The solution is to strike a balance between these two&nbsp;demands.</p>Adoption will come from the intersection of these competing forces. The key is to strike a&nbsp;balance. Four Approaches to Balance Interoperability and Innovation <p>We’ve established that innovation and interoperability are both necessary, but in opposition to one another. So where does that leave us? As a relative newbie in the identity space (going on 5 years) I’ve seen 4 approaches taken to balance the trade-offs of innovation and interoperability. I don’t intend to make a value judgment on any of these–each approach has its pros and&nbsp;cons.</p>  The innovate-by-committee: In this model, interoperability is consistently maintained by suggesting new features &amp; improvements in a committee of other companies, likely in a working group, community group, or through an RFC process. While great for interoperability, it’s tragic for innovation. It’s infeasible to expect even the most brilliant people to be able to effectively build the “right” thing sitting in a boardroom. Does Feature A need to support Capability X? A Zoom-call debate with like-minded individuals is no match for customer evidence. The only way to truly innovate is to iterate, with real-world usage, which requires&nbsp;speed.  The fit-and-start: In this model, interoperability is achieved periodically while minimizing the need to slow innovation. Implementers race forward with innovation and contribute the things that are working well back into the community. Usually vendors need to support older (interoperable) versions and newer (more innovative) versions of their products, which is a costly trade-off of this model. Success with this model is challenging in practice — the interoperability devil is in the details which can confuse the&nbsp;market.  The interop-as-feature: This is where interoperability is viewed as a means to unlocking product value as opposed to an end in and of itself. In this model products are usually not interoperable until a specific reason arises, like a partnership or customer demand. Other times, products are built using interoperable standards because those standards unlock features out of the box — but not because of interoperability itself.  The “de-facto” maximalism: This approach cares only about innovation, believing that the best mousetrap will become the de-facto standard that the marketplace adopts regardless of most other factors. While great for innovation, there is a graveyard of failed identity companies who’ve attempted this strategy. Builders&nbsp;beware.   Web5 has a Bright and Interoperable Future <p>The Catch-22 of Interoperability is surely an obstacle to widespread adoption of web5 — but I believe it’s surmountable. I hope that by getting more specific and nuanced in our discussion of interoperability, we’ll better navigate the trade-offs and requirements we all&nbsp;face.</p><p>I have a short list of suggestions that I believe will help the community press forward on this complex&nbsp;topic.</p>  Above all, focus on building products people love. I can’t stress enough that the most elegant, interoperable technology on earth will be meaningless without end-user adoption. People adopt products, not technologies. Luckily, we’re seeing IDtech companies launch faster than ever before thanks to&nbsp;web5.  Brand loyalty for standards is silly. Different requirements matter for different use cases. Rational implementers should evaluate technical decisions based on business requirements. But instead, I consistently see people so intoxicated with JSON-LD or Aries or KERI or &lt;insert flavor of the month&gt; that their rhetoric borders on religious fervor. Force-fitting round pegs into square holes is no way to accomplish goal #1 of building great products.  Interop-shaming is short-sighted. I hope I’ve made it clear in this post that interoperability and innovation both matter. Teams delaying interoperability are simply making a different set of trade-offs compared to teams obsessively maintaining interoperability. The market will decide which approach is rewarded. Despite my cautioning builders to beware “de-facto” maximalism, we need a marketplace full of various approaches to maximize our odds of adoption.  Interoperability for demo’s sake can be a good use of time. Despite pockets of compatibility in some ecosystems, little-to-no real-world interoperability has been realized (let me know if I’ve missed something!). That said, demos of interoperability have driven more developers, interest, and investment into the space. Sometimes the best way to visualize the future is to see it in the form of working code — as long as it doesn’t detract too much from point #1 😊.

   On November 7, 2022, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released a new Zero Trust strategy, clarifying the goals and timeline for modernizing the Department's defense strategy.

  <p>On November 7, 2022, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) released a new <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DoD_Zero_Trust_Strategy_v1.0_Final_508-date-cover_20221116.pdf">Zero Trust strategy</a>, clarifying the goals and timeline for modernizing the Department's defense strategy.</p>

<p>In the forward, the report says, "We all must play a role in combating our adversaries by acting quickly and correctly to address security threats wherever and whenever they arise." The report notes that the changes necessary to transform DoD IT resources from a "castle-and-moat" model to a Zero Trust model will require a coordinated, full-department effort. The forward continues, "If we do not do this together, our teammates' vulnerabilities will remain exposed and open to attack, which makes all of us less strong." This statement affirms that global information warfare is an increasing challenge for our service members, compromising mission safety and outcomes.</p>
	
	<blockquote><p>"We all must play a role in combating our adversaries by acting quickly and correctly to address security threats wherever and whenever they arise."</p>
		<p>– DoD Zero Trust Strategy, October 21, 2022</p></blockquote>

<p>The strategy promotes a fully implemented Zero Trust framework that "...will reduce the attack surface, reduce risk, offer opportunities to manage the full range of risks…and enable more effective data-sharing in partnership environments." This new strategy affects all users, Non-classified Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet) networks, and IT infrastructure in the DoD. The DoD has identified an aggressive schedule to get a fully functional framework implemented by the end of FY 2027. This is a monumental task considering the number of users and IT infrastructure that will be impacted, including the legacy systems that will likely need modernization.</p>

<p>Hastened by the need to support a remote workforce and an increase in international partnerships, the DoD is reevaluating its approach to securing intellectual property.</p>
	
<p>There is a department-wide initiative to migrate to cloud-supported software solutions (SaaS) that can meet DoD requirements. At the same time, the Department must support warfighters in low-bandwidth, Denied, Disrupted, Interrupted, and Limited (DDIL) mission scenarios, requiring some of the Zero Trust solutions to run on local infrastructure, which eliminates the effectiveness of SaaS solutions.</p>

<p>DoD Pillars of Zero Trust (source: <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DoD_Zero_Trust_Strategy_v1.0_Final_508-date-cover_20221116.pdf">DoD Zero Trust Strategy report</a>)</p>

<p>Software deployment flexibility is essential for the DoD to meet the unique requirements identified for the DoD Zero Trust Strategy. ForgeRock offers a flexible deployment model by offering feature parity between its deployment offerings: the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> SaaS solution, a fully <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.1/index.html">DevOps- enabled deployment</a>, and a <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">traditional software deployment</a>. ForgeRock is currently working in many different mission areas within DoD, from running in the cloud to being deployed in DDIL environments. ForgeRock's deployment models allow our solutions to be deployed in environments from Impact Level (IL) 2 to IL 6.</p>

<p>ForgeRock is a fully featured identity and access management platform that will provide the DoD with deployment choices that meet the full array of use cases in the User pillar of the DoD Zero Trust Strategy. Also included in the platform is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">user journey orchestration</a> that incorporates knowledge of the users' Devices – looking for signs that the device is registered to the user and checking if a device is jailbroken/rooted. The platform is infused with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>-powered Visibility and Analytics to monitor login requests in real-time, block malicious attempts, and require step-up authentication when anomalous behaviors are detected.</p>

<p>ForgeRock follows emerging and evolving identity standards closely to quickly implement the software changes required to meet their specifications. Our focus is on allowing our customers to have the latest Zero Trust identity features, including those that cover authorization, authentication, lifecycle management, and governance.</p>

<p>For further information on how ForgeRock can help the DoD meet the new Zero Trust strategy, please follow this <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/industries/government/united-states">link</a>.</p>

 Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap — 12th December to 18th&nbsp;December <p>Welcome to another exciting edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap. This week’s crypto regulatory updates mostly revolve around different agencies, authorities, and commissions, such as the US FSOC, BaFin (Germany), G20 committee, and Basel committee on banking, insisting on stricter crypto regulations and the response of the ecosystem.</p><p>After a dramatic year, we decided to lighten up the spirits and give back to the community through an edutaining <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-networks-holiday-raffle">Shyft holiday raffle fest</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/shyft-special-competition-for-creatives">a special competition for creatives</a>. For the most knowledgeable and curious, lucky and talented, there are amazing gifts awaiting.</p><p>Now, without further ado, let’s dive straight into this week’s&nbsp;recap.</p> FSOC Recommends Crypto Regulatory Gaps (<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/09/Regulating-crypto-Narain-Moretti">Image Source</a>)<p>The United States Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), in its <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1171">2022 annual report</a>, suggested U.S. legislators address the crypto regulatory gaps.</p><blockquote>According to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, crypto-asset activities “could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system” and stressed the “importance of appropriate regulation,” including the “enforcement of existing&nbsp;laws.”</blockquote><p>FSOC scans new risks and weaknesses of American financial stability while offering mitigation suggestions. And this year, the council has identified digital assets as one of the five market risk and credit risk vulnerabilities.</p><p>First identified as a priority area in February 2022, the council further red-flagged the crypto lending and borrowing as a significant risk in October this&nbsp;year.</p> G20 to Build a Global Policy Consensus on Crypto Asset Regulations <p>In a meeting — held for the first time under India’s presidency from December 13th to 15th in Bengaluru, Karnataka — G20 finance and central bank deputies sat together to build a policy consensus on crypto assets for improved global regulation.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/mtc_terminal/status/1603350526938185728?s=20&amp;t=VgCb0tQrxMPmeT41_MWr3g">Image Source</a>)<blockquote>“One of the priorities which have been put on the table is to help countries build a consensus for a policy approach to crypto assets,” clarifies Ajay Seth, India’s economic affairs secretary.</blockquote><p>The key agendas to be taken up for the G20 would also include the global usage of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs).</p> Germany Calls for Global Crypto Regulations (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/99f034f1-0464-4e5f-9b7e-92ff90767b5c">Image Source</a>)<p>BaFin, Germany’s financial market regulator, has joined the voices demanding global crypto regulation. Mark Branson, BaFin President, negated the efficacy of self-regulation and said it was wrong to have a hands-off approach towards the industry and think of it as a “playground for grownups.”</p><p>Besides advocating a ‘serious cryptocurrency regulation’ and ‘worldwide solution’ to the patchy regulatory framework prevailing across the industry, Branson also expressed the need for licenses for German banks to deal with cryptocurrency.</p> Basel Committee-Endorsed Global Crypto Banking&nbsp;Rules <p>BCBS has recommended that a bank’s exposure to certain crypto assets must not exceed 2% and said it is even better if it is lower than 1%. These crypto assets include NFTs, stablecoins, and unbacked crypto assets that do not satisfy classification conditions.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/athcryptonet/status/1603812692162232333?s=20&amp;t=c40-Ccx60S13StcXanoyjA">Image Source</a>)<p>The regulation goes even&nbsp;further.</p><blockquote>Assets falling under the same bracket are also “subject to capital requirements based on the risk weights of underlying exposures.” They have to undergo a redemption risk and basis risk&nbsp;test.</blockquote><p>The current test ensures that the level of reserve assets is always maintained at a level that keeps crypto assets redeemable at all times, while the new test will aim at ensuring that the crypto asset holder can sell the asset in a market for an amount that closely tracks the peg&nbsp;value.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer! (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1575878765363793922?s=20&amp;t=nvFMIf3wUOMwUrY0ZrvA5Q">Image Source</a>)<p>After Shyft DAO approved the Veriscope VASP grant proposal, an aggregate of 10,000 SHFT has been granted for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that integrate into the Veriscope mainnet by September 30, 2022. The fund will enable VASPs to pay the Shyft Network gas fees while using Veriscope. This offer will remain valid until December 31, 2022, or till the VASP exhausts its SHFT&nbsp;grant.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-industry-dubs-sen-warren-and-marshalls-crypto-bill-regressive">Crypto Industry Dubs Sen.

<p></p> Building Trust With Verifiable, Fraud-Proof Data <p>From the beginning, Dock’s mission has been to enhance trust by empowering organizations and individuals with verifiable, fraud-proof data.</p><p>This past year, people and organizations around the world have experienced a variety of growing problems:</p>  Our lives are more and more reliant on digital data. But data is increasingly easier to manipulate, change, and corrupt in many industries including supply chain, healthcare, and education, which leads to a loss of trust.  Individuals have less privacy and security as user data is often controlled, misused, and shared by organizations without their knowledge.  Certificate fraud is also a growing global problem and fake diplomas alone are a billion-dollar industry.  <p>These global issues demonstrate the urgent and growing need for Verifiable Credential and decentralized identity technology solutions to bring back trust, transparency, privacy, and security of data across industries.</p><p>To address these issues, during this past year, we’ve developed more partnerships with organizations using our technology, grew our community, added more functionality to our products, and made significant upgrades to the network. Regardless of what challenges there are in the industry and markets, Dock is continuously strengthening our product solutions that can be applied to a variety of sectors and use cases over the long term.</p> Key 2022 Industry Trends <p>Before diving into Dock’s achievements and development highlights, we’ll go over some key industry trends and problems that our tech can solve.

Dock Certs can be used in two ways: one is our no-code, user-friendly platform and the second is the <a href="https://docs.api.dock.io/#the-dock-certs-api">API for developers</a>.  <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app">Dock Wallet</a>: Store Verifiable Credentials and control DIDs.   New Partnerships <p>Dock is a B2B company and we’re collaborating with organizations that are using Dock’s solutions to turn their data into Verifiable Credentials to provide privacy, security, and a lifelong record of achievements for their stakeholders. Some of the key partnerships Dock has developed this year include: </p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/use-case-burst-iq">BurstIQ Makes Health Data Verifiable, Secure, and Portable With Dock</a></p><p>BurstIQ is a company that provides data solutions powered by blockchain for the healthcare industry. They needed the ability to export data from their system and ensure its security, portability, and integrity so that it can’t be manipulated. That’s why they implemented Dock’s technology in order to turn any health data into a Verifiable Credential. This enables their customers (organizations and individuals) to respect users’ data privacy and data ownership rights. &nbsp;</p><p>“We’ve looked at a lot of the systems that allow you to issue DIDs and VCs and generally what we’ve found is that Dock is far easier to use than many of the existing tools out there. It can deploy very quickly and it will be very easy for our developers to use the tool,” said Amber Hartley, Chief Strategy Officer, BurstIQ.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/sevenmile-press-release/">SEVENmile Issues Fraud-Proof Verifiable Certificates to Students</a></p><p>SEVENmile’s entrepreneurial training program in Australia connects high school students with business owners to teach them problem-solving techniques. Paper certificates have less real-world value because they are easy to fake and hard to verify for authenticity. SEVENmile is using Dock Certs to efficiently issue digital fraud-proof graduation certificates which allows students to prove their skills throughout their lives and create immediate trust with employers. </p><p>“At SEVENmile Ltd., we believe that the move to ownership of our personal data is a vital platform that will help transform how the internet functions and how our data will be protected. We’re applying this philosophy by working with Dock Labs to secure the credentials of students we train,” said Greg Twemlow, SEVENmile’s CEO.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-web3-id-now-available-on-auth0-marketplace/">Web3 ID launched on the Auth0 Marketplace</a></p><p>Dock partnered with Auth0 to launch the Web3 ID integration on the Auth0 Marketplace, an exciting step forward for developers easily leverage Dock's decentralized identity technology to enable privacy and security for their users.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for Auth0 Marketplace. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. “After speaking with many customers, we have identified the types of integrations that matter to them, and we are so thrilled to have Dock’s Web3 ID as a vetted and valuable vendor in Auth0 Marketplace.”</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.dock.io/gravity-case-study">Gravity Eliminates Health &amp; Safety Certificate Fraud With Dock</a><br>Gravity Training is a leading training provider of commercial work-at-height solutions in South Africa. Fake Health &amp; Safety certificates are a growing problem for hiring companies in the country as many people photoshop certifications. That’s why Gravity is using Dock’s certification platform to issue fraud-proof, high-security digital certificates and prevent fraud.</p> Key Technology Milestones <p>We are fortunate to have some of the most <a href="https://www.dock.io/verifiable-credentials-company">experienced and specialized developers</a> in the decentralized digital identity space on our team. We’ve added more features to the Dock Wallet, Certs API, and the network to enable more functionality, security, and privacy for users. </p><p>In order to further strengthen privacy features with anonymous credentials, Dock uses BBS+ signatures. Unlike traditional cryptographic signatures where you must show all of your credential attributes, BBS+ signatures can be used to reveal and prove certain attributes in a credential.</p><p>Here are our key achievements for 2022:</p><p>1) <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs Launch</a> </p><p>Dock Certs was built as a result of repeated requests from organizations with little to no technical resources to have a user-friendly, no-code solution to issue Verifiable Credentials. Our bulk issuance feature allows users to efficiently issue multiple credentials to recipients (e.g. 300 graduates) at the same time by simply importing a spreadsheet. Later in the year, we also <a href="https://blog.dock.io/certificate-designer/">launched our Certificate Designer</a> feature in Dock Certs to allow users to customize the design of their credentials. </p><p>2) <a href="https://blog.dock.io/dock-wallet-did-management/">Verifiable Credentials and DID Management from the Dock Wallet</a></p><p>Our wallet upgrades enable people to:</p>  Create, export, edit, delete, import, copy, and share their DIDs  Securely store Verifiable Credentials and take them wherever they go   <p>The importance of using a non-custodial wallet</p><p>As a non-custodial wallet, the Dock Wallet enables users to have full ownership and control over their keys (acts like a password to access all of their accounts and information). It’s risky to have data on custodial platforms like centralized wallets. </p><p>Custodial basically means another party holds your private keys and that they have full control over your account. Because of this, they could make transactions on your behalf. As much as possible, it’s best not to use custodial wallets to protect your digital assets.</p><p>3) Anonymous Credential Support for the Dock Wallet</p><p>The Dock Wallet provides the option for anonymous credentials where people can prove something about themselves without revealing the actual information. For example, with anonymous credentials, someone could prove that they are at least 18 years old without revealing their date of birth to enter a gambling site. &nbsp;</p><p>4) <a href="https://www.dock.io/web3id">Web3 ID Launch </a></p><p>Web3 ID is a blockchain-based sign-in system that allows organizations to request private data from users directly from their ID wallet apps in a way that preserves their privacy. By using Web3 ID, organizations prevent user tracking and don’t have to store user data. </p><p>Web3 ID is also available on the Auth0 Marketplace, a platform that offers thousands of customers around the world integration for identity solutions.</p><p>“It has been really exciting to work with Dock on a newly-built partner integration for Auth0 Marketplace. This best-in-class solution adds an integral layer to our platform that provides our customers with greater choice and flexibility,” said Cassio Sampaio, SVP of product at Auth0, a product unit within Okta. </p><p>Web3 ID was also voted the #1 Web3 Product of the Week on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/products/web3-id">Product Hunt</a>, an important site where tech startups announce new product launches. This has given Dock more visibility as the site gets almost 5 million monthly visits. </p><p>5) White-Labeled Wallet</p><p>Organizations that want to offer their customers an ID Wallet with their own brand can use our white label solution. This way, they can provide a wallet with the same functionalities of the Dock Wallet without spending time, money, and other resources building it themselves. </p><p>6) <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/help-center/wallets-and-account-creation#ledger-nano-s-hardware-wallet">Ledger integration</a><br>People can securely store their Dock tokens on the Ledger Nano S hard wallet.</p> Growth and Adoption <p>A big focus for Dock this year was adoption. What’s the point of all the long days and late-night refinements if no one is using what we build? We want to see as many organizations and individuals in control of their data as possible. </p><p>While decentralized identity is still in its infancy, we’re certainly seeing that growth taking place with the number of partners we have, inquiries we receive, and people trialing our main product, Dock Certs. </p><p>Some numbers for context:</p>  From February to June, we saw over 1,100 sign ups and almost 200 organizations trialing either our no-code solution or using our API  From July to November, we saw over 1,500 sign ups and almost 500 trials. So not only are we seeing more volume, we’re seeing a 250% growth in trials during the past 5 months!  <p>We’re also seeing more of these trials convert into paying customers and we’ve published a few of these through our social channels with more to follow in the near future. </p>  Our community of Dockers continues to grow. Here are the new followers and members we gained this year.   Dock is building for the long term, not for short-term price spikes <p>While the collapse of Luna, Celsius, and FTX have had negative impacts on the entire cryptocurrency market, remember that Dock is committed to building solutions that solve current and future problems to provide more security, privacy, and efficiencies for organizations and individuals. Rather than engaging in activities for the sake of short-term price increases, we are much more focused on consistently engaging with users and getting market feedback to create long term value that will consequently increase the value of the Dock token.</p> What’s Coming Up in 2023? <p>Looking forward to 2023, Dock is well-positioned to get through these turbulent times, continuously upgrading our technology, and growing adoption. Next year we will largely focus on developing more partnerships to increase adoption and complete the decentralized identity lifecycle by enabling users to verify and present credentials with the Dock Wallet.</p> Growth and adoption  <p>Our main strategies to accomplish this goal include:</p>  More &nbsp;marketplace integrations (first up; Rapid API)  Hired a Sales Manager  Producing more valuable online content that educates people about the problems we solve and this has consistently resulted in many of them reaching out to us first  Outbound marketing and more outreach campaigns    Complete the basic workflow for the decentralized identity lifecycle <p>Right now with our products, users can manage DIDs and Verifiable Credentials. Very soon, people will be able to present their credentials to verifiers like companies, websites, or government departments that need to check their authenticity. In 2023, our technology will enable these functionalities for people and organizations.</p> Follow our progress in 2023  <p>Check our <a href="https://www.dock.io/roadmap">roadmap</a> and <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a> anytime to see our latest news and technology developments. Next year, we’ll be attending more events like the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop in April 2023</a> to connect with more people in the space. We will keep you posted and hope to meet some of you if you’re attending as well. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has followed and supported us this past year! We’re looking forward to providing solutions for more organizations and people in 2023.</p><p>If you have any questions or feedback about our project, reach out to us anytime.</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials company that provides Dock Certs, a user-friendly, no-code platform, and developer solutions that enable organizations to issue, manage and verify fraud-proof credentials efficiently, securely, and at a lower cost.

On the one hand, true believers have insisted that free markets are a cure for all economic diseases, while sceptics have insisted they are not. The two sides have been clashing over this question for decades. Yet strangely, neither side has ever stopped to ask another, related, question: “what are the costs of operating in a&nbsp;market?”</p><p>Markets may (or may not be) an almost magical guarantee of economic efficiency. But how efficient are markets themselves? Do they always operate as efficiently as they&nbsp;could?</p><p>The answer may surprise you. The way markets work in today’s world is extremely inefficient. They cost a huge amount to run. Indeed, sometimes their costs of operation are so cripplingly high that they don’t operate at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The reasons for these immense inefficiencies take us back to the core drivers of data’s value — <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">reliability and surprise</a>. Or in this case, the lack of reliable, surprising data, which means the system has to operate using guesswork instead.</p> Inefficiency in&nbsp;markets <p>Take a typical seller. To sell their product efficiently and effectively they have to know exactly what buyers want to buy, who wants to buy it, and how to reach and engage them. The other side of the coin is the typical buyer. To access what they want or need they need to know what’s available out there, where to get it from, and&nbsp;how.</p><p>But in modern markets, nobody has reliable information on these things, and the result is layer upon layer of extra cost. Guesswork creates risk and waste — investing money, time and effort doing things that don’t&nbsp;work.</p><p>Because sellers don’t know who may be interested in buying their products, and because buyers may not be aware of these products, sellers often invest huge sums in advertising. But traditional broadcast advertising (e.g. TV, print, etc) is hugely wasteful. Advertisers spend £$€billions advertising to people who are not interested in what they are selling and who will never&nbsp;buy.</p><p>In recent years, to reduce these eye-watering levels of waste, marketers have fallen in love with ‘targeting’ — trying to gather ever more information about who might want to buy their stuff. But, it turns out, efficient targeting is very complex and difficult, depending on a huge range of things such as personal preferences and current context, mood, mode and priorities. Stuff that the advertiser doesn’t&nbsp;know.</p><p>So what do advertisers seek to do? The obvious way, which is to gather ever more information. The result? Advertising platforms like Facebook and Google that have become huge ‘surveillance capitalism’ engines that seek to know everything there is to know about people, at massive cost, with toxic levels of privacy invasion&nbsp;… while still failing miserably.</p><p>Buyers, meanwhile, are faced with a constant tidal wave of messaging, most of which is irrelevant, and most of which people don’t trust anyway. Sellers waste huge amounts of time, money and effort generating a tidal wave of noise, and buyers waste equally huge amounts of time, money and effort trying to navigate their way through this&nbsp;noise.</p><p>By the way, this applies just as much to public services, charities and other non-profit service providers as it does to the private sector. For example: If a local council wants to offer free childcare to families wrestling with poverty, they have to identify who is in need and how best to reach them and engage them. Meanwhile, families wrestling with poverty may not know what help is available, where to get it or&nbsp;how.</p><p>The entire system, then, is awash with waste: waste created by people making the wrong guesses; investing additional time, money and effort in trying to find a way to improve their guesses; in making mistakes anyway and in failing to reach their objective. Or (very often) not even trying, given the spectacular levels of cost and waste involved.</p> This is not a trivial&nbsp;problem! <p>You might think that in the context of everything else that’s going on in the economy, these costs are still relatively small. Well, think&nbsp;again.</p><p>Advertising itself accounts for less than 2% of modern economies. But the McKinsey Institute has estimated that 50% of all economic activity now revolves around ‘interaction costs’, defined as “the searching, coordinating and monitoring that people and firms do when they exchange goods, services or ideas” (an estimate that excludes the costs of ‘non-interactive’ information processing). Similarly, economists John Wallis and Douglass North estimate that 45% of all US economic activity is now absorbed by ‘transaction costs’, defined similarly to McKinsey’s interaction costs.</p><p>In other words we’re talking about a situation where a half of all economic activities are NOT devoted to actually producing value. Instead, they are devoted to finding ways to realise the value that has been produced. This is an astonishingly high burden that’s without precedent.</p><p>A hundred years ago, 75% of all economic costs were devoted to ‘making’ with just 25% devoted to matching and connecting. Then, thanks to a productivity revolution in making (such as the breakthroughs made possible by mass production moving assembly lines) processes for ‘making’ became much more efficient while processes for matching and connecting lagged behind, becoming ever more complex. That’s why, today, the relative costs of ‘making’ versus ‘matching and connecting’ have shifted to today’s 50/50&nbsp;split.</p> A simple&nbsp;solution <p>Just imagine the economic benefits that would flow if we could take the balance between ‘making’ and ‘matching and connecting’ back to the 75/25 ratio that it once&nbsp;was!</p><p>All of this waste — and all the opportunities that are missed because of the excessive costs and barriers generated by how the system works — all boil down to one thing: poor data logistics. The inability to get the right information to and from the right people at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>Over the past decade, the big digital platforms, including Facebook and Google in marketing and advertising, Amazon, Uber, AirBnb and elsewhere, looked like they might be able to help. All of them grew rich and powerful thanks to their ability to reduce buyers’ and sellers’ matching and connecting costs. But over the years their promise has faded so that they are now just as much a part of the problem as the solution: a new source of cost and complexity and a new barrier to competition made worse by the multiple toxic unethical practices of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>The strange thing is that empowering individuals with their own data via their own personal stores can break the logjam. How? By helping to get the data logistics right.</p><p>Here is how it’s done — in a safe, ethical and efficient way. The personal data store operator enables individuals to publish anonymised profiles of themselves so that service providers can search these profiles for the characteristics of the people that best fit what they have to offer. They could even publish their needs and requirements this&nbsp;way.</p><p>Services can use the platform to reach out to these individuals, who at this stage remain anonymous, so their data and identity is protected. Individuals only respond if they want to, and if they don’t the service gathers zero data about them. The individual can create specific profiles for specific aspects of their life, further protecting their privacy and ensuring tight focus on their needs and interests.</p><p>Meanwhile, individuals don’t have to go searching. The right offers come to them, and they only respond when they want to, only sharing data and engaging when they want, under their&nbsp;control.</p><p>Both sides send and receive the right, reliable new information as and when it is needed — and all the layers of waste generated by a system founded on guesswork begin to fade away. It’s a truly seismic shift which Mydex CIC is helping to deliver right now with a pioneering new service in Scotland.</p><p>This service is helping the Scottish Government to reach out to people it wants to involve in the co-design of the services they use. As an application of the principle it is highly specific. But the capabilities Mydex has developed have almost universal applicability — tackling a root cause of immense waste across all go-to-market activities.</p> Conclusion <p>This blog series has now identified three, huge productivity and quality breakthroughs made possible by personal information empowerment: <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">inside the day-to-day operations of every activity</a> that uses personal data to provide services to individuals; <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-are-joined-up-services-so-difficult-to-deliver-e21d762b7d32">filling the gaps between these activities</a> to enable properly ‘joined up’ services, and now, transforming processes for ‘matching and connecting’.</p><p>These three breakthroughs — each one transforming a vast swathe of economic activities that affect every citizen and every citizen-serving service — lie at the heart of the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">surprising economics of personal data</a>. Yet in another sense, they are only the beginning. Indeed, there are ways in which what we have described so far only touches the surface. Next step: seeing the ‘dark matter’ that current ways of doing economics simply do not&nbsp;reach.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

  The back-to-back setbacks the crypto industry experienced in 2022 are playing in favor of vocal crypto critics, including prominent lawmakers, who have begun directing a barrage of criticism against everything the crypto ecosystem stands&nbsp;for.  Just a few days ago, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Marshall presented the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022, which, as per the senators, will bring cryptocurrencies on par with TradFi in terms of anti-money laundering &amp; Combating the Financing of Terrorism.  The crypto industry is up in arms against the proposed law, considering it regressive and not really helpful in preventing FTX-like&nbsp;events.  <p>The crypto industry has experienced unprecedented setbacks this year, from TerraUSD’s crash to the recent FTX collapse, impacting millions of common investors. Yet, crypto enthusiasts don’t budge from their strong conviction that digital assets will change the world for&nbsp;good.</p><p>However, such events did give ammo to crypto critics, who call cryptocurrencies a mere instrument for money laundering, terrorism financing, and all the evils in the world. One of the most vocal crypto critics, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, recently issued a statement while introducing the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>She rejected everything the crypto industry has achieved in over a decade-long existence in her blanket statement: “Rogue nations, oligarchs, drug lords, and human traffickers are using digital assets to launder billions in stolen funds, evade sanctions, and finance terrorism.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/SenWarren/status/1603033907968049154?s=20&amp;t=rSXHOodbbBcwhwhXmqgtQg">Image Source</a>)<p>As per Sen. Warren, the proposed bill’s goal is to bring the crypto industry on par with the traditional financial sector as far as compliance is concerned and prevent malicious actors from abusing digital assets for money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><blockquote>In her own words, “The crypto industry should follow common-sense rules like banks, brokers, and Western Union, and this legislation would ensure the same standards apply across similar financial transactions.”</blockquote><p>But what do numbers say? Is crypto really powering a majority of illicit trade globally? Well, the statistics portray a totally opposite picture. As per <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainanalysis’s Crypto Crime Trends</a> for 2022 report, a mere 0.15% of crypto transaction volume was for illicit&nbsp;use.</p> The Key&nbsp;Details <p>The bill considers unhosted wallets, miners, and validators as a money service business (MSB), which has horrified the crypto industry, as decentralized crypto parties and projects haven’t been considered MSB before. If the proposed bill becomes a law, even decentralized crypto service providers and participants will have to comply with KYC requirements and obtain the necessary information from their users while onboarding.</p><p>It further bars any US-based financial entities from using crypto mixing services to conceal the origin of the crypto funds or even use privacy coins. The bill goes as far as banning financial companies from ever using any tools or technologies with anonymity features.</p><p>The reporting requirements will also be bolstered, as not only will virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have to fulfill FinCEN’s existing rules and Bank Secrecy Act’s mandatory reporting for transactions over $10,000, but they will also have to fulfill additional reporting obligations if the new bill becomes a&nbsp;law.</p> Crypto Industry up in&nbsp;Arms <p>The crypto industry outright rejected Sen. Warren and Marshall’s proposed crypto bill, with many calling it regressive. Most crypto enthusiasts said that the bill does nothing to prevent any FTX-like events from occurring in the&nbsp;future.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/NeerajKA/status/1603054176891801601?s=20&amp;t=0AHhKyUzvwVX5768gshnEQ">Image Source</a>)<p>In fact, crypto users pointed out that the bill would do the exact opposite, as it would outlaw the self-custody of cryptocurrencies, leaving everyday crypto investors with no other option but to turn to centralized exchanges. Some industry leaders have even called the bill <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams/status/1603052999282147328?s=20&amp;t=N1poTUp8UF4S0CloljiV0g">an attack on digital freedom</a> and the very ideals of the United&nbsp;States.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/sashahodler/status/1603456425308852225?s=20&amp;t=rSXHOodbbBcwhwhXmqgtQg">Image Source</a>)<p>Crypto users <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoSatireMan/status/1603619334471008257?s=20&amp;t=CsDKomxP0enwXeErg0npwg">weren’t happy</a> either with Sen. Warren’s statement about making the SEC the main regulator of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The industry unanimously believes that the decision to use a centralized or decentralized solution should be left to the end user, and the government should have no say in it. And instead of putting extensive stress on the industry with over regulations, the government should act as an&nbsp;enabler.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Spherity will build Supply Chain Provenance in EBSI TRACE4EU project together with world-leading partners  Spherity will lead work package on Products &amp; Materials Traceability TRACE4EU consortium partner countries<p><a href="http://www.spherity.com">Spherity</a> won the second EU project with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home">EBSI</a>: Traceability Reference Architecture Conformant EBSI for the European Union (TRACE4EU), a consortium consisting of 30 partners from 15 EU countries. The project aims at building a common technical ground for the traceability of documents and physical goods using the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). Within this project, Spherity will lead the work package on Products &amp; Materials Traceability that deals with Seafood, Agrifood, Halloumi, and Battery Traceability. The Products &amp; Materials Traceability addresses the tracking requirements of physical products. This process includes the physical (pre-) products and materials that will be shipped and further processed in factories or manufacturing plants as well as the arrival of products to consumers. The general objective of this project is to create an “umbrella architecture” based on existing EBSI services. The architecture builds the basis for the implementation of traceability application scenarios.</p><p>TRACE4EU promotes recommendations for developing the EBSI ecosystem through engagement with pan-European stakeholders and has the potential to significantly influence traditional industries, assisting them in becoming more efficient, productive, competitive, and resilient. Upcoming traceability implementations will also improve transparency in the European area for citizens, who will be able to track commodities and documents more effectively and proactively.</p><p>Our objectives for work package 4&nbsp;are:</p>  Testing interoperability by applying the EBSI-umbrella architecture in various EU use&nbsp;cases  Demonstrating the technological interoperability of the developed umbrella architecture between the Product &amp; Materials Traceability pillar and the Document/Data Traceability pillar  Incentives for European public authorities, research institutions, universities, and private sector actors to use&nbsp;EBSI  Showcase best practices definition for the transfer of the EBSI-based umbrella architecture to other EU countries  Defining the cooperation methods with other use case-related and EBSI-related projects, may it be past or future&nbsp;projects  <p>“Spherity is very proud to lead the work package on ‘Products and Materials traceability‘. Our biggest aim is to build an ecosystem with a common technical basis and low barriers for participants to achieve a large industry adoption.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sguth/">Dr. Susanne Guth-Orlowski</a>, Chief Innovation &amp; Solutions Officer of Spherity.</p><p>“With the emergence of digital verifiable credentials, much more impactful compliance technology is possible and digital certificates are starting to be at the core of the policy life cycle from policy endorsement to ecosystem-wide enforcement at scale. Material traceability will be a critical success factor for sustainability-related regulation. This is why the TRACE4EU ecosystem can bring policy enforcement to the next level.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-carsten-st%C3%B6cker-1145871/">Dr. Carsten Stöcker</a>, CEO of Spherity.</p><p>To participate in the ecosystem, actors in the supply chain need to apply for an identity credential from a trusted identity provider such as the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en">Global Legal Entity Identity Foundation (GLEIF)</a>. Identity credentials are stored in the company wallet as verifiable credentials. Audits determine whether various supply chain actors are in compliance. As auditors, they issue certificates as proof of compliance with a regulation or as proof of origin for the end customer. Depending on the product category, these certifications must be preserved for a specific period of&nbsp;time.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p><a href="https://spherity.com/">Spherity</a> is a German decentralized digital identity software provider that brings secure identities to enterprises, machines, products, data, and even algorithms.

 About Podcast Episode 
<p><a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/case-studies/emdt">Energy and Mines Digital Trust (EMDT)</a> was established by the Government of British Columbia (B.C.) to incentivize the formation of a digital trust ecosystem that will result in accuracies and efficiencies when sharing sustainability data, with downstream impacts of contributing towards a low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>Reporting environmental impact data can be a complicated and laborious process. Data is difficult to exchange internationally, and consumers cannot always access, or trust, reported data.</p>
<p>A digital trust ecosystem builds confidence between organizations, businesses, and individuals when interacting online. When information is shared using digital credentials, everyone can trust that the information is current and hasn’t been tampered with, even without pre-existing business relationships. For natural resource companies, this means it is possible to easily share trustworthy data to prove their sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Nancy Norris and Kyle Robinson, we discuss,</p>
 
 What’s happening in climate change legislation globally? 
 What are the sustainability reporting requirements that the mining industry faces today? 
 Where do digital trust and digital identity fit into sustainability reporting? 
 How do you start a digital trust ecosystem? 
 How do you select initial use cases to focus on? 
 What is the role of the government in growing a digital trust ecosystem based on policy? 
 How did EMDT build their digital trust governance frameworks? 
 Why did EMDT publish their governance frameworks to open source repositories? 
 The best ways to educate both technical and non-technical stakeholders about digital credentials and digital trust. 
 Can digital trust technologies alter/influence change in regulatory reporting processes? 
 Can governments who participate in digital trust ecosystems find new ways of creating value/new business models/enhancing standard service offerings?

             December 2022   
	 
		 
			 Towards 2023: the tokenization race is on&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the year comes to an end, we want to take a moment to thank you for being part of our journey. From our family to yours, we wish you a happy and safe holiday season!</p>
<p>2022 has been a great year for our industry, with the tokenization movement on the rise. This month, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that “the next generation of markets and securities will be tokenization of securities.” Moreover, this sentiment is being echoed by a number of institutions such as State Street and J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>A further indication of this trend is the rapid growing demand from institutional investors for tokenized securities. BNY Mellon’s latest survey reveals that 97% of institutional investors agree that tokenization will revolutionize asset management, with 70% expressing their willingness to pay extra for increased liquidity and faster asset turnover. There is no doubt that financial institutions (FIs) have to place a high priority on tokenizing assets in 2023 in order to meet the demands of investors.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>For years, the main FIs already experimented tokenization on private blockchains. Public blockchains were not seen as mature enough. Now, the majority of innovative FIs are launching tokenization projects on public blockchains, proving that the future of finance will be built on permissionless infrastructures as it meets the needs of security, accessibility, and interoperability. Time to market, costs, and scalability are becoming key decision factors.</p>
<p>If the blockchain network used is not permissioned, the&nbsp;smart contracts must bring control and compliance&nbsp;at token-level through identities, allowing for corporate actions and access to liquidity. While smart contract standards are usually open-source and free (e.g. ERC3643), it would take years for FIs to build a complete tokenization platform managing business workflows, data and smart contracts interactions. This would leave competitors who act quicker to seize market shares as the market is surely transitioning toward this new infrastructure.</p>
<p>A viable option for success is to use&nbsp;no-code/low-code enterprise-grade tokenization platforms&nbsp;that are already proven and interoperable with the ecosystem. Thus allowing you to focus on the core business as well as adjust your business models to better position your corporation in the era of tokenization.</p>
<p>The race is on, and we wish you a successful tokenization year!</p>

 EWC has been selected by the European Commission to participate in EU Digital Identity Wallet Large-Scale Pilots <p>Dortmund, December&nbsp;2022.</p>EWC Country&nbsp;Coverage<p><a href="http://www.spherity.com">Spherity</a> — part of the <a href="https://eudiwalletconsortium.org/">EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC)</a> — is proud to announce that we have been selected by the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/index_en">European Commission</a> to participate in the large-scale pilots to ensure interoperability and adoption of the European Digital Identity Wallet. We will participate in the EUDI Wallet Consortium (EWC) running one of the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) for the Wallet ecosystem.</p><p>Our pilot is focused on the use of the EU Digital Identity Wallet in the context of travel — such as providing passenger information, buying goods and services, and trusted business-to-business interactions. The pilot will focus on situations that are central to people’s online lives and identify barriers and enablers to the adoption and scaling of the EUDI wallet. Furthermore, by including payments and organizational digital identity (“ODI”), the EWC ensures that the pilot evaluates scenarios that are relevant to citizens, businesses, and governments such as secure e-commerce and business-to-business transactions.</p><p>With over 60 participants, from both the private and public sectors, EWC represents almost every country in the EU and EFTA plus Ukraine and is able to provide pan-European services and further the digital inner single market and beyond. EWC is led by Swedish and Finnish government authorities and supported by relevant industry experts from the travel and payment industry as well as a large number of technology partners with experience in digital identity, trust services, wallet applications, and integration of these technologies into online services.</p><p>EWC will be piloting usage scenarios alongside complete travel journeys from booking flights, hotels, etc. to CheckIns, shopping, and payment all across Europe. The pilot scenarios require the collaboration of a multitude of European partners such as Wallet Providers, Qualified Attestation and other trust services, Personal Identification Data (PID)-/ Organisational Digital Identity (ODI)-Providers, relying on parties such as travel agencies, airlines, ferry operators, as well as international payment providers. The pilot scenarios will be evaluated and tested by a large number of end-users across Europe to optimize the user experience and identify barriers and enablers to the adoption and scaling of the EU Digital Identity&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>The EUDI Wallet is part of the proposed eIDAS2 regulation [1], which will provide all European citizens access to a trusted digital identity provided by their government and accepted in all EU Member States and EFTA. The EUDI Wallet will be able to contain additional information, such as a mobile driving license, educational certificates, and more, which can be shared with full control of the user. The EUDI Wallet will be used for both government services and private sector, payments as well as other trust services like electronic signing. This means that for a wallet to function, it will need to operate within an eco-system of supporting organizations, issuing attributes, and facilitating sharing of credentials. In the end, the EUDI Wallet will ensure trustworthy digital transactions such as identification, sharing attributes, authentication, as well as signing, preservation, and archiving.</p><p>The European Commission set up a program to develop the EUDI Wallet ecosystem through Large Scale Projects Pilots (LSPs). These LSPs will be run by international consortia representing a broad variety of organizations that will set up services in various roles, such as wallet issuers, attribute issuers, trust services, and service providers from many different European Member States. The experiences gained through the LSPs will be shared with the EU member states and the European Commission implementation to create a sustainable ecosystem meeting the needs of European citizens.</p><p>EWC will start running its pilot early next year.

  With 2022 proving to be a challenging year for crypto investors, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) calls for regulating the crypto industry to protect common investors.  The FSB will release a set of global standards on crypto regulations early next year to bring the industry on par with traditional finance.  Citing the FTX &amp; TerraUSD collapse, the FSB insists that such black swan events wouldn’t have occurred if proper rules and regulations were in&nbsp;place.  <p>The unprecedented crypto market turmoil has spurred the Financial Stability Board (FSB) into action. The global financial body will be taking steps towards making recommendations for regulating the crypto industry regulate market early in 2023 and enacting them swiftly to protect investors.</p><p>Dietrich Domanski, the outgoing secretary general of the FSB, has pointed out that it’s “urgent to address risks” within the crypto space, and that’s precisely what the agency’s upcoming recommendations will effectively do. It will hold crypto projects “to the same standards as&nbsp;banks.”</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMia991a/status/1603146468579319813?s=20&amp;t=lUuZTj1Fk0SB5-Kb3HfujA">Image Source</a>)<p>Citing “strong agreement” among the FSB members about the agency’s strategy, Domanski said that it “shows clearly what the way forward (for crypto) regulation looks&nbsp;like.”</p><p>His argument — if governments had such rules and standards beforehand, it would have prevented black swan events like the collapse of Terraform Labs and FTX exchange, as these entities would have failed the “criteria for sound governance.”</p> The Details <p>Beyond an implementation timetable, The FSB plans to add further details on the areas where policymakers could benefit from “more clarity” before making&nbsp;rules.</p><p>Some of these areas are “clarify governance arrangements and ensure transparency,” how to “safeguard” client funds to avoid a run on a cryptocurrency, and how to deal with firms where “there is a combination of different activities that are traditionally separate.”</p> The Future <p>Once the agency makes its recommendations, the expectation is that various national authorities include them in their local regulations.</p><p>Recognizing that the global adoption of rules is likely to be a slow and time-consuming process, Domanski insists that the work plan should “reflect the urgency.”</p><p>To drive forward crypto regulations, a group similar to the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision that created Basel bank capital rules for tighter risk management frameworks in the aftermath of the 2007–08 crash might be&nbsp;formed.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

   Among the many approaches to do that, Zero Trust is one where organizations apply the principle of “never trust – always verify”. Since Zero Trust is not a single product or solution, implementing processes that work accordingly can be a challenge to IT teams that want to keep their privileged accounts safe.

  <p>Among the many approaches to do that, Zero Trust is one where organizations apply the principle of “never trust – always verify”. Since Zero Trust is not a single product or solution, implementing processes that work accordingly can be a challenge to IT teams that want to keep their privileged accounts safe. Modern Privileged Access Management (PAM) platforms can help with these challenges.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole will look at why standing privileges are a risk to modern multi-cloud and hybrid architectures and how Zero Trust can help in reducing standing privileges. Moreover, he will explain why advanced PAM platforms can assist with establishing a Zero Trust posture and how to move PAM to decentralized operations.</p>
<p>Joe Burke, Chief Architect, PAM, in the Symantec Identity Security Group, proposes organizations should rethink how to implement Zero Trust security for secrets, privileges, and privileged accounts. He will elaborate on factors that IT decision-makers should look for in Zero Trust-enabling PAM solutions. Among these are the time to implement, low operational overhead, scalability and performance, ecosystem integrability, as well as coarse and fine-grained authorization enforcement.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/implementing-zero-trust-with-pam"></a>

<p>Today we released Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, which is the first in a series of release candidates leading up to Holochain’s first beta release this coming January. With this release candidate, the Holochain conductor and SDKs are now feature complete for building applications. All devs with Holochain apps can now update their code to the Beta Release Candidate. </p><p>In preparation for Holochain Beta, we’ve been subjecting the codebase to a security audit by Least Authority, the favored security firm of many decentralized projects. Because cryptography is core to all modern decentralized tech projects, Holochain’s cryptographic key store — the program that stores agent keys and other secrets — was audited first. The result: the code auditors identified only one issue, which we corrected. While an audit isn’t a guarantee, there were no further vulnerabilities identified. This means that there are currently no known vulnerabilities or attack vectors for leaking users’ cryptographic secrets. You can <a href="https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-holochain-lair-keystore/">read more about the keystore audit</a> on Least Authority’s website, and we’ll be sharing each future audit report as it is completed.</p><p>If you're a dev who's new to Holochain, as soon as our scaffolding tool is updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc.0, you will be able to install and build your first app. For devs eager to deliver apps to their end users, hold tight — the Holochain Launcher and DevHub updates are still being finalized and will be released in the next few days.</p><p>Holochain is a full software stack for building scalable and efficient Web3 apps of every kind. You could build a currency, NFT, or DeFi platform with Holochain, but this framework is meant for even more. It’s capable of handling the storage and performance demands of the many practical things we want to do with each other online, most of which we’re familiar with from Web2, but with some new capabilities that don’t necessitate large centralized institutions for basic viability.</p> Some of the Dapps possible with Holochain Beta-RC <p>Here are some of the applications we think Holochain will help bring to life in decentralized form:</p>  Social networks  Chat  Groupware  Knowledge sharing  Real-time collaboration  Project management  Governance and decision-making  Marketplaces  Accounting  Community currencies  Digital rights management of creative works  Supply chain accounting  Renewable energy markets  Adaptive IoT networks and other edge computing applications  <p>As of this Beta Release Candidate, we consider Holochain’s current feature set to be sufficient for building these kinds of apps and more. In the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">near future</a>, additional features will further augment the developer experience, along with components and tools that make it easier and faster to develop complex Holochain applications (hApps). <br><br>The feature set highlights include:</p>  A conductor runtime that hosts user application microservices in a WebAssembly virtual machine and interfaces with UIs  A distributed state and integrity engine consisting of individual source chains that add data to a graph database stored and validated by random peers in a DHT  The networking protocol for maintaining the DHT and sending messages  Countersigning for transactions between users, including additional witnesses for ‘lightweight consensus’  A user-friendly application launcher  A set of SDKs for building microservices that produce, read, and validate user data and send messages between nodes  A testing framework with a multi-machine test orchestrator  A development environment with the tools needed to create, test, and package hApps  Libraries for creating JavaScript and Rust clients  For additional details see our our <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/#basic-features-of-holochain-alpha">Beta-RC announcement</a>   The user experience of Web2 meets the freedom of Web3 <p>Holochain occupies a unique place in internet tech. It’s capable of providing fast, zero-cost data storage, processing, and messaging that auto-scales with the size of the user base, without using a centralized server. That means it can deliver on the promises of user empowerment that Web3 makes including.</p>  High throughput: Holochain surpasses the inherent performance limits of universal consensus.  Zero cost: Because there’s no legion of validators to pay, Holochain application data incurs no transaction fees.  Nearly infinite scalability: Each user brings their own compute power and storage, connecting to a subset of peers and holding a subset of data. Additionally, users only store data for the applications they use. These two properties let application infrastructure scale linearly with user adoption.  Low resource consumption: Each participant in an application’s network stores only the data they produce along with a small portion of the shared database, so there is no need for often expensive mining algorithms.  Privacy: Because there’s no central cloud database or global ledger, developers can empower their users to preserve their privacy. Applications can also be run entirely in-house, keeping private records safe and reducing regulatory compliance burdens.  Failure tolerance: In contrast to cloud databases and blockchains, users can read and write data even when they’re isolated in a LAN or completely unconnected to the internet.  Ease of use: There are no crypto wallets or network tokens to deal with — not even login credentials. Applications run on the user’s machine, accessed by nothing but a strong password. (In the future, applications can also be accessed via the web via <a href="https://holo.host/">Holo hosting</a>.)  <p>Blockchain strives to replicate Web2’s safety promises in a transparent way through universal consensus on a single data set. This has important uses, especially for tracking the ownership of scarce resources such as property (e.g., NFTs and land titles) and global naming (e.g., usernames and domains). Holochain is best used in situations where universal consensus isn’t strictly necessary and where ‘lightweight consensus’ is perfectly sufficient. This opens up a tremendous new realm of possibilities for decentralized applications, as listed above.</p> Our request to developers: Update your hApp!  Community Devs <p>As soon as all the tooling is updated to 0.1.0-beta-rc we want your help finding every bug, every crack, every rough spot, every performance bottleneck before we cut an official 0.1.0-beta release in January. So we’re asking for you to run all of your automated tests for your hApp against the release candidates. If you haven’t got automated tests set up yet, download the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> test framework and learn how to <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/develop/README.md">write a test scenario</a>. Then report bugs on the relevant repo — <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues">holochain</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/issues">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/issues">Rust</a> client libraries, or possibly even <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/issues">Tryorama</a> itself.</p><p>If you want extra help writing tests, or want to discuss the nature of a bug, we have a <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Discord server</a> you can join. Make sure you ask one of the moderators for the developer role. We'll see you there – happy testing!</p>

<p>Orbit Enterprise is a No Code Self Sovereign Identity platform that facilitates the storage, issuance, verification and revocation of verifiable credentials that are held and owned by end users in digital wallets.</p>
<p>We recently implemented the ability for holders to create credential requests to issuers they’re connected to. Credential issuance is not a one-way process where the issuer will always initiate it through a credential offer. There are many use cases in which the holder will have a need for a credential, and will need to contact a specific issuer to place a request.</p>
<p>We want to ensure that<a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/"> Orbit Enterprise</a> provides the flexibility needed for any type of credential exchange use case that you may have. That is why we have also built in the opportunity for negotiations to happen between both parties. Both issuing and receiving parties can go back and forth as many times as they wish until they are satisfied with the data attribute values within a credential.</p>
<p>All this is accomplished by fully operationalizing the Aries credential issuance protocol.</p>
<p>In this example, we demonstrate how Concordia University uses Orbit Enterprise to request for a ‘business licence’ credential from the City of Montréal, and how both parties are able to negotiate the credential attribute values during the process.</p>

<p>Part V:&nbsp;Deep Dive: Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 General Model – and what is a Holder? 
<p>To understand the world of verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations, you need to understand the ecosystem in which they are expected to be used.&nbsp; The VC Data Model v1.1 defines <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#ecosystem-overview">the roles different entities play in the data format</a>, as well as two processes: credential issuance and credential presentation.&nbsp; You are probably familiar with a concept of issuers or verifiers in the physical world, but the role of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holder</a> could be new to you.&nbsp; The specification defines a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-holders">holder</a> as an entity that can “possess a verifiable credential and generate verifiable presentations”.&nbsp; Another way to think about this is the place you store your credentials until you are ready to take them out and use them for a purpose.&nbsp; You might want to jump to the conclusion that a holder and a digital wallet are the same thing - a wallet can play the role of holder, but it has many other characteristics we will discuss some other time.&nbsp; Additionally, a wallet is usually a "user-present" technology, meaning that there is a human performing a ceremony as part of&nbsp;the credential interaction.&nbsp; While wallet interactions are the most talked-about use of VCs there are also machine-to-machine interactions that do not have a user experience at all.</p>
 Credential Issuance 
<p>I have <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/decentralized-identity-the-basics-of-decentralized-identity/ba-p/3071980">previously</a> called a verifiable credential (VC) a letter of introduction – a statement of relationship between an issuer and a subject. &nbsp;A verifiable credential uses cryptographic proofs to bind an issuer statement about a subject to the subject's identifier.&nbsp; The resulting document can contain claims relative to the subject and in some cases proofs of different kinds can be bundled together. &nbsp;Once issued, a verifiable credential can be held for potentially long periods of time and presented for multiple purposes and in multiple ways.</p>
<p>VCs in a wallet wrapped by a VP and sent to verifiers</p>
 Credential Presentation 
<p>In the verifiable credential world, presentation involves the generation of a VP – a verifiable presentation. A VP is generated by a holder - it is a document that wraps a verifiable credential with a new credential that is both fresh and which proves a relationship in the moment between the holder and the original VC subject. Most often the subject/holder relationship is direct - meaning that the entity presenting the credential can prove they are the same entity named in the credential.&nbsp; To check this relationship, the verifier checks that the VC subject is the same as the VP issuer, AND that the signature of the VP is valid.&nbsp;&nbsp;VCs in a wallet wrapped by a VP and sent to verifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of this passing around of VC's and VP's is like a big game of hot potato, and different credentials may have different patterns of presentation frequency and breadth of presentation across many verifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 A visual representation of overall VC/VP travel - VCs travel between Issuers and Holders, then VCs wrapped in VPs travel from holders to verifiers. 
 What is in a Verifiable Credential? 
<p>Now that you know how verifiable credentials move, we can look at what they contain.&nbsp; While the VC Data Model doesn't specify the protocols for travel of credential between actors in the flow, the actors must be part of the data model, because their associated public/private keypairs are used for cryptographic signing operations.&nbsp; At the highest and geekiest level, a verifiable credential bundles claims together into a container called a credential, and imposes standardized rules around how parties interacting with the VC can derive confidence in different characteristics of that bundle - for example the data model shows how to verify that the created credential was made by the entity claiming to be the credential issuer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Canonical Data Format vs. Encoded Representations 
<p>If you take all proofs and interpretation out of a verifiable credential, you have a base data format (the bundle I referenced earlier) that is simply referred to in the spec as “a credential”. &nbsp;This credential data format is referred to as the “canonical form” and the assumption is that you can always get from a given verifiable credential representation to a canonical credential data format and back again, using the encoding &amp; decoding rules laid out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#syntaxes">section 6 of the VC Data Model 1.1</a>. This is why the examples in the specification document have three tabs – one shows the canonical form, and the other two show each of the representations that can be used.&nbsp; While any number of representations could be additionally defined, there are two specified in the core data model:</p>
 
 JSON-encoded verifiable credentials (known as JWT-VCs) are encoded as signed JWTs (<a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=ee1c6e463f61bdcfJmltdHM9MTY2MTIxMzAwMSZpZ3VpZD01OTAzNTM5Mi1lODYyLTQ3ZWYtOTlhMy0yZmJkZDA3OGIwZmEmaW5zaWQ9NTE4MQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=ff840252-2276-11ed-a3e6-b5f0fabdaa0b&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmZjLWVkaXRvci5vcmcvcmZjL3JmYzc1MTk&amp;ntb=1">JSON Web Tokens</a>). 
 JSON-LD encoded verifiable credentials (known as LDP-VCs) can use different proof formats, but the most common are <a href="https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>. 
 
<p>Three boxes showing a credential (without verifiability) on top and two credentials (with viability) descending - a JSON encoded credential and a JSON-LD Encoded Credential</p>
<p>&nbsp;A simple way to think about the representations versus the canonical credentials is that the representations are what add the verifiability to a verifiable credential.&nbsp; A canonical credential is the bundle of claims that purports to be from an issuer and purports to be about a subject, and contains a set of additional claims, but anyone can tamper with the content of that bundle.&nbsp; When the canonical credential is encoded into a representation however, the representation dictates what kind of proof structure can be used to evaluate various properties of the credential, with tamper-proofness being a required check (this happens through checking a cryptographic signature).&nbsp; Other checks could potentially happen, for example validating a selective disclosure of information rather than an entire credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my examples in this blog article will be JSON-encoded, partly because this is what Microsoft has implemented (and therefore what I’m more experienced in) but also because many of you reading this blog are probably familiar with the JSON Web Tokens already, especially if you have worked with JWT-based implementations like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc">OpenID Connect IDtokens</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/federatedidentitycredentials-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0">Federated Identity Credentials</a>, or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-certificate-credentials">JWT bearer client authentication tokens</a>.&nbsp; If you aren’t familiar with what a JSON Web Token is, check out <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-jwt-works-in-depth-604c93ec20a4">this tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A JWT-VC is (surprise surprise) a mashup of a JSON Web Token and a canonical VC.&nbsp; The JWT supplies verifiability through a cryptographic signature bound to a subject identifier that is labeled as iss (aka the issuer).&nbsp; JWTs have a very familiar structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A visual representation of a JSON-encoded Verifiable Credential - 3 sections - the header contains the alg, typ and kid claims.  The payload contains iss, nbf, exp, jti, sub claims and an object called vc, which contains a @context, type, and the credential subject object. That object contains various claims.  The last of the 3 major sections is the signature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A JWT-VC has three parts, and the payload contains what I would call envelope information: the data needed to know who the credential is is bound to, who made the credential, when it was made and how it can be identified.&nbsp; Additionally, there is a JSON object called “vc”. Claims information is embedded inside the vc object. &nbsp;A JWT-VC uses an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#proofs-signatures">external proof</a>, meaning in this case that signature data is not embedded inline with the credential, the signature is detached from the credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a JSON-encoded verifiable credential that my university might issue to communicate my relationship and some additional information. Note that this is NOT a real-world Microsoft-issued example, it is a construct meant to highlight characteristics of the specification.&nbsp; If you see ways in which my example is not conformant, please point it out in the comments, for extra street cred!</p>
<p>A valid JSON object formatted as a JWT-VC with a header, payload and Signature section</p>
<p>The JWT-VC payload combines two different kinds of claims:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The three-letter claims (iss, nbf, exp, jti, sub in this example ) come from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a> (the JWT specification). These claims are required to validate the JWT and would be expected by any conformant JWT library or product.&nbsp; 
 The vc claim at the first level of the JWT comes from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VC Data Model 1.1</a>. The vc claim contains the following standardized claims:
 
 credentialSubject is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#credential-subject">container for authoritative attribute statements about a subject</a> (for example, the “achieved” object in my example, which is custom to the NorthAmericanUniversityGraduationRecord credential type and shows the type of accreditation earned). 
 @context contains <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#contexts">a set of URIs</a> that point to machine-readable definitions conforming to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#the-context">W3C JSON-LD</a> @context definition. In this version of the spec, even if you aren’t using JSON-LD, you need to respect this format and ensure that the values set in @context additionally contain a reference to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#base-context">VC Data Model v1.1 base context</a> so that JWT-VC credentials won’t break JSON-LD parsers. In our example, we included the base context but also a reference to “global-diplomas.org/accreditation”, which is where the credential schema for the credential in the type attribute would be found. 
 type is another property that should be constructed according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#specifying-the-type">JSON-LD conventions</a>. According to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#differences-between-contexts-types-and-credentialschemas">Section B.2 of the VC Data Model 1.1</a>, &nbsp;@type is used to “indicate which set of claims the verifiable credential contains”.&nbsp; Unlike the @context property, which is always a set of URIs, @type can be a single string or an unordered set. &nbsp;Our NorthAmericanUniversityGraduationRecord type helps verifiers to reliably ask for a credential with predictable contents. 
 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to know how a canonical credential corresponds to a JWT-VC, you need to spend quality time in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token">section 6.3.1 of the VC data model</a>. &nbsp;Here’s an example of how our JWT-VC would look decoded into the canonical data format:</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Diagram mapping our example JWT-VC object to a canonical credential</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in the JWT-VC, both the jti and the sub properties map to a property called “id” in the credential data model, one property applies to the parent credential object and the other applies to a credentialSubject object.</p>
 Distinctions, Differences and Gotchas 
<p>The JWT-VC representation imposes rules on how a VC can be constructed, and in some cases the choice of representation has important consequences.</p>
<p>Single Signature/Issuer</p>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515.html">Signed JWTs</a> are structured to have only one signature, and that single signature is affiliated to one issuer. This is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#proofs-signatures">external proof</a> (in VC terms) and it wraps the entire assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single Subject</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519">RFC 7519</a> defines a JWT sub claim as containing a single value, which maps to the id value of a credentialSubject object.&nbsp; There can only be one JWT sub claim, which means that a JWT-VC can’t have more than one credentialSubject object within it. Other encodings do not have this limitation, allowing multiple credentialSubject objects within a single verifiable credential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nbf, not iat</p>
<p>In the VC data model, issuance date is defined as “the date and time when a credential becomes valid”.&nbsp; In JWT-land, there is a difference between the moment the token was issued (iat), and the earliest moment that any verifier should consider the token as valid (nbf). The JWT authors defined two separate values to help account for clock skew, because if the system clocks aren't perfectly aligned, the token could arrive before it was even issued. The VC data model JSON encoding maps the issuanceDate claim in the abstract credential to the JWT “not before” claim rather than the JWT “issued at” claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Remember, the Verifiable Credential is just half of the Story! 
<p>A subject might have a signed JWT-VC stored with a holder, but to present it to a verifier, the holder needs to also construct a JWT-VP to show that the subject &amp; holder have a legitimate relationship to this particular verifiable credential, and that the subject wants this particular VC to be presented to this particular verifier, at this particular time. &nbsp;Our JWT-VC claims that a globally unique subject (did:ion:pamelarosiedee) has earned a degree, now we need to convince a verifier that did:ion:pamelarosiedee is right here, right now, present in the transaction and is actively passing their credential along. &nbsp;&nbsp;Cryptographically speaking, a JWT-VP represents a proof of possession: a verifiable way to know for sure that the entity presenting the diploma is the same entity that the diploma was issued to in the first place.</p>
<p>Going back to my last blog entry, a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations">verifiable presentation</a> is an endorsement.&nbsp; It wraps our letter of introduction (VC) and adds an extra proof to the mix – a time specific proof that the exact subject listed in the verifiable credential is present and part of a real-time identity transaction.&nbsp; If my employer does all their validation checks properly, they will know that an entity with a globally unique identifier of did:ion:pamelarosiedee (me) is claiming to be the subject of an authoritative educational achievement issued by did:web:ucalgary.ca (my university) in the moment in time when the employer needs that information. &nbsp;The validation checks enable cryptographic trust, meaning that the data hasn’t been tampered with, but don’t be fooled that cryptographic trust is the only trust decision that must be made!&nbsp; What if did:web:ucalgary.ca wasn’t a real university, for example? I could go register the domain “dingleuniversity.com” and create a degree for myself that could be generated and presented with perfect cryptographic trust! &nbsp;The verifier needs to be able not only to know the documents are not tampered with, but that the issuers of the documents are acceptable business partners in a given context.&nbsp; This is where trust federations, trust registries and trust frameworks come in, topics that are out of scope for this article but that we will return to.</p>
<p>Heading back to our example, what would a verifiable presentation look like if I wanted, on the 8th of August 2022, to present my University degree to my employer?</p>
<p>A JWT-VP issued by my decentralized identifier and audienced for microsoft’s decentralized identifier that contains the verifiable credential we’ve already studied</p>
 A Closer look at JWT-VP 
<p>The example above is a JSON-encoded verifiable presentation, or JWT-VP. The “how-to” of JSON-encoding into a JWT-VP is blended into <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-web-token">section 6</a> of the spec, so there is no easy section to refer to, but there are a few significant differences if you read closely:</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>No Subject</p>
<p>The subject property isn’t needed in a VP, because the issuer is asserting a thing about itself, in other words a JWT-VC is self-issued (you will hear this term again).</p>
<p>Wraps a Related Verifiable Credential</p>
<p>Remember, the JWT-VC must prove a relationship between the presented credential and the entity doing the presentation.&nbsp; By far the most common relationship to prove is the “this is my credential” relationship, also called “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#subject-is-the-holder">Subject is the Holder</a>”.&nbsp; If I stole my sister’s diploma and uploaded it to my employer to verify, the burden is on the verifier to detect the fraud and reject my claim to the uploaded credential.&nbsp; If the verifier does a bad job, the fraud could work. In verifiable credentials we use cryptographic proofs to be sure the presenter of the credential is the subject of the credential.&nbsp; If the issuer that signs the JWT-VP is the same entity as the subject listed in the encapsulated JWT-VC, you have a strong proof of legitimate possession.&nbsp; In our JWT-VP world this check is straightforward because both JWT issuers and subject are always single-valued. Validation logic for this use case is currently non-normative, but do not interpret non-normative as not important!</p>
<p>Constrained to an Audience</p>
<p>While verifiable credentials are an open-ended assertion, verifiable presentations are targeted, using a property called aud.&nbsp; This critical security component prevents an attacker from stealing a presentation made to one verifier and reusing it at another verifier. &nbsp;Creating a presentation without an audience is like broadcasting your endorsement – as long as nobody records your broadcast you might be ok, but if anyone does record that broadcast, they can replay it at will! &nbsp;Imagine if you uploaded your diploma to your social network and openly endorsed it as yours to get a pretty badge, but somebody recorded you endorsing your diploma and used that recording to apply for 3 different jobs in your name! &nbsp;Not only is it imperative to use an audience in all presentations, but it is imperative not to accept broadcasts, that is verifiers should not accept an un-audienced presentation, because it could be a replay.&nbsp; This does not mean that audience needs to be a strict match in the way that a subject/holder match is performed – it could be that the presentation is legitimately audienced to a group of verifiers rather than a single verifier, but every degree of freedom allowed in the audience introduces replay risk.</p>
<p>Time-Limited and Single-Use</p>
<p>The momentary nature of a verifiable presentation is what makes it safe to hold and store verifiable credentials. &nbsp;A JWT-VP represents the exact moment where a subject intends to share a credential.&nbsp; These VPs are only valuable if they can reliably represent the true intention and only the true intention of the subject in the moment they intended it and no other. &nbsp;Once a JWT-VP is signed and represents that intention, the token itself becomes extremely powerful. To keep abuse to a minimum, the JWT-VP exp property together with nbf creates a short window of validity. &nbsp;Verifiers need to track every incoming jti value (the unique token identifier) for as long as it is valid, so that they can detect any token that might fall through the cracks and get replayed.&nbsp; A short JWT-VP validity window reduces the number of active identifiers that have to be tracked by verifiers (helping performance), and also condenses the window of opportunity for an attacker to act, this also means a smaller horizon for risk/fraud tools to look for abuse trends.</p>
<p>Note that many VCs will also have a validity window calculated by the exp property, however that window can be much longer, in part because a stolen JWT-VC has less value by itself without a fresh JWT-VP to wrap it.</p>
 How Does the VC Data Model Compare to Other Assertion Formats? 
<p>If you examine a SAML assertion, an OpenID Connect IDtoken, and a VC/VP pair, all three formats have a lot in common:</p>
 
 They are all secure envelopes for sending set of claims around the internet. 
 They all rely on cryptographic digital signatures to protect issuer’s integrity of the document. 
 They all rely on a trust framework: some external system of trust to know which set of participant identifiers to transact with in the first place. 
 
<p>There are also important differences.</p>
<p>Separation of Issuance from Presentation </p>
<p>SAML assertions and IDtokens are messages that carry claims bundled in the moment for one single audience &amp; transaction. &nbsp;This differs from verifiable credentials, which are bundles of claims with longer lifetimes that can be held, stored, and presented to multiple audiences as a separate transaction. &nbsp;This separation between the bundling of claims and the use of the bundles is really what makes the VC data model unique. Advantages that may be unlocked because of this separation include:</p>
 
 Usage blinding – Issuers don’t necessarily know which verifiers their credential goes to. 
 User-centric analytics – trends of credential use can be evaluated by the user across issuers &amp; verifiers. 
 Historical presentation - expired statements can still be evaluated. 
 Selective disclosure - the subject chooses how much of the credential is revealed to the verifier. 
 
<p>Subject Autonomy</p>
<p>The VC data model requires credential subjects to be cryptographic participants. That is huge! IDtokens and SAML assertions communicate their assertion subject using an identifier that is only unique within the identity provider’s namespace.&nbsp; Verifiable credentials require a globally unique identifier for all cryptographic participants, and while the spec does not prescribe a mechanism for resolving identifiers to signature validation keys, the current commonly-accepted format for a globally unique identifier that can “resolve” into a public key for the purpose of digital signature validation is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">decentralized identifier</a>, or DID. &nbsp;We are going to cover the DID specification in detail in the next blog, so stay tuned for why that specification is so important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Thrilling Conclusion 
<p>As you can see, VC and VP data formats work hard to make it possible for credentials to be issued, held, and presented at the discretion of individuals.&nbsp; A VC gives structure to the data and binds the data to a given globally unique subject identifer.&nbsp; A VP adds a timely endorsement to the credential that acts as a proof of possession for the credential. The great thing about the VC data model compared to other standards that do something similar, is that VCs are a general model, and can describe many different types of credentials.&nbsp; Of course, for the purposes of interoperability, it is better if folks could agree on what credentials look like within a given community, for example we probably don't want 100 different representations of what a university diploma looks like. The fun part of the next few years (in my opinion) will be figuring out what common instantiations of credentials can and should become household names.&nbsp; There are guardrails we will want to place, and it would be lovely if we can figure out where guardrails need to be before vehicles go over the cliff, rather than after. Early adopters of this technology will have a huge part to play in socializing the kinds of credentials that become defacto standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that key management was a topic completely absent from this blog post, despite frequent use of the term "cryptographic signing".&nbsp; That's because the VC data model considers key management only obliquely.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#issuer-0">The spec states</a> for example that "relevant metadata about the issuer property&nbsp;is expected to be available to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifier">verifier</a>".&nbsp; In a world where I might present my credential to verifiers with no pre-existing relationship to my issuer, how can that verifier discover the relevant metadata?&nbsp; This is where decentralized identifiers (or DIDs) come in.&nbsp; DIDs are not a required part of a verifiable credential, but they have properties that are very attractive.&nbsp; &nbsp;And you will never guess it but the next blog in the series will be a deep dive on decentralized identifiers!&nbsp; They are a workhorse of a decentralized identity architecture, and an important reason why there is a chance that verifiable credential ecosystems can scale to represent individual people, not just organizations.&nbsp; DIDs are also the bridge between many different decentralized paradigms, between unanchored and static key encoding mechanisms, and between centralized services, through the use of methods like did:web.&nbsp; We will dig into how the mechanism works, and why different did methods might be useful at different times.</p>

<p><a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs</a> recently brought the PL network together in Lisbon for a distributed conference. Here's our recap of the event.</p> PL Summit <p>LabWeek22 kicked off with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6tnt24cIIw">PL Summit</a>. Juan Benet, founder and CEO of Protocol Labs, gave the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lDwBnQ9Wuc">opening address</a> on his vision for the future. During the five-day speaker series, attendees heard from CEOs, CTOs, and engineers in the Protocol Labs network as they shared their successes, product innovations, and more. </p><p>Research &amp; Development took center stage during the Impact talk, demonstrating how innovation in the PLN helps grow many early research projects into fully fledged production networks. </p><p>Our CEO Boris Mann gave a <a href="https://noti.st/bmann/7b7aWx">brief overview of IPVM</a> and the other projects that Fission is working on. You can watch his presentation, cued up below.</p><p>It was also there that Protocol Labs announced the winners of a $100K prize pool. We were delighted that IPVM was selected as a grant recipient!</p>IPVM and 17 other exciting projects were selected for grant funding! Hacker Base <p>The Fission x Filecoin Foundation x Lightshift Hacker Base opened for co-working, workshops, and demos. Throughout the week we hosted an Open Metaverse Meetup with Mona Galleries, Danny O'Brien's Decentralize All the Things! talk, a Filecoin Accounts Working Group session, web3storage's UCAN Build Apps with IPFS workshop, an FVM Open Hack Day, a Web3 Creators meetup, a Filecoin Private Data co-working event, and demo sessions from CASA, SpruceId, Ceramic, and MetaPals.</p>The beautiful Hacker Base at the Garagem Lisboa Meetups <p>Fission attended a CASA Mini-Gathering and folks from Metamask, WalletConnect, web3.storage, SpruceID, and Ceramic were all in attendance. We continued the discussion on the <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/issues/132">CAIP-25 RPC Methods</a> proposal that was initiated at <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/berlin-blockchain-week-recap/">Dappcon</a>. </p><p>Our co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka enjoyed participating in the <a href="https://lu.ma/8kk9i628">"Move The Bytes" Working Group</a>. This group is focused on making IPFS faster and more reliable by building a protocol that can replace bitswap, and aren't waiting for any specific team to lead the way. They are true go-getters!</p><p>We always try to host community socials whenever we're around for a conference, and this time was no different. We partnered with the lovely folks at <a href="https://web3.storage/">web3storage</a> for a Happy Hour at our favorite rooftop bar. </p>Enjoying the UCAN Have Drinks SocialDemo-ing Webnative App Template at UCAN Have Drinks Gathering IPFS Camp <p>On Day 5 of LabWeek22, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIbZUi7cTX8&amp;list=PLuhRWgmPaHtSEv2DM9J7nSvN7dnVFMM6q&amp;index=3">IPFS Camp 2022</a> kicked off by gathering the IPFS community for talks, workshops, discussion circles, hacking time, and more, all focused on celebrating recent wins and looking ahead to the future of the IPFS protocol. </p><p>Boris gave a <a href="https://noti.st/bmann/Kuk5iE/fission-the-webnative-sdk">presentation on Fission's Webnative SDK</a>, and how we are making far edge app development much easier with identity, data, and compute solutions.</p><p>Boris also <a href="https://twitter.com/bmann/status/1584449607299321857">live-tweeted</a> his experience throughout LabWeek22 and IPFS Camp.</p><p>Our CTO Brooklyn Zelenka participated in a panel on ways to improve the developer experience. She shared how Fission's stack does the heavy lifting on encryption and access control so developers can focus on the features and benefits of the app they want to produce.</p> FIL Lisbon <p>On Day 8 The Filecoin Foundation kicked off the <a href="https://fil-lisbon.io/">FIL Lisbon</a> conference with speakers, panel discussions, and interactive workshops with storage providers, users, and builders from the Filecoin ecosystem. Topics included FVM, NFTs, the Metaverse, and more.</p><p><a href="https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/introducing-the-decentralized-storage-alliance/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">It was announced</a> that Filecoin Foundation, Protocol Labs, AMD, Seagate, and EY are coming together to form the <a href="https://dsalliance.io/">Decentralized Storage Alliance</a>. The Alliance is focused on supporting the adoption of decentralized technologies by helping organizations make the transition to Web3. Through education, advocacy, and sharing and establishing best practices, the goal is to increase the use of Filecoin, IPFS, and libp2p technologies. </p> Conversations &amp; Next Steps <p>UCAN continues to unexpectedly show up in lots of places, which warms our hearts at Fission. Lots of people are building new products, or trying to make their custom tech run on IPFS, and we are delighted that UCANs are becoming the go-to tool when it comes to passwordless authentication. </p><p>We also had some great conversations around identity and capabilities, where the idea for WhoCANs came about. WhoCANs are a way to delegate from a name to a key. This is really useful where we want to share something with someone, but don't know their key in advance, or where we want to be able to rotate our keys without rotating everything. The permissions can be tied to a long term name (like an email address), and you can get new keys if you can prove that you control the address! </p><p>Since the conference, Blaine and other UCAN community collaborators have been working on the early stages of <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg/spec/discussions/121">WhoCANs</a>. Be sure to attend the <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan">UCAN community calls</a> to learn more or lend a hand!</p><p>It was so great getting to meet everyone and reconnect with the PL community. We look forward to seeing everyone again next year!</p><p></p>

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos CMO, Michael Cichon, is joined by 1Kosmos CSO, Mike Engle, to discuss how digital identity can modernize healthcare. If you are interested in learning more about this topic, please join us at our <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/event/digital-identity-in-health-care/">webinar</a> where Mike will be diving deeper into this topic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
All right, well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon. I’m the chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’ve invited our chief strategy officer, Mike Engle here today to talk about healthcare. Mike, welcome to the vlog. I’ve done some poking around, some research around healthcare, and I’ve learned a little bit about this legislation that was passed in 2016, called The Omnibus 21st Century Cures Act. And to my surprise, this got pretty deep into some interoperability requirements. Can you talk a little bit about that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, there’s legislation and industry efforts, that are trying to get, something that should be very obvious, but access to your own data, or to have your data be easily shared with somebody else, specifically in the healthcare world.</p>
<p>So this has been a long time coming. People have been trying to revolutionize healthcare records and healthcare access for 20 years, and I think the big tech companies have all tried many times, but a lot of exciting traction, that’s coming about pretty recently in this front.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So this is interesting, because it recognizes a lot of things that we would like to take for granted. We’ve all experienced this, a new pharmacy, a new insurance company, a new healthcare provider. As a patient, you go in and you start from scratch, provide all your basic information, then if you’ve got an old doctor, old doctor asked to send information to new doctor, and over a lifetime, your information gets spread all over the place, so is this focused on solving that problem?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It is. It’s taking a pragmatic approach to it in a small steps.</p>
<p>So I’ll give you an example. Today, you go to your doctor for five years and you happen to be in the state next door and you go to the hospital. How does that hospital get access to your health records today? If you were to go to the hospital today, Michael, how do you think that would happen?</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I expect a phone call, or a fax, or some kind of an email might be sent, and they would get it, right?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right. We’re stuck in the nineties. It’s really, it’s horrifying on many levels, from a technology perspective, from a verification of what it actually is, how do we know we’re getting the right health records? So there’s these efforts to modernize what they call the key, and we’ll talk about this on our webinar coming up, the key is, how do you get in, how do you prove who you are? I am Mike Engle, let’s work on my healthcare together, in a safe way.</p>
<p>And then there’s the doors, that you’re actually going through, which is all of the entities today, that hold our data, the hospitals, the specialty care providers, and they need to be able to exchange your information in a safe way as well. If for that doctor to send it to the hospital or vice versa, your blood work, needs to be federated around to lots of different people. And so, they’re trying to standardize and modernize, how those two interaction points happen.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So, this is starting to hit some familiar points here, because the very first thing is proving who you are, I guess, electronically or in a remote setting, and then there’s the storage of information, so this seems to map pretty strongly into a lot of the themes we’ve been talking about, when we talk about identity proofing and creating this digital wallet. Is that what’s happening behind the scenes?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
It is, yeah. I mean, the terminology may vary, but at the end of the day, I need a wallet or a safe place to keep my health records, that I am in control of.</p>
<p>Much like what we do for identity, is I can allow you, Michael, to create your own identity wallet, and have trusted credentials go into it, everything verified, matched to your true world identity, et cetera.</p>
<p>So the same principles should apply in the healthcare world. I prove who I am. I get access to my data, because I don’t generate that data, the hospital takes the MRI scan or somebody draws my blood work, but they should give it to me, and I should be able to share it with anybody that I want, with the press of a button, but be in control of it at all times, and that’s all in scope of what they’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So in practicality, in real world environment, how would this work? Does a hospital deploy this, or can you step us through how patients, you and I, would experience this in real life?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so there’s a lot of ways to answer that. Today, the way you get your health record created, is you have to typically go to a provider, I’m going to the doctor’s office or the hospital for the first time, show them a driver’s license, give them some other information, and they will either create a new record, or try to find you in their system. Okay, I’ll match the address, Michael Cichon, lives at 123 Main Street. Got you, and I’m in person with you, it’s all verified, and then I can hand you now a login. And so, it’s very in person, high touch, still error prone, because they could still get the wrong Michael Cichon. Imagine if you’ve had five address changes, since you’ve been to that hospital last.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
How do they find you inside the system? So these are all the things that they’re working on.</p>
<p>Now. The way it could work in the future, if we’re successful in our mission, is you can prove who you are without a doubt, and there’s some way then, to easily match those health records, not just at that point, but even remotely and digitally. I have logins at Quest, Labcorp, around me, there’s three hospitals that I’ve been to over the years, for various non-emergency things, because I’m healthy, and I’m just kidding, but all my data’s spread out and I might have logins to some of them, I don’t even remember, so that’s the scope of the problem we’re dealing with, and now, you can do all that stuff remotely.</p>
<p>So if I’m going to, say, do a Teladoc session, where I need to get medical care over Zoom, or over something like this, now it’s really important that you’re talking to the right person and that you’re talking to a verified doctor.</p>
<p>So we can do all that stuff digitally now.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
That’s great. And we’re not alone in this mission. There’s an organization called CARIN, not the K-A-R-E-N, it’s the C-A-R-I-N, and they’re all around furthering the interoperability standards for the access and sharing of this, correct?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, that’s right. The CARIN Alliance is a nonprofit, and we’re going to talk in depth about this next week, but their mission is to bring payers and providers that serve users, like you and me, together and get some of these standards in place and create some real demonstrations of the art of the possible.</p>
<p>So for example, we’re working with the CARIN Alliance now, to demonstrate how you could prove your identity remotely to, say, one of the federal healthcare services, and then let somebody else rely on that trust.</p>
<p>So imagine you go to social security and you say, “I’m I’m 58, I need my Medicare plan B,” whatever it is, you have to prove who you are. Shouldn’t you be able to reuse that proof to a hospital, or to your doctor, so that they can easily consume your identity? You can share it with them and then they can all go downstream from there, and that’s one of the actual, real-world projects we’re working on, in the CARIN Alliance right now.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So this is pretty cool. So with the proper platform and framework that’s interoperable, me as a patient, I could enroll remotely, all of my information is stored under lock and key that I control, and then as I go to a new provider or a new pharmacy, essentially, I would do something as simple as, for example, scan a QR code and we do a facial recognition and now they get exactly the information I want to give them, at the time I want to give it to them. Right?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Exactly. Yeah, so the art of proving who you are remotely is, there’s a federal standard for that, it’s NIST 800-63-3, it says, here’s how you do all this stuff remotely to prove somebody, match the face to the driver’s license and all that, and these medical organizations and government agencies, are now working to be able to implement that as a trusted way to prove your identity.</p>
<p>And once it’s done in one place, that same identity can be leveraged over and over again, so you don’t have to go to hospital one, prove who you are, go to hospital two, prove who you are. Imagine if you go to the hospital and they ask you a question, do you have a social security account? I say, “by Joe, I do.” All right, great. I just need you to authorize the transfer of that identity information over to us, so that boom, we’re in and I can match the patient records very easily. That’s the vision. Or there’s many ways that it could be implemented, but that’s one example of how it could work, and make things a lot easier.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
This is really fascinating. We’re going from a world, like we discussed earlier, where information is just spread all over the place, to a world where it’s in one place, it’s controlled by the patient, and it’s there when they need it, they share it selectively when they want to, and they get the services they need, so that’s fascinating.</p>
<p>Now, we are doing a webinar on this. If you’re seeing this before the webinar, it’s December 15th, 1<br>
:00 PM Eastern Time, 10:00 AM Pacific Time. Mike, you have some partners in this webinar, correct?</p>

I do, yeah. I’ll be joined by Ryan Howells, from the CARIN Alliance, so he’ll be talking in depth about some of the topics that I hinted on, and we are also being joined by Adam McBride, who’s the IT director at Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>So these are people that have been doing this for a long time, and we’re working very closely with both of these organizations, to try to make some of these things come to light.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, this is really amazing, not just giving patients like you and I access to the services we need, but we all know that the healthcare records are one of the most sought after records by cyber criminals. So securing that information, especially as we move forward here and the attacks get even more creative and aggressive, it’s really exciting to hear the work that’s being done around this.</p>
<p>Mike, thank you so much for joining me today. I appreciate your time. I’m looking forward to that webinar.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Pleasure. We’ll talk to you soon.</p>

<p>For the past 5 years, Ontology has been building for Web3, through the highs and the lows of the blockchain cycle. Our latest AMA takes a look back at the history of Ontology and the progress made in building identity and data based Web3 infrastructure. With the past to guide us, we look forward to a successful future.</p><p>Here are some of the key points from the&nbsp;AMA.</p><p>Host: It’s been five years since Ontology’s inception. What are your thoughts about&nbsp;it?</p><p>Erick: I think it’s been very interesting to see how this space has evolved since 2017. 2017 was kind of like the last bull market. We’ve gone through a full cycle from bull to bear to bull, and now back to&nbsp;bear.</p><p>I think the trends have changed a bit. Initially, it was a lot of protocols focused on Layer1, thinking about the infrastructure and the very foundational level. But over time, transitioned to a lot more like DeFi and application level. So I was glad to see it move in that direction because I think the most important thing is thinking about the end-user and what kinds of applications they&nbsp;require.</p><p>That was reflected in Ontology as well. When Ontology started out, it was very focused on business to business. But overtime, it transitioned over to the more consumer facing applications. There’s still the business side of things, but I think, you know there’s no denying that the consumer market has dwarfed the enterprise market for blockchain with regards to all the applications, DeFi, NFTs, and now with decentralized identity, with no&nbsp;doubts.</p><p>Host: What is your view on this whole five years of Ontology, working on DID, OScore, constantly innovating as someone who’s a member of the community, as someone who facilitates members of the community? What is your take on&nbsp;that?</p><p>NodeDiggity: I probably have a few different points. The first one is I wish I had been here since the inception or conception of it because watching it grow from 2017 to now would probably give me a better idea of what the following five years could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>I think DID can solve a lot of issues for a lot of people, specifically with regards to mass adoption.</p><p>I think that companies, specifically Ontology, are placed to do this well. They can make the landscape safe, and it seems like a really altruistic effort. Protecting the assets of people and allowing them actual ownership of it and sort of facilitating the future, with the concept of reputation coming&nbsp;through.</p><p>Erick: I just want to reiterate the importance of reputation. I think on both sides, there needs to be ways to reward contributors and make them be able to take their reputation across different platforms.</p><p>Host: What value has Ontology actually added onto the Web3 infrastructure or the Web 3 framework?</p><p>Erick: I think the most important thing or the most important contribution is the decentralized identity infrastructure, because a lot of Web3 projects right now, especially in DeFi, still operate very much on overcollateralization, which limits the use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>So we need the identity layer and the reputation layer. Then we know which projects are trustworthy, which people are trustworthy and to do peer-to-peer loans with, and that’s going to enable a whole lot of a lot of&nbsp;things.</p><p>The core of that is the decentralized identity infrastructure, verifiable credentials to be able to track the history and to be able to read it, transfer it and even analyze it and draw insights from it to assign under a new version of a credit score. Then aside from that, I mean the same goes for the other areas of Web3 like for NFTs or&nbsp;DAOs.</p><p>NodeDiggity:</p><p>My viewpoint on this is exactly the opposite of Erick’s. I look at it from a user standpoint, because that’s who I&nbsp;am.</p><p>So the two things that I’ve thought might be the most valuable to the public&nbsp;are:</p><p>The first one is a multi chain mobile wallet which is user friendly and works as such and actually does what it’s supposed to do. And I think setting up a mobile wallet that is multi chain is paramount to getting cross chain identity to be&nbsp;usable.</p><p>And the 2nd one is coming from the node operator and initial investor&nbsp;side.</p><p>I didn’t mean the one who just saw ontology on a dex and bought it because of the high APY. It’s sustainable because of the tokenomics situation that Ontology has planned out by releasing their governance token incrementally. I think that’s particularly attractive to people like me who want to put their money into something that is not like staking something to make sure you don’t get inflated&nbsp;out.</p><p>For more information and details, please click the link below to get the recording of this&nbsp;Space:</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGlapeMnDJL">https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1RDGlapeMnDJL</a></p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/five-years-in-the-making-continuing-to-deliver-web3-7a35a4dc24d7">Five Years in the Making: Continuing to Deliver Web3</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: More than 2000 years ago in Persia, Egypt, ancient China and their contemporary civilisations, the first versions of what we now know as the passport were used to travel from one region to another. As the world became more populated and connected through roads and by the sea, passports became a vital piece of paper for people to enter from one country to another. But only in the late 21st century the passport became as standardised and globally acknowledged as we know it today.</p>
<p>But what has been the ultimate motivation for humans to travel the world? Trade, and it’s still today.</p>
<p>Companies have also existed for centuries. Some of the oldest businesses existing today were established in Japan, like Nishiyama Onsen Keiunkan a hot spring hotel founded in 705. However, the need for business registries came much later in history. The United Kingdom’s Companies House was created in 1844. The goal of British lawmakers at that time was that having a list of registered companies publicly available would help reduce fraud.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a company that was founded in 1841 provided credit reports about businesses through several decades with a similar goal of helping businesspeople know the companies they were planning to trade with. In 1963 Dun &amp; Bradstreet created the Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) a unique nine-digit identifier for businesses. A few other similar business identifiers appeared but, as with the passports, the time for a global standardisation was still to come.</p>
<p>Let’s hear now the history of the Legal Entity Identifier, LEI, the 20-digit identifier for businesses and other types of organisations.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: Today we have with us Clare Rowley. The head of business operations at the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, the GLEIF.</p>
<p>Clare, what were the reasons why the LEI was created?</p>
<p>Clare Rowley: I will go all the way back to September of 2008. For participants in financial markets, financial institutions, this is a very memorable month because during this time there was what is now referred to as the Lehman weekend.</p>
<p>And of course, that led to a failure of an extremely important market institution, market player and the subsequent impact across the world. So, at this time, there were supervisors within financial markets, financial institutions, asking a very simple question to their regulated entities. That is, what is your exposure to Lehman Brothers? And the scary answer was – that was not really an easy thing to know and to determine, and it will probably take weeks and maybe even months to get that answer.</p>
<p>And the root of the problem was not that there was no data on the positions that were held, etc. Rather, it was the problem in identifying those several thousand legal entities associated with Lehman Brothers. So, at the time there was no design in data systems that made it easy to aggregate information across the entities and then clearly paint the different hierarchies existing, be it in the financial products or in the corporate structure itself. That left a window opening or some motivation for the leaders around the world to come together and to think about how to solve that problem.</p>
<p>So, if we fast forward to today, we’ll see that the Legal Entity Identifier, the LEI and that being part of the global LEI system has solved the problem of identity, largely starting in derivative markets, but bit by bit moving into all financial instruments such as securities, fixed income markets that are around the world. And you’ll see now that the LEI, it is incorporated into different regulatory reporting’s. And based on our, the foundation’s, last analysis, we are able to identify 294 regulations and policy recommendations that are coming from 24 jurisdictions around the world.</p>
<p>Oscar: Tell us more about how was the process behind the creation of these LEI standards.</p>
<p>Clare: So, it really was a fabulous international effort that was led by the Financial Stability Board. So, following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, you then had the G20 leaders coming together and making a recommendation. An open public means a system for identifying legal entities. And that recommendation was put to the Financial Stability Board.</p>
<p>So, the very first thing that the Financial Stability Board, an organisation international that is based out of Basel, Switzerland. Put their heads together and said, okay, first we want to look at the governance topic. So, they did a very extensive consultation to public sector entities, the regulatory, central banks, securities regulators, etc., but also an extensive outreach to private sector.</p>
<p>And that private sector was not just organisations like financial institutions, the intermediaries, etc., but also going into, for example, real world like the topic of supply chain, business registries. So not just focusing on the financial markets but looking into, for example, even payments, etc., where we see a lot of activity today. And overall, the Financial Stability Board concluded a governance structure that is that is very robust but inclusive of all different organisations or all different, you could say sectors.</p>
<p>So, let’s start at the top. We have three layers.</p>
<p>At the top we have the Regulatory Oversight Committee, and this is made up of more than 65 authorities from around the globe that are setting the policy and ensuring the policy evolves over time.</p>
<p>Then you have the Global LEI Foundation, the GLEIF, which is the organisation I represent. We are managing the operations. We are a not-for-profit Swiss foundation.</p>
<p>And then at the third level there is organisations called LEI issuers. And this is the most diverse grouping of organisations involved. We have 39 in total, and they are the local experts. So, they know what makes a legal entity, a legal entity, how to validate and verify that information at the local jurisdictional level.</p>
<p>So, this governance structure that was set up is very inclusive as you have the public sector there at the top. Then you have us, the foundation, which you could consider more like a neutral, not for profit organisation and helping to coordinate across the different layers. And then these LEI issuers, the 39 organisations are all different types of entities. You have private sector entities like London Stock Exchange, Bloomberg, you have business registers, etc. So, it’s a very mixed group and also allows the system to get a very wide input into how it should evolve into how it’s applied at the local level.</p>
<p>So, this public private partnership led by the Financial Stability Board, well, it was developed in a very intensive way with great participation coming from different areas. You see a governance structure that has persisted and that has really demonstrated how efficient it is.</p>
<p>And then on top of that, we have the LEI.</p>
<p>So, in parallel to the developments, the governance structure, there is also a desire to ensure that the LEI, the legal entity identifier was non-proprietary, a broad public good and therefore there was the engagement with ISO, the International Standardisation Organisation, to establish the LEI as that kind of standard, one that is open, public, freely accessible. And you will find the LEI is also represented as an ISO standard – 17442.</p>
<p>That standard describes the LEI itself, as well as the reference data such as official name, registered address. And something interesting there as well is the idea that it should evolve over time. So, you see already there have been updates to the standard to include, for example, references to how the LEI could be embedded in digital products like digital certificates. And that is a really fundamental principle of the system that the system in the governance structure, in the actual application of standards should evolve according to market participant needs over time.</p>
<p>Oscar: And when the LEI was – possibly said launch – was made available for organisations.</p>
<p>Clare: So, the foundation itself came into being in June of 2014. But you will find that the earliest LEIs were issued all the way back in 2012 and that gets us a bit to how it has been used since its creation. So, you might think to yourself and a standard for legal entity identity that’s really big and it also gets to the heart of data systems of how businesses interact – identify their partners. And if you think yourself or even, let’s say, as a business entity, how many identifiers you have, you will quickly think about, for example online platforms, logins with governments, logins to health insurance, whatever it is, etc.</p>
<p>And you will realise you have hundreds and hundreds of identifiers, either that you use personally or for businesses as well. So that therefore brings us to well, how do you get by in an interest and utilisation for such a system when it really gets to a very expensive end and difficult change for organisations, how to identify business partners itself and transactions etc. And that is where we see regulators in the first step of using the LEI.</p>
<p>They looked and they said, well, we know we have an area that’s changing rapidly where we have regulation coming into effect and change is occurring in industry and that was derivative markets. So back in 2012 when the first LEIs were being issued, they were being issued to help the financial market participants, both financial institutions, as well as companies that use derivatives for things like currency hedging, natural resource hedging, etc.</p>
<p>Those were the first entities to obtain the LEI and that was to ensure compliance with emerging regulations of the United States such as the Dodd-Frank regulation, and within Europe, the EMIR regulation and then the LEI expanded after that in to, for example, the markets in financial instruments directive in the EU so more broad use across the across the financial instruments markets.</p>
<p>But indeed, that’s why you see a bit of the disconnect between the first LEIs being issued in 2012 to meet the market demand, the regulatory implementations. But the actual full system itself with the GLEIF, there helping managing the operations, the publication of the data, etc. that was not fully in place until June of 2014.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: The early 2010s saw the world becoming more digital and connected. Square, Stripe and later Apple Pay made it so easy to move money from the device that was already in our pockets. OpenID Connect made it so easy to use our digital identities across a seemingly unlimited number of services.</p>
<p>The concept of Identities for organisations was finally starting to take off thanks to the new LEI standard. So, how LEI is used today?</p>
<p>The ignition factor for LEIs came from the financial industry, but it was not the emergence of mobile payments or users’ convenience. It came through an unprecedented avalanche of regulations that mandated its use. These more than 300 global regulations covered most financial activity you could think of – Payments, Capital Markets, Private Banking, Treasury, Cross Border Trade, Letters of Credit, Lending, and the list continues.</p>
<p>In November 2018 the Bank of England became the first central bank with plans to make LEIs mandatory within certain transactions between financial institutions.</p>
<p>“The notes smelled musty, as if they had been stored under the floorboards” was said by the court.&nbsp; This blatant example of NatWest bank shows how cash enters into the financial system in the millions to fund illegal activities when there are insufficient anti-money laundering checks. This case makes it very clear that banks and financial institutions must verify who exactly their customers are. How can bank employees know who are the beneficial owners of a company? Here is how LEIs are already helping.</p>
<p>Who are the job creators? The media often makes us believe that big corporations and billionaires are. But the evidence shows, as we discussed with Amit Sharma earlier in this podcast, that small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are the real job creators in both the richest and poorest countries.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even in richer economies, small businesses find it very hard to get access to credit to secure their next 12 months of operation. Why? The main reason is that a company’s financial reputation is directly based on the owner’s financial score. What if the family, on top of not owning any property, never built up a good credit score to prove that they are reliable for re-payments? A bank would make its due diligence, follow their KnowYourCustomer KYC processes, and as a result deny them credit. How can we change this game and bring financial inclusion? Again, here is how LEIs can help.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that LEIs can make a big positive impact, and innovative companies are already making this happen.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: So now let’s talk about the future of the LEIs. So, with the pandemic and the recent economic instability, what are the new challenges that the LEI has found?</p>
<p>Clare: When we talk about the future, what we see at the GLEIF is a pivot to the private sector, adoption.</p>
<p>And we see there – first, I will focus on trade. And to quote a recent publication that came from ICC UK, “the world’s 333 million companies support a global community of almost 8 billion people, all of whom rely on these companies to earn a living and live in a prosperous and more peaceful world.” So, 330 million companies, well, you can’t have a global economy – interactions between companies, customers cross-border without having a more efficient way of answering that very basic question, who am I doing business with?</p>
<p>So, we see there an emerging dialogue and focus coming from the trade, the supply chain community on the importance of LEI for trade participants. And that is particularly since the COVID pandemic, where we see fraudulent transactions as people, companies ran to go digital. Fraudulent transactions also have been on the rise. And that’s where the private sector becomes engaged, looking at the LEI, the accessing of the LEI via the LEI index as a means to provide real time access to unique identification of legal entities.</p>
<p>It helps the first step in creating an efficient and trust-based relationship to facilitate, for example, trade finance. And then, very importantly, eliminating manual inputs and the difficulties or cost driving exercises that manual management of data causes. So, for example, if you are relying on names and addresses to try to identify business parties, to try to communicate across business partners, you have problems with translation, transliteration, shortening of names, of addresses and all of that requires manual intervention just to get a transaction initiated, just to have and establish that very first trust between two business partners.</p>
<p>So, there you see an emerging interest in the LEI as a solution for KYC, anti-fraud and ensuring appropriate surveillance for anti-money laundering.</p>
<p>Identity also is extremely important for businesses. And access to a global identity can be life changing for small businesses, especially small businesses coming from developing nations where maybe their local business registry is not easily accessible to parties outside the country, etc.</p>
<p>And there we did a pilot project in Zimbabwe working with a financial institution that engaged in something we call the validation agent operating model. That bank was called, NMB bank and they decided to engage, to investigate. Well, how can the global LEI system offer its small business client’s access to this global identifier so as to broaden their ability to interact digitally and also make the small businesses more present and more accessible to business partners around the world.</p>
<p>And through this engagement, there’s a firm called Copper Wares that became one of the first mid-sized African companies to get an LEI. And there we have a finance manager from the company that notes – regarding Copper Wares having the LEI that “once were known out there. We expect life to be much easier, funding terms to be more accessible, credit terms to be more accessible. And overall, that helps us Copper Wares to produce more, employ more people and offer better prices and boost market share.”</p>
<p>So, we really see that driving need the ability opportunity for small businesses to promote themselves, to make themselves more accessible via this global identity as a very important pillar to the future and the growth of the global LEI system.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. And you have mentioned earlier that the LEIs are maintained supported by a series of organisations is an ecosystem including the GLEIF. So how has the GLEIF and this LEI ecosystem evolved to help solve the challenges that you just mentioned?</p>
<p>Clare: So, I already mentioned with the with the COVID pandemic, of course, you had all sorts of business processes, operations that were going digital. And with that movement toward digital, it also highlighted, you could say, one of the shortcomings of the LEI system.</p>
<p>So as a starting point, the global LEI system, it is open public information. We are gathering the data that is validated, verified by these LEI issuers around the world. We gather that data, we run data quality checks, ensure the quality of it, and then ultimately put it together and publish it in a way that enables an easy website search, full file download, or API access for technical programmes.</p>
<p>That’s our role to ensure that the LEI remains an open public good, and we’re upholding the basic principles that were put forward by the Financial Stability Board and are overseen by the Regulatory Oversight Committee. So open public data, fabulous, easily accessible. But if you take that and now apply it to establishing a trust relationship, we have a disconnect.</p>
<p>For example, I, Clare Rowley, I could take any one of these 2.2 million LEIs that are out there. I could just choose it from the open public data. Go to a financial institution and say, “Yep, here I am, Clare Rowley. I represent this organisation. I would like to open a bank account with you”, and that financial institution now has to do the same basic checks, confirming authorised representative, etc. again. To ensure that, I, Clare Rowley actually am an authorised representative of this LEI.</p>
<p>So that has driven us to look more deeply into enhancing the LEI as a digital ID management tool. And we see there is a lot of value to expand the LEI as an organisational identity management tool and the fact that it is this global unique identifier. So, we look to leverage existing technologies such as digital certificates, and we also look into a new model of decentralised business identity, looking into, for example, the principles of self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>So as to evolve the LEI in that it is not just that 20-digit alphanumeric code to identify firms, but also to enable firms to use it as a way to identify themselves. And verify the authenticity of their counterparty organisations without the need for that additional human intervention. So, we look to evolve the system to ensure it can enable instant and automated trust between legal entities and their authorised representatives.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, the importance of connecting the individual’s identity with organisations, identity. Clare, final question how do you see the LEIs in, let’s say ten years from now?</p>
<p>Clare: So absolutely we believe that digital will drive a lot of the LEI growth and that is just the reality of the world we live in. Indeed, we had the COVID pandemic, now it starts two years ago, but we see that business processes and sectors still struggle with digitisation. So, we believe that this movement, these efforts will continue for many years to come.</p>
<p>But ultimately, digital is the future for business transactions. So, we think that that area will drive a lot of growth within the global LEI system. Right now, there is a major international effort ongoing that is led by the Financial Stability Board with the intent to make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, more transparent and more inclusive.</p>
<p>You will find that the LEI is involved in three of the building blocks of this initiative with our primary building block, our focus being around establishing&nbsp; unique identifiers with proxy registries. So, the initiative it’s very ambitious, but what we really like about it is the visionary approach. So, it is looking very globally at the overall payments ecosystem and what needs to be done to ensure the evolution of the payments ecosystem to achieve those objectives faster, cheaper, more transparent, more inclusive.</p>
<p>And just see, in July of this year, the Financial Stability Board published a recommendation report regarding the LEI in cross-border payments. And you get that same flavour of the broader ecosystem needed to facilitate transactions cross-border in an efficient way. So, some of those recommendations go to international standard setting bodies, such as FATF, the BCBS. And there you will see the focus on using the LEI as a standardised identifier for sanctions list publications, but also as a means of identification of legal entity customers, beneficiaries within payments ecosystems, but also generally for customer due diligence.</p>
<p>So, we see that there will be a growth of the LEI in the cross-border payments. To facilitate that growth we envision a greater participation of financial institutions in the issuance and maintenance of the life. And I bring back this term the validation agent that is referring to financial institutions or other types of organisations that have expertise in identity validation verification where they incorporate LEI issuance into their operating procedures for corporate, for customer due diligence to seamlessly provide the LEI to the customer as a by-product of their validation verifications that they’re doing.</p>
<p>Today we have over ten organisations that are participating as validation agents, but we believe that the LEI will become more and more embedded in customer due diligence protocols as the cross-border payment initiative forwards.</p>
<p>And then the other area I mentioned briefly is sustainability reporting. So of course, this is a very hot topic across all sorts of sectors. Knowing the sustainability profile of suppliers, of merchants, etc. And there you see of course; data is core to addressing the question of sustainability and the current climate crisis. And there’s a lot of focus on, well, what metrics are being reported, the different markets, the different cuts you could say maybe it’s looking into carbon markets, human rights, labour conditions, etc. But a very important piece of that is the fundamental question, well, who is being reported on from a company level? And then how do I connect this information? So, a company, let’s just say a manufacturer, it could be reporting information on its carbon footprint, on its use of its participants, and labour markets, etc.</p>
<p>And those could be going to very different regulators, very different investors, consumers of information. And then, of course, there also publishing the traditional financial information on their investments, on their balance sheets, income statement, etc. All of that needs to be brought together in a way that facilitates analysis, facilitates investors to understand better the profile of the company, supervisory authorities, purchasers, the customers that would be interested in engaging in supplier relationships.</p>
<p>And so, you see identity is a fundamental pillar of helping us to address the data question around sustainability reporting. So, we believe that also as the interest and the as the world around sustainability reporting becomes more standardised, you will find the LEI there growing as a tool to connect. &nbsp;You could say some of that real world information on the sustainability reporting with then also the financial markets information coming from companies.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Great to see how LEIs are going to help us on these challenges in the coming years. Thanks a lot, Clare, for joining us.</p>
<p>Clare: Well, thank you, Oscar. A pleasure again to catch up.</p>
 
<p>Oscar: There is no doubt that innovations will keep coming and will bring us surprises that are hard to imagine today. In the future, when you log into a digital service, not only you will have proved who you are but also which company you belong and if you can legally represent such business, all verified on real time.</p>
<p>These innovations will help fight against “musty” businesses, will help with international trade, will help us empower the real job creators, and more.</p>
<p>Don’t be surprised if a world in which LEIs are more ubiquitous than passports is the world we live tomorrow.</p>
<p>This was a special story episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity.</p>

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>The dedication, skills and indeed genius of the people working in industries and services such as health and care often elicits admiration and awe. So here’s a question. Why are citizens so often frustrated, let down and sometimes angry at their poor experience of using these services? How is that if you put together the expertise and dedication of thousands of different specialists the sum is so much less than the&nbsp;parts?</p><p>The answer is that these services are not ‘joined up’. They are organised around different specialist silos which are often bursting with expertise. But each concentrates on doing their own thing. When it comes to making handovers between these specialisms things fall apart. Information isn’t passed on. Actions fall between stools. There is miscommunication, error and poor coordination.</p> A single cause for a system-wide mess <p>The prime cause of such messes is the organisation-centric database: an approach to using data that keeps data generated by each specialist locked away in their own particular data silo — so that others cannot access and use&nbsp;it.</p><p>It is this that results in frustration, friction, risk, error and cost running through the system from end to end, like a stick of rock. It forces patients to tell the same story over and over again to different people as they make their way through the system. It undermines quality while multiplying costs and causing delays and errors that cascade across the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Take ‘bed blocking’. It’s got many causes, one of them being lack of capacity in the social sector: people have nowhere to go. But another cause is poor data logistics. Once someone has finished treatment in a hospital they need to be handed over to someone. But that involves planning, organisation, coordination. And that in turn requires getting the right data to and from the right people and organisations at the right times. But the traditional organisation-centric database is designed to do the exact opposite: to NOT share&nbsp;data.</p><p>If data isn’t available as to who is going to be discharged where, they can’t be discharged. Which means wards get full and new admissions get blocked. This makes the whole system suffer. Associated admin nightmares are themselves a cause of capacity constraints: the more time people have to spend chasing paper trails (and paper tails), the less time they have available for front line service delivery. Yes, the health and social care system has a funding problem. But whatever the level of funding, it could deliver a much better, higher quality service if it got its data logistics right.</p><p>This isn’t only true of health and social care. Wherever individuals’ needs span more than one, single, isolated intervention you will find the same outcomes, to some degree or other. To provide financial advice for example, you need a rounded picture of the individual’s financial state. This requires data from multiple different sources relating to employment income, pensions, income from benefits or investments, savings, debts, assets and so on. Most of the cost of providing advice isn’t related to the advice itself, but to the costs of amassing and connecting the necessary data.</p><p>When young people who have been in care leave for university or the big wide world, delays in processing and supporting them in the handover process — usually involving many different services — routinely mean that people fall between stools, creating unnecessary stress and&nbsp;misery.</p><p>Bringing together data about daily activity, exercise and diet is key to staying fit and healthy and avoiding obesity, but still impossibly difficult to do. Combining data about educational qualifications, work experiences and personal goals is essential to effective career planning, but remains more an ideal than a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>The really sad thing here is that some policy makers still seem oblivious to both what’s causing the problems they are trying to fix and the fact that they are fixable. Many policy initiatives and data strategies singularly fail to address the exam question they set themselves (such as, ‘how to use personal data to improve quality and outcomes in public services?’). Instead, they veer off at tangents while compounding the underlying problem by seeking increased centralisation and further disempowerment of individuals. It is truly tragic, for example, how often people drive by personal data logistics in their dash for jam-tomorrow claims of investment in big data, research and artificial (fake) intelligence.</p> Fixing the problem at the heart of the&nbsp;system <p>The personal data logistics infrastructure that we’ve been talking about [Link] tackles all of these problems at source. It does this by making individuals the point at which information about themselves is integrated and using their personal data stores as data sharing hubs, thereby enabling the sharing of the right information at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>In this way, it makes seamless handovers between services possible, enabling the delivery of integrated, joined-up services at much lower cost — because all the duplicated effort, delays and errors caused by the organisation-centric data logjam are lifted. It allows a step-change in service quality and outcomes as well as the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/when-organisations-become-waste-factories-9c893ea18784">productivity breakthroughs we talked about in our last&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>In this blog series we’re trying to make a point. Personal data raises all sorts of fundamental issues relating to human rights and privacy concerns. But it also has immense economic implications. In talking about the economic opportunities of personal data, we’ve used the language of cost, efficiency and productivity.</p><p>But here in particular, the biggest cost is the human cost. Every day millions of hard-working people’s best efforts are being squandered — mocked even — by the poor design of the systems they’re given to work with. And, as a result, every day millions more people experience pain, frustration and hassle because services aren’t working in the joined up way they’re supposed&nbsp;to.</p><p>But if citizens became the point at which data about them is integrated, and the hub by which this data is shared under their control, most of today’s pain, frustration and hassle could be lifted, for staff and patients alike. This is the second crucial way in which citizen-empowering personal data logistics infrastructure can help transform the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Now let’s turn our attention to the third way — transforming the ways in which organisations and individuals go to&nbsp;market.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

				  Our regular review of recent news from around the decentralized identity community. In this edition we look at a potential digital identity bill in Congress, a hackathon focused on spreading digital identity, and a conversation on regulation as we move closer to Web3.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/12/digital-identity-metaverse-why-we-need-to-regulate-it-and-how/">Why We Need to Regulate Digital Identity in the Metaverse</a><br>Marcus Bonner shares his thoughts with the World Economic Forum on how online authentication and identification have been handled historically and why the process can be considered a failure. Bonner laments the lack of control users have when relying on third parties to hold their data, whether on e-commerce or social media sites. Looking to the emerging metaverse and Web3, he draws our attention to the critical questions we need to ask if we are to avoid the pitfalls of tying our our physical lives even closer to our virtual identities:</p>
 
 Where do the boundaries lie between a digital history — such as proof of purchase — and the right to privacy? 
 Would users have the ability or the right to be forgotten? 
 What happens to your data when you die? 
 Who can add to a user’s digital identity — and what can be added or deleted? 
 Can you create multiple identities the way you can create multiple accounts today? 
 
<p>Concrete, commonly-agreed-upon answers to these questions don’t exist today; what you can do varies based on the system you choose to use and the regulations in place in your jurisdiction. But this article does a great job of highlighting what we need to think about before signing up for any system designed to share personal information with anyone.</p>

Forty teams were shortlisted to participate in the 72-hour event from which three winners were selected:</p>
<p>3rd place — Internet ID: An auto-generated, secure lifetime ID that uses a secure single account access to prevent bots and fake accounts from being created.</p>
<p>2nd place — Team <a href="https://dev.to/bitbender1010/building-a-one-click-identity-verification-system-23nn">OneSecure</a>: A one-click identity verification system for businesses and portal for individuals. The team were so engrossed in their project that they continued to work on the solution after the hackathon.</p>
<p>1st place — VeriVent: A platform that links investors to potential startups while using Verified.Africa’s API to verify the startup owners’ identity, reducing the likelihood of theft and fraud..</p>
<p>This article is a great reminder of the power of good community events. Some of the best projects can be started based on a real need that has been realized and — with just a few passionate people — continue to be developed, just like OneSecure’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nextgov.com/analytics-data/2022/12/tsa-wants-automate-id-verification-checkpoint-security/380494/">TSA Wants to Automate ID Verification at Checkpoint Security</a><br>This article by Kristen Errick, Staff Reporter for Nextgov, takes a look at the recent decision by the TSA to add digital IDs to their pilot program for testing facial recognition. The TSA has begun using Credential Authentication Technology 2 (CAT-2) systems for identity verification at 16 airports. The system will view and compare the information from the digital identity with the passenger’s live photo and flight information — an approach previously tried with physical IDs — and now is in the testing phase to see if this is possible with digital IDs.</p>
<p>According to the article, the data&nbsp; from this pilot program will be held by the Department of Homeland Security For two years for analysis before being deleted.</p>
<p>While the system itself does not claim to be decentralized, personally identifying information that is part of this test is supposed to be almost immediately deleted, with the TSA claiming “passengers’ live photos and personally identifiable information from their digital ID will only last until the next passenger is scanned, when the system overwrites the old passenger’s information with the newest passenger’s information.” The solution is still in early stages, and those that do not wish to share any additional information with the TSA can opt for the standard checkpoint screening for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Natalie Alms, Staff Writer for FCW, reports on the status of the Improving Digital Identity Act, which was originally introduced in 2020 and then recently re-introduced by a joint effort from representatives of both parties. The bill seeks to push the federal government into a bigger role in the digital identity space by providing opt-in identity validation services and creating a task force to evaluate best practices for digital identity credentials. Backers point to a <a href="https://fcw.com/digital-government/2022/09/over-45-billion-unemployment-paid-fraudsters-during-pandemic-watchdog-says/377572/">recent study</a> highlighting a significant increase in identity theft and fraud as the renewed need for this bill. Unfortunately Alms concludes that the bill is unlikely to make it to a vote as Congress’s next session will be tied up in bigger items like the 2023 federal budget.</p>

<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Earlier this year, there were manifestations against the vaccine passports and there was this whole rhetoric that people were using saying that the vaccine passports were a tool that the Government was putting in place to control and put surveillance over its citizens. These types of movements,&nbsp; specifically within the space of Digital Identity, just looking recently into the Quebec national assembly there has been a couple of different petitions with tens of thousands of people signing against Digital ID programs or even against being forced to use a wallet for Digital ID. Anyone familiar with the Canadian Digital ID in the public sector at least knows of the Saskatchewan Government Program following through in early 2022, which further deepened negative public sentiment around these types of programs which perhaps influenced, perhaps didn’t.</p>
<p>Then again, anyone familiar with the Digital Identity space knows the efforts going into preserving privacy principles and making sure they’re put into place, as well as other principles such as control agencies, equity, inclusion, security, transparency, and the list goes on.&nbsp; I think that this is also very well communicated within the digital identity community, but we seem to be having a tough time as a community explaining this more broadly to the public.</p>
<p>I hear many people say Governments need to do a better job at doing so, but I&nbsp; think it’s all of our role to do a better job at doing this. It’s not just the Government, it’s the community overall. If we do this correctly, we’re doing all of this to protect the rights of people through these tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The conversation today is meant for us to have a discussion about all this and hopefully through it generate some suggestions that we can share with listeners on how to avoid the big brother rhetoric moving forward. Let’s start the conversation with the concept of misinformation, as a growing societal topic, which I think is blurring messaging and I do think in fact that misinformation is a big cyber security risk that gets in the way of protecting the rights of individuals and societies. If we’re not able to express our choice without being manipulated, it’s a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting just to start with misinformation, because it’s one of the things blurring Digital ID communication.</p>
<p>How is your thinking on this misinformation, and how it has evolved over the past few years, maybe even more recently with Covid?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to start the conversation there.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I would say it’s not just a Digital ID problem, I think this is a societal problem that transcends any kind of subject matter, we see it with elections, with Public Health and Covid was a great example. In my opinion, a lot of it just comes down to trust or trusted sources.</p>
<p>When I was growing up,&nbsp; the only way to get your news was through outlets such as CBC News, delivered by Peter Mansbridge, who was the ‘trusted source’.&nbsp; Now, we’re facing an information overload problem, which can be good in some ways – information is awesome – and the internet and social media have come out in the last 20-odd years, which is good for our collective knowledge of humanity. But with information overload comes a lot of other stuff that isn’t necessarily accurate, we have bots that are putting out some automated things and I think the challenge we have now is that there is so much content now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I look at my own Twitter or LinkedIn feeds, the algorithms are starting to dictate what bubbles up because you can’t possibly see it all so what you get is a snippet of some of the things that are going on. Guess what snippets you’re getting? You’re getting the ones with the most reaction, interaction or the most hate or love or whatever the case may be but the extreme reactions are the ones that will bubble up.</p>
<p>I think as humans, when I see misinformation on the internet, my first instinct is to want to correct it, I want to say ‘no, that’s not true’ but the way social media works the sheer interaction with that misinformation is what allows it to bubble up to the top that others see. So it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, stuff gets out there and we naturally want to correct it, it gives it more visibility and so on. That’s kind of my general view of why it’s out there.</p>
<p>In terms of Digital ID specifically, I won’t go into Covid much. You know, maybe I will a little bit, without picking a side on the whole vaccine thing, I don’t want to, that’s another podcast by itself. I would say the mRNA vaccine, just the principle of it all is a perfect example of something that has been – the mRNA was not just invented you know, last year – it has been in the works for many years and there is a science behind it and so on so forth, but it became more well-known people put those four letters together for the first time in the general public since Covid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID is no different in that this has been researched, especially in Canada. I know going back decades on things like the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> and privacy respecting principles but the general public, just as with the vaccines, doesn’t know those little ins-and-outs, nuances, and all the minutiae that all of us have you know probably laboured through analysis paralysis for years and they have snippets of information. What happens with snippets, is that people tend to fill in their blanks and start drawing parallels to other things they may have read or heard about. The one that comes to mind in Digital Identity for me is the social credit system in China. This parallel opens up a whole can of worms and yes, that is one way to implement it. Is it the way that Canada is going to implement it? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>That is why we spent the last 10 or 15 years developing the principles to prevent that type of thing from happening. I think the rise of misinformation starts with the fact that we have so much of it, that some of the subject matter is so complex and our attention spans are so short that everything needs to be explained in 140 or 280 characters. The topics alone need way more time than that. It’s like the perfect storm of a whole bunch of things that come together to lead to this current state that we’re in.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think it’s just simple for people and I guess based on what you’re talking about the algorithms that push things either one way or another but people I think more and more have found it easier to take sides you know good or bad when in reality no subject in the world is one thing or the other. People have been taken away from actually having discussions about topics so just saying that the Government is trying to control you with Digital Identity, it’s such an easy thing to say and to get behind and people have these existing thoughts about this whether it’s Covid or they thought that this was the case or whether it’s with the central bank and digital currencies, whatever the subject is. The simple messaging I think just sticks a lot more and pushes people to one side or another and you get like these conspiracy theories. It’s easy to say the government wants to control you and it’s easy to say that your telephone is listening to you and tracking data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think there is a misunderstanding of how the architecture of the internet works today and what the economic incentives are for different people today as well. It’s easy to say this without understanding the structure of it underneath. The challenge is how you explain the structure underneath without it getting too complicated for people to listen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] As humans, it’s easier to process simple (mis)information&nbsp; ‘your phone is spying on you without going further and understanding the role of the microphone, video, GPS, etc.</p>
<p>When you apply the analytical side to the logic side, obviously there’s a bit more that comes through, and I think that’s the other reason. There are two different personality types in the sense that there are people with intuitive reasoning and others with analytical type reasoning. Like me – and maybe it’s because of the field I’m in, cybersecurity – I just don’t trust anything by default so when I read something I don’t even feel comfortable re-tweeting or liking it or resharing until I know it’s legit. I need to debunk any information I consume before taking a stand, which is more my personality type.</p>
<p>Others will read and intuitively make some of these logical or not-so-logical intuitive leaps in the sort of ‘my phone is spying on me’ which I mean, it makes sense, and then take it from there. I think that the other thing is that we need to teach our society a bit more on the critical thinking side, I know it’s something I try to instill in my kid as well. If it looks or sounds funny, just ask a question or double-check.</p>
<p>A lot of the beauty of the information overload I referenced earlier, is that there is good information that you can go search for if you desire the truth. I think that’s the bigger challenge, which is how we interpret information and whether we take enough time to vet it to our satisfaction or not.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Back to the Digital ID topic, having spent enough time in public sector Digital ID programs, there is a massive movement to protect the privacy of their citizens and the Government is committed to creating digital ideas of public good to protect the democratic rights of citizens. In the same way that the Government takes action to protect its sovereignty, it’s also taking action to ensure that citizens have more sovereignty over their lives, whether it’s just the day-to-day physical world or the digital world.</p>
<p>It is what it is, and we know why these conversations are happening, however, there are these massive movements that are happening throughout the world to protect the privacy and the democratic rights of people and in my opinion, the way they are being communicated is not as efficient as it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Also, I think openness and transparency is always the solution when there is some sort of mistrust for whatever reason. Let’s be more open or overly open and transparent about what it is we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and what we’re not doing, which I think is just as equally important as what we’re doing. In these types of messaging, there is certainly an area for improvement and I think that where people have a mistrust – and not that I’m taking the side of the conspiracy theorist – but I do understand why people have a mistrust when an institution or&nbsp; Government has an attitude of ‘trust us, we’re looking at it’ rather than talking down, and ‘trust us we’ll do it’ a bit more of the let’s talk about what we’re doing. Let’s have a conversation about what we’re doing, this goes beyond identity, this goes with vaccines and other things as well. I heard this concept during Covid because of what happened with all of the misinformation about vaccines and such, that there was a psychology behind some of the stuff that gets announced; you’ve never heard terms like mRNA before and Digital Identity cases, SSI, or all these other things that get thrown around and by human nature, you’re standoffish bit but terms you don’t understand are terms you don’t know so you’re already defensive about it. If someone gives you a reason to be more defensive about it like ‘oh there’s a microchip associated with the vaccine’ it’s easier to believe because you’ve already got your backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term I heard during Covid – I forgot what article I read this in – but some doctor said something along the lines of what they called ‘pre-bunking’, meaning anticipating what type of false messaging might come out against the thing you’re trying to release. Almost pre-inoculate people to ‘here’s what it is, here’s what you might hear about this thing in the coming months or years, here’s what our answer to that is, and here is where we can ask more questions’. So then you set a tone with people who may be originally defensive, okay now I know what to look out for, and you give them little trigger warnings that may help. Now I don’t know if that’ll have worked with Covid, I’m sure there’s still going to be a subset of the population that believes a certain thing but I do always enjoy the concept of proactive communication.</p>
<p>Bringing it back to identity now, in terms of what we all can do better or what Government can do better, I think some of this pre-bunking of information of ‘what it is the country trying to do and what the country will not be doing’ because of ABC being privacy and consent and all these other principles that we just discussed to me you’re right, I think communication is a big part of it. The sooner the better in my opinion, but I’m that with all facets of life too so the more information the better, and give people a chance to understand it versus throwing it or making it seem it’s forced upon them.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I feel sometimes coming from the space, we’re so caught up on the standards and the tech and just the lingo that we use in our day-to-day lives that mean absolutely nothing to regular people, maybe focusing just on the end-user experience that you’re looking for perhaps is a better approach than talking about zero-knowledge proof or concepts that or even talking about what could go wrong in these programs is a good conversation to have. Just to say ‘this is what we think could go wrong and this is what we’re doing to combat that and I like your idea, the pre-bunking almost made me think of different open-source software projects. They’ll just do open calls to the dev communities every week, the type of thing that would be a nice thing to see with that approach of pre-bunking rather than just talking about how to scan a QR code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s right because I think a lot of us in the field can already anticipate the types of questions or the types of concerns that might arise. There is no rocket science and we can see from implementations across the globe that there are some pros and cons to a lot of different countries’ implementations but we know this already. We should do this proactively and go out there and talk to people about our beliefs in Canada, and why it’s different. There are going to be some similarities and there will be some differences,&nbsp; the social credit thing is not happening in this country. For me to say that is one thing, but for us to all prove it collectively and demonstrate openly why that won’t be the thing is the other, and that’s what I think we’re lacking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I wonder if we could draw parallels to the whole misinformation topic; it’s very difficult to establish what is more and more, so what is a fact versus what is an opinion and I think, our news channels have been bombarded with just opinionated things rather than facts. Different tech companies have taken it upon themselves to create a fact versus fiction thing and you’ll even see them start putting messages on their Tweets or on their podcasts or just to say, warning go check this other source if you want information about something. It feels at least in the information technology or the social media companies, there is perhaps a lack of I don’t know if regulation is the right word, or an oversight committee, or there’s a lack of governance where all of these siloed platforms are taking it upon themselves to say what’s true, what’s not true.</p>
<p>Is there a role for Government in there as well, and then is it a mix between Government and private sector?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I start to think about if that’s missing in the digital world today then what we’re talking about, of having these pre-bunking forums, it could be a similar type of impartial governance organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s a really interesting question, I think there’s certainly a role for Government to help set some expectations on what we want in our country and I think our country needs to get rid of misinformation as well. The challenge with having the Government involved in it though is that the mistrust is sometimes with Government, so if a Government entity, let’s say hypothetically, was created to debunk and demystify some of the things that are out there, I still think there is going to be that inherent mistrust with a subset of the population anyway. So, to fully answer your question, I do think there’s a role for all entities to play because there’s mistrust everywhere in general. Some people don’t trust their banks, some people don’t trust their Government, some people don’t trust whatever insert name of a corner store here and I think the more people that are in the conversation, the better it is. I don’t think it’s just one’s role, but I do think everyone plays a part in it. It wouldn’t be out of the realm of the possible to have some entity at least, even a non-profit for argument’s sake, come in there and start debunking some stuff.</p>
<p>But it will be collective and don’t forget that only a certain percentage of the population is on Twitter, is on Facebook is on whatever, so the number of mediums that need to be either regulated or overseen are exponential almost. It seems to be that way, that there’s a new platform for everything so I think we have to be careful about how broad we go and what the perception would be if Government were to step in and regulate or set some rules around what can be communicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now we start talking about free speech infringement and other things that go down a spiral as well so I think it’s a collective, rather than make it feel more ‘big brothery’ or even more perceived as ‘big brothery’ than it is now, to focus it more on a community conversation, including more people in the conversations as they happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] If I give a conspiracy, that’s the reason why a lot of this negative stuff is coming out in Digital Identity. </p>
<p>Is there are a lot of the big players that are influencing fake news and is that something you could buy into?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Oh, interesting! So what do you mean by some of the big identity players?&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Yeah identity players and big tech players that have silos, they manage a lot of identity data. Anyways is that something you could get behind?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir]&nbsp; I’m an optimist by nature man I think. I would also think everyone wants to do what’s best for, you know there’s a way for all these people who are currently managing these systems, to interoperate in a bigger ecosystem that will give them, and so from a capitalistic perspective, allow them to maintain whatever market share they have and now participate in something bigger. So I see more opportunity for them if there were to be an integrated ecosystem here versus the standalone business that they’re in now. If they were involved I’d say that’s pretty short-sighted because strategically if I were running these businesses, you’d want a bigger piece of the pie right, so I think the more participatory it can be, the more inclusion there is from these people that are in the field. The better it is for them, the better it is for us as citizens that we have a bit more direct knowledge of and access to and consent to the sharing of our information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] Switching gears a bit for anyone getting into the Digital Identity space, there’s a whole slew of standard bodies and different standards that get used and it’s just sometimes tough too, I guess it creates a barrier of understanding to certain people because there are so many different standards. They’re not always technically based on these standards, but there are so many different organizations, there are some that have support from different levels of Government and for example, seeing this a lot in European nation-states and also in the various provinces in Canada, where there is a big movement towards some of the W3C and Hyperledger standards,&nbsp; and obviously on the other side with the governance of the Pan Canadian Trust Framework being there as well. Then you also look at – just talking about Canada specifically- we have multiple levels of Government, say the federal, the provincial and the municipal, picking a non-international standard is not acceptable for a federal Government due to specific reasons.&nbsp; For example barring international trade, which you could get sued for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do we make it easier for people to understand all of the different standards that are out there, and why they’re important?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you could talk a bit about some of the leading ones which you think are mature enough and need to be better understood.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s a really good question, so I think we have to start maybe at the beginning of why we even need standards in the first place and think what the role of standards is and how deep standards need to go because I think there’s a certain sweet spot there. I think standards are meant to ensure number one, consistency, reliability and interoperability, that we’re all holding everyone at the same level, whether that be technology, or the electrical outlets in your wall. I mean there’s a certain safety requirement in these, some of these other things. So from an identity perspective, I think the challenge is that it’s still early days even though I said we work on it for a few decades, it’s early days in the sense that technology is now catching up with some of those preliminary conversations. Also, I feel – and I’m going to age myself here – that we’re in a beta VHS&nbsp; moment or Blackberry/ iPhone if I want to be a bit more recent or whatever the case may be, but this goes back historically. There’s always these moments in time where you – there’s a way we are going fork in the road type of thing – in identity I think the key part right now is to find the standards that give us that common baseline that allow those things I said for before. I just don’t honestly care about technology right now, I care about whatever technology that jurisdictions will use in Canada, and let’s be honest it’s going to be multiple. Will they work well together number one, and will they have the same level of security reliability and keep our information private etc.? So I think that’s the key level we have to get to in terms of analogies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My analogy in the payments industry is that I don’t care if I have an Amex or a Mastercard or a Visa in my wallet. The thing always works when I go to restaurants unless they don’t accept one of them. What I mean is that machines tend to accept all of them. I can tap a debit, and I can tap a credit as a user of it all. I don’t need to understand the ecosystems and I trust that there is a standard that they’re all following that keeps my data and me protected to the same degree. If we can draw from that analogy in identity, I think we need to be at the same level there. I think the example I give of the <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">Pan-Canadian Trust Framework</a> is perfect. Not on the standards front, but at least on the framework, principles and things that matter in the ecosystem. The <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/">CIO Strategy Council</a>’s Digital Trust and Identity standards as well is one of the ones that take it to that higher level, the principal level that’s in this country. Those are two that I’m well versed in for sure, just on past involvement. Then there are others in the technology side of things, W3C and others that are still evolving and I’m not saying any of those are perfect. The challenge we have right now is, do we wait for the standards to figure themselves out and we sit and do nothing, or do we experiment in a way right now where we’re seeing what works best with a willingness to pivot if something were to change downstream.</p>
<p>I think that’s the eternal debate that seems to live on in at least the public sector where it feels wasteful for sure to spend taxpayer dollars on experimentation that the principle seems backwards, but when you think about it, you need some of the experimentation to understand where you need to go next as well. I think we have to get past some of those humps, it does not have to be a 10-year 100 million dollar project, it could be a one or two-year pilot with a small investment and then a quick pivot at the end of a couple of years. I think it’s a mentality around it, where we may be waiting for perfection before starting anything but there is a danger too that our citizens aren’t getting any more patient and I don’t like the in-person stuff I want to go online and digital as fast as I can and I know the next generation is that as well, so it’s an interesting balancing act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think at the end of the day the most successful capital allocators in the world, in the capitalist world, and it’s easy to name some of them, but it’s just they’ve been able to best place their dollars or their money into a mix of R&amp;D and growth things so you always need to have this R&amp;D going on so it feels if you’re looking to grow the economy and the prosperity of a nation you need to have good placement into R&amp;D. You named a couple, <a href="https://diacc.ca/trust-framework/">PCTF</a> and <a href="https://ciostrategycouncil.com/">CIO Strategy Council</a>. I tend to look more at these from at least one version of the PCTF than from a federal perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why should a citizen care about the PCTF and the work that’s happening within the CIO Strategy Council?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] It’s a good question. Do citizens care about the fact that the security or whatever, the electrical alliance has approved my plugs in the wall? Probably not. I think what’s important for them to care about is that these conversations are happening. Some of those principles we talked about earlier and the fact that this is not a social credit system. Well, how do you prove it? Look at some of the stuff that we’re putting out there in publishing on consent and privacy principles being first and top of mind, I think these types of things they don’t have to read or memorize any of these frameworks. I think they just have to be aware that these conversations are happening and it’s not just as I said earlier ‘trust us we’re good’ it’s a no, show and tell, here’s what we’re doing and here’s what the principles are that’s what’s the important part of those discussions. Is my mom going to be a part of any of the consultations? Probably not, but I think it’s important for them just to know that they’re happening rather than just again, that hiding behind a veil of ‘believe me, we know that’s good for you’, which is where I think the mistrust stems from.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] What would you say, Canada is doing good or better, or where other countries could take learnings from versus the other side as well?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there certain areas in the world under Digital ID programs, it could be standards, could be anything that you think Canada could learn from or perhaps do better, so maybe both sides.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] It’s a good question, so when I&nbsp; was, when I spent some time in Government, we were part of what was called the Digital nations of countries, a series of European and Asian countries in there and South American as well. Just leaders in the digital space and the feedback we got when was they were impressed with the work we were doing on the framework-type things, on the standard-type things, on making sure that these principles were well thought out before we dove too deeply and the challenge with our country too – and I won’t sugar coat it – is that we, our Government system is more complex than some other companies. We are countries, we have three levels of Government, it’s a Westminster model. Accountabilities are different, there are some countries in this Digital nations group everything is centralized and there’s authority. I’m not saying Digital ID is easy, but it’s certainly easier when you have the data in one authority or one jurisdictional control versus what we have is a bit more federated and that’s not an excuse as to why we’re late. It’s just more considerations of what we have to come up with, so I think, to answer the first brother question, a lot of good feedback on our willingness to try to break down some of these jurisdictional boundaries with some of these cross-jurisdictional frameworks, and the willingness to interoperate in the country for sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The privacy respecting principles, the consent, the revocation of consent, all the things that we have been baking are well respected. I think the difference on the other side is that we are slower on implementation. Let’s just call a spade a spade, we have a couple of provinces that have got out to good head starts on the West there, and since then, I feel it’s a bit stagnant for the reasons we talked about, misinformation being one. Investment is another, if it’s important we dedicate the resources to it, if it’s not we don’t, and I feel we’re still on the fence as to how much investment this thing needs across the country. You know in terms of models to follow, the one I look to the most is the European Union itself and I bring them up because they have an interoperability challenge, they have whatever number of countries is in there that work together in an interoperable scheme that I guarantee you does not use the same technology in each country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can, if we can just take that model and just consider ourselves a mini well, union, in which we are provinces and territories, there’s no reason why we couldn’t do something similar. So I think there are a lot of good lessons to learn from those</p>
<p>implementations. Other countries are world-renowned for their regimes; Estonia I’m sure comes up a lot. Different circumstances led to why they had to come together after an incident back in 2007. Evolving from there and building it up from the ground up, I have done a fantastic job there and have set some really good principles for us to follow, including the notion of transparency by the way. So I think there’s a lot to learn from around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some mistakes have been made around the world as well, and we alluded to that earlier in terms of whether it be over a collection of biometric data or central storage of some of this biometric information that personally, as a cyber guy, makes me cringe. So I think learning the good and bad from around the world, there is no such thing as bad news. That’s a good approach, and I think it’s just a matter of balancing our willingness to innovate and drive a bit rather than getting stuck into a bit too much of the analysis paralysis at the beginning. That’s my assessment of where we’re at.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] There have been some brutal stories about biometrics and facial recognition that continue to happen as well and I think what’s scary about that is it’s one thing if our passwords get breached, we could just change our passwords and hopefully we could recoup our assets if our credit card number gets breached, you could cancel your card and there is a liability protection there, but you can’t change your biometric information, like your facial characteristics and I think it’s just a very touchy subject. What makes me uncomfortable, is that it’s hard to avoid them, you go into certain places, maybe not in your day-to-day but throughout life. The first time I was at an airport in the US and I was forced to do a facial scan and whatever, I felt a little uneasy about it. So I think this is one aspect that is used, authentication or security a lot of the time, but there are so many examples of frauds and data breaches and data being wrong here. That’s a bit of a tough area,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree and you talk about roles for the Government, there’s a role for Government right there which is to regulate how and when this information can be collected, used, stored etc. because that is a – I agree with you. We all know that pictures have been taken of us over the last number of years in various contexts whether it’s in a mall walking by or whatever, the airport or where the case may be and I think the lack of regulation or rules around what can be done with that information certainly one of the reasons why I’m not a big proponent of using biometrics as the ‘be all end all’. The issue is that the role of biometrics maybe needs to be discussed a bit in what role it plays like unlocking your phone for example, without storing the image as a one-time transaction. That’s one thing to store it and keep it for later and upload it to a number of different places for various usages, it’s another thing – and I certainly don’t have clarity when, where and how my biometrics are used in all these instances. So I agree with you, and think that is one of the areas that is going to be – there’s a lot of learning too that happens from around the world, either from breaches or whatever the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that goes back to our other comment there about information and how we can proactively communicate. The words facial verification and facial recognition are two very different things, and I think one-to-one or one-to-many are concepts that people openly talk about enough or fully understand. Even in our own space, how do we expect the average Canadian to understand that as well, so as part of what I said earlier about the pre-bunking, I feel this really a good topic to dive in on and explain what is, what could be used, for what you have to watch out for, what can still be done by other players in the country etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] It feels one of those that just people get impacted by the most because it’s just so personal, it’s not using a fingerprint to get onto my phone. It’s really my picture being taken, I have no clue what’s happening to it. A few years ago, we were working with a customer that was building a product aimed at folks in the firearms industry in the US, and you could imagine the type – not all – but there’s a big movement there, of just privacy, right, and these types of people whether they’re hunters or gun collectors. It was incredible to see the second that we did some user testing with facial verification software just the backlash that came from that. So it’s a bit of an interesting one. I think there’s been a lot of backlash even then, you said there’s been a lack of capital perhaps invested in some of the ID programs in Canada, but there are other areas in the world – the ID Me project in the US – there’s so much money that was thrown in there but then there was an incredible amount of backlash over their facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Absolutely and we’re not even touching – well that’s just the privacy concerns – we’re not even touching on some of the inclusion and diversity concerns that come along with some of these things as well, which I don’t want to downplay either. I think the challenge with the identity space – not in this country but around the world – is that you are dealing with the security and privacy information which obviously has to be inclusive and equitable for all to use. However, here we are creating almost a bunch of mini divides within a subject matter that has already divided enough. I think there are a whole bunch of anecdotes from around the world about darker skin colour, facial coverings or other things that would impact someone’s ability to use it. So I agree, that topic alone can be broken down into several different subtopics, all of which require going back to proactive messaging and good understanding around the world for sure.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think facial recognition technology has proven to have a lot of biases and therefore, it’s often wrong and it takes away from equal opportunities for people in here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s right, again going back to the word trust, all things that undermine trust and confidence in a system – and that’s what ultimately comes down to – if trust is undermined whether it be from information or lack thereof or whatever the case, or bias or whatever is the reason for it, you don’t get adoption. If you don’t get adoption, then what is this all for right? So we don’t just do this for the sake of doing this, it’s to provide a benefit and so for me, that adoption piece is really critical.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to get down to the nitty-gritty of what will prevent people from adopting, and how we can address that aspect of it because delivering it and having zero users, no one wins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I do think though, at the same time, the word trust is overused by a lot of technology solution providers, the trusted platform for this rather. I feel that the concept of trust is maybe misunderstood as well and self-claims about being trusted about something is maybe not going to help create trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Agreed, and that’s a really good point actually because you can’t just self-assess or self-attest your trusted worthiness. It has to be proven. Same in real life, I can’t just tell you I’m honest and just lie to you all the time, you build that over time so I think that the building of that trust is important and I think you’re right, the word is overused by people that claim to be and then as we find out later, are not. Going back to the standards conversation, having standards to help attest to that trust or having third parties verify that trust, are all things that help build that confidence in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] The usage of zero trust is an abused term nowadays as well, and for yourself, the cybersecurity expert, I’m sure you see it getting abused as well.</p>
<p>What are some misconceptions about zero trust, or how does it get overused wrongly?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I want to be honest, I love the concept of zero trust. It’s really great, I think the word or the title is the worst title because it’s so negative. There are so many negative connotations from zero trust again, almost makes you think well, I should trust no one and it makes you think you don’t trust your users or you don’t trust this and that. I meant that’s the fundamental principle it’s based on, but not the right message to send. It’s that we want to make sure that you’re doing what you should be doing and nothing more, nothing less. Number one, I wish there was a more positive spin on the name but it starts with the principle itself. Let’s be honest, it’s nothing new, it’s applying the oldest principle; security is the principle of least privilege. You get access to the things you should have access to, nothing more, nothing less. That’s in the CISSP book item, number one. This is the first principle you learn. Now what we’ve done over time is different buzzwords and different implementations and network access control with NAQ was a big thing when I was coming up the ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just an evolution of that, now it’s more based on knowing who you are making, knowing what identity or sorry, what device you’re coming from and having the right access and monitoring. There are a lot of things that came with it, so the principle I think is sound. I think some of the misconceptions around it, is that it isn’t something you just buy and implement and be done with. It’s not a product and you may see some product labels out there that say zero trust on it. To me, it’s more of a philosophy that’s how I would characterize it. It’s a philosophy, an operating model or whatever you want to call it, but have this principle that we want to make sure the right people have the right access to the right data, at the right time. Then the technology enables that so I think that people trying to treat it as a project or something you can buy, that’s not what it is, it’s something you have to buy into and then work towards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the second part of that is it sounds – and this is typical security stuff – as if we make it sound so shiny like it’s a silver bullet that is going to solve all the problems but that makes it sound really hard and expensive and enterprise and multi-year. I wish that was all gone as well because I don’t think it needs to be as complicated as we make it to be. I think yes, it’s a multi-year program but there are incremental things you can do to step towards it as well. You could start with individual identity, you could start with MFA, you could start with device. I think you can move very slowly as you go along the chain here characterizing it as the giant behemoth that some people do, does it a disservice as well. It makes it sound more intimidating. Or whatever the case may be. Those are a couple of things that came to mind other than the term itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing I’ve heard is that this can just be more secure and it’s going to be harder for me as a user. Personally, I actually think it’s going to be easier as a user to know that I am ‘going to be bothered’ I use air quotes here sorry for those who can’t see, ‘by additional authentication prompts all the time’. The truth is you’ll be bothered when you need to be, when the risk level is nil, you won’t be bothered by all the stuff you’re being bothered with right now. Our problem with security right now is we have this very one-size-fits-all approach to identity; this your thing and if you’re enabling MFA it’s for all, if you’re making something it’s for everything and all things. Data doesn’t work that way, data works in a way that some stuff is open, some stuff is not, and some stuff is classified. I think identity rules need to be commensurate with the type of data you’re accessing now that the data resides in multiple locations like cloud, on prem or other. A data-centric approach to accessing the data is much more productive than a network-centric approach to it. I think it’s more in the way you look at the field versus what I think gets sold. Sometimes it’s the word gets overused and this is typical industry behaviour to be honest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I was at a large cyber security conference in France a few weeks ago and it’s just incredible the number of companies that are providing zero trust or cyber security solutions. The industry is growing like crazy, there’s a lot of money to be made in cybersecurity with these technology solution providers. I wonder at a certain point if it’s just without fundamentally changing the architecture, and you alluded to data-driven rather than network-driven, but if you’re just trying to add more and more solutions on top of bad architecture, how much better is it actually going to get? So when we talk about self-sovereign identity, we talk about it from more of a data-driven approach. For me, the fact that your data resides with you is zero trust. Really, I have control over what I’m doing with it there’s nothing without my knowledge that is happening with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think categorizing the self-sovereign architecture as zero trust is the right categorization?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] Interesting, I never thought of it that way. I wouldn’t characterize anything as zero trust, to be honest with you, but I do think ‘zero trust enabled’ or ‘enabling a zero trust experience’ or something along those lines, where it’s a part of a bigger series of components that lead to that zero trust ecosystem. So if we all did a better job of saying what our role is in the zero-trust paradigm, that might make it resonate a bit better. The more we go on the lens of this thing that is zero trust part, the more we drive that problem of over-extending the word. What it is, is rather a philosophy or philosophical view that I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] You also mentioned they are often big implementations but you could have logical steps or milestones you’re hitting throughout this process. We could be talking about the public or private sector here, but in any Digital ID conversation it seems there’s way too much conversation around the technical track and it differs, I guess, between the public and private sector and how you would go about it. Maybe you could discuss that a little bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q1: What are some of the different tracks that you need to get in place to ensure that all of these principles that we’re talking about, and ensuring that we’re doing this the right way to not impact privacy?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q2: And if these other principles are being done correctly, what are some of these different tracks beyond the technical track that need to simultaneously run in either the public or private or both?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] &nbsp;I would over-simplify my answer here to people, process, and technology. I think all three are equally important, but you’re right in that you can have the best tech in the world but if your process, your entry and exit process in your organization is garbage and your identities stay enabled for x number of years after someone leaves, then your technology is useless because the process is the weakest link in that chain. Similarly, if your people aren’t trained properly on how to conduct and implement some of the processes that I just mentioned, you’re in the same boat as well so I always look at these things as a triangle of all three that need to work together for any technology implementation to work properly. To me, that is the bigger risk, the technology pieces. The vendors will tell you, there are a lot of people that will sell you something tomorrow that’ll enable zero trust, but all of it is useless unless those other two legs of the stool so to speak that are adequately addressed as well. That’s my bigger concern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I say start incrementally, it has nothing to do with technology to be honest with you. It’s more about ‘let’s figure out just what is your current lay of the land’&nbsp; even if you had the best tech in the world, would it do what you want?&nbsp; Are you making sure that people have the right and how do you assign access today, how do you track when people are leaving or arriving or changing groups?&nbsp; The longer you stay in an organization, the more rights you accumulate, that’s just the nature of the beast. How are you making sure that doesn’t happen before you start diving into some of the technological concerns? I’m a technology guy and what I hate the most about technology is that it’s always sold as the thing that solves all the problems when really it’s – and I’m going to generalize here and I hate generalizing – but it’s almost the easiest part all the time because you can buy the thing and implement the thing, the other things that the people the change management and the procedural updating, the business process transformation stuff that’s the sticky stuff that usually creates havoc in the technology implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] So I guess going into a Government and trying to build a Digital Identity strategy you’re looking at the legislation track and you’re looking at a regulatory track. These things are significantly more important to any of these programs being successful and significantly more important than the technology side of things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where is the current state of things? Maybe we could use provincial Governments in Canada as an example with legislation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think they’re all on different playing fields, but what are some of the conversations that are being had about these processes and the people?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I think there are a few provincial ones, and again, going back to our Westminster model of Government, we have some federal ones. In fact, I think it was just last week if I’m not mistaken, some announcements around bill C-27 that include some more privacy implications in there as well.&nbsp; I don’t want to profess to be an expert at it, I just saw the news release but I know that the feds are working on things that will enhance at least some of our outdated national legislation that hasn’t been touched in several years. I know some of the problems have done some work, with Quebec being the most recent with what is it, bill 64 I believe, that is more in line with I think what we’re seeing with let’s call it the ‘godfather of legislation and privacy’ of the GDPR in Europe. The challenge I think we’ll see in our country is that we have provinces and federal Governments on different timelines, different maybe levels of ambition on some of these bills. So we may inherently be creating some disparity amongst – and it sucks on the vendor side of things – where you now have four five six different pieces with different requirements that you have to align to, and what ends up happening here for being honest, is we just align to the highest watermark because we know if it hits the high water mark it’s good enough for everyone else.</p>
<p>I think the landscape right now is just that, it’s finding out what the ambition is from each of these different jurisdictions and if arguably – I’m going to make this up here – but the bill 64 to Quebec is the higher watermark we work toward and we know that we’re going to be good for the rest of the country as well. On the federal side, we do have to respect the jurisdictional boundaries and what the mandates of the federal Government is and provincial and such, but I do think what the federal legislation can do is set at least a low – not a low bar but a baseline – it’s a better way to say a baseline level, for what we need to expect from all implementations from privacy and security.</p>
<p>I saw I think bill C-27 also includes algorithmic bias if I’m not mistaken, but these very important things that need to be addressed just to keep those conversations going I think. The other thing historically is, legislation is not easy, you don’t just change that overnight this stuff takes time as well and it’s really important that we&nbsp; – and it’s easier said than done i will say – that it’s future-proof, that it’s not as prescriptive that locks us into something that doesn’t work in five years time it needs to be more</p>
<p>principle-based and future-proof so that as technology evolves rapidly we’re not shooting ourselves in the foot and preventing something else from happening. That’s the challenge in being a regulator and legislator, they know it full well but I think the right minds are thinking about it certainly and we just have to make sure that we drive up collective consistency across the country.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] To comment about shooting yourself in the foot. I feel often there is a trend where it’s easier to pass regulations than to remove regulations and so you pass regulations and that at a certain point you’re starting to create so much red tape all over the place because it’s tough to navigate and actually innovate and create value because there’s so much in there. So it’s a tricky balancing act to for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] There was a funny anecdote when I was in the Government and I&nbsp; misquoted – so don’t don’t take this exactly – but it was something along the lines of the number of times the word facts is mentioned in legislation. When the thing was written sure it made sense to fax things, but in 2022 I don’t know when the last time I saw a fax machine or if the people that are younger than me will even know what a fax machine is. That type of codification is what you have to avoid because it then limits you down the road. I think finding out the right principles you want to follow, the outcomes you want to generate and the behaviours you want to influence or encourage is what the legislation needs to set out to do and nothing more, to allow&nbsp; innovation to happen within those guard rails.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] If I could use another trifecta or triangle, I think one of the challenges is how do you prioritize privacy control but then also convenience. That’s something that you don’t want to get in the way of convenience or innovation in legislation either but it’s tricky. This is why it’s interesting to look at some of the programs that are happening elsewhere in the world to see where the learnings or where the good learnings and bad learnings could come from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] With any legislation comes, and with any honesty statement, comes unintended consequences as well and that reaction you mentioned earlier that we do have to become – and I hate this word – but more agile when it comes to legislative reform and that we cannot wait 20 years if we see something that’s going well, so there is an opportunity to nip these things in the bud sooner than later and I think that there needs to be a stance our regulators take as well and being willing to pivot when the pivot happens. Technology moves way too quickly for us to modernize these things and as regularly as we want to. Just leaving that room to pivot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I think is equally important and one of my – as I was preparing for this, one of the things I felt we could probably do better as a community is lower the use of buzzwords such as agile and zero trust and all these things just make me laugh.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] That’s true that’s why I prefaced it with I hate this word but I get you.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] When we talk about that we’re spending a lot of time designing these programs and making sure that it’s not impacting the freedoms and rights of citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are some things that we’re ensuring or that we’re doing and or not putting into place that citizens perhaps should know so that they don’t feel they’re getting pushed into something that they necessarily don’t want to do?</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] I think the word mandatory comes up a lot and we heard it with vaccines when things get mandatory people get a little antsy about it and the one thing I can say with 100 certainty in Canada and Digital Identity, is that it will not be mandatory in the sense that you will have options. We are not in a position where we’re trying – and again – to debunk some of the myths around tracking or whatever.</p>
<p>This is about empowering citizens, so if you want to use it, if you want better, faster and more secure, easier and more efficient access to services you are welcome to use it. If you wish to go wait in line for an hour at Service Canada or wherever the case is, fill your boots.&nbsp;It’s the same as the banking industry, I think my parents still do telephone banking. All the more power to them. Personally, I do not want to do telephone banking, I’m more than happy to do it from the comfort of my desktop or phone, but I appreciate the optionality. That I think is a really good principle in all walks of life to be honest with you. Specifically, in Digital Identity, this is for options and this is to empower you, and if you don’t feel empowered by it, don’t use it. To me, what I think will eventually happen – just my own opinion – is that it will be eventually framed in a way just as credit cards were, as other things that have evolved from paper to plastic to online and have been in that when your life becomes easier, when you feel more in control when you feel you have the transparency you need to trust it you will use it. That’s human behavior, is to circumvent inefficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now a lot of our inefficiency is based on us waiting in line and Covid certainly spoiled me, to try to avoid human contact. It sounds really bad, I mean human contact waiting in lines. I want things delivered to me for the rest of my life and delivered to me when I want it. I get a movie when I want it, get my food when I want it, get my Uber when I want. I do think services will go down that route but in the way that people want them to be delivered. Freedom is really important to maintain so that people have peace of mind and they can go at their own pace because when they do, I just find there’s a lot more comfort and acceptance and willingness to want to adopt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing that I want to add as well, this goes back to the principle of inclusion, is that whatever is built or will be built in this country has to be inclusive, not just gender or race or anything else but I mean inclusive in general. We have a digital divide in the country as it is, we take internet access for granted and we still don’t have drinking water for our entire country much less internet access. So I think, we have some foundational infrastructure type of things that we need to address as a nation to make sure that everyone feels included. The last thing I want is for the haves to have Digital Identity for example and the have-nots to feel more have-nots and then creating a bigger divide. For me, a successful Digital Identity implementation allows some of the more underprivileged or underrepresented groups to get better, faster and more efficient access to things they may not have had before. Maybe they can apply for a job faster, maybe they can get a loan faster or a rental property and without maybe being subject to as much discrimination. I think those principles of optionality and inclusion are non-negotiable in any sort of implementation in this country.</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] That’s a tremendous point and even just yesterday, I saw – and we’re recording this on June 30th 2022 – so just yesterday on the 29th, I saw an article come out on CBC Saskatchewan, where the Saskatchewan privacy commissioner was calling out for the development of an optional Digital ID. I think the word option and optionality has now been inserted into the conversation and I think that is something that needs to be in there because it is not being pushed on people, it’s being put into place to make people’s lives better with all of these privacy-preserving principles that we’ve been talking about. However, if you don’t want to use it, then don’t use it. If I want to keep receiving my statements in the mail for my credit card I could still do it.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] You bet and I think that’s a very Canadian principle as well and that’s one where I think going back to the other question about what other countries are in respect to where we’re going, I think that’s a big one as well, and I think we do that part right. It will be one of those things that will gather a snowball moment over time, and that’s okay that none of this stuff happens overnight. I have no problem if we start off with hypothetically age verification, and nothing more. That will be great and then for those of us who are still fortunate to get carted at the liquor store, you go and do your age verification and you don’t have to show your piece of plastic that has your name and your address and your height and your weight and whether you wear glasses and all these other attributes that drive me nuts that we share so freely</p>
<p>right now because that is the way our ecosystem is built. So starting off with something small, or a small win, and just getting a little bit of adoption I think is the right way to go and again keeping that principle of optionality so you can come on board when you want to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mathieu Glaude] I also think just focusing on those interactions that you’ve described;&nbsp; if you’re purchasing alcohol at a liquor store, just talking about that interaction rather than talking about credentials and security, it’s an easier place to start and it’s where the value for people is. When they need to prove something about themselves, that is an endpoint right there. Where there’s someone that needs to verify or there’s a reliant party. Just focusing on what that improved experience is going to look like is a better way to start, than trying to explain Digital Identity or credentials to people.</p>
<p>[Imraan Bashir] &nbsp;Agreed. I think it’s that old-fashioned what’s in it for me’ message and if you explain what’s in it for them, if it’s more convenient for them they’ll use it. If it’s not, they won’t. Humans are very straightforward creatures that way and I never thought I’d see the day where my parents are using smartphones and using their fingerprints or whatever to log in but what it came down to is, would you rather type a complex&nbsp; password with your thumbs or would you like to use your fingerprint which will work and gets to the thing faster? And I think you’re right, is explaining what’s in it for them is a great way to start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital world we are surrounded by identifiers around us — our email id, phone number, twitter handle, youtube handle etc. These are the identifiers we “rent” from the parties providing the services rather than “own”. This debate on where the ownership of identifiers lies is where decentralized identifiers come in&nbsp;picture.</p> What is a Decentralized Identifier? <p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are created, owned, and controlled by the same entity, giving individuals more control over their identity and businesses more control over their data. This ownership of the DID can be proved using cryptography. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs allow entities to control the privacy of their information, including minimal, selective, and progressive disclosure of attributes or other&nbsp;data.</a></p><p>Decentralized Identifiers have 4 properties that make them indispensable:</p>  It is a persistent identifier — You can keep it as long as you need&nbsp;it  It is resolvable — You can look it up to discover&nbsp;metadata  It is cryptographically verifiable — You can prove control over it using cryptography  It is decentralized — No centralized registry or organization controls&nbsp;it   Decentralized vs. Centralized Identifiers <p>The truth is, depending on the situation you might not care if an identifier is decentralized!</p><p><a href="https://www.gs1us.org/upcs-barcodes-prefixes/how-to-get-a-upc-barcode/get-upc-barcodes">GS1 provides a valuable service managing and distributing barcodes for products</a>. Barcodes are all the same type of centralized identifier, which makes them easy to understand and use broadly. It’s not a problem if a barcode on a loaf of bread is a centralized identifier.</p><p>The problem with centralized identifiers is that they offer little privacy or control, which matters for both personal information and business information that needs to be authentic and traceable.</p> Centralized identifiers:   Rely on a single body to validate your information. If Google goes bankrupt or stops working, I lose access to every website where I validate my identity using my Google username and password.  Needlessly expose information. When I use my driver’s license to verify my age, I don’t need the verifier to also know my height or&nbsp;address.  <p>As we think of scenarios to evaluate the need for centralized identifiers vs. decentralized identifiers we must ask ourselves these questions:</p>  How much control do we want on the digital life of the person and thing to which an identifier is&nbsp;given?  What privacy trade-offs are we ready to&nbsp;make?  How much security is good enough for the situation in consideration?  How is this related to the identity of the person or thing to which an identifier is&nbsp;given?   Benefits of Decentralized Identifiers <p>By gaining the ownership of the identifiers that we control and own, we&nbsp;can:</p>  Create persistent communication across informational transactions in a human readable&nbsp;format.  Prove ownership on assets and exercise the power to authorize or delegate actions to other parties in a verifiable manner.  Digitally sign transactions or documents rooted in a trusted data source, with an identity you&nbsp;control.  Port the identity from one service to&nbsp;another.  <p>As we build the new trust layer of the internet, I strongly believe that the choice of who controls the identity should be with the individual or the organization in focus rather than in the hands of platforms and services that are today playing the role of the Identity Issuers or Identity Verifiers. Decentralized Identifiers are a critical piece in enabling this&nbsp;vision.</p> DIDs in Supply&nbsp;Chain <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#abstract">Transmute team is proud to be one of the editors of the Editor and Author of the Decentralized Identifiers 1.0 standard at&nbsp;W3C.</a></p><p>We have been working with large enterprises and regulators, especially<a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/ace/whats-new-innovation"> US DHS-CBP to enable transparency and authenticity in cross border trade and supply chain logistics</a> transactions through the use of <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-tech-101-verifiable-credentials-use-cryptography-to-secure-digitization-5bfc74cf0a1b">Verifiable Credentials</a> and Decentralized Identifiers.</p><p>The advantage of DIDs in supply chain comes into focus with questions regarding supply chain transparency and visibility, especially when many commodities are created from a wide array of raw materials, components, and parts. What is the origin of each of the multiple components in a single good, such as a cell phone? Who manufactured them? Who assembled them? DIDs can answer these questions authentically when multiple controllers inherit control over the DID throughout the supply chain. If DIDs are assigned to individual parts, and actors along the supply chain gain control over these identifiers, an aggregate picture of who created what can be constructed.</p><p>Assigning DIDs to commodities and each individual component within finished goods would provide unprecedented visibility into how things are made, allowing key stakeholders and end-users confidence to assert and assess the quality, origins, and marketing truthfulness of goods. Imagine being able to resolve a DID for a diamond in a ring and seeing exactly where the diamond was mined and if it was ethically sourced.</p><p>Sapan Narang, Director of Product, pushes the boundaries of what is possible with a rich blend of experiences across industries and a deep understanding of exponential technologies.

				<p>The convenience, optionality and accessibility that fintech brought to money is happening to the archaic, paper-based world of personal identity. Identity today is where financial services were 15 years ago—and, therefore, represents one of the largest opportunities of this generation.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Like fintech before it, IDtech is making brand new product experiences possible for the first time. And building IDtech products is easier now than it’s ever been. The surge of IDtech products being developed will bring the identity and finance ecosystems back into sync and lead to scores of incredible new startups. Finally, IDtech will enable any company to become an identity company by layering identity capabilities into existing products.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As our lives become increasingly digital, bringing identity off of paper and into the 21st century is important—but it’s critical it’s done in the right way: by using user-centric, portable, private and interoperable technology. The future of digital identity will be driven by the growth of IDtech products.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Intro to IDtech: How Decentralized Identity Will Be Adopted 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/intro-to-idtech-how-decentralized-identity-will-be-adopted-2a3fb9abf6bb">Link to the article on Medium</a><br><br>The second piece examines four potential paths that identity technology could take to be adopted and settles on what we believe to be the most viable: innovators building great products.<br><br>Here are some highlights from this post:</p>

				<p>If decentralized identity technologies are developed without achieving widespread end-user adoption, did it actually accomplish anything?</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The way to achieve adoption is simple (albeit challenging to execute): the key is&nbsp;lots of well-executing teams building useful products. “IDtech” is a term to talk about that very thing.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While well-intentioned, all the academic analysis, decentralized governance, value chain mapping, or market sizing in the world won’t get us any closer to SSI adoption. Solid product work is what will get us there—researching low-friction UIs, building sustainable business models, baking interoperability in, and iterating quickly are all examples of good product work. And this needs to be done by lots of people in lots of industries and lots of use cases. 1,000 nimble teams taking products to market will teach us so much more than 10 “queen bee” companies ever would.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>IDtech is the name we’ve begun using to describe the organization-driven, bottom-up adoption motion. It gives us a term to describe&nbsp;products&nbsp;instead of philosophies, initiatives, concepts, or technologies. If a fintech product helps you manage your money, an IDtech product helps you manage your identity and data.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Self-sovereign identity will be adopted as thousands of innovators launch IDtech products that solve real problems for users.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Has SSI’s Identity Problem Been Solved? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p><a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/has-ssis-identity-problem-been-solved-2d33490315ae">Link to the article on Medium</a><br><br>The third piece clarifies how all of these terms relate, and when to use terms like SSI, Web5, IDtech, Reusable Identity, and Authentic Data.<br><br>Here is a summary of quotes from the post:</p>

					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>SSI stands for “self-sovereign identity” — a new kind of standardized, user-controlled digital identity. But a host of other terms are used to describe the same thing — like “decentralized identity” and “self-managed identity,” and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rileyparkerhughes_a-year-ago-i-wrote-a-blog-post-link-in-activity-6864046138027331584-i5rE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">none have emerged victorious</a>. </p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>IDtech refers to&nbsp;products that empower users to take control of their identity, share their data safely, and more securely access the things they need.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Web5 is a new term — but much has been said about it already. On the&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/projects/web5/">homepage</a> of TBD, they describe it as “an extra decentralized web that puts you in control of your data and identity.”</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Reusable identity refers to people holding “interoperable identity credentials” (<a href="https://liminal.co/reports/market-opportunity-for-reusable-identity/">source</a>) that are broadly accepted and authenticate-able in real time, reducing the need to re-verify people and resulting in easier-to-access and lower-cost services.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Authentic or Verifiable Data: SSI produces data that is&nbsp;authentic (meaning “of undisputed origin; genuine”) which is slightly more accurate than&nbsp;verifiable (meaning “able to be checked or demonstrated to be true, accurate, or justified”).</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Our goal at Trinsic is to make the world more accessible by empowering teams to build amazing identity products. IDtech is the term to describe the product/application layer that is emerging on top of the concepts, technologies, and paradigms we’ve spoken about herein.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When talking about the technology or architecture of a product, I’ll continue to use web5, web3, or web2 as shorthand,&nbsp;despite not loving the “webX” framing. And I’ll use reusable identity, decentralized identity, and self-sovereign identity as high-level terms to describe the ideology driving the change in the identity market, depending on the audience I’m speaking to. And when I’m talking about the end result, or the component parts of an IDtech solution, particularly for relying parties, I’ll speak to authentic/verifiable data.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>As I’ve stated before, IDtech is the new Fintech. And the winning IDtech products over the next decade will be ones built using the principles of self sovereignty and reusability.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>In October 2022, Simon Wood, CEO of Ubisecure, presented our vision for the future of digital identity at the Houlihan Lokey Tech Leadership Summit in New York. The vision, in short:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The future of digital identity: the ability to combine strongly authenticated individual identities with highly assured organisational identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have to represent them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Simon talked about a world where individuals have complete control over personal data and can easily prove their identity to access services and products and critically, be able to digitally represent their organisations.</p>
<p>This post covers the key points covered in the presentation, and explains how Ubisecure’s recent years of experience as the leader in LEI (Legal Entity Identifier) issuance has set the stage for our future vision.</p>
<p>The vision is broken down into three key points.</p>
<p>1. We must ensure that individuals are authenticated in a secure manner and that their identities are protected from identity fraud.</p>
<p>2. We also need highly assured organisation identity. It is essential to know that the claims made regarding the organisation are valid.</p>
<p>3. We can then join both identity types, to enable users to express who they are, who they represent, and the rights they have when representing their respective organisations. Conversely, organisations can challenge and verify these claims.</p>
<p>For any vision to have a valuable future there has to be a strong return associated with it. The value of this vision has already been proven, albeit at a local, not global level.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ubisecure previously deployed an identity management platform with multi-tier delegation capabilities to the Finnish government. The platform linked individual and organisation identities, allowing individuals to represent their organisations, or delegate that representation to other individuals or other organisations. Public stats show that just over 400,000 organisations were using the platform across 104 different online government services. One of those services was the tax office in Finland, and that tax office was able to show a 99% cost reduction through moving to online service versus having physical points of presence.</p>
<p>Simon explained at the event: “The move to online for the tax office was enabled through the ability for individuals to express who they were, who they represent, and the rights that they had when representing them. Coupled with that, the ability to delegate those rights through a chain, that’s where that value came from. That’s why we see this future vision of digital identity in combining that individual and organisation capability as a highly valuable place to be, to create massive efficiencies and reduce fraud.”</p>
<p>Now, the Finnish example is something that’s already happened. So how does this represent the vision? The limitation with the Finnish solution is that it’s delivered in a closed ecosystem. The strongly authenticated individuals are derived from the Finnish national ID, be that through bank ID or mobile ID. The organisation identity is coming directly from the business registry in Finland, essentially creating the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/state-of-identity-trusting-individuals-digital-right/" title="trust anchor">trust anchor</a>. To scale this concept beyond Finland, we need to establish an open system that utilises global identities.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’re now at a point in Ubisecure’s evolution where we can take our unique combination of capabilities and enable this solution to scale globally. How do we do that? Let’s map back to that vision:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The vision requires globally available, strongly authenticated identities. Fortunately, we’re now at a point in time where reusable identities are prevalent. There are dozens of digital identity schemes throughout Europe, ranging from Government identities to mobile IDs. Where such frameworks do not exist, there are mature real-time identity proofing solutions that bring inclusivity to the growing digital identity ecosystem. We also seeing the rise of “networks of networks” like the European eIDAS 2.0 and on a global scale, schemes like GAIN.</p>
<p>The Ubisecure CIAM platform supports all identity protocols. Our broad capabilities allow us to support “the old, the new, and the strange” both in terms of protocols and applications. Over many years focusing on Europe we have been enabling organisations to connect reusable identities to applications, especially in the Nordics, arguably the most advanced digital identity ecosystem in the world.</p>
<p>Next, the vision requires globally available, highly assured organisation identities. Again, we’re at a point in time where such identities now exist, thanks to the G20 and the Global LEI Foundation launching the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/knowledge-base/what-is-an-lei-code/">Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)</a>. The LEI is the only global, standardised and open-access organisation identifier available.</p>
<p>Because organisation identity is so important to our vision, Ubisecure undertook the accreditation to become an approved LEI Issuer back in 2018. We launched RapidLEI as an LEI issuance service, built from the ground-up on a technology platform focused around automation, ease of use, and data accuracy. We also built a global partner network of Registration Agents and Validation Agents, including several of the world’s largest banks, to make registering LEIs more accessible for legal entities of all sizes and in all regions. As a result we are now the <a href="https://rapidlei.com/stats/">world’s number one issuer of LEIs</a>.</p>
<p>Our leadership position gives us ready access to globally available, highly assured organisation identities.</p>
<p>The broad support for both individual and organisation identity now enables the Ubisecure unique value proposition with a combination of CIAM and LEI that’s delivered without border limits, globally.</p>
<p>This brings us full circle and we come back to the opening part of our vision. We take the front-end identity provisioning from our LEI services, where we can ensure the availability of highly assured open access organisation identities. And the back-end identity management capabilities of the CIAM platform to allow us to understand, connect and mediate strongly authenticated individuals.</p>
<p>As those components come together, we deliver a high value Identity &amp; Access Management service, delivering the ability to express who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have in representing them.</p>
<p>If you are planning to utilise IAM to deliver real business value to your organisation, do <a title="get in touch">get in touch</a>. We’ll be happy to discuss whether Ubisecure is a good solution for your current and future projects.</p>

				  The primary function of a government is to provide services that an individual could not easily provide for themselves; these services typically include infrastructure, safety (firefighters / military / police force), and the focal point of this article, identity.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Trust is important. I don’t think that will come as a shock to anyone. What might be surprising is how many opportunities there are in a day, or even a single interaction, to break that trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Picture yourself purchasing an age-restricted item at a shop, a multiple-step process that, typically, involves you handing over your ID to prove you are of legal age to purchase the item. The vendor has to trust that you are the legitimate owner of the ID and that the ID itself is not fraudulent. You, as the consumer, have to trust that the vendor is properly licensed and able to sell you the item and that what is inside is the item on the label and safe to consume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This interaction is one that many of us take for granted, particularly in higher income countries where regulations are in place governing these types of transactions. But this is by no means easy or inexpensive for governments to accomplish. As recently as 2017, the World Health Organization reported that as many as <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified">one-in-10 medical products in developing countries is substandard or falsified.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The problems Governments are turning to Decentralized Identity to solve&nbsp;</p>
<p>As many aspects of our lives have become more digital, services have moved online, which has created many opportunities to fake identity. According to identitytheft.org, <a href="https://identitytheft.org/statistics/#:~:text=There%20is%20an%20Identity%20Theft%20Case%20Every%2022%20Seconds&amp;text=Experts%20believe%20that%20these%20cases,a%20bigger%20issue%20for%20Americans.">identity fraud has increased over the past two years by 70%.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that the internet evolved without a verification layer for people, and the way we manage identity verification online makes it easy for information to be faked or “phished.” The need to verify who you are online and who you are interacting with is driving governments to look at verifiable credential and digital wallet technology. These verifiable credentials would replace paper documents that people are already using, such as a government-issued driver’s license or passport, with a couple key factors that make them more appealing than their paper counterparts.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are privacy preserving by design and cryptographically secure. Privacy- preserving means that with a verifiable credential driver’s license you would be able to choose to share only a portion of the data stored on the credential — such as sharing just your age or name without sharing your driver’s license number, address, or any other personal details you would rather keep to yourself. Being cryptographically secure refers to verifiable credentials being nearly impossible to fake, with the verifiers being able to automatically check every document.</p>
<p>Let’s return to our example of purchasing an age-restricted item. With a customer presenting a verifiable credential to prove their age, the store owner would have the assurance that the credential has been issued by a recognized authority, hasn’t been tampered with, and belongs only to the bearer. All of these are instantly verifiable — and in ways that protect the customer’s privacy. Similarly, the item being purchased can be verified with a credential showing its proof of origin and its journey across a supply chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving Factors<br>Change on this scale takes a great deal of coordination, time, and money; so, it is important to be clear about the benefits from switching to decentralized identity solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Library of Congress, as of 2018 “<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USPTO-Counterfeit.pdf">counterfeiting is the largest criminal enterprise in the world</a>, with domestic and international sales of counterfeit and pirated goods totaling between an estimated $1.7 trillion and $4.5 trillion a year — a higher amount than either drugs or human trafficking.” By implementing verifiable credentials, governments can reduce the presence of counterfeit goods in the marketplace. This will do two things: One, keep the public safer as counterfeit goods can <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bootleg-alcohol-poisoning-deaths-istanbul-turkey/#:~:text=Deaths%20from%20illegally%20brewed%20alcohol,separate%20incidents%20in%20India%27s%20northeast.">lead to sickness or death</a>; and two, improve tax collection, as with fewer illicit products being an option governments can start to claw back some of that $1.7 to $4.5 trillion as customers return to the legitimate market place to spend their money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials are scalable. Unlike your passport or driver’s license, which is renewed at fixed intervals, a verifiable credential can be updated whenever more data or an additional service needs to be added. An example of this is the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">Aruba Travel Credential</a>, which was implemented to give travelers an easy way to prove their health status to the government so they could travel to the island in the height of the pandemic. The credential could be quickly updated to account for changes in testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity blockchains are sustainable. As <a href="https://indicio.tech/identity-blockchains-and-energy-consumption/">Indicio has noted</a>, blockchains for identity are different to those for cryptocurrencies. Identity blockchains use signatures rather than mathematical computations to generate proof, and as a consequence use only a fraction of the energy that is associated with cryptocurrencies. To put it in perspective, one write to the ledger can be the basis for millions of identity credentials and it requires no more energy than browsing a web page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments are already leading the way on verifiable credentials. British Columbia is working on providing digital identities for its citizens through the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-trust/">BC Digital Trust</a> initiative and, as previously mentioned, Aruba has been <a href="https://www.noticiacla.com/news/26573">hard at work</a> implementing new ways to make it easier for travelers to visit their island, including passing legislation to require more adoption and acceptance among businesses and spearheading efforts to adapt the credentials for more uses in traveling — getting through security at the airport, checking into your hotel, proving your health status to local businesses, etc.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about how some governments are currently putting this technology to use we encourage you to attend the upcoming <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/290011345/">Indicio Meetup</a> on December 13.</p>

<p>Welcome to another exciting edition of Veriscope Weekly Regulatory Recap. This week, we are covering the Veriscope IVMS Validator launch, Hong Kong and Kazakhstan’s new crypto-focused regulations, the EU’s decision to scrutinize crypto transactions worth over 1000 Euros, and India’s Financial Intelligence Unit red-flagged almost 3,300 accounts for suspected illegal activities through virtual assets. So, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Shyft Veriscope has launched its open-source IVMS Validator <p>With cryptocurrencies entering the mainstream, more and more countries have begun enforcing the FATF Travel Rule within their jurisdictions. As a result, Virtual Asset Service Providers are being left with no choice but to comply with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>However, amid an increasing number of crypto transactions, VASPs are finding themselves in a lurch, as they do not have any way to confirm if the files they are sharing are correct or not, as per the IVMS101 standards.</p><p>Realizing the growing demand for such a solution, Shyft Network has recently launched Shyft IVMS Validator, enabling VASPs to verify their files’ correctness.</p><p>The IVMS101 is a globally-agreed standard meant to help with language encodings, numeric identification, pronunciations of phonetic names, and standardized codes for countries. It basically helps align the data standards between globally distributed VASPs to bring them on the same page for ease of Travel Rule compliance.</p><p>Read more here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-launches-open-source-validator-to-help-vasps-verify-their-ivms-files">https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-launches-open-source-validator-to-help-vasps-verify-their-ivms-files</a></p> All Crypto Transactions Over 1000-Euro To be Monitored in the&nbsp;EU (<a href="https://thefintechtimes.com/the-slowest-and-fastest-crypto-transaction-times-are-revealed-by-forexsuggest/">Image Source</a>)<p>Under a new EU rule, all crypto transactions over 1000 Euros will be subjected to stringent due diligence inquiries by the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).</p><p>As such, the VASPs will have to structurally incorporate risk mitigation strategies, especially when dealing with self-hosted wallets and cross-border crypto payments.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/IrvineMadula/status/1601503742754316290?s=20&amp;t=WuNmm9nSEsFaUQx7FJFpTw">Image Source</a>)<p>The EU has also capped maximum cash payments at 10,000 Euros. However, member countries can go below 10,000 if they wish&nbsp;so.</p><p>For instance, Spain has the lowest limit in the bloc, allowing citizens to pay up to only 1,000 Euros in cash. The EU believes this limit imposition would help curb cash usage for criminal purposes.</p> India Puts 3,300 Crypto Accounts on “Suspected Illegal Activities” List <p>The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU) has tracked nearly 3,300 crypto accounts between April and November 2022 in the suspicion of illegal activities, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, child pornography, and wildlife smuggling.</p>(<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_in">Image Source</a>)<p>Reportedly, the FIU has shared information about these accounts with different law enforcement agencies within the country, crypto exchanges, and FIU’s international counterparts such as Egmont Group, a global consolidation of Financial Intelligence Units of 166 countries.</p><p>The Indian FIU has also recommended the closing down of these accounts.</p> Hong Kong Adds Crypto to its AML/CFT&nbsp;Rules <p>As per Hong Kong legislative council’s new amendment, a new licensing regime for VASPs will come into effect from June 1st,&nbsp;2023.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1601216457320398850?s=20&amp;t=uux8zDlVkPvGnlDB8dgS7g">Image Source</a>)<p>Virtual Asset Service Providers looking to commence their operations in Hong Kong will have to pass rigorous AML checks and investor protection mechanisms to obtain a license of operation.</p><p>According to reports, Hong Kong’s efforts to safeguard crypto investors would not remain limited to one legislation, as the country has decided to effectuate a policy on developing Virtual Assets&nbsp;shortly.</p> Kazakhstan Approves New Crypto Regulations <p>Majilis, the lower house of the Kazakhstan Parliament, has approved a new bill to regulate crypto assets and four other bills on crypto mining in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>While the first bill is called “On Digital Assets of the Republic of Kazakhstan,” the other proposed measures include the introduction of a licensing regime for digital miners, new taxes on corporate income, and value-added tax for individuals conducting crypto transactions.</p>(<a href="https://www.omfif.org/2022/01/kazakhstan-unrest-highlights-importance-of-offline-payment-functionality/">Image Source</a>)<p>However, cryptocurrency circulation and crypto exchange activities will remain prohibited within the country except for an experimental legal regime with a license from the Asthana International Financial Center.</p> Important Announcement: 10,000 SHFT on&nbsp;Offer!

 The Importance of Digital Identity and Wallets in Healthcare 
<p>Traditional processes in today’s <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/healthcare-solutions/">healthcare</a> landscape have left sensitive personal information scattered across a lifetime of providers. This makes it difficult for individuals to access their health information and make informed decisions about their care. However, the future of healthcare is moving towards a model where individuals can create and control their own digital identity to access benefits and coverage. This would give patients more control over their health data and allow them to make more informed decisions about their care. This blog post will explore the importance of digital identity in healthcare and how it can benefit both patients and providers.</p>
 What are Digital Identity and Digital Wallets? 
<p>Digital identity is an electronic and portable representation of an individual’s real-world identity. When a digital identity is controlled by the user (or “holder”), it is referred to as a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-wallets/">digital wallet</a>. Identity information can include name, date of birth, gender, address, and other contact information. A wallet can also include sensitive personal information like medical records, insurance coverage, and financial history. In the healthcare context, when done properly, a digital wallet will allow a patient to control which information is shared with which providers. For example, a patient could share their medical records with their primary care physician but not another.</p>
<p>When implemented properly, a digital identity replaces the current identity construct of a username and password with a verified identity. Verified identities ensure that users are who they say they are, where biometrics are matched with government-certified credentials to verify the identity holder. The biometric can then secure authentication into the user’s account. The user’s digital identity and PII data will be stored in a portable digital identity wallet under the owner’s complete control.</p>
 Why Is a Digital Wallet Important in Healthcare? 
<p>There are several reasons why a digital wallet is important in healthcare. First, it gives patients more control over their health data and privacy. With traditional healthcare processes, patients’ sensitive personal information is scattered across many providers with no central repository. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, for patients to access their records and make informed decisions about their care and doctors may need access to see a full patient history. With a digital wallet, patients can choose which providers can access their selected information. This control will implicitly improve the privacy controls the patient has over their data.</p>
<p>Second, digital wallets will allow patients to receive better care by making it easier for providers to access their records. Today, it can be difficult for providers to get a complete picture of a patient’s health history if they have seen multiple specialists or received care at different facilities over the years.</p>
<p>Third, digital wallets will help reduce errors and improve safety in healthcare. According to the Institute of Medicine, medical errors cost the US healthcare system billions of dollars each year and cause harm to hundreds of thousands of patients. A major contributing factor to these errors is the difficulty accessing complete and accurate patient medical records. If all of a patient’s records could be easily accessed by authorized providers, it would be easier to avoid mistakes and ensure that everyone was working with the most up-to-date information.</p>
<p>Fourth, digital wallets will assist with fraud prevention in healthcare. There are many instances of fraud in healthcare, from people pretending to be someone they’re not to receive care to billing for services that were never provided. When every patient has a unique digital identity verified by providers, it will be much harder for criminals to commit fraud.</p>
<p>Digital wallets are an important part of the future of healthcare. They give patients more control over their health data, allow them to receive better care, reduce errors, improve safety and privacy, and reduce fraud. Providers and payers should adopt requirements to accelerate an individual’s ability to create and manage their unique digital identity. Patients must create and manage their unique digital identities to easily identify themselves, schedule appointments, and receive benefits and coverage.</p>

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>There’s an old joke told by economists that if you see a £€$100 note on the ground, ignore it because it must be a scam. If it wasn’t a scam, someone else would have picked it up&nbsp;already.</p><p>It’s a joke about the supposed infallibility of markets, which are supposed to discover and fill every new opportunity as soon as it arises. But in this blog series we’re arguing the exact opposite.</p><p>There’s some wisdom in the old economists’ joke. When somebody says “Look! There’s an opportunity here that’s just waiting to be had!”, it’s a healthy instinct to think “Hang on a minute! If the opportunity is so great, why hasn’t someone else picked it up before?” It’s one of the reasons people are so sceptical about productivity, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-vital-issue-people-avoid-talking-about-ed4c36a7de93">the ‘P’ word that no-one wants to talk&nbsp;about</a>.</p><p>But in this case, this healthy instinct is wrong. There are millions of such £€$100 notes hanging around, just waiting to be picked up. Why? Because there is so much waste (friction, effort, risks and costs) built into how organisations currently operate — waste that is just waiting to be eliminated. The purpose of this blog is to persuade you how and&nbsp;why.</p> A structural logjam <p>Opportunities for improvement start mounting when, for one reason or another, a system gets stuck in a mode that’s no longer fit for purpose. That is what has happened with data. Especially personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>For decades the best, most efficient, most productive way of getting value from data was for the organisation wanting to use that data to collect it, store it and process it for itself. Who else was there to do&nbsp;it?</p><p>But the more data-driven our economy has become, the more restrictive and suffocating this old approach becomes. One, unique characteristic of data is that it doesn’t get used up when used, which means the same piece of data can be used many times over by many different people for many different purposes. But for that to happen, the data needs to be shared. And the siloed, proprietary organisation-centric database, upon which our entire economic system is currently based, is designed NOT to share&nbsp;data.</p><p>What was once the best possible way of collecting and using data has turned into its opposite: an all-pervading, deeply embedded source of waste: of unnecessary friction, effort, risk and&nbsp;cost.</p> An untapped opportunity <p>But seen from the opposite angle, it is a huge untapped opportunity. Like that £€$100 note lying on the ground in front of you. If the right sort of data sharing was enabled — where citizens can collect, store, use and share their own data under their own control using their own personal data store — we are saying it is now possible to reduce the costs of providing services by between 45% and 90%, especially and initially in the public&nbsp;sector.</p><p>To see how, let’s take a topical example. Right now, lots of people can’t afford to heat their homes. There are schemes, such as the warm home discount, that are supposed to help those who need it most. But often they do the opposite, punishing them for being poor by embroiling them in a frustrating, humiliating, anxiety producing administrative nightmare — and operating as a modern waste creation&nbsp;scheme.</p><p>To prove you are eligible for a warm home discount you have to present your energy provider with a huge amount of information: information about any earnings you have from employment, or from benefits or carers allowances, from pensions or savings, and any other sources of income. You also have to provide information about your housing costs — and when we say ‘provide information’, that means provide documentary proof, in the form that the energy company requires, for every&nbsp;item.</p><p>This is a mountain of work in its own right. But having completed it, you are then in for a shock, because if you have a partner you also have to find, present and prove all the same information for them&nbsp;too.</p><p>Then, once the energy provider receives this information, they have to check every piece of information to make sure you are not a fraudster. The whole process, from application form to final decision, can take months to complete, with processing costs of between £150 and £200 per application (and that’s ignoring all the costs incurred by the individuals themselves). In short, the warm home discount is a waste&nbsp;factory.</p><p>Yet in a high proportion of cases, virtually all this work could be avoided by one simple thing: a verified attribute. A verified attribute is a piece of information about an individual that has been checked to accepted levels of reliability by a competent, responsible organisation such as a government department or bank. It is cryptographically secure so it cannot be tampered with. Examples of verified attributes include confirmation that the individual has passed an exam or test, that they have this blood type of that vaccination, or that they have an income of X and a credit score of&nbsp;Y.</p><p>In this case, if the individual could get hold of a verified attribute confirming that they are eligible for universal credit, their ability to share this one piece of information could short-circuit all the above work, turning months into minutes and hundreds of pounds into pennies. It would eliminate mountains of friction, effort, risk and cost for both the individual and the service provider.</p> The enormous scale of the opportunity <p>The warm home discount is just one tiny example of something that is happening every day, millions of times over. The savings that could be made by changing the way we do warm home discounts could apply millions of times over, to some degree or other. Like covering the ground with £€$100 notes which are just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up.</p><p>Figure 1 below highlights the endless layers of waste currently created by poor data logistics. In doing so it highlights where the cost saving opportunities lie.</p>Figure 1: Layers of waste created by poor data logistics<p>Official Government figures provide one way of seeing just how big the problem Research by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS) back in 2103 identified 1.54 billion transactions dealing with individuals a year, covering 772 services. For example, there were 1.8 million applications for job seekers allowance with each application costing £71 to process, creating total costs of £219 million, and 870,000 applications for employment and support allowances. These cost £223 per application to process, creating total costs of&nbsp;£194m.</p><p>GDS’s commentary on these processes highlight the friction, effort, risk and cost that is endemic within them. On employment and support allowances, it&nbsp;says:</p><p>“New claims involve several interactions with the applicant and third parties,such as medical professionals, to, for example, arrange and undertake medicals, assemble evidence to validate identity and eligibility in line with benefit regulations and fraud avoidance strategies, issue NI numbers if the applicant does not have one, and deal with any appeals against the decisions made.”</p><p>Maintaining a service can be as expensive as delivering a new one. The GDS comment on job seekers’ allowance says:</p><p>“Maintaining claims involves many interactions, including contacts about changes of circumstances or compliance checks that could affect eligibility, the investigation of potential fraud and error, and appeals against decisions made. It also includes the making of payments and any queries about non-receipt.”</p><p>GDS estimated that the total costs of completing these transactions was £6.7bn. It also knew this was a massive underestimate given that it could only obtain cost data on one-fifth of transactions (so the real costs could have been five times higher than this). Its figures also ignore all costs incurred by citizens when making applications (as almost every cost measring exercise&nbsp;does).</p><p>And remember, GDS was only talking about central government. The same costs are being generated across every other sector including local government, health and social care, the third sector, financial services including banking and insurance, education, retail, transport, media and entertainment, and&nbsp;leisure.</p> Millions of £€$100 notes just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up <p>By enabling the sharing of the right information at the right times, personal data logistics infrastructure like that built by Mydex enables warm home discount-style levels of waste to be eliminated from thousands of different services serving tens of millions of different people. It reveals millions of £€$100 notes just waiting to be picked&nbsp;up.</p><p>Yet so far Governments have taken the economists’ joke seriously and ignored them, spending years and billions chasing the rainbows of ‘Big Data’ and artificial (i.e. fake) intelligence instead.</p><p>Elimination of waste and FERC (friction, effort, risk and cost) reduction via better data logistics is now a system-wide productivity revolution that’s just waiting to be unleashed. But this revolution is just the beginning of the economic opportunities opened up by the humble personal data store. It does something else too: transform the way service delivery is organised&nbsp;. That’s the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>A digital technology infrastructure depends on orchestrating information and processes from multiple components, each with unique security, database, and processing methods. Moreover, as a user navigates your platform or application, it’s crucial to ensure their identity has been verified and validated without adding friction to their experience. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/identity-orchestration/pingone-davinci">PingOne DaVinci</a> addresses this need, providing you with an identity orchestration toolkit with a no-code configuration process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, this type of identity orchestration was a complex process that required manual coding of each third-party integration. This problem often meant that changing vendors required more than just installing new software — you had to invest in the orchestration code. As a result, you might have been reluctant to switch to a new vendor, even if they offered improved services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, identity orchestration is made easier through the use of connectors. Connectors are architectural models that transfer (and control the transfer of) data between different components within your architecture. They can also provide additional services, including messaging and transitions—all of which occur independently of the components. With connectors, you can seamlessly connect to proprietary and third-party orchestration tools and integrate these tools into your workflow.</p>

We live in an Internet environment where we lack trust due to the lack of true identities.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257644" title="We lightly define trust in the Preface to these Chapters.">1</a> This results in dealing with billions of anonymous people who can come into your sphere and expect something of you.</p>
<p>Individuals and organizations come into your sphere to challenge you, or to want you to do something. Then the question in your mind comes down to how confident are you that the entity that’s approaching you is who they claim to be, and that their intent can be trusted.</p>
<p>The cost of establishing trust with entities on the internet is too high today. We want to do more things on the internet but we lack the ability to trust the authenticity of the interactions, resulting in lost opportunities to conduct certain valuable transactions.</p>
<p>The founding generation of the internet purposely excluded certain encryption, which would have made the network resistant to eavesdropping and easier to know who sent a particular communication, choosing to focus instead on the technical challenges of moving information quickly and reliably. There were pros and cons associated with this decision. The biggest pro being the fast adoption of the internet – and the biggest con being the lack of provable authenticity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It was still possible to encrypt traffic using hardware or software designed for that purpose, but the Internet developed into a communication system that operated mostly in the clear — meaning anyone with access to the network could monitor transmissions. With encryption rare, it also was difficult for anyone online to be sure who he or she was communicating with.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257644" title="</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;><a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/</a>">2</a></p></blockquote>
<p>We wrote <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">An Introduction to Digital Trust</a> in 2021 so that we could send it as a resource to people looking for a simple explainer. It’s proved helpful so far.</p>
<p>What does it mean to ensure trust is baked into our digital interactions? It starts with being able to trust the claims being made by any entity interacting with you. In a user controlled system, this comes down to trusting the proofs of credentials that your peer is sharing with you. We often refer to the ‘Trust Triangle Model’ to describe the sharing of claims. But as we will describe shortly, this trust model is not addressing all aspects of trust.</p>
<p>When we talk about the Trust Triangle, we use this jargon called “Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers,” and that exactly maps to the world that we have today. We often play those roles at different times and in various interactions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The Verifiable Credential Trust Triangle, based on the model shown in the “Introduction to Trust Over IP” whitepaper.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 An Issuer sends a credential offer to a Holder; 
 The Holder can accept or decline the credential offer; 
 The Holder can then present any credential, or combination of credentials as Proofs to a Verifier. 
 
<p></p>
<p>But within these interactions, there are further questions that could be asked, as Trust needs to be built for all types of interactions.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-3-digital-trust/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257644" title="The below doesn’t cover the complete list of questions that should be asked, as we can imagine wanting to know other details such as credentials types, credential schemas, wallets used, etc.">3</a></p>



Role
Questions


Issuer
Am I issuing the credential to the right holder?


Issuer
Is the holder authorized to receive this?


Holder
Is the Issuer who they claim to be?


Holder
Is the Issuer authorized to issue it?


Holder
Is the Verifier who they claim to be?


Holder
Is the Verifier authorized to verify it?


Verifier
Did the issuer issue the credential to the right holder?


Verifier
Is the holder authorized to receive this?


Verifier
Is the authentic recipient of the credential presenting the proof or is someone else presenting the proof?


Verifier
Is the Issuer who they claim to be?


Verifier
Is the Issuer authorized to issue it?



<p><br><br>
These above are all governance-related questions, rather than technical questions. However in some of these questions, we see technology as being the solution to solve some governance issues. Therefore showing the trust triangle by itself isn’t the best model, and is perhaps deceptive to think that it’s going to work at any scale without showing a fourth element, or what we call governance.</p>
 <p>An expansion on the Governance Trust Diamond, shown in the “Introduction to Trust Over IP” whitepaper. All entities involved have reasons to consult with one or many governance frameworks.</p> 
<p><br><br>
The purpose of this section was to take that initial introduction on Digital Trust a step further as it comes to claims being made digitally, by answering these three questions:</p>
 
 In Chapter 4, we will discuss: “What infrastructure is needed so that anyone can trust any type of claim made digitally?” (Hint: using cryptographic proofs alone aren’t enough) 
 In Chapter 5, we will then answer: “What ramp is needed to monetize the benefits of this digital trust infrastructure?” 
 In Chapter 6, we close the discussion by addressing: “Who should build, deploy and maintain this infrastructure?”

In March 2021, the prime ministers of Estonia, Finland, Denmark and Germany called on the European Union (EU) to speed up “digital sovereignty” and the creation of the “digital single market”.</p>
<p>The four countries wrote in a letter that “digital sovereignty” means increasing Europe’s technological capacity and its ability to establish values ​​and rules in a technology-centered world that is becoming dominated by other countries: “We call for the European Union to get ahead of the curve in the digital transformation.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://news.err.ee/1608127618/estonia-eu-countries-propose-faster-european-digital-sovereignty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://news.err.ee/1608127618/estonia-eu-countries-propose-faster-european-digital-sovereignty</a></span>">1</a></p>
<p>The prime ministers called on the EU to speed up the digital switchover and to emphasize digital policies involving governments, society and the economy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We need to effectively safeguard competition and market access in a data-driven world. Critical infrastructures and technologies need to become resilient and secure. It is time for the digitization of governments in order to build trust and foster digital innovation,” the same letter said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since that announcement, the EU itself<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.scytales.com/post/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://www.scytales.com/post/scytales-ab-together-with-netcompany-intrasoft-wins-landmark-eu-digital-wallet-contract</a>">2</a>, and many EU Nation States have prioritized Digital ID programs/strategies as a first order of action to protect their digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>We defined sovereignty in the previous chapter, so let’s take a stab at defining identity in this one.</p>
<p>Personal Identity is given to you by the Government in a lot of ways; that is, in an administrative sense, and not your philosophical sense of being, and who you are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the physical world, many interactions with entities are governed by regulation. Going to a financial institution or a hospital requires one to identify themselves with one of these Government-issued IDs.</p>
<p>The Public Sector Profile of the Pan-Canadian Trust Framework<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257634" title="<a href=&quot;https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;>https://github.com/canada-ca/PCTF-CCP/blob/master/Version1_4/PSP-PCTF-V-1.4-Consolidated-Overview-EN-2021-12-16.pdf</a>">3</a> defines two types of identities: foundational and contextual:</p>
 
 A Foundational Identity is an identity that has been established or changed as a result of a foundational event (e.g., birth, person legal name change, immigration, legal residency, naturalized citizenship, death, organization legal name registration, organization legal name change, or bankruptcy).
 
 Even if foundational identities can undergo changes of state, the chain of provenance of these changes are maintained. For example, on your passport it says where you were born, even though it may not be the country that you’re a citizen of. 
 Your foundational identity attributes are rarely changed. 
 Your foundational identity is controlled and managed by governments. 
 
 
 A Contextual Identity is an identity that is used for a specific purpose within a specific identity context (e.g., banking, business permits, health services, drivers licensing, or social media).
 
 Contextual identities can<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-257634" title="There is room for identities not rooted in foundational identities. It’s up to the consumer to decide whether or not they want it rooted. There’s nothing stopping you from creating a public-private key pair today to participate in the world of decentralized finance. This freedom brings sovereignty of its own.">4</a> be rooted in foundational identities. Formal recognition can be extended to other sectors where lower assurances can be tolerated and foundational identity is not required. 
 You can have as many contextual identities as you want, and you can get rid of them as you choose. As a citizen, you have much more agency and autonomy over your contextual identities. 
 Since you can have many of these for various contexts, they can help reduce correlation, an important factor to drive personal sovereignty via privacy. 
 Your contextual identities are controlled and managed by you and the entities you enter into contracts with. 
 
 
 
<p>Contextual identities, which we will start referring to as “Trusted Digital Identities”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-257634" title="<em>T</em><i>rust</i> is a loaded term. It’s a human concept, which makes it difficult to categorize as it’s very contextual. In the context of <i>trusted digital identity</i>, we’re saying that just like your physical world interactions often require identity cards that have been rooted in Government-issued foundational IDs (e.g., showing a driver’s license to open a bank account), many digital interactions will require the same.">5</a>, can be established between you and other entities (e.g., lower-level governments, tech companies, financial institutions, hospitals, online services, etc.) based on what you as an individual consent to. To repeat a point mentioned above, we require that concept of ‘foundational’ identity so we can build on the idea of a trusted digital identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As more of us spend most of our time in some digital fashion, Governments must provide the same level of trust online that they do in the physical world (root of trust).</p>
<p>One of the roles of a nation is to provide high assurance identities so that an economy can flourish. In Chapter 4 we look at some needed infrastructure to enhance the digital economy. The key questions to answer are how to establish the identities which can create trust, and how we can monetize those identities in the digital economy (Chapter 5).</p>
<p>If we don’t get digital identity right we’re in deep trouble, which is why a lot of the government initiatives right now globally are doing very similar things. They’re adopting a particular technology stack but aiming towards full interoperability (e.g., cross border digital interactions) that is going to be required to serve their citizens, allowing the country to establish its own digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>There are examples of countries in which the governments have more mature digital ID programs. We often hear of the successes from programs in Estonia, Singapore, etc. These successes have come from smaller countries, with existing high mobile adoption, and a very centralized control/governance of the countries’ ecosystems (e.g., financial, healthcare, etc.). Although they’ve been able to create lots of value for citizens to more easily access services, and cheaper for private sectors to identify/authenticate, this infrastructure doesn’t work on the open Internet.</p>
<p>As Kim Cameron states in his Laws of Identity paper: </p>
<blockquote><p>“A system that does not put users in control will – immediately or over time – be rejected by enough of them that it cannot become and remain a unifying technology.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-2-digital-identity/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-257634" title="</span></i><a href=&quot;https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf</span></a><i><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>">6</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The Open Internet for one cannot adopt the architecture of private ecosystems that countries like Singapore and Estonia have implemented. It won’t work because it’s a centrally managed model and it doesn’t put users in control.</p>
<p>Here are a couple other quotes from Kim Cameron’s paper which feel highly relevant to this topic of discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Digital identity is related to context, and the Internet, while being a single technical framework, is experienced through a thousand kinds of content in at least as many different contexts”</p></blockquote>
<p>&amp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“The emergence of a single simplistic digital identity solution as a universal panacea is not realistic.”</p></blockquote>
<p>So we think we can all agree that creating one identity system for the Internet won’t scale. But using certain governance frameworks can help accelerate the journey to digital trust.</p>
<p>There’s a really good way of managing governance at a really large scale today that a whole bunch of people in different countries in the world have bought into. It’s called governments. So who’s in a stronger position to start issuing highly trustworthy secure privacy preserving digital identities for their citizens, their businesses and for their agencies that they are dealing with? Governments are the root of trust for so many things in life today so just having that root of trust available digitally will accelerate the speed at which digital trust on the internet can be adopted. Governments can provide key inputs and frameworks to empower their citizens to benefit from trusted digital interactions.</p>
<p>We would conclude that it seems like there’s a very critical role to be played by governments in achieving digital trust, which downstream will bring more sovereignty to themselves and to their citizens.</p>
<p>Let’s next expand upon the concept of Digital Trust.</p>

<p><br><br>
In the world of self-sovereign identity (SSI), there are various opinions about using the word sovereignty for describing the ambitions that we are trying to achieve through our principles, values, standards, technologies and governance frameworks. Some people refrain from using it as it causes confusion in discussions amongst various stakeholders. There were similarities in the crypto space in 2018, where the terms crypto and even blockchain became ones to avoid in conversations, and people started referring to them as ledger technologies. But the purpose of this series isn’t to focus on the right naming convention, but instead to focus on what is needed to achieve digital trust, which is a means to achieving more sovereignty for all.</p>
<p>The need for sovereignty is not only for people, but also for Nation States. Let’s define both of these:</p>
 
 National sovereignty: “The formation and protection of sustainable freedom, equality and justice in society depends totally on the exact sense of establishment of national sovereignty. Therefore, the basis of freedom, equality and justice is national sovereignty.”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-257569" title="</span></span><a href=&quot;https://www.ktb.gov.tr/EN-104179/national-sovereignty-national-government.html#:~:text=The%20formation%20and%20protection%20of,in%20our%20state%20is%20limitless.&quot;>https://www.ktb.gov.tr/EN-104179/national-sovereignty-national-government.html#:~:text=The%20formation%20and%20protection%20of,in%20our%20state%20is%20limitless.</a>">1</a> 
 Personal sovereignty: “The intrinsic authority and power of an individual to determine their own direction and destiny. It means not being controlled or manipulated by any person, group, or institution. It means having agency and autonomy over your life; being able to make your own decisions”<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-257569" title="<a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-sovereignty-barbara-fagan-smith/&quot;>https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/personal-sovereignty-barbara-fagan-smith/</a>">2</a> 
 
<p>With the basis of freedom, equality and justice being tied to national sovereignty, ensuring democratic nation states can not only maintain, but increase their sovereignty should result in positive downstream implications for the sovereignty of their citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As world economies continue to undergo fundamental shifts, with a rising share of economic growth and prosperity being driven by intangible assets (i.e. investments and assets that do not have a concrete physical existence) (e.g., data, digital services, brand equity, etc.), governments must ensure they exercise leadership within the digital realm. As more of us spend increasing time in digital environments rather than physical, governments must enable the same level of trust in the digital world that they do in the physical world, so that citizens have agency and autonomy over their growing digital lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So the million dollar question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we create an unbiased open playing field driven by infrastructure allowing all to play with sovereignty?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technology companies seem to have sovereignty over their digital ecosystems. They architect the rules, algorithms, data, policies, etc. In contrast to the physical ecosystems where governments are generally the architects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. </p>
<p>On January 6th, 2021, when a mob attacked the United States Capitol in Washington – the response went to the tech companies, not to governments. Companies such as Twitter were empowered to de-platform the president of the US, and certain platforms like Parler were banned by their infrastructure provider.<a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-257569" title="<a href=&quot;https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/&quot;>https://time.com/5929888/amazon-parler-aws/</a>">3</a> However you feel about Twitter, they managed to exercise sovereignty (e.g., once again recently by reinstating previously banned accounts). And whatever opinion you have about these technology companies’ policies, no one has voted for their rules – they continue to exercise sovereignty over important societal matters.</p>
<p>With regard to exerting sovereignty in the digital space, generally speaking, the private sector has moved ahead of governments. Hearings of Facebook at Congress in 2018 were a good example of reactionary measures. When a private sector company generated enough complaints from citizens, the US Congress then prioritized looking into what was happening.</p>
  
<p><br><br>
At the fast pace at which new technology moves, if governments aren’t a party to what is being built, how can they keep up with it? In the physical world, if a mining operation is built on some land, to some extent the land is overseen and governed by a respective government agency. <a href="https://northernblock.io/attaining-sovereignty-by-unlocking-digital-trust-chapter-1-digital-sovereignty/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-257569" title="</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>In the physical world, does anything that can have a significant impact on citizens happen without government involvement/oversight?</span><span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;>">4</a> The Internet on the other hand doesn’t have the same standard of government oversight. So how will they know what is being built and how these things are impacting the sovereignty of their citizens.</p>
<p>Increasing national sovereignty in the digital world remains a pressing topic throughout world governments. And the launch of national digital identity programs by governments has shown great initiative to solve some of these issues.<br>
</p>
<p>We will shift the focus in the next chapter to Digital Identity. If digital trust is a means to sovereignty, then let’s look at how citizen-controlled digital identity can be a means to attaining digital trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Digital Identity → Digital Trust → Digital Sovereignty</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Chapter 2, we will look at how most of the Digital ID solutions which exist in the market today are either driven by private sector or closed government ecosystem solutions. The digital world is broader than the physical borders of a nation. And citizens every day operate digitally outside of the physical boundaries. By not having open ecosystems, it makes it difficult for governments to fully assess the impact these systems have on their citizens.»</p>

We wrote <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">An Introduction to Digital Trust</a> in 2021 so that we could send it as a resource to people looking for a simple explainer. It’s proved helpful so far.</p>
<p>Since then however, the market has matured. We’ve seen a steady increase in global self-sovereign identity (SSI) projects, with many projects undertaken, and a rising amount of tenders coming out of the public sector. It’s fair to say that there has been a growing buzz around the space.</p>
<p>We’ve also noticed the SSI adoption conversation recently shifting away from technology and standards towards trust, which we’ve felt is a positive sign for the adoption cycle of digital trust applications, knowing that technologies, protocols and standards alone doesn’t allow for anyone to trust any type of claim, especially in the digital world.</p>
<p>Hence, we decided that we needed a Part 2 to that initial post on digital trust. There wasn’t enough covered in the introduction to give the full spectrum and push forward some ideas on how digital trust can be achieved on the Open Internet.</p>
<p>Trust is a human concept. It’s a perception. Trust is relative to risk – and every human has a different risk tolerance based on contextual elements. Some may take extra steps to “trust” someone or an activity, whereas others may take much less steps for the same. Trust also can vary depending on the value of the transaction that they are involved in. A clutch point around trust is that at some point you gain enough confidence in a context to proceed with a transaction or deepening the relationship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we reflected on trust, and how there can be more of it on the internet, we felt like it really comes down to having strong trust frameworks (or governance frameworks) to set the rules which we can all operate within specific contexts. In the physical world, there’s a really good way of managing governance at a really large scale today that a whole bunch of people in different countries in the world have bought into. They’re called governments.</p>
<p>We therefore set out to write our thoughts on how governments can inject trust into the open internet so that trust can become portable across contexts where it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we’re aiming at highlighting is that today everyone is unable to trust each other in this modern digital world due to certain steps that were skipped when the Internet was rolled out. Knowing that the open internet is a foundation to so many services that we, the citizens, consume in our daily lives, how can we avoid making the same mistakes as we continue depending on more digital interactions.</p>
<p>As we continue to roll out digital identity programs, we need to really understand the relationship that digital identity has with trust, and in turn look at how that affects both individual and national sovereignty. Chapters 1-3 covers these topics and goes into depth of the problem statement.</p>
<p>Throughout Chapters 4-6, we will look into the needed infrastructure to address the problem statement. The infrastructure needs to cover the foundational building blocks so that we have a framework for digital trust based on different levels of engagements. We will discuss how citizens can engage with others (peers) and thus monetize the infrastructure through trust, while maintaining their sovereignty. Lastly, we cover the most critical question – who should design, build, operate and maintain the proposed digital trust infrastructure?</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>Trust is a human concept. It’s a perception. Trust is relative to risk – and every human has a different risk tolerance based on contextual elements. Some may take extra steps to “trust” someone or an activity, whereas others may take much less steps for the same. Trust also can vary depending on the value of the transaction that they are involved in. A clutch point around trust is that at some point you gain enough confidence in a context to proceed with a transaction or deepening the relationship.</p>
<p>Knowing that technologies, protocols and standards alone doesn’t allow for anyone to trust any type of claim, especially in the digital world, how do we build the right set of rules to foster trust within specific contexts?</p>
<p>In this podcast episode with Scott, we discuss these topics:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 In digital trust infrastructure, these “rules” are formally known as a governance framework (GF). A core thesis of ToIP architecture is that interoperability of GFs is just as important—if not more so—than interoperability of the technical protocols. Why? 
 Can you replicate, or codify existing physical world governance frameworks for digital use? 
 Where is governance created? On the edge (with the issuers, holders, verifiers), or within/across ecosystems? 
 Defining trust – is a technical or human concept? 
 How to quantify trust? Is it even possible? 
 Is accountability the key factor in building a rule system to promote trust? 
 Does unlocking certain governance frameworks correlate directly to the adoption of digital trust ecosystems? 
 How is assurance used as a measure to manage risk across various contexts? 
 Are governance frameworks composable, meaning can they be re-used across various use cases? 
 Can we leverage governance frameworks from closed ecosystems and re-use components in open ecosystems? 
 How does governance map to the <a href="https://northernblock.io/trust-over-ip-foundation-the-first-public-review-draft-of-the-technology-architecture-v1-0-specification/">new ToIP technology architecture model</a>? 
 How do private and public sectors collaborate on defining governance for large scale digital ID programs?

<p>At Spruce, we’re passionate about exploring applications of decentralized identity technology, as we help shepherd a more privacy-centric future where individuals have more control over their identity and data. One such application is through official forms of identification, like those issued by government and official agencies for mobile driver’s licenses (mDL). </p><p>We believe that in the modern, technology-driven world, an ID will become much more composable than a piece of plastic that sits idly in your wallet. That’s why we’re excited to share a new solution we’ve been working on with early partners as a part of our new <a href="https://spruceid.com/credible">Credible Product Suite</a>.</p><a href="https://spruceid.com/credible">  Credible  Credible offers digital versions of identification, like mobile driver’s licenses, that offer more security, privacy protection, and control for individuals across their digital interactions.      </a><p>We’ve put a lot of consideration into how we can best design a Credible mobile drivers license solution in a way that puts privacy and security at the forefront of our decision-making. New technology enabling digital forms of identity requires us to think about the different risks and concerns that may arise, and how we, as a technology company, can foster innovation to help protect the rights of individuals in these decisions. </p> What is an mDL? <p>An mDL is a mobile driver’s license, a digital version of the plastic ID card you carry around in your wallet. Many government agencies and institutions globally are exploring digital versions of official identification to provide expanded functionality to meet the needs of our new digital world. With this, a need for a set of global technical standards has emerged to ensure interoperability between different agencies and jurisdictions.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a> - the technical standard for mobile driver’s license applications, which was unanimously approved in August 2021. This standard for an mDL application covers how we can represent a digital driver’s license on a person’s smartphone (or other device) and the end-to-end process for how it can be presented in-person. Federal agencies in the United States, namely TSA, have already committed to using ISO/IEC 18013-5, which means that state DMVs will need to build mDLs aligned with the same standard in order for their driver’s licenses to be usable for travel at airports. The ISO working groups, which Spruce is a part of, are still actively discussing methods for how an mDL is issued, presented online (ISO/IEC 18013-7), and refreshed. </p><p>With verifiable credentials, mDLs are a secure and trustworthy way to store your driver’s license information and credentials. Verifiable credentials are digital representations of documents, such as a driver’s license, that can be stored securely on a mobile device, using cryptography. These credentials are cryptographically signed by the issuing authority and can be verified by other parties. This ensures that the credentials are authentic and cannot be altered or tampered with in any way and allows individuals to prove their identity for digital interactions in a secure and verifiable way.</p><p>With Credible, we are creating a solution to provision mobile driver’s licenses to a smartphone application using ISO/IEC 18013-5, along with the W3C standards for Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, and OpenID for Verifiable Credentials to create secure, privacy-enhancing, and tamper evident identity solutions. </p> Why should we care about this? <p>Simply put, the world is moving towards digitization. We spend an increasing amount of our time online, with an ever-increasing number of digital interactions. There is still, however, a massive disconnect between the experiences we are familiar with in the physical world and how accessible (or not) those are online. </p><p>There is no straightforward way to verify your identity online right now in order to do basic tasks, such as opening a bank account or applying for an apartment lease, aside from physically typing in a government-issued personal identifier, like an SSN, which comes with major security risks. Online businesses and services have to collect sensitive information from users because, until now, there has been no way to securely present a digital version of your identity credentials in a way that is cryptographically verifiable.</p><p>Aside from verifying your identity for digital interactions, having a digital ID, such as an mDL, creates new opportunities for people to access benefits afforded to them by both businesses and governments, at the local, state, and federal levels. Individuals will be able to present their mDL online to prove, for example, they are over 55 to qualify for a senior discount while buying movie tickets online at their local movie theater. Similarly, a college student would be able to prove they are a resident of a local city to qualify for a library card in order to check out electronic versions of their textbooks from their local library. In fact, we’re working to let mDL users be able to log into different government websites to access government services, including social security and unemployment benefits, Medicare and Medicaid, and nutrition assistance programs.</p><p>On a grander scale, the ability to prove one’s identity securely and in a tamper-evident way helps to reduce fraud in accessing financial assistance. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment insurance (UI) fraud has grown at an astonishing rate. The <a href="https://www.oig.dol.gov/doloiguioversightwork.htm">U.S. Department of Labor's Inspector General</a> states that of, "the estimated $872.5 billion in pandemic UI funding, at least $163 billion in benefits could have been paid improperly, with a significant portion attributable to fraud." The government can have higher trust that the citizens accessing benefits are, in fact, the people who qualify for those benefits, and citizens can trust that their tax money is being used responsibly.</p><p>From a security perspective, the user of applied cryptography in our Credible mDL solution ensures the identification is tamper-evident with verifiable authorship. This means that when you present your mDL, either online or in person, it will be clear that the ID hasn’t been tampered with in any way and is, in fact, official identification issued by a specific state or other governing body. This solution, when paired with a complementing data policy approach, can help ensure that your information is used only for the exact purpose specified and no further. We further incorporate support for W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers in line with the <a href="https://medium.com/@identitywoman-in-business/vc-mdl-project-community-input-session-db016c50a050">community’s inputs</a>, to maximize benefits for end users by supporting different types of popular data formats.</p><p>With this early use case of Credible, we’re unlocking the hugely untapped potential for how we facilitate trusted interactions in a digital world. The technology is deeply complex, but with Credible, the applications are intuitive and easy to use, bringing verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers toward mainstream adoption for daily use. </p><p>If you’re interested in further explorations of mobile driver’s licenses solutions, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@spruceid.com">hello@spruceid.com</a>.</p> <p><br>About Spruce: Spruce is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p><br></p>

<p>Authentication is a constant challenge for enterprise organizations managing teams accessing system resources from anywhere, at any time. New technologies are leveraging mobile devices to address this challenge.</p>
<p>What is push authentication? Push authentication uses a mobile device and authentication service to send authentication requests via mobile push notifications.</p>
 Multi-Factor and Out-of-Band Authentication 
<p>Push authentication is a component of MFA architectures using out-of-band authentication (OOBA) to verify a user’s identity with high confidence.</p>
<p>As discussed in this blog, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> is an approach to identity verification that requires users to provide at least two forms of credentials across different verification categories. These categories generally include:</p>
 
 Knowledge: A username/password combination or PIN. 
 Ownership: A One-Time Password (OTP) or token acquired through SMS, email, or an authentication device. 
 Inherence: Proof of identity through biological or physiological factors like fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans. 
 
<p>The strength of an MFA architecture depends on its use of distinct categories. For example, a robust MFA scheme might call for a password, and an OTP sent via SMS to verify identity. If a solution uses two of the same factors, it loses its strength and usefulness.</p>
<p>MFA is such an essential part of cybersecurity that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) maintains Special Publication 800-63, “Digital Identity Guidelines,” to provide federal agencies and private companies with a framework for secure <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blog/authentication/what-is-authentication">authentication.</a></p>
<p>On top of its description of appropriate MFA factors, NIST SP 800-63 requires that MFA architectures use out-of-band authentication, in which the channel used to provide the first set of credentials is distinct from the next one.</p>
<p>For example, if a user enters their password using a web interface and Wi-Fi, OOBA calls for the next step to use different communication means. This can mean device-based authentication, biometric scans, etc.</p>
<p>One of these proper channels is a mobile device, which makes some sense–a user can receive texts and emails to a phone the same as a computer. However, these methods aren’t entirely secure.</p>
<p>For instance, iPhone users might use SMS OTPs as their second authentication factor, which can open them up to theft if someone else has access to a connected Mac computer also receiving those same SMS texts.</p>
 How Does Push Authentication Work? 
<p>Push authentication addresses this problem. The push authentication system uses a secure authentication server to field login requests. When the user enters a password or PIN,</p>
 
 The server will send a push notification to the user’s mobile device, tied to their phone number. This notification, or the “challenge,” will be signed with a private key. 
 The notification will come from an associated app on the phone using public-ley encryption. The challenge, signed with a private key, will be verified with a public key associated with the app and phone. 
 Once the user receives the notification, they can approve or deny it. Since the challenge has been verified, the user may tap the verification to authorize, eliminating the need to transfer OTPs or tokens across public Internet connections. 
 The authenticated challenge is sent to the server, and the user may access their system account and resources. 
 
 What Are the Advantages and Challenges of Push Authentication? 
<p>Because of the mechanisms involved with push notifications and authentication, implementing the technology will provide several advantages to your infrastructure. These benefits come in no small part due to the features and capabilities that always-on mobile devices may support.</p>
<p>Some advantages of push authentication include:</p>
 
 Registration and Authentication: Authentication requests processed through a push notification system will do so through a registered account within that authentication system. This provides additional layers of security outside of SMS or email authentication. 
 Security: Fewer attack surfaces exist because the authentication challenge isn’t moving through open SMS or email. The user must have the phone to authenticate using push notifications. 
 Convenience: Push authentication is a single-push solution. The user gets a notification, tap it to approve, and they are authenticated. 
 <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless Authentication</a>: Push authentication is a form of MFA, but it can serve as a primary form of authentication in which the user doesn’t have to enter passwords manually. Like <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication/biometric-authentication-biometric-authentication/">biometric authentication</a>, a passwordless system can rely on push authentication such that a user accessing system resources has to tap a notification from their authentication app. 
 Complex Credentials: If using a passwordless system with push notifications, you can include arbitrarily long and complex passwords for additional security. Not having to remember the password so long as you have a mobile device, the user can rely on best security practices. 
 Compromised Account Alerts: If a hacker tries to use a password to access your account, you can get an alert via a push and shutdown the login attempt. You can mitigate the threat within 5 minutes with an immediate password update. 
 
<p>As with any technology, however, some challenges come with push authentication:</p>
 
 Internet Connections: To leverage push authentication, the user must have an active wireless or mobile connection. In our modern world of always-on internet connectivity, this isn’t that much of a deal, but it can present issues if a user doesn’t want to connect their phone to unknown Wi-Fi networks. 
 Lack of Attention: if the user receives several notifications in rapid succession (and doesn’t spend much time looking at their notifications), they may approve unauthorized logins without knowing what they are doing. 
 
 Where Is Push Authentication Used? 
<p>The ubiquity of mobile devices capable of receiving push notifications makes this technology a seeming slam-dunk. However, it’s important to note that implementing this technology requires a provider that can offer the underlying authentication infrastructure (including authentication, mobile communication capabilities, etc.).</p>
<p>In the consumer and enterprise space, larger service providers like Google and Microsoft may offer push notification tools for their cloud services. However, these solutions are somewhat limited, requiring the company to use that suite of services.</p>
<p>Likewise, enterprise solutions can be tailored to a company’s specific needs. Still, they will require a management provider to maintain the technology, ensure it remains secure and updated, and so on.</p>
<p>That being said, nearly any company could benefit from a push authentication system. Enterprises that rely on users interfacing with each other via phones or tablets, especially in a distributed, remote work environment.</p>

<p>TL;DR</p>  The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) on Dock can read from native modules using precompiles  This makes the communication between EVM and native chain bidirectional.  With this new release, the EVM smart contracts can now read data like DIDs, revocation statuses, accumulator values, etc.  EVM smart contracts can thus verify signatures from DIDs and verify credentials as well  EVM contracts could also use information like participation in governance or staking in a DAO contract, for example   Background <p>Dock blockchain's features are organized in different modules (called pallets in <a href="https://substrate.io/">Substrate</a>). Eg, the DID module stores all DIDs, their public keys, service endpoints, etc. The revocation module stores revocation registries and statuses. The staking module stores who all have staked for whom and how much. And so on.<br></p><p>To deploy smart contracts on Dock, we have the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) module (<a href="https://blog.dock.io/deploy-your-evm-smart-contracts-on-dock/">announcement</a>) that allows developers to deploy contracts written in Solidity (the most popular smart contract language) for any custom logic in their dApp. However, it wasn't possible for the EVM module to read the data of other modules. E.g. your smart contract couldn't read the public key of a DID or couldn't check the revocation status. The native chain modules could read EVM storage but the opposite wasn't possible. This changes with our new release. With the new release, EVM contracts can read data stored in any module by using our storage-reader precompile.</p> Technical Details <p>The contracts can call the precompile with the module name and storage entry name (in that module) (many variations available) to read the corresponding storage. It is the contract's responsibility to parse that storage data to create a meaningful data structure, thus the contract should be aware of the data structure of the storage its reading. The precompile can read various storage structures like without keys, maps and double maps and allow reading from an offset and limit the amount of data read. </p><p>We are releasing 2 precompiles, one for reading storage as raw bytes and the other which is type-aware and will use defaults. It's recommended to use the latter if you are unsure of which to pick. The raw storage reader precompile is at address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000F and the type-aware is at address 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000E. </p><p>Here is the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm/precompile/storage-reader">code</a> in the blockchain node repo and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/eth/storage-reader.test.js">tests</a> in the SDK repo.</p> Applications <p>This new feature allows developers to build richer dApps which not only have the flexibility of smart contracts but can also use Dock's native features like DIDs. Say a contract requires a DID's approval and thus requires a signature to verify. The contract on receiving the signature, reads the public key from the DID module and verifies. </p><p>Contracts can also verify credentials by checking the signature and revocation status however care must be taken to do it for only those credentials which don't violate the privacy of the user. So anonymous credentials can be verified by reading the BBS+ public key and accumulator (for revocation) from the chain. Contracts could also use other information like an account's participation in staking or governance like a DAO that only allows accounts that have nominated some validators (by staking tokens) or play a role in governance like they being a council member, etc.</p> About Dock <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/">Dock</a> is a Verifiable Credentials provider that offers Dock Certs, a highly secure and scalable no-code platform, and Certs API to enable organizations to efficiently issue and verify digital credentials using blockchain technology. The credentials are tamper-resistant and instantly verifiable, and the technology is easy to integrate so users can provide Verifiable Credential support quickly. </p>

 What Will Drive NFTs Inevitable Success? <p>In the current environment, Web3 seems to be in a “cold winter”, and most of the industries are showing a downward trend. However, in this “recession”, NFT development has become a “fresh&nbsp;stream”.</p><p>For example, take Doodles, which recently completed its first round of funding. As of midday on June 23, the series of NFTs had traded a total of 3,697 ETH in the last 7 days, with a floor price of 15 ETH, and did not seem to be overly affected by the general environment. Meanwhile, the “blue chips” represented by BAYC have also developed their own subculture and attracted numerous insiders on their “pilgrimage”.</p><p>BAYC, the representative work of NFTs, makes users feel the madness of a JPEG worth millions, and behind it, the voice of doubt is getting worse: what is the practicality of&nbsp;NFTs?</p> Internal Expansion of&nbsp;NFTs <p>In fact, this is not the first time the question has been raised, the exploration of utility for NFTs has already begun. It can even be said that standards such as ERC-1155 were originally developed to enable the use of NFTs. For example, GameFi’s game props can use the ERC-1155 standard to create multiple weapons of the same&nbsp;kind.</p><p>Not only that, but the expansion within NFTs has never stopped. In particular, the Utility type of NFT is already under healthy development and has explored a large number of usage scenarios, such as holding an NFT to access specific games, activities or documents, and purchasing an artwork NFT to own the artwork physically in&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the concept of SBT moves from theory to practice, NFTs can combine the concept of SBT to present the user’s on-chain identity more fully. For example, POAP-type commemorative NFTs can leave the user experience on the public chain in an NFT way, as a credential for the user to participate in a certain activity or community construction. There are also NFT-ized DIDs, whose convenience and image performance enable users to quickly accept this new concept and realize more scenario applications based on&nbsp;it.</p><p>NFT internal use scenarios have now covered most areas, but we also know that innovative technologies can not be trapped in a small circle, a strong Web3 ecosystem needs to collaborate with external resources. Therefore, the NFT industry is also actively promoting external ecological expansion.</p> External expansion of&nbsp;NFT <p>Currently, NFT’s external expansion is focused on social media displays, such as Twitter Blue’s support for NFT avatar displays, followed by Meta’s indication that Facebook and Instagram will support NFT postings and displays.</p><p>In business, it is more in the form of brand cooperation for NFT publicity and attraction, such as luxury brands releasing their own NFT, or celebrities and brands choosing to buy popular NFTs for publicity, etc.</p><p>In general, the external expansion of NFTs shows the characteristics of attention as the main focus and technology as a supplement. That is, there is no need for the public to understand the technology and meaning behind NFTs, but only to promote it through pictures, music and other visual expressions, through hot events or brand awareness. Practice has proven that this form is currently the most easily accepted by users outside the circle, and indeed attracts more new users to join the NFT ecosystem.</p> Conclusion <p>NFTs can be seen as an imaginative and scalable medium and tool. Current examples have demonstrated that NFTs can be applied to a variety of application scenarios, and there are already good ways to use them in the GameFi, metaverse, DAO and other Web3 tracks. NFTs have shown strong scalability and plasticity, so it is foreseeable that with the development of Web3, the future will certainly expand a wider range of application scenarios. There will be a time when its internal and external development has reached a certain level, then a new round of explosion will come as expected.</p> Follow us on social&nbsp;media! <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-tech-viewpoint-the-internal-and-external-double-drive-to-increase-nft-value-5c917f35440a">Ontology Tech Viewpoint | The Internal and External “Double Drive” to Increase NFT Value</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>It’s been less than two months since we opened the <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">Metadium Technology Discord </a>server and it has become the main platform for communication between the Metadium Team and the community. Our goal is to include different channels to make it easier to find the information you need from tech, partnerships and roadmap updates to educational articles and day-to-day communication about everything related to Metadium and the industry.</p><p>As we aim to grow our community even further and bring people from different nationalities and languages, we made the decision to concentrate our efforts on the Discord platform.</p> What this&nbsp;means: <p>As Discord allows us to create multiple channels for different languages while also keeping all our community together with a space for events and announcements, we will be stopping our Kakao channel on January 25, 2023. This means that, if you still haven’t joined our <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">Discord </a>server, you have almost two months to do it. We are waiting for you&nbsp;:)</p><blockquote>If you are not sure how to join Discord, check <a href="https://medium.com/metadium/how-to-create-a-discord-account-453cecdecefc">this HOW TO guide</a> where we go through the process step by&nbsp;step</blockquote> What to&nbsp;expect: <p>More activity, more communication, more&nbsp;events.</p><p>Focusing on one platform will allow us to be closer and interact more with the community.

				  A complete, easy-to-deploy ecosystem for creating, issuing, and verifying tamper-proof employment credentials, using open-source decentralized identity technology delivering secure and reusable verification  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, Dec 8, 2022/Accesswire/ Indicio, the market leader in developing Trusted Digital Ecosystems to verify and exchange high-value information, today announced the availability of <a href="http://Indicio.tech/proven-works">Indicio Proven Works</a>, a complete, off-the-shelf solution enabling&nbsp; continuous, seamless verification of employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Works reduces duplicative and time-consuming verification processes, and provides tamper-proof assurance of employee identity for global companies and external benefit providers. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) <a href="https://legacy.acfe.com/report-to-the-nations/2022/?_ga=2.170335648.1054739412.1670440686-1944471192.1670440686">estimates</a> that 5% of businesses’ annual revenue is lost to occupational fraud and payroll abuse. This includes false timesheet entries and paychecks going to employees who don’t actually exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting this in context, if the 5% loss estimate were applied to the combined total annual revenue of the top 500 grossing companies in the world in 2021, it would result in a projected total fraud loss of almost $1.9 trillion. Indicio Proven helps combat occupational fraud using verifiable credentials and open-source decentralized identity technology that is privacy-preserving, secure, and GDPR compliant.</p>
<p>“Indicio Proven Works is a powerful way to simplify employment verification,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, “and a simple way to experience the power of verifiable credential technology. Whether entering a facility or a Zoom meeting or enrolling with a benefits partner, a verifiable credential provides fraud-resistant and tamper-proof assurance that the employee presenting the credential is your employee. KYC once, verify continuously and seamlessly, save time, money, effort, and eliminate risk. And once you add a verifiable credential layer to your existing system, you’ll be ready to&nbsp; expand the scope for immediately actionable, verifiable data.”</p>
<p>With its <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Proven</a> range of products, Indicio provides all the components to quickly integrate verifiable credentials into existing systems and scale to meet needs, thereby providing a low-cost, low-code way for companies and organizations to build their own Trusted Digital Ecosystem with zero trust architecture. Indicio provides all the support, training, and continuous upgrades needed. Indicio Proven Works is a fully open source product allowing customers to own it and can customize it in whichever way meets their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key benefits of Indicio Proven Works:</p>
 
 Employees can be quickly verified without having to use either email or multi-factor authentication. 
 Verifiable credentials can be layered onto existing systems quickly—implementations are quickly achievable and do not require replacing current investments. 
 Credentials can be quickly revoked and reissued if they expire, the employee leaves the company, or a security issue is identified. 
 The employee holds the information in a verifiable credential and can share it by consent using encrypted, peer-to-peer communication. 
 Simplifies enrollment with external payroll and benefits providers. 
 As a proof of identity, an employee credential can also be used in a wide variety of contexts where proof of employment is critical, such as insurance policies, mortgage applications, and bank loans 
 Simple, intuitive user interface using QR codes and swiping. 
 The credential verification process makes it easier to manage the continuous verification required by zero trust security architectures. 
 Verifiable credentials can be easily scaled to manage thousands of employees. 
 
<p>“Usually, new technology requires replacing existing systems or complex integrations and lots of development time. Indicio Proven Works is designed to eliminate all these obstacles,” said Ken Ebert, CTO at Indicio. “We’ve removed the learning curve to open source code and built a product that can be layered into your existing systems so that you can start issuing verifiable credentials quickly. You can customize the product to highly specific needs—or we can do it for you. This is the quickest, lowest cost route to digital transformation that delivers privacy and security on top of immediately actionable data.”</p>

				 <p>By Peter Strobel</p>
<p>JSON-LD W3C Verifiable Credentials are a popular credential format in the Decentralized Identity community. They complement the Anonymous Credentials (AnonCreds) credential format; both formats are supported by Aries Cloud Agent – Python (ACA-Py) and can be combined to fulfill a variety of use cases. This credential format was the subject of our Indicio Meetup last monday, and we hope those who attended took away valuable insights into the utility of JSON-LD credentials! During the incredible meetup, the Indicio experts covered five points key to understanding JSON-LD credentials and their use in ACA-Py!</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Five Main Takeaways:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are JSON-LD Credentials?</p>
<p>Starting with the name, JSON-LD stands for <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JavaScript Object Notation with Linked Data.</a> JSON-LD is a method of encoding linked data using JSON. The term “JSON-LD Credential” alone is somewhat ambiguous but the way it is colloquially used, it means a W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model compliant credential signed using Linked Data Proofs. These are more precisely referred to as Linked Data Proof Verifiable Credentials (LDP-VCs).</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why JSON-LD Credentials?</p>
<p>LDP-VCs can be held and presented by anyone, whether they are the subject of the credential or not! This handy feature allows a holder to present authentic data about a party other than ourselves. It may seem counterintuitive from an AnonCreds perspective, where privacy and control are guiding principles. However, in the case where we need credentials from public entities whose claims are about public information, the process of exchanging verifiable information becomes incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Additionally, LDP-VCs cryptography is simpler when compared to AnonCreds’ Camenisch-Lysyanskaya (CL) signatures. CL signatures require Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) keys, which are large and potentially slow in constrained environments like Internet of Things (IoT). While there is specialized crypto hardware for IoT and similar constrained platforms, CL signatures are not widely supported on those modules. LDP-VCs, however, support multiple commonly-supported signature types, such as ED25519, BBS+, and JWS2020 (although for now, ACA-Py only supports ED25519 and BBS+).</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Components + Features of LDP-VCs:</p>
<p>Type Property: Denotes the type of verifiable credential (passport, driver’s license, etc.). Helps processors determine if the object provided is appropriate for its goal. For example, you wouldn’t provide a driver’s license if you needed to get onto an international flight.</p>
<p>Issuer Property: Denotes the Issuer of a verifiable credential. This will generally be the Issuer’s DID.</p>
<p>Issuance Date: Denotes the date and time at which a credential becomes valid. Must be present and must be in XML dateTime format.</p>
<p>Credential Subject Property: Contains claims about one or more subjects. Must contain one or more objects containing one or more claims. In AnonCreds terms, we would call these “credential attributes.”</p>
<p>Context Property: Must contain all terms used in the credential. In LDP-VCs, you can specify many contexts; if your credential has multiple (and most will, since all must at least contain the core context which doesn’t define any claim terms), all contexts are joined together. If a term used in the credential is not found in these joined contexts, the document is not considered valid. In AnonCreds terms, this could be considered the equivalent of a credential schema</p>
<p>Proof Property: Enables verification of the claims expressed in a LDP-VC. At least one proof mechanism and the details necessary to evaluate the proof must be present.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarities to AnonCreds:</p>
<p>Where Indy AnonCreds uses credential schema’s to define credential attributes, LDP-VCs use what are known as “contexts,” as described above in Take Away #1. While the feature seems odd, these are similar to AnonCreds schemas, but there are some differences worth mentioning.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An LDP-VCs context defines the terms used in the credential, including claim attribute names, type, issuer, issuance date, and other core credential properties. AnonCreds schemas, however, only define two credential terms: attributes and claims.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contexts must contain all terms used in the credential, and in JSON-LD you can specify many contexts! If your credential has multiple contexts, all are joined together Frankenstein style. AnonCreds has a similar requirement that all attributes found in a credential must be found within the schema, but does not permit joining together different schemas.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use in ACA-Py:</p>
<p>While AnonCreds can use issue-credential v1 protocol with either present-proof v1 or v2, LDP-VCs in ACA-Py are only compatible with issue-credential v2 and present-proof v2 protocols, as they are flexible enough and have a sufficiently long list of supported signature types. This means that support for v2 versions of both protocols will need to be added to your agents in addition to LDP-VC support. ACA-Py supports both protocols, but you will need to adjust your controllers to the new v2 endpoints to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>LDP-VCs are still being developed through contribution and discussion within the Hyperledger community, and you can contribute too! Several open source groups are looking for new members, including the DIDComm Users Group (DIDComm UG), ACA-Py Users Group (ACAPUG), and Aries Working Group (AWG). You can find more information on open source projects Indicio contributes to <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-source/">here.</a></p>
<p>The Hyperledger Discord is also an excellent resource for engaging with the community/getting up to date on the latest code pushes. Discussion is always active as newer ACA-Py versions are getting released! Code contributions are also appreciated, though we do encourage people to stay up-to-date with community calls or open a GitHub issue before making major changes, to make sure contributions can be merged.</p>
<p>To learn more about JSON-LDs and ACA-Py we encourage you to watch the latest&nbsp; <a href="https://youtu.be/7k37FdBYX6I">Indicio Insights</a>, or for a deeper dive, you can watch the recording of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i75OIZDmUs">full meetup</a> recently hosted by myself and Daniel Bluhm on the topic.</p>
<p>The next <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/290011345/">Indicio Meetup</a> is scheduled for December 13 and will feature Andin C.G. Bikker of Aruba, Nancy Norris of British Columbia’s Ministry for Energy, and Elizabeth M. Tanner, Esq., Secretary of Commerce, Rhode Island for a conversation on decentralized identity, digital transformation, and government.</p>

 What is a Verifiable Credential <p>A Verifiable Credential (VC) is a cryptographically secure, tamper-evident digital-twin of paper documents. A Verifiable Credential possesses the same attributes as a paper-based credential — subject, issuing authority, credential type, attributes, evidence, and constraints — but is more trustworthy and secure in a digital&nbsp;format.</p><p>A full list of benefits of VCs&nbsp;include:</p>  Data Quality: Shared credential definitions power automated review at scale with zero ambiguity  Privacy Protection: Only authorized parties can access digital&nbsp;data  Authorization: Authoritative digital signatures can always be traced back to the original&nbsp;signer  Selective Disclosure: Credential holders can selectively share information as&nbsp;desired  Integrity: Tamper-evident data, signatures, and time stamps prove legitimacy and build reputation  Offline Verification: Credentials can be verified from paper or digital copies without internet&nbsp;access  <p>Verifiable Credentials are currently a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C standard, which means it is formally recommended as a set of technical specifications which developers can use to enable industry specific use cases. </a>This standard is already being adopted by large Fortune 500 companies and regulators across the world to enable trust and transparency in their processes and in developing actionable insights that rely on a trusted data&nbsp;set.</p> How Transmute Uses Verifiable Credentials: Secure Digital&nbsp;Twins <p>Verifiable Credentials are built into the Transmute DNA as a core competency in our business model and in our product, the Verifiable Data Platform (VDP), a platform that allows enterprise teams to secure the exchange of critical transactions in near-real time. Transmute has worked tirelessly, and continues to work, with supply chain organizations and conducting third party research to define the data elements within each Verifiable Credential. We publish each VC defined in the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/#credentials">Traceability Vocabulary, an open source repository </a>that anyone can see, and is particularly useful to developers and businesses. Recent examples of essential global trade Verifiable Credentials that Transmute has defined include: Commercial Invoice, Bill of Lading, Mill Test Report, and Packing&nbsp;List.</p><p>Today, Transmute offers 25+ Verifiable Credentials out-of-the-box and ready to use within Transmute VDP. Transmute VDP enables ecosystems of all sizes and industries to leverage the power of Verifiable Credentials via both our web application and the&nbsp;API.</p> Verifiable Credentials in the Supply Chain Industry: A Steel Industry&nbsp;Example <p>Today, there are several examples of the use of Verifiable Credentials in the supply chain industry. We’ll highlight one example below — Mill Test&nbsp;Reports.</p><p>The Mill Test Report is a critical quality assurance document used to certify the chemical and physical properties in metals. When importing steel into the U.S., the Mill Test Report is required for entry by U.S. CBP, but in its current insecure format, is susceptible to:</p>  Human error that can stall shipments, halt business, and unnecessarily lose money for businesses and the government;  Forgeries to reduce their tariff fees, update the country of origin to a more desirable country, overstate the quality of the steel, and myriad other reasons that provide an unfair advantage over companies adhering to global regulatory standards   My Experience: Verifiable Credentials can Transform Global&nbsp;Trade <p>Prior to Transmute, I worked exclusively deploying proprietary supply chain software and had no exposure to Verifiable Credentials. I found that one of the core reasons why companies would deploy new software was digitalization. Many companies still operate today via spreadsheets which are not scalable, not very reportable, and not efficient. The companies I interacted with leveraged software to enhance their business processes and facilitate their day-to-day operations digitally; specifically, they did so by having systems digitally create a Commercial Invoice, PO, BOL, Proof of Delivery, and other critical trade documents. These documents would then be archived or printed then provided to another company as the goods move throughout the supply chain, which is minimal digitization without any security measures.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials have the power to optimize digitization and bring trust and traceability to trade documents, ensuring that data remains accurate and tamper-proof as it moves from company-to-company. Given my hands-on experience in global trade, I am confident that the supply chain industry is on the brink of a major break-through in technology with the implementation of Verifiable Credentials.</p><p>Matt Berry, Transmute’s Enterprise Delivery Manager, works with organizations of every size to achieve maximum value using the Transmute SaaS platform.</p><p>Connect with Matt on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-berry-99905646">LinkedIn</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 Despite being one of the most challenging periods in crypto history, the cryptocurrency exchange giant has doubled down on its growth plans.&nbsp; 



 



<p>American crypto exchange giant Coinbase has announced plans to appoint new executives to its top team to boost its European expansion efforts. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision for Coinbase to focus on the European market seems like a natural step to take, considering the region’s recent efforts to bring stability and consistency to the market via the creation of the world’s most substantial crypto regulatory framework, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and the complimentary <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds</a> (TFR) Act. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase, which counts over 73 million global users with operations in over one hundred countries, has promoted several of its long-serving employees to capitalize on the growing, yet still unstable market. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The new executive appointments come at a time when the industry is still reeling from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/23/ftx-binance-crypto-market">failure of FTX</a>, which collapsed during a liquidity crisis in November, triggering widespread anxiety and igniting calls for stricter regulatory supervision of the crypto sector. Like other prominent crypto service providers, Coinbase is also suffering from the impact of the downturn in the crypto industry, which has only been exacerbated by FTX’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The turmoil of the last few weeks has certainly impacted the reputation of the crypto market, with the full extent of the consequences of the crypto winter only to be revealed in the months to come. The “drip by drip” release of information regarding the FTX downfall makes long-term predictions more difficult. It also interferes with the ideal strategy of being able to move quickly in order to identify and address causes of&nbsp;mishaps, devise safeguards, and move on. In this unique case, however, new information continues to come to light on an almost daily basis, which would appear to be clear warning signs to industry insiders. </p>



<p>In the short term, Coinbase’s move will likely be seen as a positive, and lead to a renewed incentive by policymakers and regulators to ensure Europe can offer a safe and secure regulatory environment. It is also probable that with the arrival of such a large player, a benchmark of performance and conduct will be set. This will undoubtedly increase competition among the smaller, European crypto exchange platforms, and ultimately be a positive for the crypto consumer.&nbsp;</p>



 Breaking down and building up.&nbsp; 



<p>Despite Coinbase’s planned European expansion, in June 2022, it dismissed 1,100 employees, and a further 60 employees were laid off from its recruitment team in early November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some of its new appointments include the promotion of its long-serving employees. Patrick Elyas, formerly the Market Director of Expansion at Coinbase EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and the African region), will now assume a role mainly focusing on European expansion. Elke Karksens will take over the position of Coinbase’s country director in the UK. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Michael Schroeder, previously working as Chief Compliance and Risk Officer at Bittrex, has been appointed as the director of controls for Germany. Corman Dinan, formerly serving as General Manager at Crypto.com in Ireland, will assume the role of director of Ireland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new executives’ supervision, Coinbase plans to broaden its customer base, introduce new digital financial products, expand into new markets, and join forces with regulators, policymakers, and financial institutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new appointments are in keeping with Coinbase’s belief that Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were taking the initiative in creating a secure and suitable regulatory environment for crypto.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nana Murugesan, Coinbase’s Vice President of International and Business Development, and Daniel Seifert, Regional Vice President and Managing Director, see the regions as standard setters, and an example of what can be achieved when the “political will” is present. According to Murugesan and Seifert, the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/buying-crypto-without-kyc-immense-risk/">repercussions and dangers</a> for investors and clients of an offshore, unregulated entity have never been more evident than in the past few weeks.</p>

 Coinbase ceases support for 4 digital coins.&nbsp; 



<p>If any further evidence was needed to attest to how notoriously unpredictable the crypto market could be, on <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-coinbase-wallet-removes-xrp-support-whats-going-on.htm">November 29,</a> Coinbase announced that its Coinbase Wallet would no longer be supporting four digital coins: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Ripple (XRP) as of January 2023. &nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the exchange, the decision to delist these four leading digital coins is part of its regular evaluation to introduce new structures that will improve accessibility on Web3. Consequently, the exchange cited “low use” as its reason for ceasing its support for these crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exchange has assured customers that their balances from any of the now-delisted assets are still linked to their addresses, meaning they can access them via the Coinbase Wallet recovery process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also worth mentioning that the announcement refers to the Coinbase Wallet and app discontinuing support for the digital coins. You can still buy the coins on Coinbase and Coinbase pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The abrupt delisting of XRP surprised many, considering it ranks as the seventh-largest crypto asset by market cap. Furthermore, XRP has been subject to a lot of speculation due to its ongoing litigation with the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC). With the summary judgment date nearing, it is a surprise that Coinbase decided not to wait to hear the results of the verdict.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform stopped the trading of XRP in January 2021 after a lawsuit between the issuer, Ripple, and the US SEC. Moreover, the crypto exchange backed investors initiating proceedings against the Department of Treasury against Tornado Cash over the sanction. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Because of this, the exchange revealed its transaction volume decreased by 44% from $655 million (second quarter of 2022) to $366 million in the third fiscal quarter (Q3 2022).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to delist these crypto assets could be considered a risky move for Coinbase. Each coin possesses a great deal of support from the crypto community and could therefore discourage people from purchasing other digital currencies on their site in fear that they may also be delisted sooner than one would expect. That said, this perhaps further highlights the risk profile – or intelligence –&nbsp;of Coinbase. Despite “headwinds” they are making investment in growth, and are not alone, as just a week later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-hunt-bargain-crypto-firms-after-ftx-fiasco-2022-12-06/">Goldman Sachs</a> announced it was preparing to make significant investment in crypto ecosystem assets.&nbsp;</p>



 Role of the regulators.&nbsp; 



<p>The chief priority for regulators and policymakers is to find the right balance between promoting financial stability and consumer protection and fostering innovation and accessibility in the financial markets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upcoming crypto regulations, such as MiCA and TFR, whose main objective is to facilitate the safe and responsible use of cryptocurrencies across the EU region, have clearly played a crucial role in Coinbase’s decision to enter the market. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These legal frameworks will improve the playing field for service providers and enable them to maintain high industry standards, provide greater protection, and build trust. At the same time, a legal framework and stricter verification requirements for crypto asset transfers to and from self-hosted wallets will enable service providers and customers a clearer path for further investment and growth within this ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Leading by example.&nbsp; 



<p>Coinbase offers more than 170 crypto assets on its platform and is considered one of the most secure crypto exchanges. Many newcomers use the exchange to purchase their first ever crypto assets. The brand recognition as a trusted entry point cannot be underestimated as we enter a new phase of this crypto advancement in the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are, however, more than 500 other global crypto exchanges. While the smaller exchanges may tend to focus solely on the domestic or regional market, the larger ones attract customers from around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision for a crypto company as large and influential as Coinbase to enter Europe should be welcomed by big and small crypto exchanges alike. Recent events have caused a lot of apprehension, and affected trust in the market, but this move shows that Coinbase maintains confidence in the industry and is demonstrating it while belts are being tightened globally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although 2022 has not been as successful a year for crypto as 2021, 2023 looks like it could well be the making for the crypto industry as service providers prepare for the final implementation of MiCA in 2024. Increased attention and awareness of crypto has led to a surge of interest from everyday users to multinational investment banks, as referenced above. With wider adoption, especially from global corporation <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">comes more opportunities</a> for registered crypto exchanges and traditional banks that may be looking to enter the space for the first time.&nbsp;</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto.&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can expand, even amid an evolving crypto regulatory landscape. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.&nbsp;</p>

 Harness the Security of Enterprise-Grade MPC and Democratize it for Mainstream Users <p>As the leading non-custodial authentication infrastructure provider with over 8M monthly users, Web3Auth has launched the MPC (Multi-Party Computation) wallet SDK. We are aiming to bring seamless logins and enterprise-grade security from the institutional level to the user&nbsp;level.</p><p>To date, more than 20% of all mined Bitcoin is lost due to mismanaged or stolen seed phrases. To remove this main friction of web3 onboarding and key management issue, it’s time to say bye to the seed&nbsp;phrase.</p><p>On a mission to provide the most seamless login experience for users, wallets, and dapps, recently we integrated our MPC via @Metamask snaps. Take a sneak peek at a Web3 world without seed&nbsp;phrases</p><p>Other than Metamask, we are onboarding key Web2 gaming players like <a href="https://www.neowizglobal.com/">NEOWIZ</a> and <a href="https://glip.gg/">Glip</a> <a href="https://www.nafeza.gov.eg/en">NAFEZA</a>. Egypt’s newly launched customs platform for importing and exporting also leverages Web3Auth’s MPC technology to seamlessly and securely onboard its users to the blockchain.</p><p>A lot of exciting partners in the pipeline, but first let’s review some&nbsp;basics…</p> What is&nbsp;MPC? <p>MPC, or Multi-Party Computation, is Web3’s version of multi-factor authentication (MFA). It allows users to manage their keys intuitively by using multiple factors to protect their keys, instead of just relying on a single seed phrase to remove it in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes it possible to design crypto wallets that rely on multiple factors to access a user’s funds. It is currently the gold standard for enterprise-grade crypto custody solutions and is used widely by exchanges and financial institutions for managing&nbsp;crypto.</p> Why use MPC technology?   MPC is currently the golden standard for enterprise key management which Bitgo and Fireblocks currently offer.  Coinbase introduced an MPC alpha/beta into their wallet earlier in the year, and now we’re unveiling our MPC SDK that enables any wallet or app to do the same for their&nbsp;users.  Being able to build on the latest and greatest, we’ve optimized the infrastructure to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for globally-distributed low-latency signing.  Our MPC SDK leverages existing and familiar UI/UX flows, including simple one-click logins and others, check out the flow&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1022785836284129320/1034363507157782538/One_Click_flow.gif">here</a>   How is our SDK different from other MPC solutions?   Our MPC is the perfect Externally Owned Account (EOA) and can be paired with Gnosis Safe and other Smart Contract Wallet infrastructure (more on this coming&nbsp;soon).  The existing MPC solutions offered today are all targeted at large enterprises. These MPC solutions are expensive, require a long setup process, or are just too slow to run on consumer&nbsp;devices.  <p>We think that MPC is too important and too crucial of a technology to be kept out of reach of the average user. MPC security should be the standard for all web3 wallets today. As a wallet infrastructure provider, we have optimized our MPC SDKs to be usable on all devices, across multiple platforms, with support for geo-distributed low-latency signing. It doesn’t matter if you’re a game, an app, a Chrome extension, or even a web wallet running in a mobile browser — our SDKs support&nbsp;that.</p> Our MPC technology key feature&nbsp;includes   1.2-second transaction speed (challenge it if you don’t believe&nbsp;us).  We are chain agnostic (secp256k1, ed25519, BLS and more&nbsp;support)  Our SDK can be embedded into any web, mobile, and native application.  The MPC SDK is geo-distributed and horizontally scaled for global distribution.  <p>For those of you that are already familiar with the multi-factor keys security model at Web3Auth, this blog is just another incremental step towards improving private key security.</p><p>For those of you who aren’t familiar, here’s how multi-factor keys&nbsp;work:</p> Leveraging our MPC SDK, you can expect the following benefits   Reduces account loss from misplaced seed&nbsp;phrases  <p>There is no seed phrase to manage — shares are managed by intuitive MFA flows that users are familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>2. Prevent compromised device vulnerabilities</p><p>User accounts are not subjected to frontend vulnerabilities as MPC’s joint computation allows for keyless&nbsp;usage.</p><p>3. Avoid losing funds from dubious transactions</p><p>Safeguard your users’ accounts with a flexible policy engine to set rules — daily transaction limits and blacklist scams.</p><p>4. Expect fluid experiences</p><p>Expect a low latency of less than 1.5s for both login and transaction signing. Allow your users to focus on engaging with your&nbsp;product.</p><p>5. You own the UX, we can be a white-label service&nbsp;provider</p><p>Our MPC can be embedded into any dapp and/or wallet — you own the experience.</p><p>6. You Don’t need to compromise your stack, any platform any&nbsp;chain</p><p>Our MPC SDK is blockchain agnostic, it works on Web, Mobile, and Native applications.</p> Wanna try&nbsp;it? <p>We have an alpha SDK that you can use today <a href="https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc">https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/web/web3auth-mpc</a>.

<p>Learn how Fission models its work and communication style on the distributed systems we help build and support.</p> <p>Fission is a Canadian company but has been fully remote since its inception. Our team of talented Fissioneers is distributed across 7 countries and 5 continents. While remote work arrangements have been popular amongst tech companies for a long time, it goes deeper than that for Fission. We are not only a distributed company, we are a distributed systems company! Our work focuses on building tools for IPFS, a protocol and peer to peer network. <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/diving-deeper-webnative-file-system/">WNFS</a> and eventually <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Dialog</a> and <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">IPVM</a> would not be possible without distributed systems.</p><p>It's interesting how our company structure mirrors the work we do. In fact, computer programmer Melvin Conway remarked on this very phenomenon:</p><blockquote>"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." - Melvin Conway</blockquote><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's Law</a>, as it has come to be known, basically says that a company's complex products will inevitably end up being shaped like the system they are designed within or for. </p> The Benefits of Async Communication <p>As a company that hires colleagues across time zones and countries, async communication is vitally important to us. It wouldn't be sustainable if we asked a colleague in Asia to join a meeting or be available mid-day U.S. Eastern time. And we'd much rather hire the right person for the job than the person that was fine but available. And there are so many other benefits to async communication, including an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#six-major-benefits-of-asynchronous-working">increasing employee agency, alleviating stress and supporting mental health, and boosting efficiency</a>. &nbsp;</p> Discord <p>There are several methods and tools that we use to work efficiently in a fully remote/distributed company. A forum is an excellent tool for async communication, and we'll share more on how we utilize Discourse for our <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/">Talk forum</a> in a future post in this series. </p><p>So why then, are we talking about Discord today? Discord offers many benefits, and we've developed some unique techniques for using it in a more asynchronous way. For those unfamiliar, Discord is a text, voice, and video communication platform. It started out as a popular place for gamers to connect and stream their adventures, and today it has become a popular place for building and nurturing communities with <a href="https://discord.com/company">150 million monthly active users</a>. </p><p>Fission's Discord server has two main functions - to serve our developer community, and to serve our internal community. We love being able to flex between chats with colleagues to adding to discussions or answering questions from our developer community while using one tool! We have channels for "start-here" and "server-guidelines" to help give all members their footing, and then it expands from there, with channel topics ranging from distributed systems to identity and auth to owning your data.</p><p>Today we'll put the spotlight on how we're leveraging Discord and the ways we've made it a powerful async tool for our team.</p> #Stand-Up-Down Channel <p>Discord uses channels to organize topics, and categories to organize those channels. One channel we use every day is #stand-up-down. This is where we share what we're working on that day. Most of us track our to-do lists using our own methods, but the purpose of sharing our daily tasks here comes down to transparency and accountability. </p><p>Transparently sharing what we're working on gives other Fissioneers some insight into what we have on our plates. It also often sparks helpful comments from other team members. For example, if I post that I'm going to do outreach for a particular project, a team member might comment that they can introduce me to a specific person directly. </p><p>Accountability to ourselves and to our team members is also very important. It removes the need to ask team members for updates because we share them directly in the channel. Managers can see at a glance what their whole team is working on that day, which can help them plan projects accordingly.</p><p>We also like to share how we're feeling by using a traffic light system - a green emoji means you're doing great, yellow means you're not quite feeling like yourself, and red is a heads-up that you're struggling and may need some additional patience or understanding from others. </p><p>For example, if a colleague just travelled 12 hours and changed multiple planes, cars, trains, and time zones to get to where they were going, they'll likely be feeling jetlagged and exhausted the next day. When this is the case, a colleague can post a yellow or red emoji. This usually signals they need extra time to rest/recover, so perhaps expect some delays in responses or changes to their work schedule in the meantime. </p>An example of a "stand up" post<p>Throughout the day colleagues will check off tasks they've completed or note which to-do's are getting pushed. We may also share a "stand down" message where we give an update on what was completed or provide additional notes if we feel it would be helpful to add more context. </p> Monologue Channels <p>One Fission Discord invention people outside the company love to learn more about is our monologue channels. Every person who is part of the team gets their own channel. These channels act like our virtual desks. Colleagues can swing by and have a chat, or drop a note if the owner is away. This is particularly useful in bringing something to a person’s attention without pushing a notification, which is really important in an asynchronous environment when we are being mindful of our colleague's timezones.</p><p>Monologue channels are a space for people to think out loud, let others know if they are AFK for an appointment, etc. (A note on AFK - At Fission we encourage breaks and don't require colleagues to signal when they're going for lunch, back from lunch, taking a walk to reset, etc. We like to give everyone the space to complete their work without feeling pressured to give constant updates.)</p><p>Since they are visible to all team members, sometimes one person will see a link or note that someone else has shared in a person's monologue channel, and join in on the conversation (similar to any other channel in the server). We call these "monologue parties". 🥳 This can turn out to be very helpful, because sometimes others have additional insight that you didn't know to ask for! </p>A snippet of our monologue channels. We also choose emojis to represent us.<p>If you want to ask your co-worker a question that is a bit more time-sensitive, you can mention them by typing @ followed by their handle. We've found this much more helpful than back and forth emails.</p> Department Categories <p>We have loosely defined departments characterized by the different projects our talented Fissioneers are working on. Organizing these channels under department categories makes them easier to find when we are searching for certain info or want to pose a question to several team members at once/whoever sees it first without notifying them all individually. </p><p>For example, we have a category that houses our marketing, operations, design, and events channels all in one place. Since marketing helps with events and operations helps with marketing and so on, it acts as a mini home base for team members within the larger server.</p><p>We have many channels in our server, and we never want a colleague to feel like they need to keep up with every conversation. Department categories allow us to introduce hierarchy into the server. This, combined with a special "internal" channel, helps alleviate information overload. </p> <p>These are a few strategies we've used to help us work more intuitively in a decentralized and distributed company. Do you work remotely? Have there been any activities or tools that you've found helpful? Share them in our <a href="https://discord.com/channels/478735028319158273/1039609318288408597/1040084300554571836">#distributed-remote-work</a> <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">Discord</a> channel or use the "<a href="https://talk.fission.codes/tag/distributed-working">distributed-working</a>" tag in <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/">Discourse</a>.

				  Indicio recently unveiled the Governance Editor — a client-side, open-source project that makes the creation of governance files simple and fast and is built using ReactJs framework and Redux.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Viacheslav “Simon” Nazarenko</p>
<p>The Governance Editor is the result of addressing a real-world customer need. Over a year ago, one of Indicio’s key clients needed a trust framework to help them to manage trusted interactions between Issuers and Verifiers of verifiable digital credentials. After some exhaustive research, we found that there was a distinct lack of solutions to the problem; and since there was nothing in use, we took it upon ourselves to build our own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio found a good starting point: a proposed Request for Comment (RFC) — a common community driven living document on GitHub — by Daniel Hardman (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/concepts/0430-machine-readable-governance-frameworks">Aries RFC 0430: Machine-Readable Governance Frameworks</a>) and modified it. After working with the Linux Foundation Public Health community to brainstorm ideas and discuss use cases, today, the project is at the final stage of becoming an RFC with the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF).</p>
<p>In the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) community, there is no agreement, as yet, on what a decentralized ecosystem governance framework should be or look like. Most people are hard-coding trust, which is to say, the rules for accepting which Issuers of verifiable credentials and which entities who wish to verify those credentials&nbsp; are to be trusted in a given decentralized ecosystem; and there are multiple workgroups working on trying to pin down governance on a conceptual level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio we believe that “code often wins” — meaning, it is better to bring a code template of the solution to the table, test on a real life scenario, and then present it to the community to get feedback and recommendations for improvement, rather than waste time on countless meetings talking about different strategies, approaches and architecture. Hence, the Governance Editor, which is now a working proof-of-concept for the community. The hope is that people will give feedback and help the Governance Editor evolve, based on their real-world problems and experiences.</p>
<p>Why is governance important?&nbsp;</p>
<p>To put it simply, governance enables those who need to verify information to understand who they can trust. In a perfect world, everyone would have access to, and use secure methods for issuing, presenting, and verifying data; that is not the case today. For example, nothing is technically stopping anyone from setting up a server and creating or using a Social Security schema (a schema defines what a credential should contain), and issuing Social Security Number credentials. In this scenario, a governance file is one good way for the verifier to be able to check if the credential has been issued by the government—the actual Department of Social Security—or by someone else, who, in this case, should not be trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is it designed for?</p>
<p>The Governance Editor is designed, primarily, for companies and organizations running decentralized ecosystems and who need a way to tell all the parties involved in the ecosystem who should be trusted to issue or verify credentials, and which schemas for credentials are acceptable. It is built to be as light and as simple as possible so anyone with minimal technical background can become&nbsp; an Issuer, create schemas, and add them to the file to be used in their ecosystem.</p>
<p>Next steps for the technology</p>
<p>Indicio is dedicated to making the Governance Editor as versatile and comprehensive as possible so that everyone can use it to govern their own scenario. The goal is to help the community to decide what they want from ecosystem governance so that it becomes universal for all sorts of areas (including transportation, health and finance). On the horizon, the plan is to add versioning support, where the editor will understand different governance file formats as well as signing and publishing standards. Depending on community feedback, potential new features that could be added to governance files include issuing and verification standards, internationalization and localization, and workflows.</p>
<p>The Governance Editor is currently an open source project with the goal of boosting awareness, development, and overall adaptation of this governance technology. This is one of the main reasons Indicio participated in the latest IIW — to show how much&nbsp; progress has been made in implementing governance in decentralized identity and hopefully inspire more conversations and more people to get involved.

     Intro 
                   <p>Our award-winning management book ‘Everything Transaction’ is now also available in German. (‘Alles Transaktion’).</p>

<p>In an increasingly digital world, every interaction is becoming a transaction. These transactions go beyond the exchange of money in return for a product or service. In fact, exchanges based on data are rapidly becoming the norm in the digital world. These data-driven transactions are becoming relevant across industries, and especially in the financial services industry in the shape of ‘Open Finance’. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Financial institutions have reached a strategic crossroads and need to answer several fundamental questions, including: How will transactions evolve in the context of financial services? What role should entities like financial institutions and service providers play? And which commercial opportunities and risks are involved?</p>

<p>These and many more questions are answered in the award-winning book called ‘Everything Transaction’, which has now also been published in German (‘Alles Transaktion’). The book offers numerous up-to-date insights and concepts for players operating in an increasingly data-driven economy, and helps executives better navigate the digital world from the unique perspective of data-driven transactions.</p>

  Tap to ID leverages SSI and NFC for identity and smart access control by 
the tap of a mobile phone or NFC smart card. It revolutionises smart access 
control to digital services or physical environments. This work has been 
partly funded by NGI eSSIF-lab and was presented at the essif-lab final 
event.

Tap to ID is a game-changing technology that leverages self-sovereign identity and NFC technology to provide secure and convenient authentication and access control.</p>
<p>With Tap to ID, users can simply tap their mobile phone or NFC smart card on a reader to verify their identity and gain access to a wide range of services, including reception-less check-in at hotels and airports, or access to secure buildings and facilities.</p>
<p>During the event, Caspar Roelofs gave a shortened presentation to demonstrate our Tap to ID technology. Above, you can find the extended presentation.</p>
<p>Our Tap to ID technology is a major breakthrough in the field of identity and access management, and we are excited to continue bringing it to market and helping organizations around the world improve their security and convenience.</p>
<p>We are grateful to the European NGI eSSIF-lab funding program for their support and are looking forward to continue working with them to develop and advance our Tap to ID technology even further.</p>

Credential transfer needs to be performed securely due to the sensitive nature of the information.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2021Nov/0100.html">OKTA Cloud Identity Integration with SSI wallet</a> sethi shivam (Tuesday, 23 November) <blockquote><p>I am successfully able to integrate Okta cloud identity with SSI agent .</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@sethisaab/okta-identity-cloud-integration-with-ssi-agent-ea1694a833cb">OKTA Identity Cloud Integration with SSI agent</a></p></blockquote> Looking for your feedback on how we can improve this more<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jan/0063.html">DIF Wallet Security WG - Wallet Implementers Survey</a> Bastian, Paul (Friday, 7 January) <blockquote><p>I summarized our <a href="https://nextcloud.idunion.org/s/D2cbMi6w8t3nPYj">goals and visions in this presentation</a>, for more information check out <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-security">the Github page</a></p><p>Also we ended up to initiating 2 new work items at the end of last year:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-security/blob/main/work_items/device_binding.md">Device Binding</a> (<a href="https://doodle.com/poll/bttcdxcqdn9cpziu">kickoff doodle</a>)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;* &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-security/blob/differential-credential-security-wg/work_items/differential_credential_security.md">Differential Credential Security</a></p></blockquote> <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Mar/0241.html">W3C CCG Wallet Protocol Analysis (WIP)</a> Manu Sporny (Thursday, 24 March) <blockquote><p>As most of us know, that eventually led to the realization of the many dimensions of decentralization and creation of the excellent "DID Method Rubric" by JoeA, RyanG, and DanielH (with support from a very large cast of characters in this community).</p><p>It feels like we're in the early throes of a "Wallet Rubric".</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/139dTcWp28LePAQjrA1uXVy4d154B22Y2d-vn5GvIaec/edit#">https://docs.google.com/document/d/139dTcWp28LePAQjrA1uXVy4d154B22Y2d-vn5GvIaec/edit#</a> [updated link]</p></blockquote> RDF  <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/2022Jun/0022.html">Importing Verifiable Data as Labeled Property Graphs</a> Orie Steele (Wednesday, 15 June) <blockquote><p>I think what happens is that a first blank node is created for the proof, and since that node has `@container` `@graph`, instead of being able to trace the relationships directly from credential to proof to verification method...</p><p>Each proof is being treated as a disjoint subgraph, and the relationship is not being preserved during import… [...]</p><p>I suspect this is solvable with a more complicated graph config: <a href="https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/config/">https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/config/</a></p><p>But I wonder if we might correct this behavior in VC Data Model 2.0, such that RDF representations don't have this odd behavior when imported as labeled property graphs.

<p>IDENTOS’ latest Navigator, slated for release in early 2023, focuses on filling the gap not met by existing digital front doors in the market</p>
<p><a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3728732-1&amp;h=2153554423&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identos.com%2F&amp;a=IDENTOS+Inc.">IDENTOS Inc.</a>, a leader in digital identity and access management, today announced the upcoming launch of the latest Community Navigator (Nav 3.0).&nbsp;&nbsp;Nav 3.0&nbsp;builds on the company’s previous Community Navigator product (Nav 2.0), a configurable digital front door, which leverages IDENTOS’&nbsp;<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3728732-1&amp;h=2041802463&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newswire.ca%2Fnews-releases%2Fidentos-puts-developers-first-in-its-latest-product-release-804667077.html&amp;a=FPX">FPX</a>&nbsp;standards based identity and consent APIs as spine services to safely share data across a set of trusted service partners for a fully privacy respecting, secure, and personalized user experience.</p>
<p>The IDENTOS Nav 3.0 will differentiate further by offering a muti-layered governance function that allows multiple enterprises and organizations (or tenants) to share infrastructure and work together, while concurrently having their own regional or jurisdictional governance processes for curating and listing their local digital services and relevant communications for their region.&nbsp; This is made possible with a content management system (CMS) that is tightly integrated with FPX as well as&nbsp;a flexible pricing model to accommodate the needs of its many tenants. The result is one app that can serve a large geography while enhancing a personalized and connected end-user journey.</p>
<p>Key contributors in the Nav 3.0 design process included Ontario Health (OH) and several Ontario Health Teams (OHTs). Over 50 patients, family advisors and a group of digital health leaders and representatives were engaged to align on objectives, scope, approach, and design principles.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Users want an easier way to navigate content, one that’s customizable and transparent about the user’s privacy and how information is collected and used.&nbsp; Engaging with a large group of experts and organizations enabled us to design a set of features for more efficient collaboration amongst stakeholders as well as an enhanced user experience.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;Lauren Dewar, Lead Designer, IDENTOS</p></blockquote>
<p>Availability</p>
<p>The IDENTOS’ NAV 3.0 will be available to new and existing customers in early&nbsp;2023.</p>
<p>Nav 3.0&nbsp;feature updates</p>

 At the Turning Point — How Crypto Interacts with Real World&nbsp;Assets  Mattereum CEO Vinay Gupta’s Presentation to the London Blockchain Summit on 17th November&nbsp;2022 <p>What I’m here to talk about is literally where’s the money. Here we are, we’re now 15 years into crypto, seven or eight years into Ethereum… There’s been an enormous amount of high fortunes made, fortunes lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made, lost, made,&nbsp;lost…</p><p>And we could do a lot better, right? Getting out of this cycle of hype and destruction and hype and destruction and hype and destruction, and another bunch of awful, hideous, nonsense happens and a whole bunch of people go… We’ve seen this, and it seems to be never-ending, because it just turns out that deregulated finance is not really safe at any speed. It doesn’t mean it couldn’t be made to work, but we don’t have mechanisms, and as a result we’re stuck in this hell of cyclical boom and blowout. And that hell of cyclical boom and blowout, we have to escape that, if we’re going to turn this into a real industry, rather than something which is going to be like the butt TV show jokes in 20 years, like&nbsp;Friends.</p><blockquote>We have an amazing transactional machinery, we can buy and sell anything on the blockchain</blockquote><p>To escape this cyclical boom-bust cycle, we have to put fundamentally valuable assets in. We have an amazing transactional machinery, we can buy and sell anything on the blockchain, as long as it can be defined using some kind of digital record, and I mean anything. Things that you didn’t even think were property became property: pictures of imaginary moneys, publicly-tradable essentially stock in companies that only just began to exist, like you do an IPO off your original deck. Lots and lots and lots of things have been tried, where we’ve invented new classes of property, and then we’ve sold those new classes of property on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>What I want to suggest is that the flaws of the blockchain industry are the flaws of the new classes of property that we’re trading, not flaws of the technology for trade. We have exchange infrastructure which is powerful enough to do anything, you can imagine a new asset class, you can turn it into a token, you can sell the tokens and the exchange infrastructure can carry it, but the problem is that most of these newly-invented kinds of property are crap. And as a result, you get a wave of enthusiasm where everybody is like “Oh, this new kind of property is amazing!” and then the new kind of property just implodes.</p><blockquote>Separate out the fantastic technology we have for doing trade from the crappy assets which turn out to&nbsp;explode</blockquote><p>What I’m suggesting is that at a strategic level we can separate out the fantastic technology we have for doing trade from the crappy assets which turn out to explode every time we look at them wrong. And hard assets like gold, real estate, other kinds of commercial assets loaded into the blockchain, with the existing transaction architectures that we have, I believe this is the future of the crypto industry, it’s the everything exchange. And <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">all of the infrastructure that we’ve built</a>, whether the stuff is non-fungible or fungible, whether it’s physical, atomic things, or whether it’s liquid assets like wheat or corn or whatever it happens to be… We have a global exchange infrastructure that’s capable of handling it, we have ways of minting the things, creating and managing them… We could build extremely transparent representations of value, where you can drill down digitally to see every last detail about something, and if this is what we do in the next round of activity in the crypto industry, that round might be the round that doesn’t bust. Because the collapse in these systems has not been a collapse triggered by the exchange infrastructure failing; it’s a collapse that’s been triggered by the assets&nbsp;failing.</p><p>Now, I note here FTX is kind of an exception to that. But generally speaking, apart from poorly, poorly-managed financial architectures like Bear Stearns… It’s not that the underlying machinery goes wrong and the Bitcoin blockchain falls over and everybody loses their Bitcoin. The machines for moving the value are secure; the actual sources of value are less secure. If we put more secure, harder value on chain, we’re going to get a very different world, we’re going to get a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/relevance-of-on-chain-asset-tokenization">report </a>about this stuff that just came out from <a href="https://www.bcg.com/">Boston Consulting Group</a>, and the report is startling — we’re right in the middle of this space, and we’ve found this report remarkably startling! They’re talking about 10% of global GDP, $16 trillion a year of tokenised legal assets by 2030. And they’re not the only people talking in this direction, there’s a whole bunch of other sources that are making noises in this direction. There seems to be a general consensus that hard assets are what comes next, and that consensus is from real-world entities like Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, like actual players in the real world say tokenisation of equity, security tokens, bond markets, equity and real estate… all of these kinds of things are what they see as being the future of this&nbsp;space.</p><blockquote>They’re talking about 10% of global GDP, $16 trillion a year of tokenised legal assets by&nbsp;2030</blockquote><p>And these numbers get much larger than the entire crypto industry very, very quickly. Because we’re not creating that value from scratch, as Bitcoin goes from being worth 25 cents to $25,000; what we’re talking about is taking existing value, and just moving how that value is transferred. Instead of it being transferred on Crest, they’re transferring it on Ethereum — simple.</p><p>And this kind of growth, it’s predictable inasmuch as if you have better exchange technology, when people have to sell something or buy something, they will do it using whatever the best available exchange is; if the best available exchange for buying and selling something is a crypto exchange, a crypto exchange is where you’re buying and selling. But at this point, if what you are looking at was a bunch of hard assets — like gold, classic cars, oil paintings, 50 tonnes of wheat, 35 acres of agricultural land — if all of those things are trading in the same exchange as some Bitcoin and some Ether, is that crypto exchange, or is that just the everything exchange?</p><blockquote>He’s going to use the blockchain to handle property rights on&nbsp;Mars</blockquote><p>As long as you can figure out how to tokenise the value, then you can buy and sell in the same exchange infrastructure we have, using the blockchain to keep the systems honest. And that doesn’t have to stay within this tokenised business-as-usual sector. It is possible to go from tokenised business-as-usual, this set of assets here: listed equity, unlisted equity, other equity, investment funds, bonds, all this stuff… Yes, you can tokenise all of that stuff, you can securitise it, you can have securities exchanges and it will work. But also, there’s other tokenisable assets, which we’ve got $4.8 trillion by 2030… That doesn’t have to be existing classes of assets, that can be new kinds of things. Securitisations of revenue streams, there’s a bunch of that stuff happening in crypto, it’s not so much done in the real world — that could become a large sector. Elon Musk expects to have rockets on Mars by that time, you know that he’s going to use the blockchain to handle property rights on Mars in all probability, because if you’re going to take a new planet and carve it up into acres that people could go out and put solar panels on, probably an actual thing to do would be to use a blockchain, in the same way if you did it in the 1990s you’d use an SQL database.</p><p>So, this prospect of taking the existing systems and getting them on chain, and taking the new systems and getting them on chain, you wind up in a position where everything becomes interfungible, rather than having a bunch of separated, balkanised markets, which are very, very loosely connected. This also opens up possibilities for things like smart barter. There’s a company called NeoSwap, they have an algorithm for switching around value between lots of different people, as long as everything is represented as NFTs, without requiring it to be bought and sold at every step — extremely powerful, because it means you can do trade with minimum liquidity.</p><p>And it’s not an unrealistic rate of growth, when they say $16 trillion by 2030. If you look at the influx of stablecoins, $160 billion of hard assets went into the crypto ecosystem in a two-year period, and the rapidity of that transfer was because you didn’t have to make the assets from scratch; the assets were already there, you just move them out of the wire transfer land and you put them back into blockchain land. So, if you were doing this kind of transfer, but it was stocks, it was bonds, it was real estate, it was gold bullion, it was everything else, you could get a very, very rapid movement of trillions of value on chain, without having this weird thing that money is being printed and coming from nowhere — it’s not a fiat economy at this point; it’s actually an asset-backed economy.</p><p>Now, the question then is could this possibly work, is it legally possible to do this? And the answer is yes. My company has done this in custodied assets in five jurisdictions, and transactions in another three, out of the 170 jurisdictions that it’s possible to do this in. So this is not some kind of long-term, long-reach pipedream; buying and selling physical assets as tokens with the correct legal bindings behind them is a thing you can do here and now over almost the entire world. It’s trickier if the things that you’re buying and selling are things like securities, but if you’re selling commodities, or if you’re selling gold bricks or whatever it is, physical artwork, classic cars… The vast majority of the sort of battle rattle of civilisation is saleable right now all over the world, on relatively clear and easily understood deterministic legals. It’s not that we need massive changes in law in every jurisdiction to be able to do this; buying and selling a physical object on eBay and buying and selling a physical object on OpenSea look very similar to the&nbsp;law.</p><p>And that track record, we’ve literally just gone in the last year and a half, asset class by asset class by asset class by asset class, starting with the infamous William Shatner toy collection — I say “toys”, but I think that’s a bad word for that stuff; memorabilia [laughter] Yeah, because one does not want to invoke the wrath of Shatner — just look what he did to Jeff Bezos! That landscape, we’ve just gone asset class by asset class by asset class by asset class, making sure that it works… And in the course of a year and a half, we literally went from Shatner’s memorabilia collection to a two-million-dollar plot of land on the south coast of England. And that trajectory is not just stuff inside of the UK; that’s across a whole bunch of different countries.</p><blockquote>We went a little deeper into the legals, we solved it for a whole set of jurisdictions and a whole bunch of different asset&nbsp;classes</blockquote><p>So, that capability, now that it’s here, we can scale assets on this platform very, very fast. And we are not the only people doing this. We took a somewhat different approach from most of the other companies who are in this space. Most of those companies operate inside of one jurisdiction for one asset class; we went a little deeper into the legals, we solved it for a whole set of jurisdictions and a whole bunch of different asset classes. But at the end of the day, it’s not just “<a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-mattereum-universal-bridge-e86bca2db220">Hey, Mattereum does this amazing thing!”</a> it’s that this amazing thing is the future of the blockchain space, a whole bunch of different people have understood that… And what does this space look like in two years, if you come to conferences like this, and two-thirds of the room are gold industry, real estate industry, airline industry, talking about tokenising and selling the physical things that they’re buying and selling: airline tickets, concert tickets, real estate… I keep coming back to bullion, because given how unstable the financial markets are and how much inflation we have, bullion is a potentially very important asset class, once you can make it appropriately tradable internationally in blockchain-style transactions, rather than the current restrictions which make it hard to make payments in&nbsp;gold.</p><p>The reason that we can do all of this stuff is British law is really, really substantial on these kind of issues. The legal innovation that’s happened in the UK in the last five years, in terms of really getting down to the bones of what the blockchain is, what blockchain transactions are, what tokens are, how all of this stuff really works is absolutely world-class — I mean, this stuff is profound!</p><blockquote>Everything is being seen as a financial instrument. This Law Commission document will change&nbsp;that</blockquote><p>The Law Commission has a <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2022/07/Digital-Assets-Consultation-Paper-Law-Commission-1.pdf">consultation document</a>, it’s a philosophical examination of what digital is. Very sophisticated legal minds looking at digital, and saying, “From first principles, under English common law, what is that really?” And the advantage that it has for us as the industry is that right now the sort of power grab is that everything is being seen as a financial instrument. This Law Commission document will change that. If something is regulated as being a toy, then if it’s a digital toy or a physical toy, it’s still a toy, and English common law says, “This is how you handle toys, and here’s the digital part, and here’s the non-digital part of the&nbsp;law.”</p><p>So, in breaking down this idea that everything on chain is a financial asset, it also hugely reduces the complexity of doing ordinary, everyday things on chain. Because if you’re a corner shop that makes NFTs, you really shouldn’t be regulated in the same way as a bank. You’re an artist, you’re a working artist, you have a loft, you paint things paintings, you take pictures and you sell the pictures… If I sell them on eBay I don’t need any kind of license, and if I sell them as an NFT… You know, it’s just the regulation is kind of out of whack, and the reason the regulation is out of whack is because it wasn’t a regulatory problem, it’s a legislative problem, and the UK Judiciary are going through the process of figuring out the correct legal treatment of these&nbsp;things.</p><p>And if you compare this approach to how primitive the approach is in for example America, this is kind of sort of what Britain does for a living. We’re really good at this kind of deep problem-solving in a lot of different domains, this one happens to be legal, but don’t forget the the AI revolution also started in the UK with DeepMind. So, this is the sort of fundamental bedrock.</p><p>And then in the UK, this guy here, Sir Geoffrey Vos, is the most senior civil judge in the UK, so he’s the boss of all bosses for anything commercial… This is his statement on the blockchain, delivered I think February of this year, and the real payload is this section at the bottom: “My hope is that English common law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology, as its uptake grows exponentially in the months and years to come,” drawing parallels to the €600 trillion of OTC derivatives that currently run under English law. And those derivatives are from all over the world, but because you can transfer the seat of dispute, so you could pick your choice of courts and judges, everybody that can bring their disputes into English common law does, because our system of justice is kind of fantastic. I mean, yes, it’s still lawyers, and yes, it’s still hard, but it’s dramatically less hard, because there’s so much sophistication in the legal system — no offence to our cousins over there; he’s giving me the look, the stern eye… [laughter] “Yeah,&nbsp;yeah.”</p><blockquote>“My hope is that English common law will prove to be the law of choice for borderless blockchain technology, as its uptake grows exponentially in the months and years to come,” — Sir Geoffrey&nbsp;Vos</blockquote><p>Nonetheless, we have high-level support, there’s no doubt at all that this as an approach is credible, and the expectation is that English law is going to become better and better and better at handling digital assets in a way that is not upsetting. As a result, if you bring your digital assets to the UK so they’re all handled under UK law, you don’t wind up with this terrible problem where the local jurisdiction that you’re in doesn’t understand how to handle the assets, and you wind up regulating 120 countries, which is not going to work. We need a uniform framework, and if it’s good enough for the derivatives market, it ought to be good enough for&nbsp;digital.</p><p>Comment: I want to actually add, I was thinking while you were saying that: one of the things you cannot do in the United States is you cannot by contract grant a court jurisdiction, so we can’t enter into a contract where I say courts in Kansas or in New York will adjudicate a dispute, if there’s no nexus to that jurisdiction. That’s actually not a problem here. Anybody, somebody in Singapore can enter into a contract with somebody in Russia, saying that disputes will be adjudicated in London, and English courts will accept that jurisdiction is my understanding — it’s a very different approach, and it’s&nbsp;smart.</p><blockquote>Good law lets you get physical assets on&nbsp;chain.</blockquote><p>Yeah, yeah. And particularly if you’re working with arbitration courts, LCIA arbitration… You get multiple different mechanisms for picking your venue, you get access to good law, and the good law lets you get physical assets on&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Final slide: this is a map of what I think are the eight fundamental sources of value on the blockchain. Just about anybody that is making money on chain is executing one or more of these strategies, and a lot of the confusion and the damage that we’ve seen on chain comes because people believe that somebody is executing one strategy, and they’re actually executing another strategy.</p><p>The big problem that we have on chain is that you’ve got people who you think are selling transactional efficiency, and they are actually Ponzi schemes! And that confusion about what you’re doing for a living, what the business that you’re in, this is the thing that has brought the blockchain into such terrible disrepute, because the system is so powerful that you can turn almost anything into a Ponzi scheme without it being apparent!</p><blockquote>If we’re going to save the industry, we have to get away from the bad sources of value generation, and only be in the good&nbsp;ones.</blockquote><p>So, my recommendation is: for the next phase of the blockchain, make absolutely sure you understand what business your counterparties are in at every single step. And for yourselves, look at this very hard, and make sure that you’re somewhere up here with transactional efficiency, or you’re an exchange, or you’re selling something that you made yourself, and that you’ve not drifted into one of the dead zones on this thing. Because if we’re going to save the industry, we have to get away from the bad sources of value generation, and only be in the good&nbsp;ones.</p> Postscript <a href="https://www.shortform.com/pdf/technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital-pdf-carlota-perez">https://www.shortform.com/pdf/technological-revolutions-and-financial-capital-pdf-carlota-perez</a><p>Crypto’s seven waves of innovation have each mimicked a Perez Surge Cycle (here’s a <a href="https://medium.com/invao/blockchain-quo-vadis-applying-the-perez-surge-cycle-c15ba685c831">highly recommended piece from 2019 on blockchains and the surge cycle</a>).

<p>Neighbourhoods is an answer to the question “who controls my social feed in web3?” </p><p>Their social sensemaking tools allow groups to customize how reactions such as likes, upvotes, and content moderation flags are weighted and used to control the display of users’ feeds or other contexts like the front page of a site — whether its filled with posts, songs, poll proposals, or any other digital resource appropriate to that group. Rather than a blackboxed algorithm and corporate content moderators, communities get to set their own rules, fit to purpose. By customizing generic tools to their specific culture, a community can develop their own unique social space (or neighboorhood). Neighbourhoods is also developing methods to transfer data and reputation between communities, helping them translate meaning between cultures. &nbsp; </p> Neighbourhoods at a glance <p>Description: Neighbourhoods is creating a tool kit for developing groupware with customizable culture and social intelligence. </p><p>Quoting Director of Communications Emaline Friedman from one of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=du6gl485zAU">past salons</a>:</p><blockquote>“Neighbourhoods is a framework for online communities who want more control over their group culture.”</blockquote>  GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods">https://github.com/neighbour-hoods</a>  Demo videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ</a>  Website: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">https://neighbourhoods.network</a>  Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/neighbour_hoods">@Neighbour_hoods</a>  Substack: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/">https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/</a>  NHT: <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/">https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/</a>  Discord Invitation: <a href="https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D">https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D</a>   Why is Neighbourhoods being built? <p>Neighbourhoods came out of a weekly discussion series of Holochain and P2P ecosystem members as a response to the extractive practices of social media apps in web2. Inspired by trust networks and inclusive economies which develop out of informal micro networks, they are providing social data for its own sake — a valuable community asset. </p><p>There is a growing awareness, even among older generations and non-technical users that something went wrong with the social media giants. Whether it’s data extraction or information manipulation, the black box of their algorithms create more separation than connection. Neighbourhoods' solution? Their “Community Activation Wizard” lets a group decide what goes into the box, determining how information is processed and privileged. These “generic tools for specific cultures” can help you go from group chat to <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">DAO</a>, incubating group experimentation and evolution. </p><p>Social intelligence is an important but sometimes overlooked tool set in the P2P community. Open source social media projects can be hesitant to determine users’ feed content or suggest that they implement methods of rating and assessment, and rightly so. Neither devs, non-profits, nor corporations should have control of how our social networks function. Neighbourhhoods is solving this problem by putting the power to make those decisions back in the hands of communities while giving other developers and projects ready made source code for social sensemaking.</p> Why did they choose Holochain? <p>Holochain is a bedrock for P2P hosting and interoperability. But the internet isn’t interesting because we can link computers together, it’s interesting because of what people do with that network. Thus, Neighbourhoods developed out of deep care for the Holochain ecosystem, laying the first bricks on top of Holochain’s foundation. As a key piece of architecture for a P2P social web, Neighbourhoods is focused on creating a user-friendly experience that preserves the good parts of social media like discoverability and feed ordering. They see these as key affordances for adoption and want to give the control of those capacities back to the broader community.</p><p>On a technical level, Neighbourhoods needed an ultra-scalable distributed ledger which could maintain the dynamism of web2. Hard forks break the continuity of social media and create challenging network effects, so the ease of updating on Holochain allows for a much more fluid experience. Individual users do not all need to run the same version of an app (as long as the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/">integrity</a> remains constant), so updates and forks can happen asynchronously, all while agents securely interact in the same neighborhood. This capability emphasizes agent-centricity and allows for complex, overlapping community dynamics.</p><p>Holochain’s trust but verify model for data integrity, and the agent/group duality is also uniquely suited to Neighbourhoods’ social ontology, as well as their commitment to data protection and persistence. </p> How are they using Holochain? <p>Holochain for Neighbourhoods really comes down to flexibility. Holochain’s uniform data formatting allows for easy translation of reputation metrics between social spaces as well as enabling incredible data portability, both within and between groups. Similarly, Holochain’s graphing DHT and unique <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">linking method</a> make resource location efficient in a distributed system. Neighbourhoods has found this important for bridging across contexts as well as for adding external links. </p> Their experience developing on Holochain? <p>Holochain developers are a tightknit group. Many of the devs working on Neighbourhoods also work on other Holochain projects or Holochain’s core components. This means that they have a deep knowledge of the software and ecosystem which is essential for building on new technology. The downside however is a limited pool of developers which is why <a href="https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative">developer</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/life-imitates-art-imitates-life-cooperation-at-the-first-developer-immersive/">education</a> is so important for bringing new people into the community. Neighborhoods has been hiring consistently in support of their upcoming alpha release and we expect other projects will be doing the same soon.</p><p>There is also a lot of resource sharing and support across the ecosystem. <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightning Rod Labs’</a> <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we">We</a> provides a great framework for groupware which Neighbourhoods is integrating as a sort of ‘lobby’ for its social intelligence kit. In turn, applets can be shared across We and Neighbourhoods with minimal changes, enabling developers’ experimentation and driving innovation across the Holochain ecosystem. Similarly, Holochain’s core tools like the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">Tryorama</a> testing framework have been key for preparing Neighbourhoods for beta and has positioned them to take advantage of the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_campaign=holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold&amp;utm_content=primary">Beta-RC release</a> later this month.</p><p>As a team, Neighbourhoods is at that goldilocks scale where every member is able to give input on any aspect of the design, creating a participatory environment. They have done a lot of work to maintain this in their working practices externally as well, running workshops and salons with early adopters to get community feedback as part of a participatory design process. When building a tool that allows for so much customization, it’s important to ensure that groups working through the Community Activation Wizard have a clear understanding of what their choices affect, and so carefully communicating this information is a design challenge that requires (and creates the opportunity for) community input.<br><br>They have also been using the hApp <a href="https://acorn.software/">Acorn</a> for their project management needs. We love to see this!</p> How can I get involved? <p>With Holochain’s beta release candidate dropping, Neighbourhoods is sprinting towards a lot of new milestones. In early 2023 they will release the Neighbourhoods Tool Kit 0.0.1 which includes early versions of new features, including the sensemaker-lite, sensemaker-lite dashboard, community activation wizard, and some sample applets for rating and ordering resources in social contexts. This will enable community organizers to configure a neighbourhood by specifying resource types, social data dimensions, computation methods, and contexts where these emerge. Developers will be able to see Neighbourhoods’ work on Github and use their specifications for building applets that work well with the social sensemaker.</p><p>In the meantime, if you're interested in supporting the team, the best thing to do right now is <a href="https://neighbourhoods.substack.com/">sign up for their Substack</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neighbour_hoods">follow them on Twitter</a>. You can also join their <a href="https://discord.gg/nKSGNaJz9D">Discord</a>, check out their past <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCM7Oc8aY4FZ6S7U9onj14cQ">demos and salons</a>, or take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods">codebase on GitHub</a>. And of course, you can go to their <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">website</a> where they have more information on their ERC-20 token <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/nht/">$NHT</a>.</p>

 Set up OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>We’ll be using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa-redirect/react/main/">Okta’s SPA redirect model</a> to authenticate.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3001/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:3001</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3001</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>NOTE: Take note of your client ID and issuer as this will be used in a subsequent step.</p>

 Setup Lerna for monorepo management 

<p><a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna</a> is a tool used to manage multi-package repositories. In this project, it’ll allow us to have a single repository where both our frontend and API packages live.</p>

 
   
    <p>If you don’t already have <code>npx</code> installed, you can run <code>npm i npx</code> to do so.</p>
   
   
    <p>Create a project root directory named <code>okta-react-fastify</code>.</p>
   
   Add Lerna to your project by running the following in your project root directory:
       <code>npx lerna@latest init
</code>       
   
   Create the <code>frontend</code> and <code>api</code> packages:
       <code>cd packages
mkdir frontend api
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: The team behind <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx</a> now manages Lerna, so if you’d like to integrate Nx’s additional robust, scalable, and faster tooling for managing monorepos, check out their documentation on <a href="https://nx.dev/recipes/adopting-nx/lerna-and-nx">integrating Nx and Lerna</a>.</p>

 Add needed Fastify backend and React frontend dependencies with TypeScript 

 
   In <code>packages/api</code>, run:
       <code>npm init fastify
</code>       
   
   Add the required backend packages:
       <code>npx lerna add @fastify/postgres@5.1.0 packages/api
npx lerna add dotenv@16.0.2 packages/api
npx lerna add @okta/jwt-verifier@2.6.0 packages/api
npx lerna add pg@8.8.0 packages/api
</code>       
   
   Add TypeScript and needed types to the backend repository:
       <code>npx lerna add @types/pg@8.6.5 packages/api --dev
npx lerna add typescript@4.8.3 packages/api --dev
</code>       
   
   Next, let’s create a basic React application using <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">Create React App</a>. We’ll use the template for TypeScript with it as well. In the created <code>packages/frontend</code> directory, run:
       <code>npx create-react-app . --template typescript
</code>       
   
   Add the frontend Okta dependencies:
       <code>npx lerna add @okta/okta-auth-js@7.0.1 packages/frontend
npx lerna add @okta/okta-react@6.7.0 packages/frontend
</code>       
   
   You can now run <code>npx lerna bootstrap</code> to install your package dependencies. 
 

<p>NOTE: Our demo repository uses React <code>^18.2.0</code> and React Scripts <code>5.0.1</code>.</p>

 Set up the PostgreSQL Docker instance 

 
   In your project’s root directory, create a file <code>docker-compose.yml</code>: 
 

   <code>services:
  postgres:
    container_name: "nasa-facilities"
    image: "postgres:latest"
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USERNAME: "${POSTGRES_USERNAME}"
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}"
      POSTGRES_DB: "${POSTGRES_DB}"
</code>   

 
   Create a <code>.env</code> file in the same project root directory and add the following:
       <code>POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
POSTGRES_DB=nasa-facilities
</code>       
   
   
    <p>To use the Docker configuration we created, run <code>docker compose up</code>.</p>
   
   There is a provided PostgrSQL data dump <code>./nasa-facilities_20200910.sql</code> <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-fastify-postgresql-example/blob/main/nasa-facilities_20200910.sql">in the example repo</a>. You can import it by running the following from the project root directory:
       <code>docker exec -i nasa-facilities psql -U postgres nasa-facilities &lt; ./nasa-facilities_20200910.sql
</code>       
   
 

<p>Your newly created Docker instance is now running a PostgreSQL database with the restored data.</p>

<p>NOTE: The PostgreSQL dump included in the demo repo uses data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/nasa-facilities">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/nasa-facilities</a>.</p>

 Create the API backend app using Fastify 

 
   
    <p>In the command line, go to your backend repository root directory at <code>packages/api</code>.</p>
   
   Update <code>package.json</code> by adding the following to allow the backend application to compile using TypeScript:
       <code>{
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "scripts": {
 "start": "tsc &amp;&amp; node build/index.js"
  }
}
</code>       
   
   Initialize a Typescript config file by running:
       <code>npx tsc --init
</code>       
   
   Add the following to <code>tsconfig.json</code> to output the build files to the proper directory:
       <code>"outDir": "build"
</code>       
   
   Create a <code>.env</code> file with the following and replace the Okta values with the prior output from the CLI:
       <code>CONNECTION_STRING=PostgreSQL://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/nasa-facilities
OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId}
OKTA_AUDIENCE="api://default"
</code>       
   
   Create an <code>index.ts</code> file and add the backend application Fastify server code: 
 

   <code>import fastifyPostgres from "@fastify/postgres";
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";

dotenv.config();

const fastify: FastifyInstance = Fastify({
  logger: {
    serializers: {
      res(reply) {
        return {
          statusCode: reply.statusCode,
        };
      },
      req(request) {
        return {
          method: request.method,
          url: request.url,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});

fastify.register(fastifyPostgres, {
  connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_STRING,
});

const start = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
start();

</code>   

 
   Next, let’s create our Fastify API routes along with their appropriate CRUD operations in a new file <code>routes/facilities.ts</code>: 
 

   <code>import { FastifyInstance } from "fastify";
import { FastifyReply, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

interface IFacility {
  Center: string;
  Facility: string;
  Status: string;
  City: string;
  State: string;
  Visited: boolean;
  id: bigint;
}

async function facilitiesRoutes(fastify: FastifyInstance) {
  const client = await fastify.pg.connect();

  fastify.get(
    "/facilities",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      let facilities: IFacility[] = [];

      try {
        const { rows } = await client.query("SELECT * FROM facilities");
        if (rows.length == 0) throw new Error("No facilities found");

        facilities = rows;
        reply
          .code(200)
          .header("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
          .send([...facilities]);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );

  fastify.patch(
    "/facilities/:id",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      const { id } = request.params as { id: bigint };
      const { visited } = request.body as { visited: boolean };

      const query = {
        text: `UPDATE public.facilities SET 
                "Visited" = COALESCE($1, "Visited")
                WHERE id = $2`,
        values: [visited, id],
      };

      try {
        await client.query(query);
        reply.code(204);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );

  fastify.delete(
    "/facilities/:id",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      const { id } = request.params as { id: bigint };

      const query = {
        text: `DELETE FROM public.facilities
                  WHERE id = $1 RETURNING *`,
        values: [id],
      };

      try {
        await client.query(query);
        reply.code(204);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );
}

export default facilitiesRoutes;

</code>   

 
   To register these routes with our Fastify instance, add the following to <code>index.ts</code>:
       <code>fastify.register(facilitiesRoutes);
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Don’t forget to also import the <code>facilitiesRoutes</code> after adding the above line.</p>

 
   Then we’ll create a <code>utils/jwt-verifier.ts</code> file that will include logic to verify the access token included in API calls from the frontend: 
 

   <code>import OktaJwtVerifier from "@okta/jwt-verifier";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import { FastifyReply, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";

dotenv.config();

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: process.env.OKTA_ISSUER || "",
  clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID
});

const audience = process.env.OKTA_AUDIENCE;

export const jwtVerifier = async (
  request: FastifyRequest,
  reply: FastifyReply
) =&gt; {
  const { authorization } = request.headers;

  request.log.info({ authorization });

  const match = authorization?.match(/Bearer (.+)/);

  if (!match) {
    return reply.status(401).send();
  }

  if (!authorization || !match) {
    reply.code(401).send();
  }

  try {
    const accessToken = match[1];
    const { claims } = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(
      accessToken,
      audience || ""
    );

    request.log.info({ claims });

    if (!claims) {
      reply.code(401).send();
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    reply.code(401).send();
  }
};

</code>   

 
   We’ll then add a <a href="https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Reference/Hooks/#prehandler">Fastify Prehandler Hook</a> to <code>index.ts</code> that will run the <code>jwtVerifier</code> logic with each Fastify route: 
 

   <code>fastify.decorate("jwtVerify", (request: FastifyRequest) =&gt; {
  fastify.log.info(`The incoming request is: ${JSON.stringify(request)}`);
});

fastify.addHook("preHandler", async (request, reply, done) =&gt; {
  return jwtVerifier(request, reply);
});
</code>   

<p>NOTE: An import will also need to be added for <code>jwtVerifier</code>.</p>

<p>Your final <code>packages/api/index.ts</code> file should look like this:</p>
   <code>import fastifyPostgres from "@fastify/postgres";
import Fastify, { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest } from "fastify";
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
import facilitiesRoutes from "./routes/facilities";
import { jwtVerifier } from "./utils/jwt-verifier";

dotenv.config();

const fastify: FastifyInstance = Fastify({
  logger: {
    serializers: {
      res(reply) {
        return {
          statusCode: reply.statusCode,
        };
      },
      req(request) {
        return {
          method: request.method,
          url: request.url,
        };
      },
    },
  },
});

fastify.register(fastifyPostgres, {
  connectionString: process.env.CONNECTION_STRING,
});

fastify.decorate("jwtVerify", (request: FastifyRequest) =&gt; {
  fastify.log.info(`The incoming request is: ${JSON.stringify(request)}`);
});

fastify.addHook("preHandler", async (request, reply, done) =&gt; {
  return jwtVerifier(request, reply);
});

fastify.register(facilitiesRoutes);

const start = async () =&gt; {
  try {
    await fastify.listen({ port: 3000 });
  } catch (err) {
    fastify.log.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};
start();

</code>   

 Configure the React app 

 
   
    <p>Add <code>"proxy": "http://localhost:3000"</code> to <code>packages/frontend/package.json</code> so that React knows what base URL our API calls will need to make.</p>
   
   
    <p>In a <code>.env</code> file in the <code>packages/frontend</code> directory, add the needed environment variables:</p>
       <code>PORT=3001
REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER=/oauth2/default
REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId}
REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3001
</code>       
   
 

<p>NOTE: Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourOktaClientId}</code> with your own Okta domain and client ID.</p>

<p>NOTE: We are switching the default port React will run on because the backend API app will use port <code>3000</code> by default as well.</p>

 Create React components 

<p>Let’s create our React components for render on the frontend.</p>

 
   In a newly created <code>src/components</code> directory, add the following files: 
 

 login.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { Navigate, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
import "../App.css";

export function Login() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const { authState } = useOktaAuth();

  const handleLoginClick = () =&gt; {
    navigate("/facilities");
  };

  return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
    &lt;Navigate to="/facilities" replace /&gt;
  ) : (
    &lt;div className="form-wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;form onSubmit={handleLoginClick}&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Welcome Back!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Login" /&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

</code>   

<p>NOTE: Our app uses <a href="https://reactrouter.com/en/main">React Router v6</a>, which utilizes the new <code>useNavigate</code> to replace <code>useHistory</code> to programmatically navigate.</p>

 facilities.tsx 

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

 secureRoute.tsx 
<p>In this file we’ll create a custom <code>SecureRoute</code> component to work with React Router v6.</p>

   <code>import React, { useEffect } from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

export const RequiredAuth: React.FC = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (!authState) {
      return;
    }

    if (!authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      const originalUri = toRelativeUrl(
        window.location.href,
        window.location.origin
      );
      oktaAuth.setOriginalUri(originalUri);
      oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
    }
  }, [oktaAuth, authState?.isAuthenticated, authState]);

  if (!authState || !authState?.isAuthenticated) {
    return &lt;p className="loading"&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;
  }

  return &lt;Outlet /&gt;;
};

</code>   

<p>NOTE: The <code>okta/okta-react</code> package includes a <code>SecureRoute</code> component, but it does not support React Router v6 to stay router version agnostic. For more information, please see the issue comment at <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-react/issues/178#issuecomment-1150407182">https://github.com/okta/okta-react/issues/178#issuecomment-1150407182</a>.</p>

 
   We’ll also need to add the <code>SecureRoute</code> component and the following to <code>App.tsx</code>. 
 

   <code>import { useCallback } from "react";
import "./App.css";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from "react-router-dom";
import { LoginCallback, Security } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { Login } from "./components/login";
import Facilities from "./components/facilities";
import { RequiredAuth } from "./components/secureRoute";

function App() {
  const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
    issuer: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_ISSUER,
    clientId: process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
    redirectUri:
      process.env.REACT_APP_OKTA_BASE_REDIRECT_URI + "/callback",
  });

  const restoreOriginalUri = useCallback(
    async (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri: string) =&gt; {
      window.location.replace(
        toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
      );
    },
    []
  );

  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Routes&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/callback" element={&lt;LoginCallback /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/" element={&lt;Login /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;Route path="/facilities" element={&lt;RequiredAuth /&gt;}&gt;
            &lt;Route path="" element={&lt;Facilities /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;/Route&gt;
        &lt;/Routes&gt;
      &lt;/Security&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
}

export default App;

 Running the app 

<p>You can start the demo app by running <code>npx lerna run start</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we’re not authenticated, our app will land us at the login page. Here, we click login to go through the Okta login process. Once authenticated, we’re redirected to <code>/facilities</code>. If we’re already authenticated when we land on the root URL, our app will automatically navigate us to <code>/facilities</code>. Once our table loads, we’ll see the following:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To render the facilities table, our app has made a call to our API which includes the access token to fetch the data from the backend <code>/facilities</code> API endpoint.</p>

<p>In <code>packages/frontend/facilities.tsx</code>:</p>
   <code>  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    const apiCall = async () =&gt; {
      if (authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp; authState.accessToken?.accessToken) {
        try {
          const response = await fetch("/facilities", {
            headers: {
              Authorization: authState.accessToken.accessToken,
            },
          });
          const data = await response.json();
          setData(data);
        } catch (error: unknown) {
          setErrors(getErrorMessage(error));
        }
      }
    };
    apiCall();
  }, [authState]);
</code>   

<p>The backend verified the access token using the <code>jwtVerifier</code> utility we created.</p>

<p>The backend connects to our PostgreSQL instance and has used the query we specified to fetch the needed data at the <code>/facilities</code> route.</p>

<p>In <code>packages/api/routes/facilities.ts</code>:</p>
   <code>fastify.get(
    "/facilities",
    async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) =&gt; {
      let facilities: IFacility[] = [];

      try {
        const { rows } = await client.query("SELECT * FROM facilities");
        if (rows.length == 0) throw new Error("No facilities found");

        facilities = rows;
        reply
          .code(200)
          .header("Content-Type", "application/json; charset=utf-8")
          .send([...facilities]);
      } catch (error) {
        const errorMessage = (error as Error).message;
        throw new Error(errorMessage);
      }
    }
  );
</code>   

<p>The same process repeats when a user clicks on the <code>Visited</code> checkbox or <code>Delete</code> button for the appropriate API endpoints and PostgreSQL queries.</p>

<p>Encryption is the foundation of modern Internet security. Data cannot move safely and securely across the public Internet without it. However, not all forms of encryption are made equal.</p>
<p>What is asymmetric encryption? It is a form of cryptography that uses two distinct but linked encryption-decryption keys to protect information from outside viewing.</p>
<p>How Does Encryption Work?<br>
Encryption is a form of data obfuscation in which information is transferred reversibly, such that the data remains unreadable by unauthorized parties.</p>
<p>As long as there has been writing and information storage, there has been a demand to hide the contents of that data from outside eyes. Forms of cryptography were found to exist as early as 1900 BC in Ancient Egypt when hieroglyphics were transformed to make them seem more mysterious or important.</p>
<p>The first major evidence of the use of cryptography for hiding information is usually attributed to Julius Caesar. He used a simple letter shift to hide the meaning of messages he sent to and from generals.</p>
<p>Cryptography is simple to break, given enough work and attention to patterns and details. Modern cryptography draws from these ideas but uses factors like random number generation and prime numbers’ unique properties to create encryption styles that are nearly impossible to break without powerful computers working over centuries.</p>
<p>The process of encryption itself, outside of the encryption method itself, is relatively straightforward:</p>
 
 Creation of Cipher Text: An encryption algorithm may obfuscate information in various ways. However, the basic approach will involve creating a complex encryption key (or simply “key”) to transform data at the level of its bits. For example, some algorithms will feed characters in a message through an algorithm that manipulates each character’s bitwise value. 
 Transmission: The encrypted information is transferred to the recipient. If an individual intercepts that message and tries to read it (assuming there are no means to break that encryption), they will find it essentially useless. 
 Decryption and Verification: The recipient must receive the key to decrypt that message and read it. In some cases, the sender may also use a form of hashing or digital signature to verify that the document came from the right person and has not been tampered with. 
 
<p>In any situation where encryption is used, the only way to effectively share information (encrypt, send, decrypt) is by using associated keys. Two overarching encryption strategies are based on how these keys are generated and used.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
 
 Symmetric (or Private): A single key is created and then during the encryption process. This key is the lynchpin to encrypt the information, and the end recipient must have the key to decrypt and read that data. 
 Asymmetric (or Public): This method involves the creation of two different and unique keys connected by the fact that one key is used for encryption and the other serves as the decryption key. 
 
 How Is Asymmetric Encryption Different from Symmetric Encryption? 
<p>The surface-level difference, as stated, is that asymmetric encryption uses two distinct keys for encryption or decryption. However, this difference changes how the encryption process works:</p>
 
 Creation of Key Pairs: The pair of keys created for the encryption-decryption process are created using mathematical formulas and pseudo-random numbers that link them to one another. Typically, one key is designated as the “public” key while the other is the “private” key. 
 Encryption: The connection between the public and private keys are at the heart of asymmetric encryption. In a simple asymmetric model, one party will use a recipient’s public key to encrypt a message or block of data. At this point, the only way to decrypt that information is through the paired private key. 
 
<p>Because of this public/private relationship, asymmetric encryption is particularly useful when sending information (for example, via email). Unlike common symmetric algorithms like AES, where a single key can be kept and used without worrying about sharing in the wild, asymmetric provide additional security for outgoing data.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many security regulations, frameworks, and best practices will call for encryption standards that cover data at rest and in transit. The latter is almost always a form of asymmetric encryption.</p>
 PGP and Certificates 
<p>The challenge of an asymmetric encryption plan is providing a secure and accessible way to manage and share public and private keys.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.openpgp.org/">Pretty Good Privacy,</a> or PGP, accomplishes this more straightforwardly and facilitates strong end-to-end encryption. An application using PGP will generate keys for a user and manage them through the application, such that a user has a centralized location to collect, manage, and use public keys to send encrypted messages to trusted recipients.</p>
<p>However, this strategy isn’t scalable enough to work at enterprise levels. The sheer endeavor of managing a key infrastructure of that size would swamp even the best app while creating problematic honeypots.</p>
<p>Additionally, protocols like PGP present hurdles to widespread communication between organizations and the public because, to function properly, all parties must use the same protocol–and most email providers do not support PGP out of the box.</p>
<p>The more common form of public-key encryption is the use of SSL certificates. This approach is familiar to anyone using the Internet. Any website that uses the secure <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818">HTTPS protocol</a> will include proof of legitimacy through a publicly-maintained certificate, secured by a certificate authority, that guarantees the certificate holder’s identity and facilitates encrypted communications.</p>
<p>Some common forms of asymmetric encryption include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8446">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a>: Secure Sockets Layer, supplanted by the more advanced Transport Layer Security protocol, uses a handshake process to facilitate authentication and encryption protocols while using SSL certificates as the public component of the asymmetric encryption approach. 
 
<p>TLS currently serves as the baseline for many different forms of email communication, most notably in-transit (but not end-to-end) email cryptography and HTTPS protocols.</p>
 
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">Rivest Shamir Aldeman (RSA)</a>: Named after its inventors, RSA uses the challenge of factoring prime numbers as the basis for deriving its encryption methods. This problem is so challenging that, with a strong enough key complexity, there is no published method for breaking RSA. 
 
<p>The trade-off is that it is quite slow due in no small part to its complexity. Because of the lack of efficiency, RSA is often used to encrypt keys to encode data as an additional layer of security.</p>
 
 <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/fips/nist.fips.186-4.pdf">Digital Signature Standard (DSS)</a>: The DSS was created by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology to provide organizations with a method of ensuring the legitimacy of digital documents. 
 
<p>This process uses a hashing function with a “signature” function, the sender’s private key, and the message itself to create a unique signature appended to the encrypted message. This signature can then be verified on the recipient’s end.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to encryption, and different approaches will excel in different contexts. Furthermore, many systems will combine symmetric and asymmetric encryption in different ways to provide maximum protection.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, asymmetric encryption provides a few key benefits.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 In-Transit Security: Symmetric encryption only works with a single key used for encryption and decryption. With the right strategy, this is a perfectly stable and secure way to manage database or server encryption. Having a single key, however, is a liability when sending data between multiple parties. Asymmetric encryption is much more suitable for public internet data sharing. 
 Document Authentication: Public and private key pairs are necessary for creating security signatures that allow users to authenticate documents. This additional layer of security assures that the sender is who they say they are and that the message has not been tampered with. 
 
 What Are the Drawbacks of Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Speed: Asymmetric encryption is complex and, therefore, slow. It’s not the best solution for bulk encryption–which means it isn’t the best solution for encrypting servers, hard drives, databases, etc. 
 Complexity and Adoption: To be useful, all parties must use the same form of encryption to share messages. In many cases, this isn’t a problem. For example, all the major internet browsers and providers utilize HTTPS, which means that they have adopted certificate authorities and tools to ensure that HTTPS is seamlessly integrated such that users never have to do a thing. The same is true for email–almost all email providers will use some form of TLS. 
 
<p>The problem comes when organizations need to implement end-to-end encryption solutions like PGP. Because all parties must use the same solution, it’s not feasible for a hospital to send emails in a HIPAA-compliant fashion, counting on E2E to maintain data confidentiality.</p>
 Use Cases for Asymmetric Encryption 
<p>Despite challenges and benefits, asymmetric encryption isn’t a one size fits all solution. It has a big impact in areas where people need to secure information being exchanged on a network connection, often public ones, where a symmetric key isn’t necessarily secure enough.</p>
<p>Some of the primary business use cases for asymmetric encryption include:</p>
 
 Web Traffic Security: The use of SSL certificates on HTTPS transactions serves as a foundation of security on the Internet. It not only protects sensitive data exchanged across websites (such as, for example, payment information from a web store cart), but it also provides a way to prove that an entity is who they say they are–crucial for avoiding phishing scams. 
 Email Encryption: Most email providers will utilize TLS security for incoming and outgoing emails as a matter of purpose. This doesn’t obfuscate those emails in an inbox, but it ensures that emails cannot be plucked out of the ether and read by malicious actors. 
 Virtual Private Networks: VPNs are crucial for businesses with remote workers or an international workforce. To maintain the security, privacy and usability of the VPN intact, asymmetric encryption will be used (similar to TLS or SSL) to authenticate and authorize users while protecting data moving back and forth between the users and the central enterprise system.

 A primer on maximizing rewards via publishing &amp; wash consuming  0.1 Introduction <p>The latest release of ocean.py makes it very easy for us to interact with datatokens, the marketplace, veOCEAN, and Data Farming(DF). With it we’re able to easily play with the Ocean Protocol stack, use veOCEAN, and maybe even turn a profit (for now) by wash consuming and gaining reward from&nbsp;DF.</p><p>DF runs weekly, starting &amp; ending on Thursdays @ midnight GMT. During this period the market is sampled, and all data assets are measured for `Data Consume Volume (DCV)` &amp; `veOCEAN Allocated`. For each week, this is sampled 50 times to obtain an average, and to distribute Active Rewards for this period of participation.</p><p>“Wash Consuming” is when the publisher fake-consumes data to drive DCV to get more rewards. Not healthy for the ecosystem long-term. Good news: if consume fee &gt; weekly rewards, then wash consume becomes unprofitable. DF is set up to make this happen by DF29 (<a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1587527525529358336">if not&nbsp;sooner</a>).</p><p>This blog post is technical in nature but tries to offer context to the reader so they can understand the intuitions behind Data Farming.

By reading and following any of these actions, you absolve others of any injury and are solely responsible for your&nbsp;actions.</p> 0.2 Project&nbsp;overview <p>Ocean is a complex project with many different pieces.</p><p>Do not worry, we’re making it extremely simple, only needing a few lines of code that you can follow step-by-step.</p><p>To get you excited, here are some of the things we’ll be&nbsp;using.</p>  Github repositories.  A mixture of python and&nbsp;docker.  Ganache to test on a local&nbsp;network.  Brownie to connect our&nbsp;wallets.  Ocean to create a data&nbsp;asset.  Ocean to buy and consume data&nbsp;assets.  <p>Whenever possible, I will point you to existing documentation and resources to avoid repeating them. Much of it is already explained in a way that is easy to understand.</p><p>This blog post tries to provide a bit more context and intuitions regards Data Farming, veOCEAN, and what you need to consider to farm successfully.</p><p>This blog post mirrors the <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/df.md">“df.md” README</a>.

They’re numbered the same as the df.md&nbsp;README.</p>  Setup, in&nbsp;Ganache  Lock OCEAN for&nbsp;veOCEAN  Publish dataset &amp;&nbsp;exchange  Allocate veOCEAN to&nbsp;dataset  Fake-Consume data  Collect OCEAN&nbsp;rewards  Repeat steps 1–6, for Eth&nbsp;mainnet  <p>Let’s go through each&nbsp;step.</p> 1. Setup, in&nbsp;Ganache <p>Before we dive deeper, you will need to have docker and python installed in your system. Further, you will likely need a MacOS/Linux system to get through&nbsp;it.</p> 1.1 Setup from&nbsp;console <p>This section is best handled with patience. The best way to complete it <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/install.md">is to follow the install.md README</a>. You will need to complete all steps&nbsp;there:</p>  Prerequisites  Installing the Ocean&nbsp;library  Configuring brownie  Running Barge and&nbsp;services  Setting up test&nbsp;keys  <p>Once you complete all of the steps above, you will&nbsp;have:</p><p>Terminal 1: An Ocean environment configured. Barge and Ganache running together.</p><p>Terminal 2: A local python project with some private keys for us to farm&nbsp;with.</p><p>You also need to set the factory envvar. In the&nbsp;console:</p> export FACTORY_DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xc594c6e5def4bab63ac29eed19a134c130388f74f019bc74b8f4389df2837a58 Barge running. Give yourself a pat on the back.&nbsp;Squeee! 2.2 Setup in&nbsp;Python <p>This section mirrors <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/data-nfts-and-datatokens-flow.md">the simple-flow README “Setup in Python”&nbsp;section.</a></p><p>You should have two terminals open now. We’re going to resume from inside Terminal 2 where you entered the python virtual environment (venv).</p><p>Here, begin by typing `python` inside terminal, and entering the python&nbsp;console:</p>Entering the python console. Our happy&nbsp;place.<p>Key Point: For the rest of this blog post and exercise, we’re going to remain in the Python console. Every line of code entered for the remainder of this blog post should just&nbsp;work.</p><p>We’re going to start by making sure that the Ocean library is available, and wallets are accessible via&nbsp;Brownie.</p><p>In the Python console, enter the following:</p> # Create Ocean instance<br>from ocean_lib.web3_internal.utils import connect_to_network<br>connect_to_network("development")<br><br>from ocean_lib.example_config import get_config_dict<br>from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean<br>config = get_config_dict("development")<br>ocean = Ocean(config)<br><br># Create Alice's wallet<br>import os<br>from brownie.network import accounts<br>accounts.clear()<br>alice_private_key = os.getenv("TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1")<br>alice_wallet = accounts.add(alice_private_key) <p>Let’s review what this code&nbsp;does:</p>  Initializes the ocean library to use our local development network (Barge &amp; Ganache).  Obtains the configuration and initializes the Ocean&nbsp;library.  Retrieves our private key and gives us a wallet to play&nbsp;with.  <p>Great, after we run these commands inside the python console we have a wallet that we can start&nbsp;using.</p> 2.3 Fake&nbsp;OCEAN <p>In order for us to use the Ocean marketplace and to play with Data Farming, we’re going to need some OCEAN and veOCEAN. Because we’re working in a development environment we start by minting&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # mint OCEAN. Alice will get some<br>from ocean_lib.ocean.mint_fake_ocean import mint_fake_OCEAN<br>mint_fake_OCEAN(config)<br><br># simpler variable names<br>OCEAN = ocean.OCEAN_token<br>veOCEAN = ocean.ve_ocean<br>alice = alice_wallet <p>Let’s review what this code&nbsp;does:</p>  mints fake OCEAN, with some going to&nbsp;Alice  makes some convenient variable&nbsp;names   2. Lock OCEAN for&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>OCEAN is used to buy/sell datatokens, reward participants, and obtain&nbsp;veOCEAN.</p><p>veOCEAN is used to determine how rewards are distributed across the protocol, including via Data Farming. veOCEAN has a learning curve. But once you get the basics of it, it becomes intuitive. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">This is a great blog post</a> to learn more about&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, let’s set some key parameters for veOCEAN and DF. On Ganache, you can use these values as-is. But on Eth mainnet, you must choose your own. In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # On your asset, your DCV = DT_price * num_consumes<br># Your asset gets rewards pro-rata for its DCV compared to other assets' DCVs. <br>DT_price = 100.0 # number of OCEAN needed to buy one datatoken<br>num_consumes = 3<br><br># This is how much OCEAN to lock into veOCEAN. It can be small if you're<br># the only staker on your asset. If others stake on your asset, your<br># rewards are pro-rate compared to others' stake in your asset.<br>amt_OCEAN_lock = 10.0 <p>Now, let’s lock OCEAN for veOCEAN. In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #simulate passage of time, until next Thursday, the start of DF(X)<br>from brownie.network import chain<br>WEEK = 7 * 86400 # seconds in a week<br>t0 = chain.time()<br>t1 = t0 // WEEK * WEEK + WEEK #this is a Thursday, because Jan 1 1970 was<br>t2 = t1 + WEEK<br>chain.sleep(t1 - t0) <br>chain.mine()<br><br>#we're now at the beginning of the week. So, lock<br>from ocean_lib.ocean.util import to_wei, from_wei<br>OCEAN.approve(veOCEAN.address, to_wei(amt_OCEAN_lock), {"from" : alice})<br>veOCEAN.withdraw({"from": alice}) #withdraw old tokens first<br>veOCEAN.create_lock(to_wei(amt_OCEAN_lock), t2, {"from": alice}) <p>Let’s review what this code&nbsp;does:</p>  Manipulates the clock so we are on a Thursday. Data Farming rounds Begin + End each Thursday at midnight&nbsp;GMT.  We configure the amount of OCEAN we’re going to&nbsp;lock.  We approve the veOCEAN contract, to take OCEAN from Alice’s&nbsp;wallet.  We prepare to create the lock by withdrawing, making sure there are no old&nbsp;tokens.  We create the lock using t2, which is configured to be 1 week from&nbsp;today.  Alice now carries a veOCEAN&nbsp;balance.  At the end of this, the clock is adjusted to start Data Farming, and we have defined some helper parameters to create a lock, and obtain&nbsp;veOCEAN.  <p>Alice then creates a lock for 1 week using 10.0 OCEAN, receiving veOCEAN.</p> 3. Publish Dataset &amp;&nbsp;Exchange <p>If you have followed other READMEs, you might already be familiar with posting a dataset for sale on an exchange. We’re going to follow this pattern here in order to explain&nbsp;DF.</p><p>DF Key Concept #1: Data Consume Volume&nbsp;(DCV).</p><p>Every week, you can earn Active Rewards for the following actions:</p>  Locking Ocean to receive&nbsp;veOCEAN.  Allocating veOCEAN to a&nbsp;DataNFT.  Having datatokens associated with that DataNFT consumed.  <p>So, if we can create our own dataset, point veOCEAN to it, and then consume from it, we can game DF. There are two things to&nbsp;know:</p>  Your asset DCV = datatoken_price_OCEAN * num_consumes.  Your assets rewards are pro-rata = your_asset_DCV / other_assets_DCV.  <p>DF Intuition #1: The more the item costs, and the more it’s consumed, the better it is for us. In the real world, Alice still needs to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p><p>DF Intuition #2: In the real world, Alice still needs to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Knowing all of this, create Alice’s data asset that will be consumed, then put 3 of it on the market with a cost of 100.0 OCEAN&nbsp;each.</p><p>Let’s put this into practice via code! In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> #data info<br>name = "Branin dataset"<br>url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trentmc/branin/main/branin.arff"<br><br>#create data asset<br>(data_NFT, DT, ddo) = ocean.assets.create_url_asset(name, url, alice, wait_for_aqua=False)<br>print(f"Just published asset, with data_NFT.address={data_NFT.address}")<br><br>#create exchange<br>exchange, _ = DT.create_exchange(<br>    to_wei(DT_price), OCEAN.address, {"from": alice}<br>)<br><br>#make datatokens available on the exchange<br>DT.mint(alice, to_wei(num_consumes), {"from": alice})<br>DT.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(num_consumes), {"from": alice}) <p>Let’s review what this code&nbsp;does:</p>  Defines all information required for the data&nbsp;asset.  We have to consider that datatoken_price_OCEAN and the num_consumes to determine our&nbsp;DCV.  If we want to make money from data farming, by wash consuming, we can improve performance by playing with&nbsp;these.  Creates the data&nbsp;asset.  Asset is configured to cost 100 OCEAN, with 3 available to be consumed.  We obtain the data_NFT, datatoken, and&nbsp;asset.  Creates an exchange&nbsp;object  Takes the datatoken from Alice’s dataset and adds it to the public marketplace. By doing this, Alice receives revenue whenever the token is purchased.  The token is configured to cost 100 OCEAN and to have 3 available.  <p>We now have our data token launched and ready to be sold. If Alice is smart about it, maybe she can farm rewards&nbsp;too.</p> 4. Stake on dataset, by allocating veOCEAN <p>Now that we have our asset available to be purchased, we can try to game DF a&nbsp;little.</p><p>DF Key Concept #2: veOCEAN Allocated (Round Allocation).</p><p>To keep it simple we’re going to allocate 100% of Alice’s veOCEAN to the data_NFT from the Branin dataset that we’re going to wash&nbsp;trade.</p><p>DF Intuition #3: DCV is multiplied by all veOCEAN allocated to it. So the more users are allocating veOCEAN to the same asset, the more dilluted the rewards will&nbsp;be.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> amt_allocate = 100 #total allocation must be &lt;= 10000 (wei)<br>ocean.ve_allocate.setAllocation(amt_allocate, data_NFT.address, chain.id, {"from": alice}) <p>Let’s review what this code&nbsp;does:</p>  Allocates 100% of Alice’s Voting Power to the data_NFT.  100% allocation equals 10,000 because it uses integers to express decimal places. If you wanted to allocate 6.9%, you would allocate 690&nbsp;points.   5. Fake-Consume Data <p>This step shows how to fake-consume.</p><p>Alice is going to consume her own data and receive most of her money back. In the real world, Alice still needs to pay for&nbsp;fees.</p><p>In the same Python&nbsp;console:</p> # Alice buys datatokens from herself<br>OCEAN_pay = DT_price * num_consumes<br>OCEAN_alice = from_wei(OCEAN.balanceOf(alice))<br>assert OCEAN_alice &gt;= OCEAN_pay, f"Have just {OCEAN_alice} OCEAN"<br><br>OCEAN.approve(exchange.address, to_wei(OCEAN_alice), {"from": alice})<br>exchange.buy_DT(to_wei(num_consumes), {"from": alice})<br><br>DT_bal = from_wei(DT.balanceOf(alice))<br>assert DT_bal &gt;= num_consumes, \<br>    f"Have {DT_bal} datatokens, too few for {num_consumes} consumes"<br><br># Alice sends datatokens to the service, to get access.

She then approves for the exchange to use her OCEAN to buy the datatokens.  We then iterate through each item we want to consume, and buy it from the exchange using Alice’s&nbsp;wallet.  Finally, we validate that we purchased the datatokens we&nbsp;wanted.  Alice is going to send datatokens to pay for the service, and consume&nbsp;them.  We iterate through all the datatokens we’re going to consume, and consume&nbsp;them.  <p>Let’s review what happens economically:</p>  Alice published her own datatoken.  Alice is buying her own&nbsp;data.  Alice receives most of her money&nbsp;back.  Alice consumes her own datatoken, causing her datatoken DCV to go&nbsp;up.  Because Alice owns veOCEAN and has allocated to her data_NFT, she can game the&nbsp;rewards.   7.

Repeat steps 1–6, for Eth&nbsp;mainnet <p>We leave this as an exercise to the reader&nbsp;:)</p><p>We have now simulated wash-consuming and manipulating of DF. Because Alice participated in DF by using her veOCEAN and helped to curate good datasets (her own dataNFT) she should receive some&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Theoretically, you might be able to replicate this on ETH Mainnet and&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Hint #1: Repeat steps 1–6 but <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/blob/main/READMEs/simple-remote.md">use the initial setup of simple-remote</a> flow.</p><p>Hint #2: If Data Farming samples the week 50 times, how can you best capture DCV &amp; veOCEAN allocated throughout the whole&nbsp;round?</p><p>We also need to think about users who will allocate to Alice’s data_NFT and dilute our efforts of capturing DCV &amp; veAllocate. If we look at the table below, and we are operating in Alice’s NFT, we have to consider how other users might come to take advantage of our wash consuming.</p><p>The more users wash-trade, the more competitive this game becomes and margins are reduced further. The way to win the meta quickly evolves to building products that naturally drive the consumption, price, and allocation of veOCEAN towards datatokens.</p><p>As outlined above when describing the evolution of Data Farming, the parameters and mechanisms are changing.

<p>Covered California just began its 10th open-enrollment period with the admirable and ambitious goal of continuing to reduce the number of uninsured Californians. And this is no easy task. If you've ever attempted to access a healthcare benefit exchange, you know it is a very complex system. These exchanges have so many participants like citizens, healthcare providers, insurers–all of whom need very different types of access to many types of services like dental and vision insurance, prices, access to accounts and more.</p>

<p>Covered California is the state's Affordable Care Act marketplace, which was created and managed by the California Healthcare Eligibility and Enrolment System</p>

<p>(CalHEERS) Project. CalHEERS recently completed an update to the system with ForgeRock, implementing a comprehensive identity platform to better serve its various audiences. According to Toua Her, Information Technology Manager I, at CalHEERS, the organization can now "provide a stable, resilient platform for Californians to consume services from the exchange, enhance the security landscape with modern identity capabilities, protect users' data from unauthorized access, and provide a positive experience to consumers where we can leverage the power of identity."</p>

<p>Today, the plan is working. Covered California provides healthcare insurance to a record 1.7M Californians. According to Covered California and federal data, California's uninsured rate dropped to 7% in 2021 (which was 17.2% in 2013) and this marks the largest percentage drop for any state in the U.S. within the same <a href="https://www.coveredca.com/newsroom/news-releases/2022/11/03/covered-californias-10-years-strong-campaign-visits-sacramento-to-celebrate-a-decade-of-historic-increases-in-coverage/">timeframe</a>.</p>

				<p>Trinsic Ecosystems, our next generation platform, became the <a href="https://trinsic.id/ecosystems-exclusive-platform-for-new-users/">default product for new users</a> as of November 1st, 2022. With this update, we’ve unlocked a world of new possibilities for developers building IDtech products. Our goal is to provide flexibility for product builders to create the best experiences for their users.<br><br></p><p>This post will cover:<br><br></p>  Two types of identity wallets (+ our proposed third option)  Key features of identity wallets in Trinsic Ecosystems  Design decisions we made implementing Trinsic Ecosystems  					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Two Types of Identity Wallets (Plus Our Proposed Third Option)  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When creating an IDtech product, there is a delicate balance between user experience and user control. Edge wallets often maximize user control while sacrificing user experience, whereas cloud wallets provide better user experience with little user control.<br><br></p><p>We’ll discuss the wallet possibilities and propose a third option, one that we believe merges the usability of a cloud wallet with the user control of an edge-based solution.<br><br></p><p>Note: You may also hear edge vs. cloud wallets described as a custodial solution vs. a non-custodial solution, especially for people familiar with web3. Holding crypto on Coinbase is a custodial solution. Holding crypto in a MetaMask wallet is a non-custodial solution.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 1. Edge Wallet Solutions  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In an edge wallet, all credentials are held locally on the end-user’s device, giving them full control of what information they share and reveal. While great for privacy, edge solutions have significant drawbacks from a user experience perspective and for the developers building them. Asking users to manage a private key or seed phrase also presents a high barrier for mass adoption.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 2. Cloud Wallet Solutions 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Full cloud solutions store all user credentials in the cloud and often require a username and password to access their data that is tied to a specific platform. While cloud solutions are easy to build and provide a familiar user experience, they miss the mark when it comes to user control, choice of data storage, and interoperability.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 3. Trinsic Modular Wallet Solution 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>The Trinsic Ecosystems platform offers a third option, which we believe combines the best of both solutions. IDtech product builders have the ability to decide where credentials are stored and how users access their credentials. Developers can use familiar authentication methods and cloud storage to start, while providing increased user control and decentralization over time.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Key Features of Identity Wallets in Trinsic Ecosystems 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In Trinsic’s platform, identity wallets are secure, partitioned data stores scoped to a single holder, capable of storing and sharing credentials and proofs. Here are a few key features of wallets in our Trinsic Ecosystems platform:</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 One Step Wallet Creation  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In the past, user onboarding to a wallet required downloading an app, then scanning QR codes to accept connections and credentials. Our new platform streamlines the onboarding experience down to a few seconds as wallet creation happens behind the scenes.<br><br></p><p>On the back-end, when an issuer “sends” a credential to an email, a <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/reference/services/account-service/">user account</a> is created and the credential is associated with the email. The user receives a notification email that they’ve received a credential.<br><br></p><p>For an overview in our documentation, see the <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/reference/services/wallet-service/">wallets section</a>.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Flexible User Wallet Authentication  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic plans to support a variety of authentication methods like email, SMS, sign in with Ethereum and more to allow developers flexibility in how they implement a solution. Currently, the email based authentication flow allows users to enter their email, receive and 6-digit code, and gain access to the credentials in their wallet. Users don’t have to worry about creating usernames and remembering passwords, lowering the barrier to entry for anyone to start using verifiable credentials.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Fast Credential Exchange 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>When a user has access to their wallet, they can share credentials (or selectively share fields from a credential) when they are prompted by an application. Once a credential is shared, Trinsic will check the schema conformance, revocation status, trust registry, and signature to verify the credential in a fraction of a second.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Design Decisions in our Ecosystems Platform 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>For users to adopt a new technology like verifiable credentials, you need to allow for familiar workflows. Every design decision we made keeps user experience at the forefront, while also giving IDtech product developers options for their users to have more control of their identities online.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Cloud Accessible Credential Storage 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>By default, Trinsic Ecosystems uses cloud wallet storage with user-controlled, flexible authentication. This choice allows us to easily support features like account recovery and multi-device credential access.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Modular Platform Design  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>While Trinsic Ecosystems offers comprehensive infrastructure for setting up a trust ecosystem, it’s not a bundled set of technologies. You can use parts of our solution without using the entire stack.<br><br>For example, credentials could be issued and verified using Trinsic’s API, but IDtech companies do not need to utilize Trinsic cloud wallets. We don’t store any user data during credential issuance and a developer could choose to store credentials elsewhere like an edge wallet on a user’s device or in a decentralized storage solution.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Embedded Wallet Experiences 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>Trinsic Ecosystems provides the ability to create an identity wallet that is embedded in an existing web or mobile application. It also supports standalone mobile applications or wallet experiences that are completely invisible to the user while still allowing for the interoperability benefits of using verifiable credentials.</p><p><br>In the past, the only way was building a mobile application in a limited number of languages. Now our platform supports a variety of options, increasing how fast developers can go to market with IDtech applications.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Role Flexibility Between Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
				<p>In Trinsic Ecosystems, we’ve done away with rigid constructs of who can be an issuer, a verifier, and a holder. All wallets in an ecosystem have the same permissions by default, and ecosystem providers can set up a trust registry to establish the governance model of their ecosystem.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Getting Started with Trinsic Ecosystems

<p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Here’s a strange thing. If I told you that the NHS budget could be improved by £19bn (i.e. 10%) without having to raise taxes, most people would be delighted. But if I said that productivity and efficiency savings within the NHS could release £19bn to be spent on better services, what would the response be? A yawn? Shrugged shoulders? A cynical&nbsp;smile?</p><p>It’s £19bn either way. They’re both exactly the same sum of money. But somehow one seems exciting and real while the other seems almost depressingly unreal. Why is this? What is it about words like ‘productivity’ and ‘efficiency’ that generate such negative reactions? Productivity is all about finding ways to achieve more and better with less: less time, less effort, less resources, less energy. What is wrong with&nbsp;that?</p><p>We’ve been pondering this question because it’s vital to our mission. As a social enterprise, our primary purpose is to empower citizens with their data. To help them realise its value in their own lives, to protect it, to use it to improve access to services and to aid inclusion.</p><p>This is all about making it easier for individuals to collect, store and use their own data for their own purposes. But in the process of doing that, we also do something else. By enabling safe, efficient citizen-controlled data sharing we also transform the ways in which services are provided — because personal data lies at the heart of all service provision. In other words, we help both citizens and bona fide service providers to be more productive.</p><p>This is the particular focus of our latest <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">White Paper on The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. It argues that by fixing a simple but fundamental design flaw at the heart of our economic system — the organisation-centric database that is designed NOT to share data — all manner of benefits can be unleashed, particularly:</p>  unleashing an economy-wide breakthrough in productivity via step-change reductions in services’ baseline operating costs, in the public, private and third&nbsp;sectors  streamlining handovers between services (crucial in sectors like health and&nbsp;care),  slashing organisations’ go-to-market costs,  helping individuals and households save time, make better decisions and manage their lives&nbsp;better,  creating new personal information management services and industries,  turbocharging data-driven research&nbsp;and  accelerating and complementing the drive to net&nbsp;zero.  <p>Yet, very often when we talk about this to people, we are met by a wave of indifference. Or even worse, it’s as if the people we are talking to simply aren’t hearing what we are saying. It sort of bounces off them, somehow inducing them to start talking about something else.</p> Reasons for scepticism <p>Thinking about it, we can see many good reasons why people seem to have an aversion to ‘productivity’, the ‘P’&nbsp;word.</p><p>People have grown cynical after decades of austerity where glib politicians have trotted out tired old slogans, saying that cuts to budgets wouldn’t harm services and outcomes because they would be made up for by ‘efficiency savings’. They never said exactly how these efficiency savings would be made. It was just convenient camouflage, a euphemism for cuts that did harm services and outcomes. So it’s not surprising that with decades of such cynical misuse under our belts, the P word now has a bad smell about&nbsp;it.</p><p>In fact, of course, the ‘efficiency savings’ the politicians talked about were the exact opposite of what productivity is really about, which is about genuinely finding ways to do more with&nbsp;less.</p><p>Suspicions are roused even further by the fact that when organisations pursue what they call productivity drives and efficiency savings, what it boils down to is sweating their staff ever harder, making them do more with less, piling the pressure (and blame) on them. Everyone knows that piling responsibilities on people without providing them with the means to do a good job is a recipe for stress and frustration. This, too, is the exact opposite of what genuine productivity is about: which is helping people do a better job, easier, so that they get real satisfaction from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then there’s simple fatalism. Learned helplessness. How many times have politicians and managers spouted grand plans for productivity drives and efficiency savings, where everybody rushes around at hectic speed for a while&nbsp;… until it all grinds to a halt without anything having really changed? That, again, is the opposite of what genuine productivity is about, because genuine productivity can be transformational.</p><p>Take one, simple example. When Henry Ford introduced his moving assembly line using standardised parts, he reduced the time and effort needed to make a motor car by more than 90%. That was genuine productivity: achieving a lot more with less. Ford’s productivity breakthrough made the motor car affordable to ordinary people, transforming how they live, work and play. Applied to the manufacture of a million other products, it made these products affordable to ordinary people too, creating what came to be known as the ‘consumer society’.</p><p>Sure, that society generated its own problems which we are having to deal with now. But this productivity revolution itself was transformational. One tiny example: the introduction of the washing machine lifted an average of seven hours a week of back-breaking drudgery off women’s lives (yes, it was women because washing clothes was regarded as women’s work). How many people today want to give up on washing machines?</p><p>But there is further snag in productivity revolutions like this. They require painstaking, disciplined attention to the detail of how work gets done. They can only happen on the front line of where work gets done. Mundane. Day-to-day. Not glamorous. In other words, when push comes to shove, the P word is for ‘the little people’. Not something that the great and good want to demean themselves with. Rather, something for elites to politely sneer at, and hurl over the fence for lesser people to worry&nbsp;about.</p><p>Finally, there is the simple fact that once a productivity revolution has taken place, we naturally begin to take it for granted. Not long ago, mobile phones were so expensive that only the rich could afford one. Today, most of us have access to a smartphone — thanks to stunning advances in productivity.</p> Despite the scepticism, productivity matters <p>For all these reasons we understand why people are wary of the P word, and often dismissive of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>It’s sad but true, but it takes the average British worker five days to produce what the average French worker does in four days and what the average German worker does in three and a half days. According to the Resolution Foundation, if UK wages had continued to grow at the pre-2008 crisis rate they would be £292 a week, or £15,000 a year, higher. That’s linked to productivity.</p><p>Productivity lies at the heart of prosperity. The only reason why people in countries like the UK, Europe and America live longer, healthier lives is because of multiple productivity revolutions that swept across the provision of all the things we depend on today including food, energy, access to water and healthcare, and physical products.</p><p>A continuing revolution in productivity — this time in the delivery of renewable energy — could, one day, literally save our lives. In 1975, it cost $106 to produce a watt of electricity using a solar panel. By 2020, the cost had been brought down to 2 cents, and improvements are still being made. As I said, that 5,300-fold leap in productivity could play a big part in saving the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>So despite all the yawns, the shoulder shrugging and the cynical smiles we at Mydex are going to continue banging the drum of productivity — of genuine productivity, that is; of productivity that genuinely improves peoples’ lives by finding ways to do more, better with&nbsp;less.</p><p>We have already provided a glimpse as to how. Drawing on our front-line experience in projects we think it’s now possible to unleash a productivity revolution in the provision of services dealing with individuals (in the public, private and third sectors) which is as big and as far reaching as what Henry Ford did for the manufacture of physical products. All made possible by enabling the safe, efficient re-use of data that has already been&nbsp;minted.</p><p>Our next blog will get into the details of what and&nbsp;how.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data Delusion</a> 19th century doctors thought bloodletting would cure most diseases.

<p>It’s been a while since the last Dev Pulse. My commitment to you, dear reader, is that, at a minimum, I always publish a Dev Pulse if there’s a Holochain release with breaking changes. But it turns out that I missed something way back in Holochain 0.0.172! I apologise for the oversight.</p><p>You may also have heard that we’ve announced an important date — we’ll be releasing Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc.0 by December 15th, and we’re asking all devs to write a bunch of tests for their hApps and hammer this RC with those tests. The goal is to discover bugs and stabilise it for the 0.1.0-beta release in January. Read more about how you can help in the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">official announcement</a>.</p> Release notes  Holochain 0.0.172: <code>AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey</code> name change <p>Release date: 9 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160<br>Breaking changes: admin API, HDI, HDK</p><p>Breaking (admin API): The admin API endpoint <code>AuthorizeZomeCallSigningKey</code> had its name and call signature changed, as I <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/hackathon-tool-upgrades-hrea/#holochain-00170-authorise-signing-key-get-dna-def">warned</a> in the previous Dev Pulse. It’s now called <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.69/holochain_conductor_api/enum.AdminRequest.html#variant.GrantZomeCallCapability"><code>GrantZomeCallCapability</code></a> to better reflect that it can be used to create any capability grant, not just an assigned one for signing zome calls. As part of this change, the <code>provenance</code> field has also been removed, as it duplicated information already contained in <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_zome_types/0.0.55/holochain_zome_types/capability/enum.CapAccess.html#variant.Assigned"><code>CapAccess::Assigned</code></a>, which can be used in the payload’s <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_zome_types/0.0.55/holochain_zome_types/capability/struct.ZomeCallCapGrant.html#structfield.access"><code>cap_grant.access</code></a> field. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1647">#1647</a>)</p><p>Breaking (HDI/HDK): Wasmer has been updated to 2.3.0. As part of this change, the Holochain wasmer crate has led to simplifications that require fewer <code>.into()</code>s in your HDK code. You probably won’t need to rewrite any code, but you will need to recompile your zomes against HDI 0.1.8 and HDK 0.0.160 because serialisation across the host/guest boundary has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1620">#1620</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.173: Network performance tweak #1 <p>Release date: 16 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160 and 0.0.161<br>Breaking changes: none</p><p>This release brings the first of a series of experiments to reduce network traffic, timeouts, and deadlocks, which appears to be the primary cause of slow gossip. <code>rpc_multi</code>, a low-level function in the networking layer used to retrieve DHT data, no longer contacts multiple peers. Because it's an experiment, this change may not remain. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1651">#1651</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.174: Smaller gossip packets, signals from <code>post_commit</code> <p>Release date: 23 November 2022<br>HDI compatibility: 0.1.8 and 0.1.9<br>HDK compatibility: 0.0.160 to 0.0.162<br>Breaking changes: network protocol</p><p>Breaking (network protocol): To reduce network timeouts, the amount of traffic being transferred in a network message has gotten smaller in two ways:</p>  Hard breaking: Entry data can only be 4 MB in size (down from 16 MB to reduce gossip bottlenecks for nodes with slow upload speeds). If your hApp does any blob chunking, it’s time to change the chunk size!  Soft breaking: Gossip rounds have a soft limit of 1 MB. This is more of an agreement than an enforced limit, although older conductors will likely have a hard time syncing with this version and newer.  <p>(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1659">#1659</a>)</p><p>Bug fix (HDK): You can now use <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/p2p/fn.emit_signal.html"><code>emit_signal</code></a> within your <code>post_commit</code> callbacks, which allows a hApp’s UI to respond to writes triggered by <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/time/fn.schedule.html">scheduled</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-use-the-scheduler-in-your-zome">tasks</a>, calls from other <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#inter-zome-call">zomes</a> and local <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">cells</a>, and <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">remote calls</a> into a cell from other nodes, as well as simply receive notifications that a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#client-call">locally</a> triggered post-commit has finished.

(<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1667">#1667</a>) Here’s the full list:</p>  <code>ZomeId</code> → <code>ZomeIndex</code>, <code>zome_id</code> → <code>zome_index</code>  <code>AppEntryType.id</code> → <code>AppEntryType.entry_index</code>  <code>AppEntryType</code> → <code>AppEntryDef</code>  <code>AppEntryDefName</code> → <code>AppEntryName</code>  <code>AppRoleId</code> → <code>RoleName</code>  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#20221130011217">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Getting an hREA node set up: quick start <p>Connor Turland has posted a quick-start guide for getting a <a href="https://hrea.io">hREA</a> node set up.

Holochain Beta and more <p>This section is written for developers who are planning the development of their app and need precise details. If that’s not you, here’s the tl;dr: Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc will be released by 15 December, 0.1.0-beta will be released sometime in January, and it’ll be API-stable and supported for the following six months. Meanwhile, we’re working on performance improvements, security audits, and important components for developers and users. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">Read the announcement</a>.</p><p>The core dev team is working hard to stabilise everything for the upcoming release candidate and the following 0.1.0-beta release. The first release candidate will arrive by 15 December and the beta sometime in January.</p><p>0.1.0-beta will have a long-term support (LTS) promise, marking a freeze on all breaking changes and a promise to support hosted discovery services for six months from its release date, as long as you and your users stick to the 0.1.x series. (We may release and support &gt;=0.2.x series in this same timeframe, and you’re welcome to move your app and users to them, but they’ll be separate and parallel and won’t affect our promises for 0.1.x.) This means that you can depend on the stability of the following things within 0.1.x’s LTS period:</p>  Network protocol: You won’t have to ask your users to keep upgrading their Holochain version to keep interacting with their friends and colleagues who are using newer versions.  Discovery protocols and services: Your users will still be able to find each other, because the bootstrap and proxy protocols won’t change, and Holochain’s hosted bootstrapping and proxying services will keep running.  Host API (HDI and HDK): You won’t have to refactor your hApp’s core code to keep up with SDK changes.  App API: You won’t have to refactor your hApp’s UI code to keep up with conductor updates.  Admin API: If you’re a container creator (e.g., you build something like Launcher, Embedded Holochain Runner, or the Tryorama test framework), you won’t have to refactor your codebase that controls the conductor.  <p>Here’s what’ll be included in 0.1.0-beta (if you’ve been following the project for a while, most of these will be old news).</p>  A runtime executable (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain">conductor</a>) and a WebAssembly VM for running the core of your applications  An end-user <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">launcher</a> with a built-in app store, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux  A secure key store for Holochain-related secrets  Developer tools for stubbing, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding">scaffolding</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">testing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/hc_sandbox">running</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/tree/develop/crates/hc_bundle">packaging</a> applications, and a <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">development environment</a> based on Nixos that gives you the full suite of Holochain tools and lets you keep all your application’s dependencies pinned — not just Rust libraries but all the binaries too  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#how-to-secure-functions-against-unauthorized-use">Capability-based security</a> that allows developers to write applications that give their users control over the ways their agency is accessed  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/">Source chains</a> for recording individual state changes  A peer-to-peer protocol that connects machines into separate, private, TLS-encrypted network spaces  A sharded <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/">DHT</a> that validates and stores content-addressed <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">graph data</a>, creating a separate distributed database for each network space  Composability via <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#bridge-call">bridge function calls</a> between a user’s running applications  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/8_calls_capabilities/#remote-call">Remote function calls</a> that allow people to delegate their agency to each other  <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">Node-to-node signals</a> that bypass the DHT  Countersigning of atomic state changes across multiple parties’ source chains, including a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00148-enzymatic-countersigning-functional">primary witness with M-of-N optional witnesses</a> for building highly available, lightweight consensus  Cell cloning for creating new private network spaces with existing applications  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/quantised-gossip-optional-countersigners/#holochain-00147-quantised-gossip">Quantised gossip</a> and a host of other performance improvements to make both publishing and gossiping faster and more respectful of system resources  <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/integrity-and-coordination-part-ways/#holochain-00144-integritycoordination-split">Integrity and coordinator zomes</a>, for maintaining the core data rules over long periods while issuing updates to controller logic  External hash references and Holochain resource locators that allow an application’s graph database to refer to data on other DHTs or outside of Holochain   What are we asking of you? <p>If you’re developing a hApp, library, tool, or container, we ask you to:</p>  Update your hApp’s zome and client code to work with Holochain 0.1.0-beta-rc when it’s published.  Run all your tests against the upcoming release candidates (if you haven’t written tests yet, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/">Tryorama</a> is a JavaScript-based scenario testing framework, and <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain/latest/holochain/sweettest/index.html">Sweettest</a> is a Rust-based framework that comes with the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain">holochain</a> crate and allows you to mock certain parts of the Holochain stack).  Report any errors or developer UX problems you find as <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues/">GitHub issues</a>.  <p>If you’d like to get more involved in the development conversation, remember we have a <a href="https://discord.gg/HhhxQkNUsr">Discord server for you</a>.</p> What does this mean for Holo hosting? <p>As one of the primary groups developing on Holochain, the Holo hosting team is eager to have stable, full-featured releases on which to build HoloFuel, Service Logger, and all the hApps to support hosts and publishers. This milestone will allow them to move more confidently, which will translate to more rapid movement.</p><p>In addition, they’ve been rewriting their <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk">Holo Web SDK</a> to align more closely with the API of the Holochain JavaScript client. This will mean that it’ll be easier for you to get your hApps ready for pre-beta testing on the hosting network.</p> What will happen after this? <p>Here are some <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/">roadmap</a> items that won’t be part of 0.1.0-beta. We'll also be updating the roadmap and adding more details beyond the 0.1.x-beta milestone.</p>  Immune system / warranting to identify and take action against bad actors  Ephemeral store for storing non-source-chain data that can be removed later  Merkle tree entries that provide public proofs of the existence of private data, which can be selectively disclosed to those who ask for it  Pub/sub signals which allows nodes to selectively listen for messages and DHT events by topic  A new large-scale testing framework, which allows developers to spin up &gt;100k nodes across multiple machines and run automated test scenarios  Attack Factory, a library of common threat scenarios that can be played against your hApp to test it for vulnerabilities  <p>Holochain 0.2.0, the ‘network stable’ beta, will include the immune system, end-to-end encryption, a new transport protocol based on WebRTC and TURN, and potentially other features from the list above. It will likely come out while the 0.1.x series is being supported, and will carry its own separate six-month long-term-support promise.</p><p>Not all point release bumps (e.g., 0.2.x, 0.3.x) will contain breaking changes for the things you touch as a developer, so you may find that your hApp will work just fine on the next point version.</p> Happening in parallel <p>In the meantime, things are happening in the larger ecosystem. In the coming months, you can expect further performance improvements, a revamped scaffolding tool (similar to the famous Rails scaffolder), as well as useful core libraries like DeepKey. Various dev teams will be sharing their rollout plans soon.</p> Let’s go! <p>I’m not gonna lie — I’m really excited for this next phase of Holochain’s journey. I know that existing hApp developers are looking forward to things quieting down (although new features are cool too), and I’ve also talked to app developers who are waiting for this stage of maturity before they start devoting time to building on Holochain. It feels like there’s a lot of energy just waiting for this moment, which is fast approaching.</p><p>If you want to know more, read the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-reaches-major-maturity-threshold/">official announcement</a> from the Holochain Foundation and take a look at the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">Holochain roadmap</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@zhpix?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Pascal Meier</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/runway?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 In an industry rife with grooming, racism and even money laundering, isn’t it time the video games industry fixed its KYG (Know Your Gamer) problem? 



 



<p>It’s safe to say that many of us have played at least one video game in their life. Today, over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/three-billion-people-worldwide-now-play-video-games-new-report-shows">3 billion people</a> in the world play video games in their spare time, whether that’s on a console, a computer, or a smartphone. Little wonder then that the market is estimated to be worth approximately <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-152/Accenture-Gaming-Article.pdf">$300 billion</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The industry has changed considerably since Pong (a table tennis-themed video game released by Atari) launched in 1972. Long gone are the days of gamers queuing up outside video games shops to get their favorite release. Now, 83% of video games sales are made online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also been a huge rise in online gaming, thanks in part to the introduction of lightning-fast internet speeds and other technological developments that can facilitate battle royales, and other mass group games. Nowadays, huge communities of gamers can be found in gaming companies’ online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery services, such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network (PSN), Steam or Ubisoft Connect. According to a <a href="https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-152/Accenture-Gaming-Article.pdf">study from Accenture</a>, 84% of gamers believe video games allow them to meet people who share common interests. In an increasingly insular world, the social aspect of video games has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



 Community-centric experiences.&nbsp; 



<p>Although video games offer the gamer exciting and rewarding adventures, and the opportunity to meet people from around the world, the industry has never been far from controversy. Much like horror films in the 80s, video games are often used as the scapegoat for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/26/20754659/video-games-and-violence-debate-moral-panic-history">real life violent events</a>. They are also criticized for their addictive nature, with children racking up <a href="https://gamerant.com/6-year-old-spends-16k-microtransactions-moms-credit-card-sonic-forces-ios-apple/">thousands of dollars</a> in microtransactions, and with increasing incidents of online grooming, harassment and racism, certain online gaming platforms have been accused of being toxic cesspools, and certainly no place for children to be spending their spare time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, online gaming platforms are feeling a growing pressure from their communities to provide a safe and respectful environment. If they don’t, there can be serious repercussions for revenue and reputation, and for the gaming experience and community at large. For example, the notorious French gamer Yannox was <a href="https://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/ubisoft-obtient-la-condamnation-d-un-tricheur-notoire-sur-rainbow-six-39935583.htm">fined €2,600</a> in January 2020 after creating a toxic environment for the Rainbow Six (tactical First Person Shooter) community. The gamer was found to have cheated regularly, and was banned 80 times by developer Ubisoft, which of course affected other players’ gaming experiences. It was also alleged that Yannox caused the swatting (phoning a false emergency to cause disruption) of Ubisoft offices in November 2020, after getting banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, such misconduct is not an isolated incident. In fact, the bigger the online community, the more <a href="https://www.protocol.com/unity-online-gaming-toxicity-study#toggle-gdpr">toxic behavior</a>. Perhaps emboldened by the anonymity that online gaming platforms provide, misbehavior like bullying or verbal abuse is now an almost inescapable part of the gaming community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.adl.org/hateisnogame">third annual report</a>, conducted in 2021, the Anti-Defamation League surveyed a representative sample of US players regarding the prevalence of toxic behavior. It found that 71% of adult online gamers experienced severe abuse, including physical threats, stalking, and sustained harassment, while 60% of responders aged 13-17 experienced harassment in online multiplayer games. On top of that, 42% of women and 41% of African Americans reported to have been harassed because of their gender or race.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>But how can video game companies provide a safe environment for their players, free from verbal abuse, harassment, or cheating?</p></blockquote>



<p>The actions currently taken by gaming platforms like banning or freezing accounts do not seem to act as a big-enough deterrent. Players can simply just create a new account and rejoin the community and continue to engage in misconduct. How? Well, one of the main reasons is because there are currently either very limited, or no identity verification checks when registering for online gaming.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why KYC in video games should be a priority.&nbsp; 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC requirements</a> have been in place for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/online-gambling-regulations-uk/">online gambling</a> for several years, the video games industry has enjoyed a comparatively hands-off regulatory oversight. However, with increasing pressure from campaigners, the general public, and the gaming communities, gaming platforms now face a conundrum: Should they implement rigorous customer onboarding to verify players’ identities, and run the risk of losing customers who don’t want to prove who they are? The more pressing question, however, should be: with the potential impact to reputation, business disruption, and a negative experience for gamers, can they really afford not to?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the future, is it foreseeable that regulators could turn their attention to gaming platforms, making it a requirement to verify the identities of all players? This level of accountability would not only act as a deterrent from gamers engaging in nefarious activities, but it would also, of course, prevent underage gamers from playing certain games, or purchasing microtransactions online. Such restrictions could be based on <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/video-games-age-ratings-explained/">PEGI standards</a>. KYC checks could also be used to prevent anti money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Not all fun and games.&nbsp; 



<p>A <a>recent study</a> from the Radicalization Awareness Network from the European Commission highlighted that Steam and PSN (among others) could be considered “hotbeds for radicalization”. Indeed, as it has become increasingly difficult to launder money through financial services providers, criminal organizations have begun to look out for new avenues, like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-protect-owners-guests-holiday-rental-scams/">holiday home rental scams</a>, for illicit activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Combine the rise in popularity of microtransactions, with the potential for money laundering, and you have a deadly cocktail that may very well push authorities to start asking for KYC requirements in the industry in the very near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With criminal organizations constantly on the lookout for new streams of revenue, payment systems in video games have become a target of choice. The use of convertible and non-convertible virtual currencies for in-game purchases, in particular, has proved to be an efficient way to launder money, as identity verification is yet to be enforced.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/5510338/Sixgill%20Threat%20Reports/Carding%20and%20the%20Gaming%20industry%20-%20Sixgill%20Threat%20Report.pdf?utm_campaign=Lead%20Gen%20from%20Threat%20Reports&amp;utm_source=hs_automation&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=74779191&amp;_hsmi=74779191">report from Sixgill</a> highlighted how <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/fr/home">Fortnite</a> is often used for carding (a form of credit card fraud, in which a stolen credit card is used to charge prepaid cards or purchase gift cards) and as a haven for money-laundering.&nbsp; Bad actors will use illicitly gained funds to purchase in-game currency, then use the virtual currency to buy in-game goods. Finally, they will sell the goods in exchange for “clean” money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2019, Valve <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xw7nx/nearly-all-counter-strike-microtransactions-are-being-used-for-money-laundering">reported</a> that “nearly all” microtransactions in Counter Strike: Global Offensive were being used for money laundering, and was forced to stop specific trading between accounts. Perhaps the question should therefore be not if regulators will consider KYC requirements for the video games industry, but rather when.&nbsp;</p>



 Painful account opening processes.&nbsp; 



<p>From a gamer’s perspective, registering and opening accounts is often seen as a pain point that gets in the way of the fun, but automated identity verification solutions can be integrated seamlessly into a player’s onboarding journey without impacting on the gaming experience. From the business side, not only does KYC help gaming companies gain a better understanding of their players, but it also enables them to weed out the toxic gamers wreaking havoc on their communities. Having these processes in place now will enable video game companies to stay ahead of the pack if AML regulations were ever introduced in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>KYC should be considered the next step in building better and safer online gaming communities. Gaming accounts that have been correctly vetted and verified will allow for easier and more accurate identification of bad actors, and eliminate verbal abuse, cheating, bullying, and fraud. It can also help players retrieve their account after a takeover, as they will be able to easily verify their identity and prove they are the rightful owner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although digital identity verification solutions are typically adopted by banking and financial services as regulated entities, such technology and processes have a wide application of use cases in different industries, including gaming companies. Transparent, efficient and painless for the user, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> from IDnow is an ID solution that can be integrated easily into a mobile app through SDK, a web flow or directly through the IDnow AutoIdent application.</p>

<p>In September, Anonyome Labs’ co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley was once again invited to share his insights on the “topic of the era in the privacy and identity space”—decentralized identity—this time, for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OwU73L-T4Y">Ethereum Engineering Group meet-up</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/">Ethereum</a> is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications. The engineering group regularly meets to discuss applications, engineering, and research, and records each meet-up for its thousands of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ethereumengineeringgroup">subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>For Ethereum, Dr Ashley delivered his landmark talk on progress and pitfalls on the path to decentralized identity. It’s this talk that has event organizers regularly inviting Dr Ashley to speak on the topic of decentralized identity—known as the third wave of identity and access management on the internet. That, and the fact Anonyome Labs is at the leading edge of implementing DI technology through its API platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>. (See our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">identity wallet</a> and our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a> service.)</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told the Ethereum group that with the continued rise of the <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance economy</a>, the world needs solutions that improve <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> for the general public—and we’re seeing those solutions come from <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a>.</p>

   A look into the evaluation process for the Forrester Wave™ for CIAM 2022 

<p>When considering a technology investment, many organizations seek the expertise of industry analysts, often turning to the most respected firms and popular industry reports as a way to shortlist their vendor selections. From my perspective, as a vendor undergoing the evaluation process, it's been interesting to observe the different approaches researchers take as they analyze companies and their product offerings. In this post, I'd like to explore our experience with one firm in particular, Forrester, in its creation of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-names-forgerock-leader-ciam">The Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone (myself included) loves to see how different vendors stack up in a report's final chart or diagram. But have you wondered what goes into those findings? How do the analysts reach their conclusions, and how do they ascertain that vendors can actually do what they claim they do? We feel it's not always obvious in the rankings, nor can you derive a lot of insight from the short vendor descriptions that are a part of most reports.</p>

<p>I was deeply involved in the request for information (RFI) with Forrester for the 2022 report, and I believe I can shed some light on the evaluation process.</p>

<p>Typically, analyst reports begin in similar fashion: the team conducts primary research on a given technology area to develop a list of vendors to consider for evaluation. From that initial list, the vendors are narrowed down based on various inclusion criteria until the final list is determined. While different firms take different approaches to reach their conclusions, this is the point at which Forrester will gather details on the product and strategy of each vendor through a detailed questionnaire, along with use-case demos, briefings, and customer reference interviews. Forrester takes those inputs, along with each of its analyst's experience and expertise in the marketplace, to score vendors using a rating system that compares each vendor against others in the evaluation.</p>

<p>The approach taken by Forrester in its Wave for CIAM report is extensive, much like a full vendor selection, evaluation, and proof process we would see from an enterprise customer and in some cases moreso.</p>

<p>For this report, 15 vendors were asked to provide a thorough RFI response detailing their strategy and market presence. As the head of the sales engineering organization at ForgeRock, I've been involved in our response to numerous requests for proposals from prospective customers, including some of the world's largest enterprises, and I've rarely seen any request as exhaustive as the one submitted by Forrester for this report. Their evaluation included 22 criteria, including detailed descriptions of our product vision, roadmap, market approach, partner ecosystems, delivery models, revenue, and number of live installations, including such details as the largest number of customer authentication attempts per hour at a single client organization. We were also asked to supply a list of customers so that Forrester could conduct reference interviews. Which they did.</p>

<p>Each vendor also had to document how it delivers a set of key use cases. The use cases for the latest Forrester Wave™ for CIAM included:</p>

  Data orchestration: configure intelligent workflow scenarios (aka low-code approaches to deployments). What kinds of visual workflows are available? 
	 Users and roles: manage role-based access control (RBAC), including adding users to roles and roles to users, editing fine-grained permissions, and using role inheritance and/or embedded roles. 
	 Customer IDV and registration: configure identity verification of a new user. What out-of-the-box integrations are available? 
	 Consent management: configure privacy-by-design (data residency) for customer PII that the CIAM solution stores. Show configurations for multiple customer countries, geographical segmentation of users, etc. 
	 Authentication methods: configure protection against credential stuffing, account takeover, and password spraying, and how to enable single sign-on (SSO), passwordless, biometrics, and tokens for multi-factor authentication. 
	 Risk-based authentication: configure risk-based customer authentications and rule-based risk scores, and configure which authentication methods will be invoked based on the risk score. 
	 Customer-self-service: configure policies for customers to recover a forgotten user ID, manage their devices, update their profile, and more. 
	 Business systems integration: configure the CIAM solution to integrate with CRM (e.g., Salesforce), MDM, web analytics, ecommerce portal, and others. What features are available beyond SCIM? 
	 IDV and fraud management: configure the CIAM solution to integrate with third-party IDV solutions, such as Equifax, Experian, LexisNexis, TransUnion, etc., and with an Enterprise or Retail Fraud Management solution, among others. 
	 Reporting, dashboarding, and scalability: set up, define, and run an ad-hoc report. Show filtering, changing order of columns, hiding/showing columns in the output. And show how to set up customized dashboards for CIAM administrators. 
 <p>And this is where it is a little different with Forrester. In addition to written descriptions, they required vendors to demonstrate each use-case scenario in real time to the analyst, which typically took three hours. Under each of the use cases listed above were five or more specific use cases. Vendors had to document and demonstrate their effectiveness in all of them, for a total of 50 use case demos. Beyond just responding to and demonstrating the use cases documented, the analyst can "go off-script," asking the team to demonstrate other capabilities or prove something out a little further — this is a real examination of both the platform and the team presenting.</p>

<p>The use cases Forrester examined for its analysis represent a comprehensive set of requirements for any modern CIAM solution. We believe that any organization considering buying and implementing identity for their customer- or citizen-facing services should be looking at these capabilities and understanding why certain vendors outperformed others.</p>

<p>The team at Forrester has many years of experience in the IAM and CIAM segment and rigorously tests vendors. But we believe this rigor is exactly why ForgeRock obtained the highest score possible in 15 criteria, including data orchestration, users and roles, customer IDV and registration, consent management, authentication methods, risk-based authentication, and customer self-service. And ForgeRock earned the highest score amongst all vendors in the current offering and strategy categories.</p>

<p>When investing in an essential technology, like CIAM, it's important to examine the capabilities that matter most to your organization's success. Reading <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forrester-names-forgerock-leader-ciam">The Forrester Wave™: Customer Identity and Access Management, Q4 2022</a> is a great place to start.</p>

<p>At the 2022 <a href="https://www.codsummit.io/">Compute Over Data Summit</a>, Fission's co-founder and CTO Brooklyn Zelenka gave a presentation on how UCANs help enable computation in distributed systems.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bacalhau.org/">The Bacalhau Project</a> seeks to help users manage large amounts of data by providing developers with decentralized tools that are collaborative and efficient. Developers can compute over vast amounts of data by leveraging the peer-to-peer Bacalhau network of shared compute resources and IPFS Network's content addressing structure. Users never have to move the data itself to a central server to run the calculations. That's because large amounts of data can be represented by hashes, thus requiring less energy to run the necessary operations. </p><p>At Bacalhau's Compute Over Data Summit (Bacalhau is the Portuguese word for cod, and the Compute Over Data acronym spells out "cod" 😉), Fission's co-founder and CTO <a href="https://octodon.social/@expede">Brooklyn Zelenka</a> gave two presentations. One was called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y1RB8wt_YY">IPVM: The Long Fabled Execution Layer</a>, and the other was called Decentralized Authentication . The former is mainly a recap of the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-breaking-down-ipvm/">IPFS Thing presentation</a> that Brooklyn gave earlier in the year, and you can view the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y1RB8wt_YY">CoD presentation</a> on YouTube. The latter is what we'll focus on today, in which Brooklyn explains the ins and outs of <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>.</p><p>UCANs stands for User Controlled Authorization Networks. They enable ways of authorizing offline-first apps and distributed systems. We previously shared a more <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/verifying-ucans/">technical break down</a> of UCANs on the blog, and today we'll be discussing UCANs within the context of computation. </p> Solving Locality Problems <p>Traditionally, when a developer wants to interact with services that have access to data, the different parts of the network have to have individual agreements with one another, and the developer has to pre-negotiate tokens in order to interact with each part. This is because you need an authorization server, located in a specific place, that can handle these negotiation requests and agreements.</p><p>In distributed systems using content addressing, we are able to use capabilities rather than an authorization server. Therefore, location becomes a non-issue and the compute and the data are able to move about freely!</p> What is a Capability? <p>A capability defines what the issuer is granting permission for, and what the recipient can do with that permission. It is entirely defined by the person issuing the UCAN and the ability for the recipient service to understand the request. This means a wide variety of capabilities can exist. </p><p>Capabilities in UCANs are also fully extensible, so you can add more fields to restrict a recipient's permissions.</p><p>And the best part is you don't need anything further for invocation! So the compute over data can take place right where you are, enabling distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPC</a>.</p> Chain Witnesses <p>Furthermore, in-browser cryptographic keys and offline compute means users can keep off of external systems entirely. The public and private keys that are now built into browsers can interoperate and connect to each other securely, and the user need only select the specific subset of data they want to compute over and then send the diff back to the network. All of this is made possible through content addressing and chain witnesses.</p><p>Chain witnesses are the individuals (people or software agents) that have been granted varying levels of access to a piece of content. It is possible to walk up the chain and see who delegated which permissions to whom, thus allowing the service to verify access. </p><p>Issuers can also revoke access to specific users and anyone downstream from them. </p><p>Learn more about UCANs and decentralized authentication by viewing Brooklyn's full presentation below:</p><p>Brooklyn's <a href="https://noti.st/expede/G8hQ9v/decentralized-authorization-plumbing-for-permissionless-interoperation#sE7Fv97">presentation slides</a> are also available.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

				  Twitter already showed how misinformation moves fast; but botched identity shows that “verified” misinformation can move even faster  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>With his acquisition of Twitter, Elon Musk has set about to make sweeping changes, one sure to be analyzed in business school case studies for years to come</p>
<p>Until now, a Twitter blue check was, for many, a status symbol reserved for those with high numbers of followers, celebrity, or organizational status; it was something to be achieved. More importantly, it also served as a way for users to know for certain that a tweet truly originated from the high-profile person purported to be behind the account. It was designed to protect the reputation of individuals and organizations and made it easier for users to parse through the never-ending flow of opinions and updates of hundreds of millions of users and organizations each day. But it was reserved for the few. Musk wanted to democratize verification through charging for a blue check.</p>
<p>“You too can have the long sought-after blue checkmark for just $8” Sure, ok.<br>“Eliminate the bots and spam!” Sounds great.<br>“Cut down on fake news?” Yes, please. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it was launched.</p>
<p>But what, exactly? It was not clear that verification was being performed at all—or it was being done in a way to make a mockery of the process. Some were quick to take advantage of the situation. By simply changing their Twitter handle, tweaking their profile name, and paying $8 for “verification,” they could easily impersonate other people or companies. Now you could be anyone you wanted to be AND have it officially verified by Twitter — a perfect storm for an online identity crisis.</p>
<p>For business, the result was a nightmare:</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>&nbsp;Incredibly, fake accounts led to billions of dollars in lost market cap:&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 And it wasn’t just Eli Lilly that took a hit. Two of its top competitors, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, saw sharp drops in share price as well, also equaling billions of shareholder dollars.<p></p>
<p>Twitter’s largest source of revenue has, historically, come from large companies looking to reach a large audience. But now, some companies are questioning their presence on the platform, viewing it as a liability to their brand. Some major advertisers have paused paid ads, including General Motors, United Airlines, General Mills, and Audi.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, the new verification scheme had been paused. Some 140K users had signed up for the $8 “verification.” This is the equivalent of $13.4M ARR— or an amount easily obtainable from the ad spend of a single advertiser. In addition to being a small amount of revenue, this low-quality verification scheme has likely cost Twitter itself billions of dollars.</p>
<p>How should Twitter solve its verification problem?<br>
Part of Twitter’s problem with verification is that it doesn’t have good resources to lean on when it comes to verifying every company, government, and person; it becomes the sole arbiter of impersonation attempts. Pre-Musk Twitter solved this problem by limiting verification to those invited — this allowed it to limit the amount of leg work required while avoiding the combinatorial effect of ‘open’ registration. Musk’s attempt was, perhaps, noble, but naive to the difficulties of actually proving identity.</p>
<p>The solution is portable trust enabled with verifiable data. This approach avoids the logistical, technical, and regulatory issues with database and API integrations. Data is cryptographically signed, which allows it to be verified when it’s presented. The data can move with the subject, rather than rely on direct contact with the authority.</p>
<p>All kinds of data can be made into a verifiable credential. Business registrations, proof of employment, drivers licenses, anything.</p>
<p>So how does this help Twitter?</p>
<p>Imagine an ecosystem where a variety of credentials are available to both businesses and individuals. During registration, credentials may be presented to Twitter. Twitter can verify both the cryptographic signatures and the validity of the issuer, and use that verified information to make decisions about the names being registered. This is a vast improvement over today’s ad-hoc verification process of manually chasing down information from a wide variety of sources.</p>
<p>Before you ask, we are not going to claim that the product we sell will solve Elon’s problem in 15 seconds or less. What we do have is experience with the&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">open-source decentralized identity technology</a> that begins to solve the underlying problems with verifying data and identity online — and which will make Twitter’s verification challenge a much easier task.</p>
<p>Indicio has experience working with verifiable credentials and the open-source projects that support their issuance and verification. We have a packaged offering called <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven™</a> that offers commercial support for those that don’t want to use the open source project directly. This allows the issuance and verification of credentials and functions as an important part or a start of a credential ecosystem.</p>
<p>With an active ecosystem of credential issuers, verification procedures for Twitter (or anyone else with a verification problem) become fast and efficient — and much more resilient to impersonation attempts and other issues that can cause the havoc we are observing now.</p>
<p>We can also offer design consulting or assistance for any circumstance. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Give us a call!</a></p>

 2022 has witnessed record growth for fintechs, but wherever there are opportunities, there is increased competition, and greater scrutiny from regulators. 



 



<p>There has never been a time of greater opportunity for financial technology businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Continual advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics are delivering digital-first solutions to meet ravenous consumer demand for instant, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">mobile-led products and services</a>.</p>



<p>A glance at Forbes’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/06/07/fintech-50-2022-the-newcomers/">fintech rich list</a>&nbsp;reveals half of the top 50 are new entrants, with cryptcompanies and start-ups vying to make banking services cheaper, more accessible, and more convenient for the public. As more fintechs launch, venture capitalists continue to pump money in; a total of $133 billion globally was invested last year, almost three times the amount of the previous year.</p>



<p>“New” newcomers are jostling with the “old” newcomers; digital banks such as Starling, Monzo, money transfer service Wise, and retail investing apps Robinhood, Freetrade and 2-1-2 have already carved out revenue streams from services that were formerly the preserve of traditional institutions.&nbsp;</p>



 Risky business. 



<p>However, the knock-on impact of having a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-growing-pains/">packed field of fintechs</a>, and such huge sums of money swirling around is that the risks have also exacerbated. Competition is more intense than ever, with major&nbsp;names in&nbsp;technology entering the market to compete with the stalwarts and app-based digital banks.</p>



<p>Regulatory pressure is also at a level unseen, with penalties for poor anti money-laundering controls spiking to record levels in recent years. The $10 billion in fines collected by regulators last year puts into sharp focus the $26 billion total for the entire post-financial crisis decade of 2008-2018, with no sign of a slowdown in enforcement.</p>



<p>Multi-million-dollar fines have long been commonplace for banks that step out of line, but now fintech firms are finding themselves on the receiving end of increasingly hefty sanctions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mobile trading app Robinhood landed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-for-misleading-customers-and-outages-the-largest-finra-penalty-ever.html">record $70 million fine</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/media-center/newsreleases/2021/finra-orders-record-financial-penalties-against-robinhood-financial">FINRA</a>&nbsp;for multiple failings of systems and policies, while in the UK, audit watchdogs have shown concern over the lack of understanding around systems and controls inside some major digital banks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e7bca1a-f43a-45f1-a684-1f6cf1415e2c">such as Revolut</a>. According to comments by a company insider to the Financial Times, Europe’s second most valuable fintech “needs to have a back office like a bank and it’s got the culture of a tech firm,” which is sure to sound familiar to many within the sector.&nbsp;</p>



 Fintechs are not exempt from fines. 



<p>The number of firms hit by AML fines more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.complianceweek.com/aml/report-number-of-aml-fines-up-penalty-totals-down-in-2021/31492.article">doubled</a>&nbsp;in 2021. The largest sanctions were still reserved for banks, with Malaysian lender AmBank stung for $700 million for its role in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-1mdb-ammb/malaysias-ambank-to-pay-700-million-in-1mdb-linked-settlement-idUSKBN2AQ1XF">1MDB financial scandal</a>, however, the wider spread of offences embroiled several fintech firms. Although the official figures of 2022 fines are unlikely to be revealed until early 2023, all signs are that they are likely to follow a similar pattern to 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last 12 months, the cryptocurrency sector has increasingly found itself in the crosshairs of enforcement agencies. In February, BlockFi agreed to pay $100 million, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-26">largest-ever enforcement penalty</a>&nbsp;for a crypto firm, for systems and control failures. A few months earlier, Helix, a large cryptocurrency-centric organisation, was fined&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ohio-resident-pleads-guilty-operating-darknet-based-bitcoin-mixer-laundered-over-300-million">$60 million for darknet money laundering offences</a>, and the chief operator of the organisation, Larry Harmon, faces 20 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, another crypto trading platform was fined $29.3 million for violating multiple sanctions, including those outlawing US companies from doing business with individuals operating in Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba and the Crimea region of Ukraine. Regulators discovered that the Washington-based Bittrex failed to maintain an effective anti-money-laundering program from February 2014 through December 2018. As few as two employees were responsible for reviewing over 20,000 daily transactions for suspicious activity during that period.</p>



<p>Other notable penalties over the last year include a $360,000 fine for Wise, formerly known as TransferWise, by the regulator of Abu Dhabi’s free zone financial centre. Indeed, the UAE is a perfect example of a region experiencing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-fintech-challenges-opportunities/">unprecedented regulatory scrutiny </a>following its banking sector’s recent growth. The local subsidiary of Wise paid $360,000 for breaching anti-money laundering requirements and failing to identify and verify the source of funds or wealth held by high-risk customers carrying out transactions on their behalf.</p>



<p>Wise did not “consider customer nationality as part of its risk-based assessment of its customers,” along with other breaches, the regulator said, indicating a serious escalation of financial regulatory enforcement in the Middle East.</p>



<p>With added scrutiny from regulators, exposure to geopolitical shocks, economic uncertainty, and the prospect of a long period of cheap money and leverage winding down, an entirely new set of risk management tests has materialized for fintechs to pass.</p>



<p>Speed to market times are decreasing alongside these pressures, but firms that streak forward without a solid foundation of compliance risk losing it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“While growth is the top priority, the need to manage risk, optimize costs and increase efficiency also requires new technology innovations,” said Gartner analyst Moutusi Sau. The research consultancy is predicting a $63 billion outlay on new technology by financial services firms in 2023.&nbsp;</p>



 Looking forward. 



<p>As fintech challenger banks are now invariably competing for customers based on the customer experience, rather than, for example, account opening bonuses, they must ensure their customer onboarding experience is as safe and secure as it is intuitive and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through every technological advancement that fintechs implement, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">AML</a> process needs to remain front and center, and at the very cornerstone of any customer onboarding experience. It needn’t necessarily be an either (security) / or (consumer experience) situation. Read more about the steps that the UK banking sector can take in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-aml-kyc-challenges/">‘How UK’s banking sector can meet its AML challenges’ blog.</a></p>



<p>IDnow provides the most powerful, configurable, and secure platform for identity proofing. Whether automated or expert-assisted, IDnow’s identity-proofing methods have been optimized to meet the strictest security standards and regulatory requirements without compromising on customer conversions or the consumer experience.</p>



<p>Any fintech company or traditional bank that wants to avoid falling victim to fraud or fines in 2023, needs to invest in the right KYC technology and risk management platform. Smart thinking and better technology can provide fintechs with the necessary stability and assurance the market needs as they navigate obstacles in a febrile trading environment.</p>

For example, given a mnemonic, key type and hd path, there will be a corresponding public private key pair. In the case of Ethereum and Bitcoin, these keys can be used to derive addresses that support crypto currencies.</p><p>We have explored using these patterns to support issuing and verifying verifiable credentials.</p><p>In particular, using JsonWebSignature2020 to issue Linked Data Proofs and using VC-JWT to issue compact JWT based verifiable credentials from the same “did:key”. This proves that the key representations support both established and emerging cryptographic suites.</p><p>Finally, we have used the demo to communicate to implementers of the VC API one way to conform to the interoperability test suites, and we have added Postman integration tests that demonstrate interoperability.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@OR13">Orie Steele</a>, Transmute’s CTO and Co-Founder, has managed security concerns for startups and publicly traded companies, building secure web applications in Finance, Energy, and Healthcare.</p><p>Connect with Orie on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/or13b/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/OR13b">Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OR13">GitHub</a></p><p>About<a href="https://transmute.industries/"> Transmute</a>: Building on the security and freedom that Web3 promised, Transmute provides all the benefits of decentralization to enterprise teams seeking a cost effective, interoperable, planet-forward experience provided by experts in technology and industry.</p><p>Transmute was founded in 2017, graduated from TechStars Austin in 2018, and is based in sunny Austin, Texas.

 Regulation is finally here, and uptake is increasing, are you ready to join&nbsp;Europe’s most lucrative gambling industry?&nbsp; 



 



<p>It’s been more than a decade since the Dutch government took the first step toward regulating its online gambling market. Back in 2012, it was believed the Dutch online gambling market had the potential to become one of Europe’s most&nbsp;<a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/dutch-market-early-success-true-battles-ahead/">lucrative gambling industries</a>. Logically, the legalization and subsequent capitalization of online gambling, which would also put safeguards in place to protect gamers from fraud and underage gambling, seemed like an easy decision for the Dutch government to make.</p>



<p>However, the Netherlands’ journey toward a fully regulated online gambling market was peppered with multiple&nbsp;<a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/regulation/dutch-igaming-launch-delayed-for-third-time/">delays</a>, regime revisions, and millions of euros in fines levied against illegal operators along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Dutch Remote Gambling Act (KOA) was finally passed in April 2021. In October of the same year, a month before the official launch of the licensed market, the Dutch national regulator&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kansspelautoriteit/">De Kansspelautoriteit</a> (KSA) outlined a new series of penalties and tighter rules against unlicensed operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although only&nbsp;a year&nbsp;has passed since the&nbsp;introduction&nbsp;of the fully regulated market, the uptake has been quite impressive. In fact, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://kansspelautoriteit.nl/nieuws/2022/september/markt-online-kansspelen-stabiel/">recent survey</a>&nbsp;by the KSA, eight out of 10 players now bet with legal operators. The goal of the KSA was to attain an 80% channelization rate within three years, but it has exceeded that (85%) within just 12 months.<br></p>



 Playing by the rules. Or else. 



<p>With the online Dutch gambling market amassing about €81.4 million per month, the industry is clearly worth protecting. Rewarding those who play by the rules will only allow for further growth. Operators can apply for a gambling permit for&nbsp;€48,000, but those who don’t will face the full wrath of regulators and law enforcement.</p>



<p>KSA has stated that unlicensed operators that attract the most players will be subject to higher fines. For example, illegal providers with a turnover of more than €15 million will be fined 4% of their annual turnover. Operators whose turnover is less than €15 million will be fined €600,00, which is a substantial increase from the €200,000 basic fine introduced in 2019.</p>



<p>Additional fines are levied if operators target minors, or if no information is made available on how to prevent addiction to gambling.</p>



<p>The message from the KSA to unlicensed gambling operators is clear: register to comply with local regulations and requirements – or face the consequences. The longer time goes on, penalties will only become more severe</p>



 So, who needs a licence&nbsp;for the Dutch online gambling market? 



<p>Any operator, whether domestic or international, that operates in the Netherlands and offers any of the following online games of chance needs to apply for a permit:</p>



  Casino games in which the players play against the license holder (roulette and blackjack, for example).  Casino games in which the players play against each other (poker, for example).  Bets on events occurring during a sporting contest or on the outcome of a sporting contest.  Bets on the outcome of horse racing and harness racing.<br>  



<p>Currently, almost three quarters of all gross gaming return is generated through casino games, while 25% comes from sports betting such as the World Cup.</p>



 Licence to gamble. 



<p>One of the key requirements for gambling operators to earn a permit and adhere to Netherland’s rigorous gaming regulations is the ability to prove they know who their customers are and perform a valid <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer (KYC) check</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The KSA requires player verification to take place before participation in games. The following information is required: name, date and place of birth, gender, address, and contact details, including at least one email address and phone number.</p>



<p>Before a player can gamble, the gambling provider must also check the Central Register of Exclusion of Games of Chance&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/centraal-register-uitsluiting-kansspelen/">Cruks</a>)&nbsp;to see&nbsp;whether the player is registered.&nbsp;</p>



 Is it worth it? 



<p>Gambling operators, whether from the Netherlands or elsewhere, endure many <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/responsible-gaming-for-safe-online-gambling-sites/">challenges</a>, such as risks of fraud, underage gambling, regulatory compliance, and increasing competition to offer safer and smoother onboarding processes.</p>



<p>Although the Netherland’s zero-tolerance policy toward illegal gambling has pushed operators to attain a permit, the competition for players is still incredibly fierce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The customer experience, especially during the sign-up process, is paramount. Operators must make the onboarding experience as intuitive, streamlined, and safe as possible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s experience in offering automated identity proofing experiences for gaming companies, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/eyas-gaming-chooses-idnow-autoident/">Eyas Gaming</a>, allows operators to stay compliant and ahead of the game.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI-powered identity verification tool, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> streamlines the onboarding process of gambling platforms by scanning players’ identity documents, processing the data and verifying identities within a matter of minutes. It is also compliant with regulations across 195 countries and offers coverage in over 30 languages.</p>

 Design flaws of blockchain technology — Asset Ownership  Binding assets to&nbsp;users. <p>The world as we know it was introduced to the blockchain with the popularization of Bitcoin, which was launched at the start of 2009. Much later, that moment came to be fondly remembered! An infamous fictional inventor: Satoshi Nakamoto, claimed to have made available a near-perfect peer-peer electronic cash system that is untraceable by design. Satoshi’s weapon of choice is anonymity. Considering an ideal world where anonymity is power, and power should, and will be in the hands of the people, Satoshi aimed to make Bitcoins operation decentralized. He achieved this by using an anonymous address as an account number/ account address. The address obtained from the public key must match with a private key held by the user in his cryptocurrency wallet. Handling of the asset requires the user to sign the transaction using their private&nbsp;key.</p> Is anonymity the same as&nbsp;privacy? <p>Contradictory to the claim, anonymity does not ensure that the user’s privacy is protected! In fact, these are not interdependent on the other at all. For transactions to be recognized in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, they must be acknowledged by a consensus. For this to happen, the transactions cannot be encrypted. This is particularly dangerous if there is criminal or nefarious intent, as users and their addresses are viewable to all. The idea of privacy and private information is negated when users can be in danger due to immutable transparency. Few specialized blockchains such as ZCash provide privacy by encrypting transactions.</p><p>There has been a lot of skepticism about the actual intention of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, due to the lack of accountability and the anonymous nature of the address system. “Privacy for social benefit” is not the first thing that crosses one’s mind while considering Bitcoins’ real-world applications. Since its integration into the financial system, there have been numerous problems. Bitcoin has been used to facilitate the anonymous buying and selling of weapons, drugs, and paraphernalia on the dark web, the laundering of money, and funding terrorism, and crime. Earlier this month, U.S. law enforcement officials said they were able to recover $2.3 million in bitcoin paid to a criminal cybergroup involved in the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May. The FBI said its agents were able to identify a virtual currency wallet that the hackers used to collect payments from Colonial Pipeline (Tan,2021).</p>Image Source: Bloomberg<p>The Bitcoin framework is built around anarchism. The structure is built to ensure that the identity of the user cannot be verified. This system is systemic in eliminating traces and can be used for the laundering of money without accountability. While user identification is hidden, specifics about the transaction like account balance, address, and asset transfer information are available for all to view. Legacy financial infrastructure has been designed, tried, tested, and has evolved over hundreds of years. There are instruments and policies in place to prevent the misuse and manipulation of the financial system.</p> Lose your key, lose your&nbsp;assets! <p>Blockchains like Bitcoin have an unfortunate and rather comedic characteristic, which some may have come to realize is quite tragic! To access the wallet, you require a private key. In case you misplace this private key, the assets that are bound to it, are irrecoverable. This is because there is no option to get access to the wallet besides the private key. There are third-party methods like Shamir’s secret Sharing (SSS), or Secure Multi-party computation (MPC). However, these options are expensive, time-consuming, and not foolproof. There is no guarantee that the assets may be recovered. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/tens-of-billions-worth-of-bitcoin-have-been-locked-by-people-who-forgot-their-key.html">Of the existing 18.5 million Bitcoin, around 20 percent, is currently worth around $140 billion. These appear to be in lost or otherwise stranded wallets, according to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis.</a> Wallet Recovery Services, a business that helps find lost digital keys, said it had received 70 requests a day from people who wanted help recovering their riches. This is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s technological blunders, which sets it apart from normal money, and makes it risky. Bitcoin has no company to provide or store passwords.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article"> But the structure of this system did not account for just how bad people can be at remembering and securing their passwords (New York Times,&nbsp;2021).</a></p>Image Source: RAPP, Fortune.com<p>During the conception of the MetaMUI blockchain, anonymity was seen as a design flaw and therefore has been addressed in a way that binds assets to the user’s identity. All transaction that takes place on MetaMUI has identifiers that allow the asset to be linked to the user by decentralized identity technology called SSID or self-sovereign identity. No personal information is stored on the blockchain, and user identities are managed using signed certificates called verifiable credentials. This ensures high-quality privacy for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>MetaMUI is designed so that even if the private key is misplaced, a replacement may be generated after identity verification through official documents. Once the user passes verification, the new key is handed over and the assets can be reacquired without any delay or complications. Considering asset reacquisition, and the fact that no one apart from the user can authorize a transaction, one can assume that MetaMUI’s privacy standards are more on point with what is really required for real-world applications, and to have a working financial blockchain. A wallet stored on the user’s smartphone contains a private key, and this key does not leave the device. Information and identity theft is quite common in traditional banking and current cryptocurrency exchanges. There are industries built around protecting against and the effective handling of these mishaps. However, the MetaMUI blockchain renders these mishaps obsolete. The system uses a wholly decentralized method to manage and recover private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>At MetaMUI, we are always looking toward the future and are driven toward benefitting humankind. Do share your thoughts and opinions in the comments&nbsp;section.</p> About us <p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based blockchain that solves the trilemma of identity, privacy, and programmability. It enables legally compliant digitization of currency, identity, assets, certifications, signatures, contracts, copyrights, arts,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>More about&nbsp;us</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Source: Non-commercial-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-SA&nbsp;2.0)</p><p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Back in the 1960s and 1970s before digital, one of kids’ main entertainments was the comic: Superman, Batman, Marvel comics like the Incredible Hulk, The Beano, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>One promotional line for Superman — Is it a bird? A plane? No! It’s Superman — became a common cliche. It was just for kids. But it raises one of the most fundamental questions there is for human thought: telling the difference between one sort of thing and another. Friend or foe? Opportunity or&nbsp;threat?</p><p>This question — what sort of thing are we dealing with here? — is fundamental to all debates about personal data. Some people frame this debate in terms of human rights. Some people frame it in terms of opportunities for innovation opened up by new digital technologies. Others focus on specific products and services that can be created using personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>When they peer inquisitively at this strange new phenomenon, they naturally describe it in ways they already know. A bird? A plane? But no. In this case, we are dealing with something else entirely: a super-villain or a superhero — the nature of the very system itself. How it works. What it&nbsp;does.</p> Fixing a fundamental design&nbsp;flaw <p>Right now our society is contending with a design flaw at the heart of its economy: the siloed organisation-centric database. As a resource, data is unique in one crucial respect. When it gets used it doesn’t get used up. Many different people can use the same data for many different purposes. Which means that if the full personal, social and economic potential of personal data is to be realised, it needs to be&nbsp;shared.</p><p>But the organisation-centric database is designed to do exactly the opposite: to make sure that data is NOT shared. The result is not only a system based on citizen exclusion (because citizens never get to access or use their own data) and potential privacy invasions.</p><p>It’s much bigger than that. Economically speaking, it is a system that every day automatically generates a) increased costs that multiply as they cascade across the system, thereby stifling productivity plus b) a complete block on whole dimensions of innovation — all the uses to which data could be put which are NOT happening, because users can’t access the&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data, then, is neither bird nor plane. It’s not just a policy issue. Or an innovation issue. Or a business opportunity issue. It’s a system design issue, the central question being “how do we overcome the intrinsic limitations of the organisation-centric database?”</p><p>Our new White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> explains the enormous opportunities that are created when personal data is shared in the right way. That is, when citizens become the point at which data about themselves is integrated; where they are able to access, collect, store, use and share their own data independently, under their own&nbsp;control.</p><p>The Paper examines seven enormous economic opportunities that this change in system design can bring. They are the opportunity to:</p>  Unleash an economy-wide breakthrough in productivity, via step-change reductions in services’ baseline operating costs,  Streamline handovers between services (crucial in sectors like health and social&nbsp;care),  Slash organisations’ go-to-market costs,  Help individuals and households access services and manage their lives&nbsp;better,  Create new services and industries,  Turbocharge data-driven research&nbsp;and  Accelerate and complement the drive to net&nbsp;zero.   Evolving to a new system&nbsp;design <p>We’ll explore each one of these themes in coming blogs. But to see their potential, we need to see how a new system design can be created: via a new layer of personal data logistics infrastructure by which organisations can share data they hold about individuals with these individuals, and where individuals can then use this data for their own purposes including sharing it with other service providers.</p><p>This could be any data. But economically speaking, the most important data points that organisations deposit are ‘verified attributes’ — information about an individual (such as whether they have passed an exam or are eligible to access a service) that has been thoroughly checked and confirmed by a responsible organisation. These verified attributes are cryptographcially secure, which means they cannot be tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>Figure 1: Step One of the Mydex personal data logistics process</p><p>Once the data is deposited in the individual’s personal data store it is held there, safe and secure, ready to be used by that individual whenever they need&nbsp;it.</p><p>Individuals can also add other information about themselves. Especially valuable is information that only they know, such as their personal goals and changing priorities and preferences, and the contexts in which they are making decisions.</p><p>Figure 2: Step Two of the Mydex personal data logistics process</p><p>When the individual starts dealing with a new service, either from the same organisation or from an entirely new one, that service will ask for the bundle of data that is needed for the delivery of that specific&nbsp;service.</p><p>With data already deposited in the individual’s personal data store, the individual can immediately send it, at the press of a button. And if it takes the form of a secure verified attribute, the organisation receiving this data can confidently use it, without having to regenerate it, recollect it or check it. Data held in individuals’ personal data stores is kept up to date via secure API links with the organisations that hold the original&nbsp;data.</p><p>This means that individuals can bring ready-to-use data with them to all their service relationships. It is this that eliminates layer upon layer of friction, effort, risk and costs from the workings of the economy as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Over time, the more data that is deposited in the individual’s personal data store, the richer and more rounded it becomes — creating the best possible up-to-date, accurate picture of that person and their life. The richer this data set, the more uses it has, and the greater its ability to cut costs when shared — always under the control of the individual whose data it&nbsp;is.</p><p>Legally enforceable data sharing agreements ensure that individuals’ data is <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/safe-by-default-6a45fe2f93ee">safe by default</a>, with organisations having to sign legally binding agreements to respect individuals privacy and data when they sign up to connect to the platform.</p><p>With this new infrastructure it is possible for our entire economy to evolve to a new level: a new system design. Rather akin to animals emerging from the sea to learn how to breathe air and walk on land. Or if, you like, become superman rather than just a bird or&nbsp;plane.</p><p>Once you can see how the infrastructure works, suddenly all its opportunities become visible. Let’s start with the most immediate and the biggest — and the one currently most ignored — an economy wide revolution in productivity.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data&nbsp;Delusion</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">Why is personal data so&nbsp;valuable</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/is-it-a-bird-a-plane-no-its-super-efd09dcc8121">Is it a bird?

 What Are Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks? 
<p>Of all the cybersecurity threats on the internet, phishing seems to be the most prevalent. Per a <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">report published by Verizon</a>, phishing is the most common attack in 2021, with 43% of all breaches originating from these attacks. According to the same report, 74% of U.S. businesses experienced a successful attack, 30% higher than the global average.</p>
<p>Phishing, as a form of social engineering, uses communication technologies (primarily email) to send deceptive messages to members of the organization to entice them to disclose information. “Social engineering” is the use of non-digital, social channels (emails, phone calls, in-person interactions, even physical interactions at office locations) to gain information that aids in the unauthorized access to resources.</p>
<p>These emails can use tricks to hide email addresses or model important messages from a legitimate organization to get recipients to provide login credentials or other pieces of data. The following are some of the most common tricks and techniques to look out for:</p>
 
 Pretending to Be Members of an Organization: Phishing attacks can obfuscate the sender’s email (called “spoofing”) to look like it came from someone inside the organization. Emails that look like they come from management can entice recipients to respond without thinking twice. 
 Pretending to Be a Third-Party Company: Many emails will attempt to present themselves as originating from a legitimate company. 
 
<p><a href="https://www.knowbe4.com/press/q4-2020-knowbe4-finds-work-from-home-related-phishing-email-attacks-on-the-rise">A study performed by the KnowBe4 security firm</a> shows that many emails will contain subject lines that include the name of a popular platform like Twitter, Zoom, or Google. Many will use HTML editing tools, copied logos, and formatting to make their emails look as if they were sent from the company.</p>
 
 Pretending to Be a Security Warning From a Common Application: Alongside the previous approach, many messages will use security warnings to elicit worry and immediate action. Warnings could include a message that the user’s account has been compromised, that multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been triggered, or that a platform has updated its security policies. 
 
<p>Hackers might also make phone calls to people in an organization, pretending to be IT support or another department in that organization, to gain access to information. Some social engineers dive into dumpsters to find documents with sensitive data.</p>
<p>For the most part, educated employees can see through these tricks. More importantly, well-formed email policies can help non-technical employees recognize problematic emails and report them. But even in large organizations, all it takes is one person to provide a password to compromise an entire system.</p>
<p>Why are these attacks so powerful? In short, they bypass technical security controls and target people where they least expect it. Phishing is a form of social engineering, where the attackers use social or communicative means to gain information about an organization that can facilitate an attack.</p>
 What Are Types of Phishing Attacks? 
<p>A phishing attack can be launched from nearly anywhere, using multiple technologies, and prove difficult to trace depending on the countries they are launched from.</p>
<p>Some common forms of phishing include the following:</p>
 Deceptive Phishing 
<p>The most common type of phishing is the practice of hackers impersonating legitimate companies to fool recipients to give up usernames and passwords associated with those companies. For example, a hacker or hacking group might spam an email stating that it is from their bank’s security department attempting to access a user’s bank account.</p>
 Email Phishing 
<p>Email is by far the most common form of phishing. Attackers will often send mass emails to the public or to members of an organization under a specific domain (like “@companyname.com”) to find users who might fall for the trick. Because many major corporations can have hundreds or thousands of employees, it’s common that at least one person will fall for the trick.</p>
 Spear Phishing 
<p>Spear phishing is a specific type of attack that, Instead of using a mass email approach, will use knowledge of the organization and personnel to spoof emails, create tailored emails, and target specific people in the organization. While spear phishing takes more time and effort, it typically results in higher success rates.</p>
 Whaling 
<p>Whaling is another form of phishing. While it uses the same approaches as spear phishing, it will involve targeting higher-profile targets like managers, administrators, or executives. A successful attack at this level of the organization can expose a system to more security risk because these users will typically have more access to sensitive information.</p>
 HTTPS Phishing 
<p>Attacks can often have multiple stages, one of which involves sending the user to a malicious landing page or website where the user enters their information (or ends up with an infected computer).</p>
<p>The common advice for HTTPS attacks is to determine the site’s security. For example, if a site is using Secure HTTP (HTTPS), then .</p>
<p>However, modern hackers have found ways to get security certificates, a necessary part of implementing HTTPS security. This makes even illegitimate landing pages seem legit, fooling victims.</p>
 Pharming 
<p>Pharming, the combination of “phishing” and “farming,” combines an initial attack with a lingering hack. Pharming starts by tricking a user into clicking a link or visiting a website that installs malicious code into their system. This code will intercept internet traffic coming into that system and reroute it to a malicious website.</p>
<p>Second, the attack will propagate to a central IT system, like a server, and do the same. At this point, any user attempting to route to that server will go to the malicious site, often without noticing it.</p>
 Vishing 
<p>Vishing, short for a voice phishing attack, is a traditional attack performed over the phone rather than by email. More aligned with old-school social engineering, vishing attacks are common from illegal call centers in India or Russia, where callers attempt to trick people into providing bank information or sending cash or gift cards to third parties.</p>
 Smishing 
<p>Smishing, is the practice of phishing for credentials or scams over SMS texting—an increasingly common form of attack. While not as common as email phishing attacks (right now), frequencies of these attacks in the UK increased almost <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/smishing-reports-increase-nearly-700-in-first-six-months-of-this-year-12407504#:~:text=Reports%20of%20text%20message%20scams,there%20were%20banking%20smishing%20attacks.">700% in 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.safetydetectives.com/blog/what-is-smishing-sms-phishing-facts/">cost U.S. businesses over $54 million in the same year.</a></p>
 Clone Phishing 
<p>Clone attacks use legitimate emails (either cloned from widespread customer support messages or hacked email boxes), modify them with malicious links, and resend them as a forward or an accidental email. These messages may go unnoticed, but others might use the email as if it were the original.</p>
 Evil Twin Phishing 
<p>In a world of Wi-Fi and mobile networks, hackers are getting more and more creative in their attacks. An evil twin attack uses a fake Wi-Fi network as a phishing method. The hacker will set up a Wi-Fi hotspot with a similar network name to a legitimate one (for example, one associated with a public business Wi-Fi). And users connecting to this network will expose their network traffic (and all their information) to the hacker.</p>
 Phishing Resistance Means Strong Training and Identity Verification 
<p>Phishing is the most prominent form of attack on the web. It’s tempting to blame this on users, but in reality people cannot be expected to understand every potential vulnerability and attack vector. Training and awareness are critical to preventing attacks, as are strong authentication systems.</p>
<p>Modern authentication has moved away from password-only schemes, which has helped prevent some attacks—but it isn’t enough. A combination of passwordless security with advanced biometrics and identity proofing can make it so that a user cannot actually give out usable credentials through an attack.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides this type of authentication and identity management for enterprise businesses. We do this through the following features:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID includes Identity Assurance Level 2 (NIST 800-63A IAL2), detects fraudulent or duplicate identities, and establishes or reestablishes credential verification. 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through identity credential triangulation and validation. 
 Integration with Secure MFA: BlockID readily integrates with a standard-based API to operating systems, applications, and MFA infrastructure at AAL2. BlockID is also FIDO2 certified, protecting against attacks that attempt to circumvent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication.</a> 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API, including private blockchains. 
 Privacy by Design: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private blockchain and encrypts digital identities in secure enclaves only accessible through advanced biometric verification.

<p>Let’s talk about identity. Your own and your organisation’s. Where do you use your identity the most, where is your organisation’s identity seen most often? Or maybe a better question is, where are those identities most at risk? </p>
<p>In the Nordics Social Media is referred to as “SoMe”, keeping things short and sweet. Everyone knows that you are talking about any, or all, of the social platforms that you are on personally, or that your company participates in. SoMe is great for connection and exposure and building networks.&nbsp; Quickly finding like-minded people, or even doing some light market research – just to see what’s out there. </p>
<p>It doesn’t really matter who you are, or the SoMe platforms you use – there have always been trolls out there. Just waiting to steer the conversation or post in a direction that the original poster didn’t intend. Or worse, the troll could be posting and pretending to be you or someone from your organisation. Even today it is hard to know who to trust. </p>
<p>Impersonation – it’s in the news a lot these days. How to manage and ensure your organisation is actually yours. And how do your customers or prospects know… It’s a challenge for even the largest companies. This is exactly what we’ve been working on at Ubisecure. If you are wondering which checkmark to purchase, then we have the answer for you: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Registering your corporation’s LEI, Legal Entity Identifier, has never been easier. Using Ubisecure’s RapidLEI service, we can issue your corporation with its own globally unique LEI today.</p>
<p>When you combine your LEI as an organisational attribute in your CIAM system, like Ubisecure’s Identity Platform, you gain the ability to identify and assure your partners and end customers that your staff really are your staff. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here at Ubisucure, our vision statement, having “The ability to combine strongly authenticated individual identities with highly assured organisational identities to show who you are, who you represent, and the rights you have when representing them.”, leads us through every step of every day. </p>
<p>We continually work to create a service that can securely integrate all aspects of your organisation. Offering the ability to strongly authenticate each and every user, then provide them with the needed digital authorisation to carry out the tasks/purchase orders/emails/video calls/ or SoMe posts. </p>
<p>We’re interested to hear your challenges – how would combining a strongly authenticated person with an organisational role, like Product Owner, help your company meet the challenges of today’s digital world. So, I’ll ask you to reach out to anyone here at Ubisecure, on any SoMe method you like – even the good old email contact – we’d like to hear your challenge and see if we can’t offer a solution for how to strongly identify and assure you and your business online.</p>

 Let’s talk about digital identity with Bianca Lopes, Identity Advocate, Investor. 
<p>Join Bianca Lopes and Oscar as they discuss the top challenges, solutions and achievements for digital identity within the financial industry – the connection to regenerative finance (Refi) and how this is changing identity in finance.</p>
<p>[Transcript below]</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think a lot of the microservices architectures that some of the banks and financial services companies have implemented in their movement to the cloud, or just in their change inside and internally, have opened up their minds to rethink identity across the organisation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Bianca Lopes is an investor, business builder, economist, and identity expert, who focusing on driving meaningful impact through technology and regulation. Leading many significant identity projects and having helped transform how data can unlock financial and social worth. With a central focus on how we can rewire finance using the power of digital identity, ethics, and Web3.</p>
<p>Bianca is driven by how we negotiate competing values with data and information technologies. In her work I have supported over 40 financial institutions and 8 governments to reshape their approach to technology, rethink the role of identity, and leverage their innovation agendas. She manages an international speaking calendar to help business leaders, governments, and consumers understand the impact that data, privacy, and finance will continue to have on our lives.</p>
<p>Bianca’s journey and lived experience have informed her worldview. Born in Brazil, educated in Canada, based in Denmark and multilingual, she has encountered both sides of economic and digital development. Her mission is to build bridges and create value. She is honoured to work with UNESCO’s International Research Center on Artificial Intelligence. Here we facilitate cooperation in developing artificial intelligence with special emphasis on supporting the development of a vibrant AI ecosystem Globally.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And today, we’ll hear how the financial industry is redefining itself. And of course, what is the role of identity on this. For that, we a have special guest who is Bianca Lopes. As an investor, business builder, economist and identity expert, Bianca Lopes focuses on driving meaningful impact through technology and regulation. Leading many significant identity projects, she has helped transform how data can unlock financial and social worth. Bianca’s central focus is on how we can rewire finance using the power of digital identity, ethics, and Web 3.0. Hello, Bianca.</p>
<p>Bianca Lopes: Hello, Oscar, thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: First, tell us about yourself and what was your journey to this world of identity?</p>
<p>Bianca: All right. Well, I guess I’ll start where my sort of journey on this Earth started. I’m from Brazil, originally. I’m an economist, as you mentioned, and my journey started in data centres. I was actually putting biometric hardware in physical parameter security. And I got into this after working at the bank for few years, I worked as a trader, and I worked in commercial banking. And then I worked in risk management and came to work with my client. And he was building this business. And this business was in the biometric space.</p>
<p>And back in the day, it was kind of like, you know, minority report, when you told people you worked in biometrics. And little did I know that that’s where my journey in identity was meant to start. And that was about over 13 years ago. It’s been incredible. It’s been a journey of purpose and a journey of understanding what an industry is really capable of.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and as an economist, suddenly doing some biometrics and I’m feeling, did that scare you? Apparently, it didn’t scare you at that time.</p>
<p>Bianca: No, it kind of excited me when I like, well, at first, when you kind of realise you break it down and its data, right, as an economist, you’re used to being able to handle like tremendous amount of data and compute things. And, you know, your kind of – like, I’m kind of a curious person so I was trying to correlate things.</p>
<p>So I was looking at this technology and figuring out, OK, if we’re using this for some of the highest, most secure data centres at that time in North America and all over Asia, how can we look at this in this digital world that I was inherently built in, that I saw us trying to build at RBC where I used to work.</p>
<p>So that was kind of how we went from literally a physical wall, to this thing on the phone before there was even sensors, we started talking about, you know, how can this mean – a mean of access. And that was the first time and realised that what excited me and not scared me was that this is about access. This is about understanding. As an economist, I was curious. And it was about correlating these big data things to understand who’s here? Who’s allowed? And that was like a revelation moment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Fantastic. That spark your attention so much that you, yeah, you are here now talking about digital identity and very into this industry. So, from your perspective which started this world of digital identity and finances now, through this journey, your entrepreneur, you do many things as far as I know. So, from this very wide perspective you have on your opinion, personal opinion, what are the top challenges that digital identity has today?</p>
<p>Bianca: I think the first one is the reality. It’s the reality that as much as we’ve made some unicorns and billionaires, and, you know, we have our click clubs are growing, it’s still not understood. And it’s still in the hands of a few and we still miserably failed at addressing massive portions of the population, from our biases on how we build code or to the way, you know, we’ve distributed that technology, or to the barriers we’ve created with understanding.</p>
<p>I often find, you know, part of, or half, so it sounds like an airy-fairy journey and excited and identity was – it was hard. It was a lot of acronyms and a lot of things that didn’t talk to each other, didn’t interoperate. It was almost like it was designed that way. So, when I look at one of the challenges like that’s the first one is education and understanding. But it starts with this acceptance of the reality of where we are.</p>
<p>You know, we’ve gone a long way, and this industry is filled with amazing people, which is why I’m still here and like preaching as loud as I can. Preaching is not the right word but like sharing and saying, “Hey, guys, I’ve seen the light and like, some of these things can change the world.” But the challenge is, you know, it can only change something you can at least acknowledge or see or understand. And a lot of us have made this super complicated, that’s why people like you, Oscar, and this community are like, we need more.</p>
<p>So that’s the challenge. That’s one of the, I think, of the big ones, on the education, on the understanding. Then there’s technical challenges we can talk about.</p>
<p>Oscar: Of course, technical challenges, there are many. And of course, the most techy, between us we are working hard to solve the challenge. But I definitely agree with you with the education, so understand well, what has – well, what has failed a way. So, what we don’t understand enough, even between us who are in this industry.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, we divide, right? Like if you kind of walk around or even if you look at, and fair enough, like a huge part of this, I feel like, “How did we get here?” You ask yourself in the financial services industry, how did we get here that we don’t have at least a shared understanding one of the importance of identity? Like I’ve been looked at like an alien for a long time in some of these bank conversations saying, Identity. And like, “What?” And then they’re like, “Ah, onboarding.” And I was like, “No, no, no. Identity.” And I’m like, trying to have a principles conversation, a foundational conversation, not a fix here conversation. So, I think there’s a little bit of that in the challenge of the industry itself. And a lot of that has to do with control. And I think the way we were taught how to look at data, how to think about data. And identity is kind of like the foundation of a lot of that, right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed, indeed, yeah. Crazy. Well, now that you mentioned, you had had some of these conversations where mostly anybody in the room means – understand what identity means in that context is well, hard to imagine. And I suppose it still happens today.</p>
<p>Bianca: I think everybody has a different definition. And that’s part of the beast. And that’s part of the identity crisis of not only of financial industry, but our own industry, and human nature trying to label things.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what would you say about good solutions or achievements. So, let’s not focus on what is wrong, but the things that you have been observing, finding, discovering in these last years, and something that good solution achievements, yeah, that are worth mentioning in this identity industry?</p>
<p>Bianca: Ooh, where to start? There’s so many. Like, the industry has been filled with so many. My career was fortunate to me, like I worked in many projects in digital identity from digital infrastructures of the biometric expert. Relooking at some of the adjacent consequences of Aadhaar, which, you know, people talk about it as a failure.</p>
<p>But if we talk about starting a billion people in the beginning of the industry, that was a compliment. The failure perhaps was that lack of, or constitutional infrastructure, or lack of privacy, or security built into it, which leads me to like, look at how much cryptography and like zero-knowledge proof as an industry and as a specialisation has grown. And so that to me is, you know, the deep, deep tech infrastructure that is going to make digital identity work.</p>
<p>In the biometric space, my country often gets looked over in Brazil, and they’ve done amazing, if you look even just back in the ’90s to advance the industry. You know, when Fujitsu was coming up with like, palm hand vein sensors, and HID was finding fingerprint biometric and talking about persistent identity. This was like in the ’90s. And the industry has evolved tremendously ever since.</p>
<p>And now, you hear sure, Vitalik talks about soulbound NFTs. Or finally, our CEO of JP Morgan talk about identity is important. Like, that’s great. This is important. And some of the new technology and even standards on NFTs are identity components that we’ve been talking on the credential industry for ages.</p>
<p>So, some of these advancements and technologies worth mentioning are the foundation of what’s been predominantly at the periphery of the technology stack. If you’re a technologist or think about it in a bank infrastructure, it’s been at the onboarding or it’s been in access directory. Now you have to reconstruct this with thinking of, you know, decentralising data honeypots. You look at technologies from like an innovator or some other folks that understand that this innovation is needed, that now we have more data points, more identifiers, more ways of looking at people’s identities to how we’re going to also upkeep privacy ethics and centralisation of data.</p>
<p>Those are all advancements I get super excited about. They go from, you know, when people talk about in the banking industry of building trust, or building a digital economy and connecting everything, and seamless everything, this infrastructure needs to be built and these advancements is what, it’s definitely worth noting and worth understanding.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, certainly there’s a lot being ready to be used, combined, and of course, customised to different needs. And specifically, now we go see more closely to the financial industry. What is working well today in the financial industry from an identity perspective?</p>
<p>Bianca: Well, I think we’ve kind of succeeded or got there in the biometric camp that I started in. I started selling biometric software to banks and Visa. And it was like, I’m talking about biometric authentication. So that’s working. I think it can improve and there’s a wave of improvement and excitement. But it’s been implemented in like onboarding journeys. I think most of us can now correlate to what I say when I say, you know, your face recognition. I remember when I started, people were like, “Your what?” Like, what are you going to do with that? So that’s been well and working.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the microservices architectures that some of the banks and financial services companies have implemented in their movement to the cloud, or just in their change inside and internally, have opened up their minds to rethink identity across the organisation. You know, we’ve talked about it being in silos and you know, the bank didn’t know that the Bianca that owned this business is the same Bianca of the personal side, and where is the line in the sand. And that has allowed the identity and document verification industry to make billions because you authenticated the same person twice.</p>
<p>Now that when you’re thinking about that change, that’s something that is working in the financial services industry. But the change, you’re still seeing, like, if I brought big banks in their room and said, “Hey, how many people here are on identity and access, or identity management, or security?” There’d be a lot of hands in the room. So, from a lot of different departments. And then there’d be a lot of different vendors in the identity stack and ecosystem that would come along with that. And I think that that’s working but could be better. And needs to be better.</p>
<p>Oscar: When you mentioned biometrics, of course, you started a long time ago with biometrics. But today in the recent years, so which ones are the ones most used? And it’s mostly mobile or how it is in practice? Yeah, how is the personal interaction?</p>
<p>Bianca: It depends country by country, but if I want to go make gross global generalisations, and I mean gross here, like if anybody who want to talk about a country you guys can hit me up after. But it’s mostly obviously the same trends that follows mobile. And one of the interesting parts about a lot of the technology advancements practically in computer vision, some of the underlying technology that, you know, people talk about in machine learning is what also works in biometric space, it’s predominantly benefited from better sensors, better cameras, better microphones, because it’s better capture of data.</p>
<p>So, if you think about a biometric, you know, minutiae or template, it’s kind of like a photo of a bunch of little pieces of information together, the better the data, the better the photo, the better the accuracy of you being you. So, it kind of has followed that trend. Which one is more predominantly used? Obviously, you’ve seen facial biometrics take over pretty massively, and you saw, and I think there’s going to start to see a resurge around fingerprint and some of the other alternatives for what one could call like multifactor authentication, or higher degree of like transactional value, a.k.a. “I need to be a little bit more certain so I’m going to mix some stuff here.”</p>
<p>But when – in the same token, when you look at things like accelerometer sensors on phones and other identifiers, and tokens inside of phones, you have this other wave of proxies or pseudonyms out of identity that are also coming up that one could sometimes people encompasses all this stuff into like behavioural, but there’s subtleties there. And I think that that’s also something you will see. You’re seeing now in the fraud department as a trend, but you’re not seeing it as much as a passless like, imagine your metaverse authentication. It kind of just kind of knows your avatar and here we go. There’s lots of other factors behind this like, image or thing.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. So, it feels like we’re going to see more biometrics, not only in the financial industry, of course, a lot in the metaverse as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Oscar: And tell me how is the financial industry redefining itself?</p>
<p>Bianca: Well, I think it’s been redefined a lot by, if you kind of look around the globe, by regulatory regimes – opening up and understanding this concept we started with around data, right. That identity is so central too and it needs to take a bigger role here. My point being the identities like they’ve had to redefine themselves.</p>
<p>Like if I look at Brazil, you know, some of the banks had to redefine themselves because you had a president of our central bank incredibly fast moving and changing legislation and opening up parameters of data sharing that enable entire FinTech multitrillion dollar FinTech industry to be built. So, they’ve had to reinvent their services, you know, through much pain, kicking and screaming around digital transformation, where I think that one could say they’re being forced now to redefine themselves is in this CBDC, which is another foundational part of the architecture of any system, exchange of value as well.</p>
<p>So there, you starting to see banks look and do some things, some more than the others. Some of them pay attention to, obviously, crypto conversations and other legislation. So, they’re having to reinvent themselves in terms of what is their payment acceptance. I’ve yet to see us fully embrace the thing I’m excited about, which is, you know, another hash tag here, but ReFi, Regenerative Finance. And why am I getting excited about this? Because finally identity can have such a massive role, and a rule of equity of value and equity of distribution.</p>
<p>So that’s how I’m excited about the finance industry understanding that, you know, at some point, we all made up money. And they became the kind of holders and, you know, guardians of some of it, along with central bank for a public good. Where did we lose track along the way? And what are we going to look at financing? Because I don’t know about you, but the world is backwards and a little bit on fire, is probably the understatement of the century. So, if banks intend to have something to redefine and to count, I expect them to be doing a lot more than what we’re seeing today in digital transformation. And I think the identity industry can see this as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. How you define that concept of regenerative finance?</p>
<p>Bianca: It’s the idea of you’ve extracted things from the world, you’ve extracting things from people. If you look at the agriculture, we’re here to feed, but have you really thought about the effect that it has on the human bodies of those who feed us? And yet, we’re still starving as a collective. Why does that exist? Well, because of the price of trade, because of the price of how much labour is in certain areas, because of the price of a commodity, because it pays more to farm a pig than to plant a tree.</p>
<p>But if you looked at a world that was a nature-based economy, and we as economists, or just as humans realise that things are finite, and we’re connected as an ecology. There’s no balance sheet, you know, delineation between the air that I breathe and the air that somebody in India breathes. So, I can put carbon credits all day long, but I have to acknowledge these things.</p>
<p>So regenerative finance is a movement. It’s a decision to say, “Hey, how do I use models and instruments?” You know, bonds, stocks, exchanges, bank account, these things were built for facilitating trade and facilitating, hopefully distribution, access. This is all about identity as well, right? And we’re kind of like, so regenerative finance is an opportunity for finance to think about what incentive structures are they building. What kind of incentives are we building for humanity? Do we need another stock exchange when there’s no water? Everybody’s, like where where’s the line?</p>
<p>Oscar: Who needs to lead this regenerative finance? A bit difficult word for me. I don’t know.</p>
<p>Bianca: So, finanças regenerativas, finanzas regenerativas – Portuguese and then in Spanish. Who needs to lead? It’s a community effort. It’s not – and that’s the starting point. The starting point is like, it’s acknowledgement of our impact in the good and bad ways. Like, we all have impact in how we exchange energy, how we’re there, and it’s acknowledging that, and I don’t think it’s like, OK, the banks have to lead it, or technologists have to lead it. Like, that has led us here.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. Yeah, I’m getting your point.</p>
<p>Bianca: I would like to think that the answer lies not there. I don’t have a crystal ball.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So, what’s the primary issue that ReFi seeks to address?</p>
<p>Bianca: That the incentive structures of building and caring for the planet and humanity are backwards. So, they seek to build products, infrastructure, instruments, market, liquidity, you know, which deep down, like, how does the world go around? If you ask me, I’ll tell you, energy. If you ask most, they’ll tell you, money. If you really look at that, that’s what they’re trying to address.</p>
<p>How do I make sure that, you know, the farmer in Brazil doesn’t want to cut down a tree but he actually makes more money from keeping the tree and maybe he can have time and take care of his body or take care of somebody’s education or his own future and reduce the cost of health care? Like what is the impact of realising we’re connected ecosystem? A word that is so used and like so not but true. So that’s what I think. We’re trying to figure it out, or just at least acknowledge.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how the industry, how the digital identity industry can help. So, what’s the connection? Being more concrete on this, so how we can help? What is the connection between ReFi and digital identity?</p>
<p>Bianca: All right. So, if you kind of think about it in a very simplistic way, and you said, here’s the Earth, and here’s all these people, and these animals and these resources on it. Like a good board game, right? We have all these things. How do you distribute them? Well, you kind of first have to identify them. And the digital identity industry, or the IoT industry, or the you know, the data industry, and the auxiliary industries around security and distribution and storage and cryptography are going to be needed if we’re going to play this game in a fair, transparent and ethical way that we can keep people accountable.</p>
<p>So that’s how to me in a very simplistic down to Earth way. We talk about, yeah, we’re going to build digital trust, we’re going to be able to exchange everything in the metaverse and we’re going to go from this place to this place. We would have fractionalise this, like, how are you going to identify these things? How are you going to tie them? How are you going, you know, authenticate and verify, like, where these systems going to interoperate? Who’s going to make sense of like, where’s going to be the security? Hey, this one is not identified like, are we in the system? Are we not… Is that going to be a creepy thing? Is that going to not going to be a creepy thing? Like, in a very simplistic way, that’s what the identity industry should have done and should have thought about. That’s why I talked about periphery to foundation. To me it’s a massive change.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s definitely interesting. I think we have to talk more about this in the future. So yeah, hopefully.</p>
<p>Bianca: We can talk, I can talk about this for days.</p>
<p>Oscar: I’m sure you do.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah, I love what I do.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. ReFi a topic that definitely we have to talk more in the future, so yeah, I have to bring in more in this podcast. So, this is the first time, thanks for introducing this, so much about this before. Bianca, final question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Bianca: To pursue the definition of identity within the context of their work. If you listen to this, it’s because you’re curious, or maybe because you’re exploring an identity project, maybe in the periphery, like I said, you know, I’m getting a better document verification, or I’m getting a new security system, or I’m doing a new way of identifying money laundering fraud. Like, maybe you’re in somewhere in that journey. Step away and try to connect the dots in that identity journey inside of your business. There’s a lot of cost-savings to be made and nothing else during this recession. And there’ll be much to be gained if you enjoyed, or sort of got a little bit of this conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Bianca for a super interesting conversation.</p>
<p>Bianca: You’re welcome. You do lots of these. So, I hoped I would.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please let us know how people can continue the conversation with you or learn more about what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Bianca: Yeah. Totally. Reach us via LinkedIn, or there’s a website it’s Biancalopes.com, pretty simple, or Instagram, Twitter @biasmlopes. Any of those ways you’ll get a hold of me. And if I’m in your city or in your country, hit me up. I’d love to grab a coffee if you’re talking or interested in identity, and if I can be of help, part of the journey.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot, Bianca. It was a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>

<p>Be In Crypto: Two European Central Bank (ECB) members launched an unprecedented critique of Bitcoin. They affirmed the failure of Bitcoin to replace or improve the monetary system, as it has never been used for significant real-world transactions. In reply to ECB’s publication, Lior Yaffe comments that this is a predictable critique and ECB is making great efforts to make Bitcoin irrelevant, as a conflict of interests. Lior added that Bitcoin is a door opener and a case study of the decentralized economy. It might not have fulfilled its full potential yet, but it is certainly a hint for things to come.</p>

<p>Dear Metadium community,</p><p>Our technology is trusted by multiple private and public institutions and, as a result, it is being used to provide a wide array of services, some well known and others not so much. Because of this, we are launching a series of articles to bring light to our services, specially those less&nbsp;known.</p><p>Let’s start with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinplug.bpass&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">B PASS</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.coinplug.enterprise.jeboapp&amp;hl=ko&amp;gl=US">Public Safety Report</a>. These are the two main services provided to Busan, South Korea’s second largest city with over 3.4 million citizens. Metadium’s relation with Busan City started in 2019 with the designation of the Blockchain Regulation-free Zone and the resulting development and constant improvement of the aforementioned services.</p><p>With <a href="https://metadium.com">Metadium</a> blockchain technology, the user’s personal data is encrypted and stored directly in the user’s mobile device, instead of a centralized database. Due to the nature of the technology, data records can’t be tampered with and security risks like hacking or theft are eliminated.</p>B PASS and the Public Safety&nbsp;Report B PASS <p>B PASS is Busan’s DID-based mobile identification card integrated with a variety of public and private services such as the citizen card, public libraries, tours, maternity health cards, and digital vouchers. Among the other services integrated in B PASS&nbsp;are:</p> Mobile transportation card <p>With the use of non-face-to-face identity authentication technology, users are able to issue and customize their transportation cards without the need to provide any personal information to third parties. The B PASS-integrated transportation card works in subway rides, buses and&nbsp;taxis.</p> Unmanned convenience store&nbsp;access <p>B PASS-integrated access card for Busan’s unmanned GS25 convenience stores, the leading convenience store chain in South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Customers can access unmanned stores without the need to provide any personal information to third parties. The application of Metadium DID technology eliminates the risk of information leakage by delivering the identity verification through a QR&nbsp;code.</p> Government24-linked storage <p>The Government24 portal issues over 100 different types of certificates and, through this integration, users are able to store them in an electronic wallet in the B PASS app. Users can access the acquired certificates at any time and submit them online to different institutions (businesses/agencies/insurance companies, etc). This also reduces the big amount of paper normally used for different kinds or processes.</p> COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service <p>With the integration of the COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service into B PASS, users can receive and store proof of their vaccination status in their mobile app. These certificates can be accessed whenever they are requested and are simple to use: individuals only need to show a QR code in their mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>(Suspension of provision of BPASS COVID-19 Vaccination Certification Service due to the suspension of the government’s implementation of quarantine passes after March,&nbsp;2022)</p>B PASS The Public Safety&nbsp;Report <p>The Public Safety Report app is a secure and transparent data sharing platform that promotes citizens’ participation in the community’s safety improvement. With the Public Safety Report, users can relay information regardless of time and location with DID authentication, this ensures the anonymity of the informants and data reliability, while using a reward system to encourage citizens’ participation in the&nbsp;reports.</p><p>There are two types of reports within the&nbsp;app:</p>  Regular Report: Citizens can report an accident, public inconveniences or a natural disaster to the appropriate public facility.  Mission Report: Public facilities launch missions with the intention of getting information to increase safety and prevent accidents. They can be a general mission, a location verification or a survey mission. With this kind of report, participants get rewards that can be exchanged with the Busan Digital&nbsp;Voucher.

  <p>If you were to follow security best practices, your passwords would be long and complex, containing no dictionary words. You'd have a unique one for every online account, service, or application – roughly 100 passwords if you're like most people. You'd change them regularly and you'd remember them all, perhaps using a password manager but never saving them in a file (or a notebook next to your bed).</p>

<p>Passwords have become the bane of most people's online experiences. If you switch devices, you'll have to enter your credentials and remember that complex password. If you forget, you may have to go through a reset — you might even get locked out of your account.</p>

<p>We've all heard it before, but I'll say it again: passwords are inherently bad. They're bad for the user experience, bad for security, bad for support, and bad because they enable credential phishing attacks. And yet, as we head into 2023, passwords remain the most widely used form of authentication. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

 It's time to do away with passwords; "passkeys" represent a major step forward 

<p>As a long-time champion (and enabler) of passwordless authentication, ForgeRock has been a part of the war on passwords. The latest front in this war has come from the FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2) Alliance's introduction of passkeys, quickly followed by announcements from Apple and Google about their support for the use of passkeys on iPhone and Android operating systems.</p>

<p>This introduction remedies a key usability and experience gap that has been holding back the broader adoption of passwordless authentication, promising to deliver better end-user experiences and reduce the risk of credential phishing attacks.</p>

 Passkeys remove login friction by working across your devices 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> is based on the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard, and features the convenience of biometrics, such as a fingerprint or facial scan. WebAuthn eliminates the need to enter a password by utilizing private and public key cryptography for secure authentication.</p>

<p>Until now, the widespread use of passwordless has faced headwinds due to limitations in the portability of WebAuthn, which has been tied to the physical device enrolled to the user. The private keys stay in the vault on the user's mobile phone or device. So the frictionless experience goes away when the user changes devices or gets a new one, as the new device no longer holds the login credentials (private key) to authenticate.</p>

<p>Passkeys eliminate this restriction by allowing the private keys to be stored in a vault in the device vendor's cloud instead of on the device itself. Passkeys remove the reliance on hardware from the equation and, in so doing, remove friction when you change devices.</p>

 By eliminating passwords, you thwart the most common types of attack 

<p>Unauthorized or fraudulent access remains the number one attack vector and will continue to be as long as passwords are around. According to the 2022 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2022-forgerock-consumer-identity-breach-report">ForgeRock Consumer Identity Breach Report</a>, compromised credentials accounted for half of all data breaches in 2021. Passkeys and other approaches to passwordless authentication remove attackers' ability to use and re-use stolen credentials, and can play a powerful role in your multi-factor authentication (MFA) strategy.</p>

 ForgeRock delivers no-code, out-of-the-box support for passkeys 

<p>While other vendors have had to code it into their platform and upgrade their systems to support passkeys, we are excited to announce that the ForgeRock Identity Platform already supports passkeys without requiring any coding changes or upgrades to the platform. Passkeys have been supported by ForgeRock since their inception and available for our customers to use.</p>

<p>Our unique platform enables passkey support to be offered out-of-the-box (OOTB), and it's seamlessly integrated into user journeys to deliver multiple authentication choices to users. ForgeRock customers with active deployments will receive passkey support along with FIDO support, as the platform does not differentiate between, and equally supports, keys that are device-bound and those that aren't.</p>

 Enabling more flexibility and choices in passwordless authentication 

<p>ForgeRock customers are already building no-code passwordless authentication journeys with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access Trees</a>, which facilitate <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">journey orchestration</a> in the identity platform. We also provide OOTB integrations for the FIDO2 WebAuthn standard through Intelligent Access.</p>

<p>With passkeys already supported by these WebAuthn nodes, our customers can provide more passwordless authentication choices to end users, depending on the user's specific mobile device. Building passwordless user journeys is quick and easy — you simply drag and drop the pre-configured WebAuthn nodes and adjust the journey to meet your needs. Supported in WebAuthn nodes, passkeys are easily embedded in user journeys which then steer towards different passwordless paths based on run-time signals.</p>

 Never login again 

<p>Passkeys represent an important step forward in achieving truly seamless, outstanding experiences while dramatically reducing credential-based attacks — all by making passwords a thing of the past. We are enhancing passkey configuration options for different deployments to further improve security and interoperability, and to address customer needs for maximum choice and flexibility. As the recognized leader in passwordless technology, we continue to innovate and move closer to our mission of "never login again."</p>

Using Polimec (Polkadot Liquidity Mechanism), projects would be able to access critical development funding. KILT credentials would be used to identify project supporters in KYC and AML processes, and the supporter would register a DID (decentralized identifier) on&nbsp;Polimec.</p><p>Now a dedicated team with extensive experience in blockchain and financial services has taken on further development of Polimec and the launch of the network in late 2023. This team has evolved Polimec into a decentralized community-driven funding protocol to accelerate the Web3 ecosystem. The protocol will enable fundraising in a transparent and regulatory compliant manner, aligning stakeholder incentives during and beyond the fundraise.</p><p>As in the original concept, <a href="https://polimec.link/whitepaper">Polimec will utilize</a> the KILT blockchain for on-chain credentials for KYC/AML processes, issued by trusted third parties. In this way, the Polimec use case is a mechanism to accelerate the adoption of KILT credentials and DIDs (decentralized identifiers) and increase the traction for KILT Protocol.</p><p>“The new Polimec team is building an on-chain funding mechanism for Polkadot projects as a Polkadot parachain, while utilizing the power of another Polkadot parachain — KILT — to efficiently reach their goals. This is a milestone for the Polkadot ecosystem”, said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol. “It’s exciting to see the beginning of a KILT ecosystem of entrepreneurs, creating new businesses that serve as growth drivers to scale KILT more rapidly.”</p><p>“With this business model around KILT credentials and DIDs, we are creating a significant addition to the KILT ecosystem. Polimec has evolved into an independent project that will disrupt current fundraising models and enable a fully decentralized regulatory compliant fundraising protocol for Web3”, said Kasper Mai Jørgensen, co-founder of&nbsp;Polimec.</p> About KILT <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain identity protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise and consumers.</p> About Polimec <p><a href="http://www.polimec.org/">Polimec</a> is a decentralized community-driven funding protocol developed on Polkadot to accelerate the Web3 ecosystem.

 Press Release — idFlexNetz <p>Digitalizing flexibilities in the energy grid with renowned project partners — digital wins, data spaces, marketplaces, and&nbsp;more.</p>idFlexNetz members<p>Press release — Dortmund, 28.11.2022</p><p>Dortmund, November 2022 — At the beginning of May, Spherity launched a digitalization project for the energy sector together with renowned partners from the fields of industry, research, and software/consulting. The aim of the research project, called idFlexNetz, is to create digital models (“twins”) of existing grid resources in order to make them available to the market along with algorithms for operations management.</p><p>With a view to the requirements of decarbonization, the digitization project, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate with around 2 million euros, links the electricity, electromobility, gas, and heat sectors. In principle, the aim is to make the distribution networks fit for the future and to coordinate increasingly decentralized and highly dynamic energy generation with increasingly flexible local consumers in an overarching and intelligent manner.</p><p>The basis — tamper-proof digital&nbsp;twins</p><p>A standardized description language, which has yet to be developed, will initially be used to create a uniform ICT ecosystem for corresponding prediction and operator models from the previous individual, highly heterogeneous stand-alone solutions of the grid operators. Its digital products can then later be traded on a digital market that meets the highest security requirements.</p><p>For this purpose, digital images of real network components such as local network stations will be created, i.e., forgery-proof models known as digital twins. Network operators can then use these models, for example, for various network operation applications such as network capacity estimations, network simulations, network load forecasts, or even maintenance measures in different characteristics and scenarios. These are all parameters that meet their specific conditions on-site with a lot of operational experience. They are ultimately available to all network operators in comparable situations and, last but not least, to the industry. This should reduce time and&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Renowned project partners — intradisciplinary</p><p>In order to achieve universal usability of digital goods in network applications, standardized interfaces will be developed within the project. The aim here is to develop standardized procedures that enable players to convert models into digital twins and offer them on the marketplace for trading purposes. To this end, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence GmbH and Fraunhofer IOSB-AST, Schneider Electric GmbH, Spherity GmbH, Fraunhofer ISI, as well as the Frankfurt School of Finance and SAP SE, under the leadership of Saarbrücken-based VSE AG, will work on cross-sector solutions and their commercialization in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>“We are pleased to start this exciting research project together with the diverse partners,” comments Dr. Stephan Tenge, technical director of VSE AG, on the start-up phase of the future project. “I think we have exactly the right mix of partners in this project. Personally, I have high expectations for the project and am already looking forward to the first results. The topic of the digital twin,” Tenge knows, “opens up new possibilities for us in the context of the energy transition.”</p><p>Secure Marketplace for Digital Goods — The business&nbsp;model</p><p>The business model of such an ecosystem is based on the comparability and transparency of the digital twins. Digital models that network operators will in the future be able to offer for sale on the digital marketplace, together with master data and other valuable parameters such as location and usage data, but also purchase for their own fields of activity.

<p>Most software developers learn OpenID Connect or other identity standards by chance. Some will love and others may hate that experience. Regardless of their affection to the standards, it’s crucial that software engineers understand reasonably well how these standards work and what their implications are, in terms of usability but especially in terms of security. Just finding a library and making it work is a recipe for failure.</p>
 What is the most common task, the problem 
<p>The most common task a developer faces in which OpenID Connect comes into place is: integrate our application with an authentication method (e.g. login with Office 365, bank authentication), so as a result, this new authentication method is enabled in the application. In quora.com or stackoverflow.com you will easily find articles starting with “how to integrate openid connect …”</p>
<p>The problem to solve is the following: unless OpenID Connect was thought of from the very first moment an application was designed, the application cannot use an external authentication method such as “Login with Apple” so add a login button besides its own username+password boxes.</p>
<p>In order to capitalise on the numerous advantages of adding an external authentication method, the application has to become an OpenID Connect relying party. In practice, the developer must embed such functionality into the application. The most common way to do it is by using libraries approved by The OpenID Foundation.</p>
<p>The OpenID Connect standard has different flows for different use cases that involve user authentication, and the most common flow used today for both web and mobile applications is authorisation code flow. The next step besides flow choice is to define how the client authentication will happen.</p>
 Types of clients 
<p>RFC 6749 defines type of clients in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749#section-2.1">Section 2.1: OAuth 2.0 Client Types</a> as show below.</p>
<p>OAuth defines two client types, based on their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server (i.e., ability to maintain the confidentiality of their client credentials):</p>
 Confidential 
<blockquote><p>Clients capable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., client implemented on a secure server with restricted access to the client credentials), or capable of secure client authentication using other means.</p></blockquote>
 Public 
<blockquote><p>Clients incapable of maintaining the confidentiality of their credentials (e.g., clients executing on the device used by the resource owner, such as an installed native application or a web browser-based application), and incapable of secure client authentication via any other means.</p></blockquote>
 When would you need to use a confidential client? Possible reasons are for example: 
 
 It is a policy requirement defined by the Identity Provider 
 The claims returned by the Identity Provider could be highly confidential 
 There could be a cost associated with each authentication transaction 
 
<p>Now that we understand types of clients better, we can see that most of today’s real life scenarios require confidential clients. Broadly speaking there are two types of credentials for confidential clients:</p>
 
 Symmetric credentials using any of the client_secret authentication options 
 Asymmetric credentials using either private_key_jwt or mutual TLS authentication options 
 
<p>Confidential clients must send client credentials with requests to endpoints that require authentication, which includes token, introspection and revocation endpoints.</p>
<p>Today for most scenarios, the integration of applications is done with OpenID Connect using client_id and client_secret. However private_key_jwt is another option that often comes to developer’s attention.</p>
<p>This is when the question “Should I use private_key_jwt or client_secret?” comes into play.</p>
 Should I use private_key_jwt or client_secret? 
<p>First of all, it’s good to clarify that there are three flavours of client_secret. Let’s review each by one:</p>
 
 On client_secret_basic, the client uses HTTP Basic authentication scheme with client_id and client_secret. 
 On client_secret_post, the client sends client_id and client_secret as HTML form parameters 
 On client_secret_jwt, the client uses JWTs for client authentication. The JWT is signed with a key derived from client_secret. 
 
<p>The first two are very similar and only differ on how the client_secret is sent in the POST (or GET) calls. The most common one is client_secret_basic, while client_secret_jwt is very rarely used.</p>
 Now let’s analyse how client_secret works. 
<p>Let’s imagine we have an OpenID Connect compliant application, which wants to allow users to authenticate with an external identity provider such as Login with GitHub. The very first step is to check what the type of client authentication used is. In case of GitHub, client_secret is used.</p>
<p>In this scenario, GitHub is the identity provider as all the user accounts (and its respective credentials) are stored on its servers. When you, as a developer, want to integrate GitHub login to an application, you must go to GitHub developer portal to register an OAuth 2.0 application. In that process, GitHub will generate a client_id and client_secret for this new client.</p>
<p>The developer copies this piece of information on the relying party’s CIAM system, and the registration is completed. For reference, step-by-step instructions to do this on Ubisecure Identity Platform are <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KNB/pages/8989147157/Github+Login+Setup">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please observe that:</p>
 
 The identity provider has generated the secret. 
 Every time the application wants to perform client authentication to the server, first it must send the client_secret through the channel in order to obtain an access token. 
 
 Let’s compare those similar steps to analyse how private_key_jwt works. 
<p>Now imagine the OpenID Connect compliant application wants to allow users to authenticate with an external identity provider like the Finnish Trust Network. In this case, private_key_jwt is the only allowed option for client authentication.</p>
<p>When you as the developer want to integrate Finnish Trust Network login to an application, you have to follow an identity broker’s integration guide. The identity broker has publicly shared all its relevant metadata on the .well-known/openid-configuration endpoint. This includes its JSON Web Encryption keys (<a href="https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Jwks_uri">jwks_uri</a>). For instance, Telia Identification Broker Service’s jwks_uri is <a href="https://tunnistus.telia.fi/uas/oauth2/metadata.jwks">https://tunnistus.telia.fi/uas/oauth2/metadata.jwks</a>. In the registration process, the relying party must generate its own pair of asymmetric keys, typically throughout its CIAM system.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0</a>, a “registration request” is sent to the identity provider (identity broker strictly speaking for Telia) and the service provider will receive back a “registration response” metadata file. The developer uploads this metadata on the relying party’s CIAM system, and the registration is completed.</p>
<p>Notice that:</p>
 
 Both the relying party and the identity provider generate a pair of asymmetric keys on their own side. 
 Every time the application wants to authenticate, no secret is sent through the channel. Instead, the private key is used to sign the request so a signed client_assertion is sent. The other end can use the sender’s public key to decrypt the assertion. 
 
<p>If you are unsure which one(s) of these two are supported by the identity provider you want to integrate, the OpenID Connect discovery endpoint of a server (.well-known/openid-configuration) shows the list of client authentication methods supported.</p>
 Comparison table 
<p>The table below offers a succinct comparison between the two client authentication options.</p>



Client_secret
Private_key_jwt


A secret is shared
No secret is shared


Based on symmetric cryptographic
Based on asymmetric cryptography, which offers stronger algorithms


Secret is usually generated on the Identity provider side, and then shared to the relying party in order to integrate the specific application
Key pairs are generated by the service provider side (using the Identity and Access Management system), and only the public key is shared to the identity provider


It’s used today in the vast majority of identity providers, including all social media
It’s a requirement for Open Banking APIs under the Financial Grade API (FAPI), the Finnish Trust Network, and other similar profiles.


Manual key rotation, based on a shared secret
Dynamic key rotation



<p>Overall, in the near future you will use both, especially client_secret. But as FAPI has adopted it because of its improved security, private_key_jwt is the way to go if you have the choice.</p>

 On-Chain “Polkadot Alliance” Formed to Recognize Ecosystem Contributors and Establish Community Code of&nbsp;Ethics <p>Today seven teams from the Polkadot ecosystem announced the formation of the Polkadot Alliance, an on-chain collective that establishes and upholds a set of ethics for the community to follow. Founding Fellows <a href="https://acala.network/">Acala</a>, <a href="https://astar.network/">Astar</a>, <a href="https://www.interlay.io/">Interlay</a>, <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a>, <a href="https://moonbeam.network/">Moonbeam</a>, <a href="https://www.subscan.io/">Subscan</a> and <a href="https://www.phala.network/">Phala</a> have initiated the Alliance with a mission of ensuring standards of excellence across the rapidly growing ecosystem.</p><p>The Polkadot Alliance was first referenced in the August 2022 blog post “<a href="https://polkadot.network/blog/proposal-for-common-good-parachains/">Proposal for Common Good Parachains</a>” by Joe Petrowski of the Web3 Foundation:</p><p>The new proposal for Polkadot governance introduces a new collective, the Fellowship, which allows a ranked group of experts to express its opinion on sensitive or highly privileged proposals.</p><p>Another collective in development is the Polkadot Alliance. The Alliance is already deployed on the Westend test parachain and will likely be the first one on Polkadot. Several community teams banded together about two years ago and came up with the idea for the Alliance, primarily to fight misuse of the Polkadot brand and unattributed code…The Alliance would be an on-chain industry collective that sets a code of ethics regarding brand use, scam activities, and harmful behavior, but also provides recognition to teams who do make positive contributions to the growth and success of the Polkadot&nbsp;network.</p><p>A <a href="https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1318">proposal</a> for a Collective common good parachain followed in October 2022 and the parachain launched on 21 November 2022. A referendum is now needed to initialize the Founding Fellows; a motion will be made later this&nbsp;week.</p><p>The Alliance will exist on-chain and will publish its findings of unscrupulous websites and accounts on-chain. But it will not have any governance powers; its domain does not reach into other parts of the Polkadot protocol.</p> Background <p>As the Polkadot ecosystem has expanded, some low-quality teams have started to pollute the Polkadot brand. These teams copy code without attribution, use “Polka” branding with no intention of building on Polkadot, conduct scammy token raises on Ethereum, launch rival relay chains, and are disrespectful in their interactions with other community members.</p><p>The Polkadot Alliance provides a framework to recognize the teams who empower others and contribute to the ecosystem in alignment with open source culture, and includes an on-chain mechanism that calls attention to those teams that do&nbsp;not.</p> Membership <p>Alliance members are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself). Membership consists of two tiers: Fellow and&nbsp;Ally.</p><p>Fellows have voting rights on Alliance motions and carry out on-chain operations. Being a Fellow requires a strong commitment not only to abide by the standards, but also to enforce these standards in a consistent and timely manner. For instance, Fellows are responsible for membership management including promotion to Ally (or removal), and curation of an “Unscrupulous List” of problematic team URLs and accounts.</p><p>A subset of the Fellows is the seven Founding Fellows, which are the teams who built the Polkadot Alliance and started to contribute before it was live on-chain.</p><p>Allies are members of the Polkadot Alliance and do not have voting rights. There are two ways to join as an&nbsp;Ally:</p>  By submitting a transaction to join and placing a deposit of 1,000 DOT, which is locked until retirement from the collective.  By nomination by a Fellow, which does not require a&nbsp;deposit.  <p>Anyone can join as an Ally (with a deposit), but only Fellows can promote Allies to Fellow. Allies that wish to take a more active role in operating the Alliance, and who demonstrate active and sustained contributions to the ecosystem, can request promotion to Fellow. The motion to do so requires 60% approval from voting members to&nbsp;pass.</p><p>Read the Alliance <a href="https://crustwebsites.net/ipfs/QmdBBY5JTzazy4zK3ZP4dMXVnM5XXo3QfhEkMrZEzxBFn6?filename=Polkadot_Alliance_Charter_v1_28Nov2022.pdf">Charter</a> to learn more about how to become a&nbsp;member.</p> About the Polkadot&nbsp;Alliance <p>The Polkadot Alliance is an on-chain collective that establishes and upholds a community code of ethics. The Alliance provides an on-chain mechanism to recognize teams who align with open source culture, to ensure the continued success of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/on-chain-polkadot-alliance-formed-to-recognize-ecosystem-contributors-and-establish-community-da8431183db7">On-Chain “Polkadot Alliance” Formed to Recognize Ecosystem Contributors and Establish Community…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>London, 29 November, 2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>,&nbsp;a leading European identity proofing platform provider,&nbsp;has appointed Jason Tucker-Feltham as its Head of Crypto Sales. Based in IDnow’s London office, Jason brings with him more than a decade of experience in financial services, with the last four years spent specialising in crypto.</p>



<p>Jason, who is also the committee chairman at Crypto Club Global, is a passionate industry advocate, and regularly engaged as a speaker at crypto events in the UK and beyond. Previously, he worked in business development and European sales at Celsius, where he covered some of the largest institutional clients in the crypto space. Before that, he was the Head of UK Advisory Compliance at UniCredit, where he lobbied for proportionate MiCA regulation on behalf of the entire banking group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Commenting on his appointment, Jason said: “The crypto market has been consistently growing in relevance ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. In that time, market capitalisations of most crypto assets have varied considerably, but industry momentum indicates that crypto has a future and may well turn traditional finance on its head.”</p>



<p>“However, with decentralised finance (DeFi), there are concerns that bad actors can exploit digital asset platforms. This is where Know Your Customer (KYC) and the tokenisation of identity can come in. These processes can build an additional layer of trust between all market players. As one of the leading platform providers for identity proofing in Europe, IDnow is a great fit for the rapidly maturing crypto industry,” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benjamin Haas, Senior Sales Director EMEA at IDnow, commented: “We’re excited to have someone as knowledgeable in the crypto market as Jason as part of the team. In his capacity as Head of Crypto Sales, he will be responsible and accountable for our go-to-market crypto strategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Given the developments in the crypto industry currently, having Jason join the team now is great timing. The crypto market is clearly in need of regulation and with our team and our market leading solutions, we want to be at the forefront of this change,” Benjamin added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MATTR teams have been hard at work adding new capabilities and additional features to our MATTR VII platform, SDKs and MATTR&nbsp;Wallet.</p><p>We’ve spent a lot of time collaborating with customers to better understand their needs and expectations when it comes to data security, auditability and user experience.</p><p>Here’s a walkthrough of what’s new in the MATTR universe — including new cloud deployment options, enhanced security features and a fully revamped digital&nbsp;wallet.</p> Introducing event logs to the MATTR VII&nbsp;platform <p>We have added enhanced logging for all key API calls (platform events logs) to the MATTR VII platform. Over 130 different types of events are now&nbsp;logged!</p><p>There are three different levels of logging that can be configured:</p>  Level 1 — Basic information such as the API name, date, time, request&nbsp;ID  Level 2 — Basic information +&nbsp;metadata  Level 3 — Basic information + metadata + full API payload information  <p>All MATTR VII public cloud deployments are set to Level 1, which excludes any personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>In MATTR VII private cloud deployments, the logging level is configurable based on the customer’s audit, user privacy and operational requirements. Private cloud users can also leverage our integration adaptor to extract the platform event logs to their systems, e.g., centralised audit logging stores, SIEM, billing capability or data warehouses.</p> Get notified of event updates automatically with&nbsp;webhooks <p>MATTR VII now supports webhooks, a standard design pattern that allows subscription to specific MATTR VII platform events in real time. Customers can be automatically notified of these platform events and either integrate that information into specific workflows or store additional information.</p><p>The first webhook that customers can subscribe to will notify them each time a credential is issued by the MATTR VII OIDC bridge. This enables ongoing credential lifecycle management activities with the information returned in the webhook, such as sending additional communications to the holder or augmenting end user&nbsp;records.</p><p>We’ll be adding additional webhooks in the future to give MATTR’s customers even more flexibility in integrating their systems with the MATTR VII platform.</p> Use our HTTP Signatures Library <p>To provide customers with confidence in the integrity and validity of webhook events, we’ve open-sourced our HTTP signatures library — anyone can now integrate it with their own applications.</p><p>HTTP message signatures are a way of digitally signing an HTTP request to give the receiving party assurance of the integrity of the message, and that the party sending the information is who they say they&nbsp;are.</p><p>Though this mechanism can be applied to any HTTP request, it’s particularly effective when used with MATTR VII webhook events. It allows the subscriber to authenticate that the signed request is, in fact, coming from MATTR VII. We’ve also published:</p>  An <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mattrglobal/http-signatures">NPM library</a> to allow for easier software integration of this capability.  A <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/sample-apps/tree/master/verify-webhook-http-signature">sample app</a> to demonstrate how to use the open-source library in your implementation.  <p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/webhooks/overview">Read the technical tutorials about implementing webhooks on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@mattrglobal/open-sourcing-our-http-signatures-library-821c04a640ec">Read more about how we’re enhancing the security of webhooks with HTTP signatures</a>.</p> Meet the new MATTR&nbsp;Wallet <p>We’re thrilled to announce we’ve re-released the MATTR Wallet — our digital wallet app that helps showcase to developers and ecosystem pilot partners how verifiable credentials can work in the real world, in real-time.</p><p>The latest release has been designed with end users in mind, accessibility tested and informed by in-depth customer&nbsp;insight.</p><p>It includes a fresh onboarding flow, which reduces friction for first-time end users, and a new home screen that consolidates important information.

<p>An important part of creating a future where digital trust is embedded into business practices is creating tools to strengthen secure communication across systems and applications.</p><p>Part of this effort for our products at MATTR includes implementing standards that make our API communications more secure. We recently announced that we’re introducing the use of HTTP message signatures to our flagship MATTR VII platform, which enhance data security and make the interactions between different parties on the web&nbsp;safer.</p><p>We also champion open and interoperable standards across the internet and web applications in our mission to make a safer internet for all. To aid both our customers and others in the community in this, we’ve made our HTTP Signatures library fully open-sourced and publicly accessible.</p> HTTP message signatures <p>Hypertext Transfer Protocol, more commonly known as HTTP, is a core technology that underpins the internet. As it enables global systems to communicate with each other, it’s critical to secure HTTP messages as much as possible.</p><p>Much like an artist’s signature on a painting in the real world, a digital signature assures a verifying party that information:</p>  has integrity — it hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with  originated from an authentic source — it’s from where it says it’s&nbsp;from.  <p>HTTP message signatures apply the power of digital signatures to HTTP, providing integrity and origin authenticity properties to the message or&nbsp;request.</p><p>Other digital security methods like OAuth and shared secrets, used to implement authentication and access control on APIs and web applications, require a round-trip to confirm the client. The HTTP Signatures scheme doesn’t. The integrity of a message sent can be verified independently and directly by the receiver and both parties can be confident that information has not been tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>The use of HTTP message signatures is currently a draft standard incubating at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/">Read the draft IETF standard]</a>. If the draft is progressed to a finalised standard, this technology could become more commonly utilised across applications.</p><p>HTTP signatures have broader benefits for the community. There are various use cases where security features can be applied to different kinds of interactions. Examples&nbsp;include:</p>  Authorising access to a secure storage&nbsp;backend  Filtering spam and other messages sent to a communication endpoint  Allowing ecosystems to authenticate access to permissioned APIs  And many&nbsp;more   How we use HTTP message signatures with&nbsp;webhooks <p>Within our MATTR VII platform, we’re using HTTP message signatures to help customers verify the authenticity and integrity of webhooks sent by the platform. A webhook is a standard design pattern that enables a party to “subscribe” to one or more events on a system by supplying a callback URL. The URL is used to communicate with another party when a certain condition or event&nbsp;occurs.</p><p>With a “publish and subscribe” model, MATTR VII customers can be set up to be notified that the specific event has been triggered, such as a credential issuance events or configuration updates –they then use those to take further action based on business&nbsp;needs.</p> What HTTP message signatures do for&nbsp;webhooks <p>Using webhooks on the MATTR VII platform requires customers to set up an endpoint to receive information, and that endpoint must be open to the public internet.</p><p>Because of this, there needs to be a way for the subscribed system to authenticate that the request is coming from MATTR VII and that the request is valid and not being spoofed, intercepted or modified in any way by malicious actors.</p><p>We sign the outbound webhook events with HTTP message signatures so our customers can safely call MATTR VII APIs from webhooks, and any subscriber can confidently verify the received requests are coming from&nbsp;us.</p><p>HTTP message signatures provide an easy and scalable way for our customers to authenticate messages or requests from our platform. The same pattern can be used to provide authenticity for any kind of web interaction or event&nbsp;trigger.</p> Leverage the technology for your own implementations <p>The application of the HTTP Signatures library in the context of webhooks is one of many implementation examples.</p><p>Broader implementation of the HTTP message signatures scheme will lead to more secure digital interactions and a safer internet for all, so we have open-sourced our HTTP Signatures library for both MATTR customers and for the community at&nbsp;large.</p><p>The library is permissively open-source, and we believe it will help the community establish higher levels of security between web services and applications.</p><p>Open-sourcing the library also encourages interoperability and integration with the MATTR VII platform, making it more accessible for businesses of all shapes and&nbsp;sizes.</p> Get started <p>It’s easy to get started today.

<p>In this vlog, 1Kosmos’ Product Manager, Sheetal Elangovan, joins 1Kosmos’ CMO, Michael Cichon, to discuss how employee onboarding can be fixed with document verification and identity based authentication.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right, hello, everybody. This is Michael Cichon, a chief marketing officer at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with a special guest, Sheetal Elangovan, a product manager at 1Kosmos. How are you, Sheetal?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Very well, Michael. How are you?</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
I’m good. And it’s special talking to you because we started at 1Kosmos on the very same day back in early 2021. So welcome to the vlog. I invited you here because I wanted to talk to you about onboarding.</p>
<p>If we could start with just employee onboarding, the typical process, what does it look like? All of us have been through this but step us through it.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Absolutely. So if you look at onboarding at most organizations today, one of the biggest challenges that they’re handling is remote onboarding. It is a common problem across most organizations that you step into. And usually, there’s an HR person who you are in contact with.</p>
<p>The first step is to provide some documentation about yourself that helps the HR person establish your identity. In most cases, these government documents are being shared over email, fax, or an insecure medium to say the very least, right? Once these documents are in possession of the HR person, they’re being kept in a database and being processed by multiple parties within an enterprise. And after which you’re going through some manual verification before you get to the next step.</p>
<p>As an employee, after you’re cleared for verification, you go on to get an account, they provision you into your single sign-on applications or anything that you require access to. After which finally as an employee, you have to go ahead and set up your account with a password. Of course, you have to remember that you’re going to forget your password or have to make a call to the help desk before you can actually be fully set up. So that’s what employee onboarding looks like for most people today.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So this is to comply with the employee eligibility requirements, but something very similar happens on the banking side of things. If I wanted to set up a bank account online, I’d have to make the same kind of identity-proofing process, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yes. You’ll have to go through extensive KYC processes before you get an account.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So in either of these cases, we go to our go-to documents, our driver’s license and a passport is generally what we use. And I know from my experience, it’s generally either taking a picture and faxing this information or sharing it online. So, what are the drawbacks there?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Of course, the biggest drawback is, first of all, it’s going through an insecure channel, either email, fax, all of these are potential for hacks. And all of the sensitive information, you definitely don’t want it out there being exposed to any of the threats out there. So that is the biggest risk of having it out there.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
And then, of course, we’re all doing things more remote these days in the post-COVID era, we’re remote identity-proofing for new jobs remotely and then for our bank accounts. So everything’s going online, going digital. So what’s the way to improve this process?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
The definite way to improve this process from a user perspective is to make things easier for them to access with having good checks and balances in places. And for a business, you want to make sure that they are able to give the right people the right kind of access, and this is really where 1Kosmos steps in, right? We are able to help you prevent fraud right on day one by adding identity-proofing to the mix.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
What’s identity-proofing?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Identity-proofing is a way of verifying your identity. And identity verification begins with a government-issued document, not just one form of it, but using your government-issued document along with your biometric to make sure that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>NIST provides a lot of guidelines today around digital identity and how a identity can be verified remotely. So we follow those standards and guidelines to go through identity verification.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay, so when we’re scanning a driver’s license, that driver’s license is then verified, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Just scanning a driver’s license does not mean that you’re verified. We have to go ahead and make checks against that driver’s license, make sure that the document that’s being presented is a match with your biometric, your actual face, right? I don’t want to present your identity, Michael, so just making sure that that is in place.</p>
<p>And also, a lot of triangulation, right? It’s not just one form of document in place but triangulating information across different signals to make sure that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. There’s 50 states, 50 driver’s license at least. I mean, there’s quite a few documents that you have to be able to verify, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yes, there are 50 states, 260 countries, different document types that we have to handle to really verify a user.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So obviously, 1Kosmos has solutions for this. So what is unique about the way 1Kosmos goes about identity-proofing and user onboarding?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
So the most unique thing about 1Kosmos when it comes to onboarding is that we are able to automate the entire process from identity verification, making sure that the user is who they are, to making sure that they are able to use that same information every day when they authenticate into their systems.</p>
<p>We are able to not just on day one, prove the identity of the user, but on day 10, day 360, we are able to leverage government-issued information that the user provided to make sure that who they say they are.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. So the old way of doing things, I take a picture, I scan it, the other side gets it somehow either on a fax or email, maybe they can’t read it, so I got to send it again, so it’s in my sent folder now, it’s in their inbox. The information exposed in this modern way of doing it. It’s encrypted end to end, correct?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Absolutely. So when it comes to the 1Kosmos journey, what does it really look like? We have a heavy focus on user experience, making sure that it’s the end user. It’s very an intuitive journey where we put you through… You receive a request from your HR person that tells you, “Hi, Michael, are you ready to onboard your go through this journey?”</p>
<p>The first step essentially is to verify your email followed by a phone number verification, and then you go on to present a government ID of choice. After that, we are able to do checks against the documents that were presented and then we determine your identity assurance level. How strongly can we state that you are who you say you are.</p>
<p>But the extremely unique thing about 1Kosmos is that we operate on the concept of having an identity wallet. So an identity wallet is a… Think of your wallet, but your wallet is in possession of you. We use cryptography behind the scenes to make sure that all of this information lives within your identity wallet and can only be accessed with your permission. And that just makes it that much more secure for a person because this is privacy by design in action, right? We’re making sure that the user is always in control of the information that they’re sharing.</p>
<p>From an employer perspective, it reduces the liability when they do not have to keep any of this information on their database. They just have to present the information. They just have to see that information. Identity verification is automated by us, so they just benefit end to end by using 1Kosmos as their identity-proofing provider and authentication service.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. Okay. Do you have something to show us? Can you show us how this works?</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
So the process looks like this. So HR sends out an invite to a end user. Usually, this is their personal email address asking them to begin their onboarding process. So once they click on that particular link, they are asked to create an account. They go through their provided email address. Once their email address is provided, they go through an email verification to make sure that that email is in possession of them.</p>
<p>The next step is to go ahead and provide additional information about themselves, which is around account creation, having a verified phone number. So we go ahead, make sure that the user’s phone number is verified as well. Behind the scenes, we are able to perform device checks to make sure that the user is in possession of that particular device and that particular phone number for a certain period of time, just to make sure… It’s an additional signal in making sure that the user is who they say they are.</p>
<p>Once they complete that process, the next step really is to go through the identity wallet creation. We are one of the most unique players in this space leveraging the concept of an identity wallet just so that this identity wallet is in control of by the user. That is where all of their documents get stored. Driver’s license, passport, SSN, any of their sensitive information gets stored in their identity wallet. It can only be unlocked by the user.</p>
<p>Once they go ahead and set up their wallet with 1Kosmos, the next step is to go through a driver’s license, verification or really any government-issued document to begin with. The user is asked to leverage their mobile phone camera to go ahead and perform a scan off the document. They go through a scanning process to do the front, the back. And once they successfully get through that process, the next step is to make sure that there is a biometric verification, which is looking for a match between the photo in the driver’s license as well as the biometric that was provided at this time.</p>
<p>Once they’ve been able to pass that, we are able to add in an optional SSN verification check just to make sure that there is sufficient triangulation across different signals that we’ve been able to build up for this particular user. And once that’s done, we have all of this information ready within the user’s wallet.</p>
<p>At this point, the user can be redirected to an HR portal where they will be requested to present all of their documents. Mind you, they’ve already been through all of these checks with respect to identity-proofing, meaning they’ve been verified against third-party verifiers we’ve built signals about the user. Now, all they have to do is just present their information.</p>
<p>Once they consent to present all of this information, HR is able to receive the necessary information, or they can just receive the identity assurance level. We can authoritatively say, “This person is who they say they are based on government-issued documents, based on their biometric, and email, phone verification.” Once this is done, HR can go ahead and choose to go through any downstream processes to enable this users account.</p>
<p>Now, the other benefit with 1Kosmos is that on day one, you also can make sure that the authentication mechanism is set up. If they’ve successfully gone ahead and completed identity-proofing, you can make sure that on day one, as soon as they approved and been through sufficient systems, they can go ahead and log into any of the downstream applications.</p>
<p>That’s just a quick preview of what our remote onboarding looks like today.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, that’s pretty cool. You covered some of the benefits. I mean, I’ve done this with the driver’s license scan, and it takes a minute. Just when you think of all of the… Well, first of all, the privacy, right? The information is kept confidential, end to end, but then all the administrative work that it would take to normally vet somebody and prove their identity manually, you’re streamlining all of that. And then on the back end, you have this strong credential now, which the user has at their disposal with 99% facial match to access their systems and nobody else can access it because they’re not that person. That’s a pretty amazing product, Sheetal.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Thank you for spending time with us today. Really appreciate it and keep up the great work in the product management team.</p>
<p>Sheetal Elangovan:<br>
Thank you. Thank you, Michael.</p>

 IDnow sits down with global advisor and investor in digital financial services, David Birch to discuss the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework, whether KYC is just a box-ticking exercise,&nbsp;and why regtech may become even more important than fintech in 2023. 



<p></p>



 Do you think the Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework does enough to reassure British people of the benefits of digital identities? 



<p>Well, I’m sure the British people have never heard of the Framework and probably never will. If the government proposes a national digital identity, then there many well be considerable resistance, especially if it is made mandatory. However, the idea of a bank identity, a social security identity, a health identity and so on is a different story. If these are interoperable with the framework, I am sure that they will be accepted.</p>



 Speaking of which, what do you foresee as some of the main benefits and advantages in the use of digital identities in the UK? 



<p>A smoother, simpler online life with considerable cost-savings and an actual improvement in security. Remember that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-kyc-risk/">fraud is the number 1 crime in the UK</a> today. I read recently of the case of an airline pilot caught using forged documents. He was flying for two years for two major airlines before this was discovered. A working digital identity infrastructure would stop this, and a thousand similar frauds going on every day.</p>



 With the creation of a solution comes the inadvertent creation of a new problem, so conversely what are some of the major risks associated with a digital identity future in the UK? 



<p>As always: confidentiality, integrity and availability. That last point needs particular focus: If you need a digital identity to open a bank account, open your office door or open a bottle of wine, then the infrastructure better be there! It would become an obvious target for agents of foreign powers. I wouldn’t want to find that I can’t start my car in the middle of Wales because I can’t get online to a blockchain or because my mobile phone has run out of battery!</p>

 What are some of the important things that service providers should look out for when choosing a digital identity solution provider? 



<p>At a high level, I would strongly distinguish between the provision of identification, authentication and authorization services. If you mean identification services, I would say the key requirement is for fully automated processing.</p>



 With Sanctions, AML/CTF, Fraud, and KYC departments often working in silos, how important is it for cross collaboration, especially in highly regulated markets?  



<p>I’m not an expert on the internal structure of financial organizations but to be honest I do see compliance and fraud as separate functions that respond to separate drivers. Organizations implement compliance because they are made to, whereas they implement anti-fraud measures because they want to.</p>



 KYC has traditionally been seen as a mere box-ticking measure, but considering how intertwined eKYC is with customer onboarding digital solutions, is that opinion set to change for both businesses and consumers? 



<p>KYC is a box ticking measure, that’s the point of it.</p>



 Will there ever come a time when a person’s digital identity becomes more valid, more secure, and more trustworthy than in-person validation? 



<p>We have already reached that point. You think the guy that asked to see my vaccine certificate at the airport today is an Israeli airport security-trained counterfeit documentation spotting genius? There is ample evidence that digital identity is more secure than analog identity. I saw a story in the newspapers recently about a guy who had taken his wife’s passport by mistake. It didn’t stop him from getting on the plane.</p>



 What are your predictions for the fintech and regtech space for 2023? 



<p>My top three would be: Firstly, for most of the companies I deal with, regtech has much more of an impact on the bottom line than fintech so with the economy going through difficult times, their focus will shift to cost-cutting via the former than new products or services via the latter; Secondly, that we will see the impact of open banking really begin to be felt as more and more embedded finance services (not all of them to do with money or payments) are launched; Thirdly, that the digital assets business (the tokenization of everything) will become mainstream and separate further from the “crypto” business.</p>



 Many predict that with the upcoming crypto regulations, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">TFR</a>, 2023 will be the “coming out” year for crypto assets. How do you think the industry will react? Will regulation have a positive impact on crypto businesses and consumers? 



<p>I agree with this view, but as I noted above, I distinguish between the digital asset business and the crypto asset business. They may well be built of the same technology, but they are not the same thing.</p>



 As the UK will not have to comply with EU crypto regulations, will that place UK cryptos at an advantage in the marketplace? 



<p>You need to ask a lawyer! I have no real idea what either the EU or UK’s crypto regulations will look like. I will, however, point toward the law society of England and Wales recent work on “digital objects”: this seems to me to be a good foundation.</p>

<p>The recent quick collapse of FTX, which not too long ago was one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has had a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency market. On November 11, 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy which has wiped billions of dollars of value from the broader crypto markets. This event has led many people to understandably be concerned about investing in blockchain projects. </p><p>But it’s important that people first know that no $DOCK is held by FTX and our network will continue to operate without any impact from these events. We will continue to scale with many exciting updates coming in Q1 2023.</p><p>There are many unpredictable events and factors that can impact the overall market, but the important thing for long-term supporters is not to focus on the day-to-day prices of projects, but rather on the long-term utility and value that a project will bring to solve problems. </p><p>We held an AMA with Dock’s CEO Nick Lambert to answer questions and concerns from our community.</p><p>Question: To what extent have we been impacted by the bear markets? </p><p>I’ll first address what recently happened with FTX. While we’re not directly impacted by FTX’s downfall because Dock has never used FTX as an exchange, the entire industry will be affected.</p><p>For Dock, we’re focused a lot on good governance and financial management. One of the downsides of FTX is they didn’t have a board of directors. There was no one to look after the people running the company, giving them advice, and making sure they were making good judgment calls. </p><p>It’s understandable why people are nervous. At the end of the day, there has to be some element of trust in the people running companies. Structures need to be put in place to make sure that those individuals are held accountable to do things in responsible ways.</p><p>We spend a lot of time with our directors, lawyers, and accountants on the team making sure that when we make decisions, they are checked and verified by others to make sure we are doing things the way we should be. </p><p>To be sustainable, we’ve moved assets and spread our risk by holding a number of tokens. More recently, we’re putting more priority on holding assets that are not volatile like non-algorithmic stable coins and cash. We’re in a solid and stable position as the Dock team has not changed in size at all. We have a consistent team which is important for the continuous enhancement of the types of products we’re building.</p><p>Question: What are the most ambitious goals of the project in the future? &nbsp;</p><p>For Dock, the biggest goal is to become the largest independent entity and provider of identity and <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a>. We’re well-placed to become one of the market leaders.</p><p>Question: What is one of the main priorities on the roadmap?</p><p>The mobile wallet upgrade is the biggest focus in the next two months. We’re making a lot of enhancements to it including the storage and management of credentials by users. </p><p>Question: What kind of transformations and advancements can be done with the Dock network in the healthcare sector? &nbsp;</p><p>BurstIQ is using Dock’s Verifiable Credential technology. Their vision is to turn any piece of health data into a Verifiable Credential. Some of the most important features Verifiable Credentials have are that they are controlled by the holder or recipient of those credentials, tamper-resistant, and fraud-proof.</p><p>If you think about healthcare records being controlled by the holder, that becomes quite powerful because it moves us away from the current status quo where if you went to a local healthcare provider and they have your records, they decide what you see and who gets your record. If you turn healthcare records into Verifiable Credentials, it should be the case that you control that information, where it’s stored, and who gets to see it. This is a significant contribution that Verifiable Credentials and Dock’s partnership with BurstIQ will bring into the healthcare space. </p><p>We’re building other technologies including zero-knowledge proofs, anonymous credentials, and selective disclosure. Selective disclosure is enabling something to be proven without needing to reveal everything to prove that information. For example, you could use selective disclosure with your own medical records. If your doctor needs your blood type, then you can decide to just reveal the blood type only to give you maximum privacy and control over your data. Those are going to be some of the exciting things that we’ll see in the healthcare space.</p><p>Question: People want to know how we are expanding, what type of marketing strategies we’re doing to increase brand presence, and if we have strategic partnerships to help us grow.</p><p>There are 3 main aspects to our adoption strategy:</p>  Inbound marketing  <p>We produce a lot of content online so people who are interested in what we’re building as users or issuers can find out how Dock is doing things. If they’re interested, they’re getting in touch with us and we engage with them to see how we can help. </p><p>This has been the most effective strategy because when companies come to us first, they’re already interested in what we’re building and they’re pretty well-educated about what we do. </p>  Outbound marketing (more sales-led)  <p>We are picking industries where we know we provide value and reach out to companies to see if they’re interested in what we can offer. </p>  Integration with marketplaces  <p>There are many marketplaces for things like apps. But for B2B businesses, there are marketplaces for many things that some people may not be aware of. One example would be marketplaces that provide tools for developers to allow them to enable their users to authenticate and access their services like Auth0. </p><p>Auth0 is offering our <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/dock-web-3-id">Web3 ID</a> product for enabling private and secure access to systems using Verifiable Credentials. By being in that marketplace, we’re tapping into an entirely new audience and making them aware of what we’re building. </p><p>We’ll be looking at more marketplaces in the early new year. Another example is an API marketplace for developers to be aware of Dock and try our software. </p><p>Those are the main strategies we have for growing adoption.</p><p>Question: What type of strategies do you have to attract new investors? </p><p>Our main focus is to build things that have value that companies can come and use to get a business benefit. Individuals get the product benefits that make their life easier, more secure, and provide more privacy and control of their own data. If we build and market it in a really efficient way as a project, people will start to use it more and that value will spread in the ecosystem.</p><p>We’re not just trying to do some quick fix and run marketing campaigns without any real structure and innovation behind the company. We’re working as far away from that as possible because we want to bring long-term value in the ecosystem by providing solutions to organizations and individuals.</p><p>Question: Many people are not that aware of Web3. How do we pull more people to join Web3 for DIDs? </p><p>It comes down to user experience. We have to make new technology as easy and as good to use as the technology it’s replacing. And if it’s not then it won’t replace it. If you think about how much of a hassle it is to use a different web browser, it's annoying at the start and slower because you’re not familiar with it.</p><p>From the perspective of users, young people are much more privacy-conscious than the previous generation. I think as soon as these tools become great, they'll start to make that switch. They’ll start to recognize that their data is being used in a way that they might not agree with or consent to. &nbsp;</p><p>For companies, they’re wanting to be able to add value. It becomes more about making efficiencies where Web3 is better than some of the technologies. With Verifiable Credentials, you can issue a credential that the verifier doesn’t need to manually check if the credential is legitimate. For example, if an employer needs to check the authenticity of a university degree, they don’t have to phone up the university. They can simply check the verifiable presentation instantly in seconds and they can know who issued that credential. This verification process is much more efficient for businesses.</p><p>KYC is another relevant use case because every time we use centralized exchanges, we’re continually having to go through a KYC every time we sign up for a new exchange. Or even for exchanges we are members of, they may ask us to reverify. </p><p>Instead of having to go through that process every time, imagine if you go through the identity verification check just once and you’re issued a credential after that. So every time afterward that you’re asked to do an identity verification, all you have to do is send them a Verifiable Credential. This process is much more efficient for businesses and this can increase onboarding percentages quite massively while creating a better user experience by spending less time doing the verification process. </p><p>Businesses will adopt Web3 when they realize the benefits and efficiencies they’ll get from using this technology.</p><p>Question: We will be providing a white-label wallet where customers can have their own branded wallet. What are the advanced security features that will be provided in this white-label wallet app? </p><p>White labeling is a way for developers, companies, and projects that want to offer a mobile wallet app for their customers but don’t want to build it. They can take the essential components of the Dock wallet, switch some features on and off as they prefer, and rebrand it. Then they have a ready-to-go wallet. </p><p>Security features they would have included having custody of your own keys and credentials. You manage your own private keys with the wallet and no one else has ownership. No one can take those tokens away from you. </p><p>Another thing we built is the ability to log into the wallet with biometrics using facial recognition or a thumbprint, which is more secure than PINs and passwords. We’ve also enabled the ability to create an encrypted backup so in case a device gets lost, damaged, or stolen, you won’t lose access to your tokens or credentials. Everyone who has a Dock wallet should create a backup. </p><p>Question: Are validators selected randomly based on the amount of Dock tokens staked or a mix of both?</p><p>Validators are selected like in any Proof of Stake network. We have 2 types of validators: an active set that is actively validating and those waiting to become validators. </p><p>In an active set with Dock, there are 50 validators and the ones that will become active are the ones that have the most stake. We combine what the nomination or delegators are putting into that node (computer connected to the Web3 network) plus their own stake which gives you a total. The top 50 with the highest total are validating the network. The network itself is calculating and running elections which means that the active validator set could change based on how much stake each of those nodes has.</p><p>Question: A large percentage of investors are focused on the token price in the short term rather than the long term. Why should investors choose Dock and what are the advantages of holding the Dock coin in the long run? </p><p>It’s unfortunate that many people are focused on the short-term price, but that is the reality of the space right now. The motivation for holding Dock over the long term is that we’re building something of value with products that people are using today for commercial benefit and to make their lives better. </p><p>We have a strong team, we have paying clients, and we’re very focused. It’s just a case of scaling, growing, and to keep improving all of the time. </p><p>Question: We’ve been tracking the progress of soulbound tokens. I’ve seen many other projects getting involved with the Web3 identity space with soulbound-based products. Can you briefly explain how these tokens are different from Dock’s DIDs? What kind of similarities and differences are there to NFTs for example? </p><p>Some of the similarities are that they are both about identity. Soulbound tokens are non-transferable NFTs. Normally NFT ownership can be transferred and that is all recorded on the chain. But a soulbound NFT is intended to not be transferable. So once you get this token, it’s completely yours which makes it more effective for managing identity because identity is something you shouldn't be able to transfer. </p><p>The differences are that with Verifiable Credentials, a big aspect is that they are often off-chain. What is in the blockchain is the identifier of who issued the credential and who it is going to. A Verifiable Credential is usually held in the wallet of the holder and not on the blockchain. </p><p>Because soulbound NFTs are all on-chain, the information is there for everyone to see. Of course, because blockchains are unencrypted, you can view that information so it’s a lot less private for the individual. </p> Connect With Us Anytime<br> <p>If you have any questions about us or our projects, please reach out to us anytime at:</p>  <a href="mailto:marketing@dock.io">marketing@dock.io</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a>  <a href="https://t.me/dockio">Telegram</a>   Learn More About Dock   <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/certificate-fraud">How to Prevent Certificate Fraud</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/supply-chain-fraud-blockchain">How to Prevent Supply Chain Fraud</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/what-are-digital-credentials">Digital Credentials</a>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/decentralized-identity">Decentralized Identity</a>

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 Upgradable and easy-to-deploy ERC3643 V4 for tokenized securities 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in november 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In the midst of the FTX chaos,&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/why-ftxs-catastrophe-could-have-a-positive-impact-on-the-tokenization-industry/">we shared our views</a>&nbsp;on its impact on the tokenization industry. Like many builders in this space, we continue to develop solutions to solve market problems. And today, we are excited to announce the&nbsp;launch of the version 4 of the ERC3643 smart contracts, providing upgradability and easy deployment for tokenized securities.</p>
<p>The code of a smart contract cannot be changed once it has been deployed on a blockchain. This is a huge concern for securities issuers, as they need to have full control over their digital securities. As regulations and business needs evolve, additional logic must be added and being able to fix potential vulnerabilities is essential. Therefore,&nbsp;issuers of tokenized securities must be able to upgrade their smart contracts.</p>
<p>To this end, the new version of ERC3643 is made upgradable through the use of the proxy method.&nbsp;A proxy contract delegates its logic to an implementation contract, so it can be ‘upgraded’ by pointing to a new implementation contract.</p>
<p>The ERC3643 V4 points the token logic to a central contract called Implementation Authority. This contract stores the address of the implementation contract. To update the smart contract,&nbsp;the owner can set the address of the new version of the implementation contract&nbsp;and the token will adopt the new logic of this contract. Furthermore, multi-token issuers can point all tokens to the same Implementation Authority contract so that upgrades are automatically applied to all their tokens simultaneously.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>In addition to upgradability, issuers or their authorized agents can leverage&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643-onchain-factory/">Onchain Factory</a> to automate the&nbsp;deployment of the entire ERC3643 suite in 1 single blockchain transaction.&nbsp;The ownership of the smart contracts is given directly to the chosen stakeholder during the deployment, eliminating the dependency on any third-party. Finally, with Onchain Factory, a token can keep the same token address across all EVM blockchains for simpler multi-chain operations. This drastically reduces the dependency on a single blockchain network.</p>
<p>The release of ERC3643 V4 is our latest contribution to the standardization of tokenization for capital markets. These upgrades are open source. By making sure that the main token standard for security tokens is always up-to-date with the latest innovations, we accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. Furthermore, to ensure the highest level of security,&nbsp;ERC3643 V4 smart contracts are currently being audited by prestigious firms.&nbsp;The results will be shared publicly once they are available.</p>

 Why is personal data so valuable? <p>This is one of a series of blogs exploring <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/">Hidden in Plain Sight: The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>, the subject of Mydex CIC’s latest White&nbsp;Paper.</p><p>Everyone knows data is incredibly valuable.

Very often it quickly veers off on a tangent, to a different question entirely: “how to put a money price on data and create a market for it?”.

Because it’s been a key source of energy that provides the heat, light and motion upon which our civilisation is based. Look around you. Anywhere, everywhere, you’ll see oil at work in the form of heat (and refrigeration), light and motion. We need these things for virtually everything we want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>What is data’s equivalent of heat, light and motion? Here is the answer which, strangely, you won’t find anywhere except in this blog; which is almost universally ignored in debates about personal data, resulting in the building of countless castles of speculation that rest on foundations of&nbsp;sand.</p><p>Understanding this answer is important because it acts as a sort of filter and North Star that helps us assess the many contradictory claims and arguments that are made about personal data. It helps us distinguish between smoke and mirrors, snake oil and practical realities and opportunities.</p><p>Data provides us with reliability and surprise.</p><p>Like oil’s heat, light and motion, reliability and surprise lie at the heart of countless things every person and organisation do every day without fail: make decisions and implement them. To make good decisions and to implement them well we need information that is reliable and surprising (e.g. which keeps us up to date with a changing&nbsp;world).</p><p>Just how economically important these two contributions of reliability and surprise are, only really becomes apparent when they are&nbsp;absent.</p><p>If you know a piece of information is reliable, you can rely on it to make a decision and to implement your decision. If a piece of information tells you something you didn’t know before (a surprise, in other words) that means you can keep your decisions and actions in tune with what’s needed, rather than getting out of&nbsp;kilter.</p><p>Now consider what happens if these things are absent. If you are not confident that your information is reliable you have to stop what you are doing to get information you can rely on or check the accuracy of the data you are given. This causes delays and creates extra effort. You also have to invest time and effort, not in doing what you want to do, but in getting the information you need to do what you want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Unreliable data also creates risks of error (resulting in wasted resources) and damage, which also add cost and waste. If you spill milk, you not only waste your milk, you have to spend time and effort clearing it up — time and effort you could spend more productively doing other&nbsp;things.</p><p>Surprises are information that is new to you, and which can therefore change how you act. A key part of every organisation’s activities is the methods it uses to gather such new information. Today, for example, forms are ubiquitous. Nowadays we have to fill in a form (in some form) to do anything we want online. These forms gather information that is new to the organisation in question (even though this information might not be new to other parties), and this new information is then used to deliver a service. Without this new information, the service either cannot be delivered, or cannot be delivered as efficiently or effectively as it&nbsp;could.</p><p>If you lack access to the right ‘surprises’ your decisions and actions get out of kilter with what’s needed. This means that all the time, money and effort that goes into making these decisions and implementing them risks being&nbsp;wasted.</p><p>In other words, without reliable and surprising data everything we do gets burdened with huge amounts of extra work, delays, errors and risks and all the costs associated with&nbsp;them.</p> FERC busting <p>Without reliability and surprise huge amounts of time, energy, material resources, effort and money is wasted doing unproductive things. We call this FERC, which stands for Friction, Effort, Risk and&nbsp;Cost.</p><p>This is true of both non-personal and personal data but o<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">ur Paper</a> shows how these two sources of data’s value — reliability and surprise — lie at the heart of new economic revolution revolving around personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today’s data systems operate with a design flaw at their heart: the siloed, organisation-centric database which is designed to make sure data is NOT shared. This means that reliable, surprising data that could be shared and used to avoid FERC never gets shared. The result is layer upon layer, upon layer, of FERC embedded into our economic system works, suffocating its potential and weighing it down with unnecessary costs.</p><p>It affects every individual and household trying to manage their lives, and every service that deals with identifiable individuals, including public administration and services in both central government and local government, financial services (banking, insurance, etc) health and social care, education, charities and the third sector, retail, transport, leisure, media and entertainment. Economically, it is pivotal to the workings of 80% of the economy (basically, ‘services’), affecting every man, woman and child and every household.</p><p>The new personal data logistics infrastructure built by Mydex provides a very efficient way for individuals to collect, store and share data about themselves easily, safely and in a way that ensures data protection and privacy. It helps ensure the reliability and surprises that people and organisations need to manage their affairs better, opening up the possibility of a new productivity and innovation miracle along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>This is why fixing personal data logistics — in how it is verified, gathered, stored and shared — is one way of fixing the economy&nbsp;itself.</p><p>The third blog in this series explains&nbsp;how.</p><p>Other blogs in this series&nbsp;are:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-great-data-delusion-744b40795f73">The Great Data&nbsp;Delusion</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-personal-data-economically-valuable-927e8c7cd51">Why is personal data economically valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
