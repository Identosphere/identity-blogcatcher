<p>The recent, numerous high-profile attacks targeting identity processes, like those by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/csrb-report-lessons-from-the-lapsus-threat-group">the Lapsus$ group</a>, underscore the need for strong identity security. New research by the Identity Defined Security Alliance found that 90% of organizations had an identity-related incident in the past year with two-thirds of those suffering direct business impact as a result. Identity verification and identity authentication are both essential elements of a comprehensive identity security strategy. While they sound similar, they serve very different, but interconnected, purposes. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the increased attacks on identity systems, it’s critical to understand identity verification vs. authentication to determine where your organization may be vulnerable and put in effective measures to address these weaknesses. In the most basic terms:</p> 
  
  Identity verification, also referred to as identity proofing, is the process of confirming if someone is who they say they are.  
  Authentication is the process of making sure that the person trying to log in is the same person whose identity was confirmed before.  
  
<p>Here, we take a closer look at identity verification vs. authentication, what each of the terms means, how they work, and what role they play in a broader identity security strategy.</p> 
 What is Identity Verification?  
<p>Verification connects an individual with an identity, validating that someone is who they claim to be. It proves that the personal information being used to establish identity is legitimate and isn’t forged or stolen. While this may involve manual checks, technological advances in secure data capture and processing have enabled fully digital identity verification methods. For example, digitally verifying government-issued IDs, matching PII against official databases or even taking a selfie.</p> 
<p>Identity verification is frequently used to validate customer identity, especially relating to financial processes, such as opening a bank account. It’s an important part of Know Your Customer (KYC) standards and other guidance and regulations aimed at stopping fraud, corruption, money laundering and other criminal activities. Increasingly, identity verification is being used for Know Your Employee (KYE) purposes, particularly for managing employee onboarding and access control.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Methods of Identity Verification  
<p>There are various ways to verify identity. The methods an organization uses will depend on the level of identity assurance they require and what works with their business processes. Typically you will use multiple methods together. Methods include:</p> 
  
  Document verification — This is typically a government-issued ID such as a driver’s license or passport. This could be a photo or scan of a physical ID or a digital ID such as a mobile driver’s license.&nbsp;  
  Biometric verification — This usually involves using a mobile phone to take a selfie, with the selfie then compared against an official ID to ensure a match.  
  Database verification — User-supplied information is compared against official databases, such as those managed by the DMV and IRS.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Some identity verification solutions include options for additional levels of assurance such as video verification through a live video feed or attestation from a manager.</p> 
 What is Authentication?  
<p>Authentication is the process by which a user proves that they are the holder of the verified identity. For example, to access an online bank account you may be asked to enter a username and password, plus answer security questions or click on a link sent by email or SMS.</p> 
 Common Methods of Authentication  
<p>Online authentication relies on the user presenting one or more factors from the following three categories:</p> 
  
  Knowledge — This is something you know such as a password, PIN or security question. It’s the least secure authentication factor, as it can be guessed, cracked or obtained by malicious actors through <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-phishing-prevention">phishing</a>, social engineering and other attack methods.  
  Possession — This relates to something you have, such as a device or security key. It offers a stronger level of authentication since an attacker would need to steal or intercept the item in question. Some possession factors, such as an SMS OTP, have proven very easy to bypass.  
  Inherence: This is something you are such as your fingerprint or facial characteristics. Typically this is the most secure factor but that highly depends on how authentication is implemented.  
  
<p>Multi-factor authentication requires two or more factors from different categories. While most multi-factor authentication solutions use a multi-step process, there are some that combine factors into a single action. FIDO-based <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwordless authentication</a> uses biometrics (inherence) to unlock a device-stored cryptographic key (possession) for login.</p> 
<p>Providing the necessary authentication factors is just the user-facing part of authentication. The factors must still be verified. The backend methods used for verification affect the level of security in authentication as much as the factors used. For instance, if biometric factors are verified by comparing them to ones stored in a central database, then they can be intercepted or stolen just like a password. Look for solutions that perform authentication verification through robust public-key cryptographic exchange protocols.</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Similarities  
<p>Identity verification and authentication both concern the confirmation of identity. They are frequently used in tandem to ensure that only a valid user can access systems and resources. Identity verification and authentication come in at different points in the identity lifecycle. Verification is used to establish an identity and, when necessary, re-confirm identity. Authentication is what verified individuals use for daily access. Both are necessary to identity security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Verification vs. Authentication: Differences  
<p>Although they sound similar and are often used in conjunction, major differences exist between identity verification and authentication. Verification involves establishing a legitimate, proven user identity. Authentication deals with preventing illegitimate users from entering a system on an ongoing basis. Below we compare them in key areas.</p> 
 Purpose  
<p>Verification confirms an individual is who they claim to be by verifying the authenticity of their proof of identity.&nbsp; Authentication determines if someone attempting to access an account is authorized to do so.</p> 
 Data Type Used  
<p>Identity verification usually involves some official form of documentation, such as government IDs, and/or a live photo that proves a person’s physical identity. Authentication may not be tied at all to the person’s physical identity; it can use information such as passwords or possession of a code or key.</p> 
 Identity Timeline  
<p>Verification is performed at a specific point in time, when first onboarding an individual to establish their identity. There may be reverification triggers at times of increased risk or other key events. Authentication is performed on an ongoing basis to continuously validate a person’s identity to grant access to systems and resources.</p> 
 Building a Comprehensive Identity Security Strategy  
<p>Stringent identity verification policies cannot protect your data and systems if that identity can be easily spoofed through insecure authentication methods. Similarly, strong authentication won’t help you if a bad actor has possession of legitimate authentication credentials.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s passwordless MFA eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication processes. Based on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/passkeys">FIDO passkey</a> standards, it provides the strongest authentication to form the basis of a comprehensive identity security strategy.&nbsp; To find out how HYPR passwordless authentication can protect your organization, <a href="https://www.hypr.com/contact">speak to one of our identity security experts</a>.</p>

<p>The Local-First Software Movement is a philosophy and approach to software development that strongly emphasizes prioritizing user control and ownership of their data. Unlike traditional cloud-based or centralized applications, which store data on remote servers, local-first software primarily operates on users' devices and ensures that data remains under their direct control. This movement seeks to empower users by providing them with the benefits of collaboration and connectivity while preserving privacy, security, and data autonomy. It challenges the dominant paradigm of centralization in the digital world and aims to redefine how software applications interact with and safeguard user data.</p><p>Personal data ownership is more important now than ever. Companies train their AI models on user data without compensating users or offering clear ways to opt-out. Platforms change leadership and direction, leaving users scrambling for ways to liberate their content from walled gardens. Centralized services are a target for bad actors.</p><p>Today, we'll dive into the history of the LoFi movement, notable local-first projects, and how to get started.</p><p>The Early Days of Computing and Data Localization</p><p>In the early days of computing, data was all stored locally. It was always physically stored on a floppy disc, a flash drive, the computer's disk drive, or even punch cards and magnetic tapes. Computers relied mainly on physical connections. There was a risk of data loss if the hard drive failed, limited accessibility due to the data being tied to a physical location, and version control issues, as users couldn't edit files simultaneously and had to rely on naming conventions to keep track of changes.</p><p>Then, with the emergence of the Internet and advancements in networking technologies, users could connect with other users across geographical distances and exchange information securely and reliably. The rise of personal computers and the introduction of the World Wide Web in the '90s allowed users to access and share data globally via servers and browsers.</p><p>Then, in the '00s, we saw a major shift to cloud computing. The big three were (and remain) Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. These service providers offer on-demand computing and storage resources at scale. Major companies embraced the cloud to reduce costs. It eliminated the need to build and maintain large on-premises data centers. There were also competitive advantages, such as speedier deployment of new applications. </p><p>The Rise of Cloud Computing and Centralized Services</p><p>The shift to cloud computing has a profound impact on software development. One of the big benefits is optimal resource utilization. Developers can scale up or down their resource needs depending on demand. This is also reflected in the pay-as-you-go model, which allows developers to pay for a tier or plan that best fits their needs.</p><p>Cloud providers offer various managed services, including databases, analytics tools, machine learning, and AI, allowing companies to build innovative features and applications without starting from scratch. </p><p>They also offer APIs for effortless integration and redundancies that ensure high data availability.</p><p>But with these benefits also come drawbacks. For example, data privacy is one of the biggest concerns users express. When storing data with a centralized provider, users have limited control over how it is handled, accessed, and even shared. As the saying goes, "There is no cloud. It's just someone else's computer." </p><p>This can be easy to forget until a data breach or security vulnerability exists. </p><p>Centralized storage creates a single point of failure, which is attractive to bad actors. If it is compromised, the results could be widespread and disastrous. &nbsp; </p><p>Vendor lock-in is another drawback. Once a company is so intertwined with a cloud platform's services, it can be time-consuming and challenging to make a change.</p><p>Cloud services are dependent on Internet connectivity. If there is an Internet outage, and the company is almost entirely cloud-based, business essentially ceases. This can lead to a loss of revenue and unhappy customers. </p><p>There are also additional costs that developers and companies need to be mindful of. For example, while pricing tiers can be a straightforward way to select a plan that suits the budget, going over the allotted storage can be pricy. The same goes for data transfer costs. </p><p>There are also legal considerations. Businesses must take additional security precautions to stay compliant when dealing with sensitive data, like healthcare and financial data. For example, access must be carefully monitored and data encrypted. </p><p>The Local-First Software Movement Takes Root</p><p>As a result of these growing concerns, some developers and users have shifted to a local-first approach. Local-first combines the convenience of cloud apps, including real-time collaboration and the ability to work on multiple devices, with the prioritization of local data storage and networks. </p><p>Local-first also shifts a key paradigm of version authority. With the cloud the file stored in the cloud is the primary copy. Any edits made offline don't matter until they are synced. With local-first, the local copy is the primary copy. </p><p>In the seminal paper, <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/local-first.pdf">Local-First Software: You Own Your Data, In Spite of the Cloud</a>, by Martin Kleppmann, Peter van Hardenberg, Adam Wiggins, and Mark McGranaghan, the authors lay out seven ideals for local-first software.</p>  No Spinners: Your Work at Your Fingertips - Instantaneous modifications to files, not burdened by the speed of light!  Your Work Is Not Trapped On One Device - Users should be able to work on their computer, phone, and tablet.  The Network is Optional - Even without Internet connectivity, users should be able to do work and sync their changes later when connectivity is restored.   Seamless Collaboration with Your Colleagues - Cloud apps allow users to edit the same document, so should local-first apps.  The Long Now - Users should be able to access their data long after the company that created the app is gone  Security and Privacy by Default - End-to-end encryption protects sensitive data, whereas cloud services may not meet confidentiality requirements and offer an attractive target for bad actors.  You Retain Ultimate Ownership and Control - A centralized service can lock users out of their data, but users always retain ownership with local-first apps.  <p>Notable Local-First Software Projects and Initiatives</p><p>Several exciting projects have popped up recently in the local-first software space. <a href="https://skiff.com/">Skiff</a>, for example, is a privacy-first end-to-end encrypted workspace. Offering apps such as Skiff Drive, Skiff Docs, Skiff Calendar, and Skiff Mail, they provide a decentralized alternative to cloud-based collaboration tools. <a href="https://dxos.org/">DXOS</a> is an application framework, development platform, and toolchain that enables developers to build local-first, multiplayer applications. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">WNFS</a> is a distributed file system that stores public and private data on IPFS while keeping it encrypted and controlling access via <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. More examples of local-first applications exist and are on their way, and there has never been more <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/">interest in the movement</a>. </p><p>How Users Can Embrace Local-First Software</p><p>Users, developers, and businesses should all consider whether adopting local-first software solutions is the right fit for them. First, evaluate your data needs and sharing requirements. Do you need to store confidential information? How does the local-first tool handle encryption and access? </p><p>Local-first software builders should provide offline functionality and design with user control in mind.

<p>Modern enterprise networks are vast systems of remote and on-premises endpoints, locally installed software,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">cloud apps</a>, and third-party services. Every one of these assets plays a vital role in business operations—and any of them could contain vulnerabilities that&nbsp;threat actors&nbsp;can use to sow chaos. Organizations rely on the vulnerability management process to head off these cyberthreats before they strike.</p>



<p>The vulnerability management process is a continuous process for discovering, prioritizing, and resolving security vulnerabilities across an organization’s IT infrastructure.</p>



 Security vulnerabilities defined 



<p>A security vulnerability is any weakness or flaw in the structure, function, or implementation of an IT asset or network that hackers or cybercriminals can exploit to cause harm. Coding errors—e.g., a bug in a web app that lets threat actors inject the system with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware">malware</a>—are a common type of vulnerability. Misconfigurations, like a cloud storage bucket that exposes sensitive data to the public internet, are also common.</p>



<p>According to the IBM&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">X-Force Threat Intelligence Index</a>, the exploitation of vulnerabilities like these is the second most common&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattack</a>&nbsp;vector (method of infiltrating the target system or network).</p>



<p>A continuous vulnerability management process helps stop cyberattacks—and soften the blow of those that succeed—by finding and fixing flaws before threat actors can weaponize them. In short, it enables the security team to adopt a more proactive security posture, which is why vulnerability management is a key component of enterprise&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-risk-management">risk management</a>&nbsp;strategies today.</p>



 The vulnerability management lifecycle&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Corporate networks are not static. Every change—adopting a new app, updating an operating system—can introduce new vulnerabilities. Plus, hackers are always hunting for undiscovered flaws, and it only takes them about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hackers-are-getting-faster-at-exploiting-zero-day-flaws-thats-going-to-be-a-problem-for-everyone/">12 days to start exploiting the ones they find</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep up with these adversaries and respond to cyberthreats in a timely manner, security teams address vulnerabilities in an ongoing process called the vulnerability management lifecycle. Each cycle leads directly into the next, and the intel collected in each cycle shapes how the next one plays out.</p>



<p>Typically the vulnerability management lifecycle includes five stages, plus an occasional planning phase.</p>



 Planning and prework&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Before the lifecycle officially starts, the organization establishes its overall strategy for addressing security weaknesses. This includes identifying responsible stakeholders, earmarking resources, setting goals, and defining key performance metrics.</p>



<p>Organizations go through this stage once before implementing a formal vulnerability management process. Then, the overall strategy is revisited periodically and updated as needed.</p>



 1. Asset discovery and vulnerability assessment 



<p>Every round of the vulnerability management lifecycle starts with updating the inventory of all the hardware, software, and other IT assets active on the company network. Security teams often use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/attack-surface-management">attack surface management</a>&nbsp;platforms or other asset discovery tools to automate this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the security team conducts vulnerability scans to identify vulnerabilities in these assets. The team may use a combination of vulnerability management tools and methods to assess all assets, including automated vulnerability scanners, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/penetration-testing">penetration tests</a>, and logs from internal security tools.</p>



 2. Vulnerability prioritization 



<p>The security team uses the results of vulnerability assessments to sort out false positives and prioritize discovered vulnerabilities by level of criticality. Prioritization enables security teams to focus on the biggest security risks first.</p>



<p>Resources like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), MITRE’s list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and NIST’s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) can help security teams get a baseline understanding of how critical their vulnerabilities are.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity teams then combine this external threat intelligence with company-specific data to understand how known vulnerabilities affect their unique networks.</p>



 3. Vulnerability resolution 



<p>The security team works through the list of vulnerabilities, moving from most critical to least. Generally, they have three options for resolving these flaws:</p>



 
 Remediation: Fully addressing a vulnerability so it can no longer be exploited, such as by patching software vulnerabilities or fixing device misconfigurations. 



 Mitigation: Making a vulnerability more difficult to exploit and/or lessening the impact of exploitation without removing the vulnerability entirely. For example, putting a firewall around a vulnerable asset and training employees on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/social-engineering">social engineering</a>&nbsp;attacks would be forms of mitigation. 



 Acceptance: If a vulnerability is unlikely to be exploited or wouldn’t cause much impact, the company may accept it. 
 



 4. Reassessment and monitoring 



<p>To confirm that mitigation and remediation efforts worked—and to ensure they don’t introduce any new problems—the security team reassesses the assets. The team also takes stock of the overall network and the general cyberthreat landscape, as changes in either one may require updates to security controls or criticality ratings.</p>



 5. Reporting and improvement 



<p>Vulnerability management platforms typically provide dashboards for reporting metrics like mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), and vulnerability recurrences. The security team can use these metrics to report back to stakeholders and audit the vulnerability management program, looking for opportunities to improve performance over time.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/vulnerability-management-lifecycle">Learn more about the vulnerability management lifecycle</a>



 Best practices for an effective vulnerability management program&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Correlate vulnerabilities 



<p>Security teams can better understand each vulnerability’s criticality by considering how a flaw relates to other vulnerabilities in the system. For example, a non-critical flaw in a non-critical asset may not seem important in isolation. If hackers can use that non-critical asset as a stepping stone to exploit a vulnerability in a more critical system, it may take on a higher priority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Correlating vulnerabilities can also help find and fix underlying issues that may make the network more susceptible to cyberattacks. For example, if vulnerability assessments keep turning up outdated assets, it may be a sign the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/patch-management">patch management</a>&nbsp;process needs an overhaul.&nbsp;</p>



 Curate information 



<p><a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/augusto-barros/2019/10/25/new-vulnerability-management-guidance-framework/">According to Gartner</a>, one of the most common vulnerability management mistakes is when security teams send raw vulnerability scan results to asset owners. These reports can contain hundreds or thousands of vulnerabilities, making it hard for IT teams to determine the most effective remediation strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security teams can use the prioritization stage to not only rank vulnerabilities but also curate threat intelligence and other information into digestible reports. That way, other stakeholders in vulnerability management can help move the process along instead of getting bogged down in the details.</p>



 Strategically schedule scans 



<p>Some organizations use continuous scanning tools to flag vulnerabilities in real time. Those that don’t need to be intentional about scheduling scans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vulnerability assessments can be time- and resource-intensive, so security teams may not want to scan every asset during every assessment. Generally, organizations group assets on their networks according to criticality level. More critical asset groups are scanned more often, typically weekly or monthly. Less critical assets may be scanned quarterly or less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scans can also affect the performance of some assets, so the organization may schedule assessments for off-hours when the assets aren’t being used.</p>



 Automate wherever possible 



<p>Given the sheer number of assets in the average enterprise network, manual vulnerability management processes typically aren’t feasible. Instead, security teams often use vulnerability management systems to automate key workflows like asset discovery, vulnerability assessment, prioritization, and patch management.</p>



 Explore vulnerability management solutions 



<p>Even with the right security tools in place, it can be hard for security teams to keep up with all the potential threats and risks in their enterprise networks.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>This conversation revolves around two key elements that my esteemed guests consider pivotal for the adoption of self-sovereign identity: robust communication strategies and interoperable user experience elements.</p>
<p>In the decentralized identity space, numerous communities are filled with individuals collaborating to establish and enhance unified sets of standards to underpin the principles of self-sovereign identity. These communities are also actively engaged in developing technical specifications and open-sourcing implementations. Their collective efforts are instrumental in promoting the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. A fundamental pillar in this journey is interoperability. It’s the key to preventing vendor lock-in and decoupling protocols from end applications. Just as we seamlessly exchange emails across various clients using standardized email protocols, we aspire to achieve a similar level of interoperability in the digital trust space. However, while we’re making significant strides in achieving interoperability, there’s one critical area that warrants more attention and collaboration: user experience (UX).</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Irene and Esther from <a href="https://gataca.io/">Gataca</a>, we focus around the challenges surrounding user experience and the need for greater standardization in this domain. Standardizing user experience elements is crucial for implementing solutions that are truly interoperable, preventing the emergence of proprietary obstacles.</p>
  
<p>For anyone interested in collaborating on designing interoperable user experience elements, Gataca is kicking off a new <a href="https://hs.gataca.io/ux4ssi">UX4SSI Working Group</a> on September 12, 2023. Feel free to register using the link I provided.</p>
<p>And for those interested, here is the link to <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23488/w23488.pdf">‘The Digital Privacy Paradox: Small Money, Small Costs, Small Talk’</a> paper that Irene refers to in the conversation.</p>
<p>I trust that you’ll enjoy this conversation as much as I did. Enjoy!</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Irene, Esther and myself in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:25] Defining Adoption: How do we define adoption in the context of Self-Sovereign Identity, and what lens should we use when examining its various aspects and dimensions? 
 [02:21] Measuring Adoption: When measuring adoption, should we start within specific geographical contexts or industries? What key performance indicators (KPIs) and signals should we consider? 
 [12:07] Communication Challenges: Communication plays a vital role in SSI adoption. We explore why it’s challenging to communicate and market SSI compared to other technologies, like generative AI products. What are the unique hurdles in conveying the value of SSI? 
 [18:24] Simplifying Terminology: The conversation continues with a focus on the use of technical jargon and terminology that can bewilder potential adopters. How can we transition from technical discussions to emphasizing business solutions? 
 [23:17] Targeting Adopters: Is it more effective to target entities that serve as both issuers and verifiers or to focus on specific roles within the SSI ecosystem? What are the trade-offs? 
 [27:56] Building Brand Recognition: Given the open nature of the SSI ecosystem, how can organizations build strong brand recognition, and what role do trust marks and certifications play? 
 [31:47] Navigating Political Terminology: How do you address concerns surrounding the term “digital identity” being weaponized in political discourse when communicating about your SSI products? 
 [37:44] Learning from European Adoption: What lessons can be learned from early adoption of digital identity programs in Europe, and how does it compare to the North American market? 
 [47:29] UX Challenges: What are some of the key user experience (UX) challenges in the SSI space, and how can they be addressed to enhance usability and security? 
 [50:59] Interoperability Impact: How does user experience impact interoperability in the SSI ecosystem, and vice versa? What collaborative efforts are needed? 
 [53:22] Balancing Usability and Security: Balancing usability with security is a common challenge. How can the SSI community find the right equilibrium and enhance user adoption?

<p>Brands that deliver an excellent customer experience (CX) will always be more resilient than those that don’t. Giving our customers personalized support at every stage of their journey is proven to earn their longtime loyalty—and keep them from switching to a competitor. The challenge, however, is that many teams operate in siloes that inhibit them from applying their customer insights in meaningful ways. And many brand leaders still view CX as an expense, not an investment.</p>



<p>Given the rise of artificial intelligence, savvy brands are augmenting their abilities and improving experiences rapidly. If your team lags in AI adoption, you give your competitors an opportunity to get ahead. It is now a necessity to implement AI to deliver the personalized journeys your customers are expecting.Generative AI is especially necessary as your company works with a growing number of customers. Consider Salesforce, which has more than 150,000 companies that rely on its customer relationship management platform. These customers are using AI in some remarkable ways to gain a competitive advantage. </p>



 3 ways Generative AI can improve your customer service 



<p>It can feel challenging to know where to get started with AI and how to prove its value. Customer service is one area that presents immediate opportunities for AI to truly <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/transforming-customer-service-how-generative-ai-is-changing-the-game/">transform</a> your customer experience. Let’s explore what you should consider and how to get started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generative AI is a top-priority for CEOs, with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">75% believing</a> the companies with the most advanced generative AI will beat their competition. The key is to identify specific problems that AI can solve and start piloting use cases so you can begin to realize its limits, challenges, and undeniable advantages.</p>



<p>Once you define your <a href="https://experienceinvestigators.com/vision-goals/why-customer-experience-mission-matters/#:~:text=A%20Customer%20Experience%20Mission%20is,directly%20with%20customers%20or%20not.">CX mission statement</a>, you can use that to gauge if your AI initiatives across departments support the promises you’ve made to customers. I often recommend companies start with customer service, because there are some already tested ways to integrate AI and drive measurable results:</p>



 
 Tools for Agents: As your service representatives engage with customers, generative AI is essential to provide personalized services quickly. AI tools uplevel your customer insights to ensure tailored services based on their unique needs and circumstances. Consistently check in with your representatives to understand what challenges they face when engaging with your customers, and consider where AI can help. Ideally, you should see a boost to your post-service call satisfaction surveys as well as a quicker resolution time for customer requests, all thanks to the help of AI! 



 Automated Email Nurture Streams: Communications, or a lack thereof, often make or break your customer experience. AI can help automate messages during key moments, like when customers first purchase your product or as they explore features or additional services. Your customer service team can create email nurture streams that welcome customers and show them how to use your product. A few days or weeks later, you can send emails checking in on their experience and providing additional resources. AI is essential for delivering these messages when they matter most based on the individual journey of each customer. Your reps can leverage generative AI to craft the perfect message, then your system can take care of the rest! Track your email engagement rates to see what resources your customers access, and measure to learn what works best (and potentially adjust your outreach cadence). 



 Dynamic Customer Onboarding: Complex implementations can frustrate your customers and prevent them from realizing the full benefits of your solution. AI is great for walking customers through their onboarding process and delivering tailored support based on their use cases and experiences. Instead of sending user manuals or complicated “getting started” kits, I recommend you explore how AI can deliver dynamic support in the moment. You should see a lift to your CSAT scores, as well as a quicker implementation time for customers. It’s a win/win! 
 



 <a></a>Empower Your Reps to Deliver Personalized Experiences 



<p>Generative AI tools significantly augment our ability to meet our customers’ changing needs. Humans will always be an essential part of delivering authentic and personal experiences, and AI supercharges our ability to do so.</p>



<p>Customer service is an approachable place to start experimenting with AI and achieving its benefits. My best advice: Ensure you have a clear problem in mind for AI to solve before piloting a use case. Be open throughout the process and invite feedback from your team and customers on how you can continue to improve their experience.</p>



<p>Now is the time to get started.</p>

To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream.

<p>The effects of climate change grow more tangible by the day. As a result, the electric power industry is hastening efforts to reduce environmental impact. To do so, they need help to get a clearer picture of where they fall on the emissions reduction roadmap, and to better understand their opportunities for improvement. This is where harnessing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and data analytics can help.</p>



<p>To assist utility companies, IBM has created the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/clean-energy-maturity-model">Clean Electrification Maturity Model</a> (CEMM) in conjunction with the American Productivity &amp; Quality Center (APQC). Based on 14 years of development and input from electric utility experts, the CEMM provides a series of benchmarks to help utility companies measure the maturity of their clean electrification capabilities, set priorities for transformation and track their progress along the way.</p>



<p>The results from the first global CEMM benchmark of 90 transmission and distribution utilities paint a telling picture of the role that technology can play in this critical transformation. Companies that harness AI and data analytics can also make clean energy more viable overall by increasing their cost competitiveness over legacy energy sources.</p>



<p>On average, 3.3 times more of the most mature utilities prioritize research in energy balancing and trading. This research can enable more liquid markets and lower energy prices for customers. By introducing AI into the renewable energy generation, transmission and distribution processes, utilities can better <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite">predict weather patterns in advance</a>, giving them better insights into the output of solar and wind farms.</p>



 AI: The road ahead for energy and utilities 



<p>AI can also benefit customer care, freeing up resources for innovation in other aspects of their business. The most mature utilities were more than four times more likely to utilize customer experience platforms, including AI-powered chatbots and data analytics for personalized service. The latter can also help drive efficiency by lowering end-user energy use. Informed by automated reports, customers can better understand their energy consumption and take steps to reduce their power draw during peak periods of demand.</p>



<p>Despite these strides, the industry still has a lot of ground to make up to realize its carbon reduction goals. According to the CEMM study, the most mature 25% of transmission and distribution utilities still only achieved the modest overall score of 2.2 out of 5 across all domains. The average maturity for all T&amp;D utilities was at the 1.6 mark. Technological maturity has vast potential for improvement; here, the most mature segment fared only marginally better than the bottom 75%, falling into the lowest development category.</p>



<p>Global electricity demands continue to rise. Utility companies must take urgent action to realign their organizations’ strategies and implement intelligent, data-driven processes for change. By emulating the successes of industry leaders and adopting the latest proven AI-enabled technologies, utility companies can take a big step toward meeting their own emissions goals and reducing the impact of climate change on the planet.</p>

<p>In today’s modern era of hybrid digital and physical banking experiences, financial institutions are seeking new ways to improve their new customer acquisition strategies while ensuring they are compliant with relevant regulations. Following a dramatic increase in the use of remote onboarding and expansion of digital banking in recent years, the sector is only set to develop further – the market size is projected to grow from USD $8.4 billion in 2021 to USD $19.2 billion by 2028, <a href="https://marketsnresearch.com/report/1592/global-digital-banking-market">forecasting a healthy compound annual growth rate of 14.80%. </a></p>
<p>Therefore, it’s become increasingly important for banks and credit unions to ensure their customers’ identities are genuine, and that they can lawfully use the services offered by the financial institution. The use of biometric identity verification and eKYC (electronic Know Your Customer) checks have become essential, as they enhance security while simplifying the end-user’s journey.</p>
<p>To meet this growing need, Entrust and iProov – two industry leaders in digital identity verification and authentication – have partnered to deliver biometric identity verification and eKYC checks in one powerful, end-to-end solution. This solution revolutionizes how banks and credit unions onboard new users, ensuring a fast, secure, and user-friendly experience for customers and financial organizations alike.</p>
 What are eKYC Checks and How Do They Work?  
<p>eKYC checks are a digital alternative to the traditional KYC process, which is required by regulatory bodies to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. eKYC allows customers to open accounts remotely without the need for physical paperwork or in-person interactions. It’s the most effective way to speed up the onboarding process and improve customer and member satisfaction right out of the gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/">Entrust’s </a>identity solutions portfolio combined with iProov offers identity verification and eKYC services to financial institutions for account opening. It integrates iProov’s biometric solutions suite to provide a seamless and secure onboarding experience. Customers can use their smartphones to capture their biometric data, take a selfie, scan a government-issued ID, and submit the information for verification. The technology can process thousands of identity verifications in minutes, reducing the time and costs associated with manual identity checks.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Combining Biometric Identity Verification With eKYC? 
<p>By incorporating biometric verification into eKYC processes, banks and credit unions can reduce the risk of onboarding illegitimate users with stolen or synthetic identities. Additionally, eKYC checks enhanced with biometric technology have proven to be more efficient – McKinsey says that the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Featured%20Insights/Innovation/The%20value%20of%20digital%20ID%20for%20the%20global%20economy%20and%20society/Digital-ID-a-key-to-inclusive-growth-January%202019.ashx">potential cost reduction</a> in onboarding costs by using digitally-enabled processes is 90%. Also, if a digital onboarding process takes longer than 20 minutes, <a href="https://www.visa.co.uk/dam/VCOM/regional/ve/unitedkingdom/PDF/vca-digital-onboarding-whitepaper-s8.pdf">70% of customers completely abandon</a> their attempt to open an account.</p>
<p>Ultimately the benefits of using biometric identity verification and eKYC checks include, but are not limited to:</p>
 
 Faster, more convenient, and more secure onboarding experience for customers and members 
 Support for compliance and regulatory requirements 
 Reduced risk of both synthetic and stolen identity fraud, as well as data breaches, which can be costly for financial institutions and damaging to their reputation 
 
 The Next Step in Customer Experience: Digital Payment Card Issuance 
<p>A critical objective of this joint solution is creating an effortless experience for users, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Following on from this, it’s important to prioritize delivering value to customers and members as soon as their account is created. One of the most meaningful milestones is debit card issuance, which provides customers with purchasing power and access to their newly deposited funds. Streamlining the issuance of digital payment cards as a part of the account opening process creates a seamless and valuable experience. By linking the onboarding process with the instant issuance of digital payment cards, banks and credit unions can provide a seamless and convenient experience for their customers and members.</p>
<p>This innovation in digital payment card issuance is part of the joint solution and is particularly valuable because it eliminates the urgency for physical card issuance. Customers can begin using their new accounts immediately, contributing to a more satisfying onboarding experience and increased time-to-value for the financial institution.</p>
<p>The partnership between Entrust and iProov is a game changer for the banking industry. It offers a cutting-edge solution that combines biometric identity verification and eKYC checks to provide a secure and user-friendly onboarding experience for both customers and financial institutions. As digital banking continues to grow, this technology will become increasingly important for financial institutions to stay ahead of the curve and provide their end-users with the best possible service.</p>

<p>Planning and managing your cloud ecosystem and environments is critical for reducing production downtime and maintaining a functioning workload. In the “Managing your cloud ecosystems” blog series, we cover different strategies for ensuring that your setup functions smoothly with minimal downtime.</p>



<p>In the third blog of the series, we’re discussing migrating your worker nodes to a new Ubuntu operating system. If you haven’t already, make sure you also check out our previous entries on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/managing-your-cloud-ecosystems-maintaining-workload-continuity-during-worker-node-upgrades/">ensuring workload continuity during worker node upgrades</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/managing-your-cloud-ecosystems-upgrading-your-cluster-to-a-new-version/">upgrading your cluster to a new version</a>.</p>



 OS support on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service">IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service</a> supports the Ubuntu OS and regularly moves to newer Ubuntu versions. Currently, the default OS for cluster worker nodes is Ubuntu20.</p>



<p>To avoid disruptions to your workload, you are responsible for migrating your worker nodes to new OS versions as they become available. IBM Cloud notifies users of upcoming OS releases and deprecations several months in advance to give users time to make any necessary preparations.</p>



 Best practices for migrating 



<p>The steps to migrate to a new OS are found in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ubuntu-migrate">documentation</a>. However, before you begin, you should consider the order in which you migrate your components. Just as we described for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/managing-your-cloud-ecosystems-upgrading-your-cluster-to-a-new-version/">upgrading cluster versions</a>, always start the migration process in your development environment, followed by any other pre-production environments. Test your services along the way and address any issues that arise before making any changes in production. Then, if there are no issues, continue the migration in your production environment.</p>



 Testing services during OS migrations 



<p>Testing your services throughout the process is important for minimizing downtime from any issues that may arise. Keep in mind that the steps for migrating to a new OS involve creating new worker pools that populate with worker nodes at the latest version and then deleting the original worker pools. Before deleting the original worker pools, consider scaling them down and keeping them for several days before you remove them. This way, you can scale the original worker pool back up if your workload experiences disruptions or if you encounter any issues during testing. When you determine that your workload is stable and functions normally, you can remove the original worker pools.</p>



 Wrap up 



<p>Keeping your worker node OS up to date is important for keeping your Kubernetes setup running smoothly. When migrating your worker nodes, it’s important to work in one environment at a time and to leave plenty of opportunity for testing at each step.</p>



<p>In our next and final blog entry for this series, we’ll discuss how you can maintain optimal consistency across your setup.</p>

<p>But AI today is an incredibly dynamic field, and AI platforms must reflect that dynamism, incorporating the latest advances to meet the demands of today and tomorrow. This is why we at IBM continue to add powerful new capabilities to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM watsonx</a>, our data and AI platform for business.</p>



<p>Today we are announcing our latest addition: a new family of IBM-built <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models">foundation models</a> which will be available in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">watsonx.ai</a>, our studio for generative AI, foundation models and machine learning. Collectively named “Granite,” these multi-size foundation models apply <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> to both language and code. And just as granite is a strong, multipurpose material with many uses in construction and manufacturing, so we at IBM believe these Granite models will deliver enduring value to your business.</p>



<p>But now let’s take a look under the hood and explain a little about how we built them, and how they will help you <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-watsonx-ai-open-source-pre-trained-foundation-models-make-ai-and-automation-easier-than-ever-before/">take AI to the next level in your business</a>.</p>



 IBM’s Granite foundation models are targeted for business 



<p><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">Developed by IBM Research</a>, the Granite models — Granite.13b.instruct and Granite.13b.chat — use a “Decoder” architecture, which is what underpins the ability of today’s large language models to predict the next word in a sequence.</p>



<p>At 13 billion parameter models the Granite models are more efficient than larger models, fitting onto a single V100-32GB GPU. They can also <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/generative-ai-for-enterprise">have a smaller impact on the environment</a> while performing well on specialized business-domain tasks such as summarization, question-answering and classification. They are widely applicable across industries, and support other NLP tasks such as content generation, insight extraction and <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG">retrieval-augmented generation</a> (a framework for improving the quality of response by linking the model to external sources of knowledge) and named entity recognition (identifying and extracting key information in a text).</p>



<p>At IBM we are laser-focused on building models that are targeted for business. The Granite family of models is no different, and so we trained them on a variety of datasets — totaling 7 TB before pre-processing, 2.4 TB after pre-processing — to produce 1 trillion tokens, the collection of characters that has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=models-tokens">semantic meaning for a model.</a> Our selection of datasets was targeted at the needs of business users and includes data from the following domains:</p>



 
 Internet: generic unstructured language data taken from the public internet 



 Academic: technical unstructured language data, focused on science and technology 



 Code: unstructured code data sets covering a variety of coding languages 



 Legal: enterprise-relevant unstructured language data taken from legal opinions and other public filings 



 Finance: enterprise-relevant unstructured data taken from publicly posted financial documents and reports 
 



<p>By training models on enterprise-specialized datasets, we help ensure our models are familiarized with the specialized language and jargon from these industries and make decisions grounded in relevant industry knowledge.</p>



 IBM’s Granite foundation models are built for trust 



<p>In business, trust is your license to operate. “Trust us” isn’t an argument, especially when it comes to AI. As one of the first companies to develop enterprise AI, IBM’s approach to AI development is guided by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/policy/trust-transparency-new/?_gl=1*npf8yo*_ga*NjI3OTU2MTEwLjE2MzQwNDk4Mzc.*_ga_FYECCCS21D*MTY5MDU1NjY5My42Ny4wLjE2OTA1NTY2OTMuMC4wLjA.">core principles</a> grounded in commitments of trust and transparency. IBM’s watsonx AI and data platform lets you go beyond being an AI user and become an AI value creator. It has an end-to-end process for building and testing foundation models and generative AI — starting with data collection and ending in control points for tracking the responsible deployments of models and applications — focused on governance, risk assessment, bias mitigation and compliance.</p>



<p>Since the Granite models will be available to clients to adapt to their own applications, every dataset that is used in training undergoes a defined governance, risk and compliance (GRC) review process.&nbsp;We have developed governance procedures for incorporating data into the IBM Data Pile which are consistent with IBM AI Ethics principles. Addressing GRC criteria for data spans the entire lifecycle of training data. Our goal is to establish an auditable link from a trained foundation model all the way back to the specific dataset version on which the model was trained.</p>



<p>Much media attention has (rightly) been focused on the risk of generative AI producing hateful or defamatory output. At IBM we know that businesses can’t afford to take such risks, so our Granite models are trained on data scrutinized by our own “HAP detector,” a language model trained by IBM to detect and root out hateful and profane content (hence “HAP”), which is benchmarked against internal as well as public models. After a score is assigned to each sentence in a document, analytics are run over the sentences and scores to explore the distribution, which determines the percentage of sentences for filtering.</p>



<p>Besides this, we apply a wide range of other quality measures. We search for and remove duplication that improves the quality of output and use document quality filters to further remove low quality documents not suitable for training. We also deploy regular, ongoing data protection safeguards, including monitoring for websites known for pirating materials or posting other offensive material, and avoiding those websites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And because the generative AI technology landscape is constantly changing, our end-to-end process will continuously evolve and improve, giving businesses results they can trust.</p>



 IBM’s Granite foundation models are designed to empower you 



<p>Key to IBM’s vision of AI for business is the notion of empowerment. Every organization will be deploying the Granite models to meet its own goals, and every enterprise has its own regulations to conform to, whether they come from laws, social norms, industry standards, market demands or architectural requirements. We believe that enterprises should be empowered to personalize their models according to their own values (within limits), <a href="http://www.ibm.com/blog/how-foundation-models-and-data-stores-unlock-the-business-potential-of-generative-ai/">wherever their workloads reside</a>, using the tools in the watsonx platform.</p>



<p>But that’s not all. Whatever you do in watsonx, you retain ownership of your data. We don’t use your data to train our models; you retain control of the models you build and you can take them anywhere.</p>



 Granite foundation models: Just the beginning 



<p>The initial Granite models are just the beginning: more are planned in other languages and further IBM-trained models are also in preparation. Meanwhile we continue to add open source models to watsonx. We <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-08-09-IBM-Plans-to-Make-Llama-2-Available-within-its-Watsonx-AI-and-Data-Platform">recently announced</a> that IBM is now offering Meta’s Llama 2-chat 70 billion parameter model to select clients for early access and plan to make it widely available later in September. In addition, IBM will host StarCoder, a large language model for code, including over 80+ programming languages, Git commits, GitHub issues and Jupyter notebooks.</p>



<p>In addition to the new models, IBM is also launching new complementary capabilities in the watsonx.ai studio. Coming later this month is the first iteration of our Tuning Studio, which will include <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-ai-prompt-tuning">prompt tuning</a>, an efficient, low-cost way for clients to adapt foundation models to their unique downstream tasks through training of models on their own trustworthy data. We will also launch our Synthetic Data Generator, which will assist users in creating artificial tabular data sets from custom data schemas or internal data sets. This feature will allow users to extract insights for AI model training and fine tuning or scenario simulations with reduced risk, augmenting decision-making and accelerating time to market.</p>



<p>The addition of the Granite foundation models and other capabilities into watsonx opens up exciting new possibilities in AI for business. With new models and new tools come new ideas and new solutions. And the best part of it all? We’re only getting started.</p>

 Thrive in the open data economy by closing the loop towards speed and&nbsp;value The Data Value-Creation Loop Motivation <p>The <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">core infrastructure </a>is in place for an open data economy. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Dozens of teams</a> are building on it. But it’s not 100% obvious for teams how to make&nbsp;$.</p><p>We ask:</p><blockquote>How do people sustain and thrive in the emerging open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is simple: ensure that they can make&nbsp;money!</p><p>However, this isn’t enough. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> The Data Value-Creation Loop <p>The next question&nbsp;is:</p><blockquote>How do people make money in the open data&nbsp;economy?</blockquote><p>Our answer is: create value from data, make money from that value, and loop back and reinvest this value creation into further&nbsp;growth.</p><p>We call this the Data Value-Creation Loop. The figure above illustrates.</p><p>Let’s go through the steps of the&nbsp;loop.</p>  At the top, the user gets data by buying it or spending $ to create&nbsp;it.  Then, they build an AI model from the&nbsp;data.  Then they make predictions. E.g. “ETH will rise in next 5&nbsp;minutes”  Then, they choose actions. E.g. “buy&nbsp;ETH”).  In executing these actions, they data scientist (or org) will make $ on&nbsp;average.  The $ earned is put back into buying more data, and other activities. And the loop&nbsp;repeats.  <p>In this loop, dapp builders can help their users make money; data scientists can earn directly; and crypto enthusiasts can catalyze the first two if incentivized properly (e.g. to curate valuable&nbsp;data).</p><p>If we unroll the loop, we get a data value supply chain. In most supply chains, the most value creation is at the last step, right before the action is taken. Would you rather a farmer in Costa Rica selling a sack of coffee beans for $5, or Starbucks selling 5 beans’ worth of coffee for $5? Therefore, for data value supply chains, the most value creation in the prediction step.</p><p>To the question “How do people make money in the open data economy?”, the “create value from data!” almost seem like a truism. Don’t fool yourself. It’s highly useful in practice: focus only on activities that fully go through the data value-creation loop.</p><p>However, this is still too open-ended. We need to dive&nbsp;deeper.</p> Which Vertical? How To Compare Opportunities <p>There are perhaps dozens of verticals or hundreds of possible opportunities of creating and closing data value-creation loops. How to select which? We’ve found that two measuring sticks help the&nbsp;most.</p><p>Key criteria:</p>  How quickly one can go through the data value-creation loop?  What’s the $ size of the opportunity  <p>For (2), it’s not just “what’s the size of the market”, it’s also “can the product make an impact in the market and capture enough value to be meaningful”.</p><p>We analyzed dozens of possible verticals with according to these criteria. For any given data application, the loop should be fast with serious $ opportunity.</p><p>Here are some examples.</p>  Small $, slow. Traditional music is small $ and slow, because incumbents like Universal dominate by controlling the the back catalogue.  Large $, slow. Medicine is large $ but slow, due to the approval&nbsp;process.  Small $, fast. Decentralized music is fast but small $ (for now! Fingers crossed).  <p>We want: large $, fast. Here are the standouts.</p>  Decentralized Finance (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/defi/">DeFi</a>) is a great fit. One can loop at the speed of blocks (or faster), and trade volumes have serious&nbsp;$.  LLMs and modern AI is close: one can loop quickly, and with the right application make $. The challenge is: what’s the right application?   On Ocean Protocol&nbsp;Strategy <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">At Ocean</a>, we encourage our ecosystem collaborators to close the data value-creation loops, with maximum $ and speed. We follow our advice for internal projects too. Accordingly, a lot of our focus is on the DeFi and LLMs / modern AI. These are natural for us because Ocean is natively a Web3 and an AI&nbsp;project.</p><p>Loops, then scale. Once one or two fast &amp; high $ data value-creation loops have been established on Ocean, where people are sustainably making money, we’ll likely adjust our activities to scale those loops&nbsp;up.</p><p>Ubiquity. Our aim is to grow over the long-term, until Ocean is ubiquitous as a tool to level the playing field on data and&nbsp;AI.</p> Summary <p>To sustain and thrive in the open data economy: make&nbsp;money!</p><p>Do this by closing the data value-creation loop, in a vertical / opportunity where you can loop quickly and the $ opportunity is&nbsp;large.</p> Notes <p>This content was originally published in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2023-44ed14510051">Ocean Protocol Update || 2023</a>”, Mar 10, 2023.

  FATF Travel Rule compliance is now mandatory for UK-based Virtual Asset Service Providers.  The fragmented adoption of the Travel Rule globally poses significant compliance challenges.  Technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope are essential for seamless, cross-jurisdictional compliance.  <p>As of September 1st, the FATF Crypto Travel Rule has been implemented in the United Kingdom. Hence, for all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that are active in the UK, comprehending the nuances of the Travel Rule is no longer optional — it’s a business imperative.</p> The Implications of the FATF Travel Rule for&nbsp;VASPs <p>At the heart of the matter, the primary obligation for UK-based VASPs is to meticulously collect, verify, and share information about crypto-asset transfers. But what does this mean in practice?</p> Dealing with International Transactions <p>Suppose a VASP receives an inbound payment from a jurisdiction where the Travel Rule isn’t enforced. In such a case, it’s not just business as usual — the VASP is required to conduct a risk-based assessment before making the assets available to the recipient. By extension, similar protocols would apply to UK citizens initiating payments to foreign territories.</p> Regulatory Expectations <p>While planning to implement the FATF Travel Rule, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was clear in its expectations — VASPs are not merely encouraged but expected to exercise due diligence, even when they use third-party services to assist with compliance.</p> Keeping an Eye on Global Developments <p>VASPs must also make it a point to monitor how the Travel Rule is being implemented in other jurisdictions. This vigilance is particularly crucial when dealing with transfers to or from regions that have yet to adopt the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Transferring Crypto Assets to Jurisdictions Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>The VASPs are required to make sure they can receive the necessary information for each transaction. However, even if receiving this information isn’t possible, they are still obligated to collect and verify it in line with Money Laundering Regulations. This must be done before any crypto asset transfer&nbsp;occurs.</p> Receiving Crypto Assets from a Jurisdiction Without the Travel Rule in&nbsp;Place <p>UK VASPs must scrutinize the countries involved if a transfer comes in with incomplete or missing information. It’s essential to be aware of each country’s status with regard to the Travel Rule, especially given that only a limited number — like the United States, Germany, and Japan — have fully implemented it. Statistically speaking, as of March 2022, only 29 out of 98 jurisdictions had met the necessary requirements.</p><p>Given this fragmented FATF Travel Rule compliance landscape, VASPs are entering uncharted territory. Moreover, the crypto economy itself is still evolving, and compliance requirements like these are inevitably going to pose challenges, and the UK-based VASPs are no exception to these growing&nbsp;pains.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Concerns <p>Cross-border transfer of funds deals with the regulations of two different legal jurisdictions. The compliance mechanism in such transfers always has to be well-structured and well-laid-out, ensuring that the regulatory realities of two different political geographies are taken into account. This is why many crypto service providers believe that they need further guidance from the FATF while they work on compliance.</p> Heterogeneous Implementation of the Regulation <p>In June 2023, the FATF released an update stating that a whopping <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html">75% of 98 jurisdictions</a> were either partially compliant or not compliant with their requirements for virtual assets and&nbsp;VASPs.</p><p>This discrepancy in compliance levels creates a challenge as transactions between compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions become fraught with legal complexities. The industry calls this the “Sunrise” issue, a problem Shyft Veriscope has found an innovative solution&nbsp;for.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope uses a “historic lookback” approach, allowing VASPs to pull information on any transaction, regardless of when it occurred or whether the receiving VASP was compliant at the time. This feature allows for seamless, compliant transactions across borders and regulatory landscapes.</p><p>In essence, Veriscope helps VASPs navigate the fragmented regulatory environment by retroactively generating the necessary compliance information, ensuring that every player can meet their obligations under the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>More on Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report — Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p> Unequal Compliance Levels <p>Fraudulent actors are always active in exploiting cracks in the system, and one such vulnerability could arise from a transaction involving both compliant and non-compliant jurisdictions.</p><p>But it doesn’t end there — even within two compliant geographies, unequal levels of compliance could similarly present exploitable gaps.</p><p>For example, both Canada and the UK are travel rule-compliant. However, Canada requires VASPs to record the beneficiary’s postal address, while the UK does not. Such irregularities have to be streamlined to achieve an efficient implementation of the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Cryptocurrency’s Unique&nbsp;Features <p>The crypto-economy has facilities like self-custodial or unhosted wallets, where no service provider knows the wallet details. Only the holder possesses and controls the private key to that wallet. In such setups, it becomes difficult for VASPs to comply with the norms, including a requirement for firms to identify the names of people behind transactions.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>The implementation of the FATF Travel Rule in the UK signals a pivotal moment in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulation. While the UK has taken proactive steps to embrace this global standard, the challenges for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are far from over. With a fragmented global adoption rate, issues like the “Sunrise” problem loom large, and even within compliant jurisdictions, nuances in the regulatory frameworks create additional layers of complexity.</p><p>As the regulatory landscape continues to mature, VASPs will need to keep several key considerations in&nbsp;mind:</p><p>Regulatory Harmonization: Given the patchy adoption of the Travel Rule, efforts to standardize compliance requirements across jurisdictions will become increasingly important. The crypto industry will benefit from greater cooperation among regulators globally.</p><p>Technological Solutions: Leveraging technological solutions like Shyft Veriscope can serve as a lifeline for VASPs struggling with cross-jurisdictional compliance. Such tools offer a real-time, scalable way to meet regulatory requirements without sacrificing operational efficiency.</p><p>Ongoing Monitoring: Regulatory compliance is a moving target. Keeping abreast of updates, whether from FATF or local regulatory bodies like the FCA, will be vital for continuous compliance. To stay updated on the latest developments and insights, <a href="https://shyft-network.beehiiv.com/subscribe">consider subscribing to our Veriscope recap newsletter</a>.</p><p>Fraud Prevention: As the sector evolves, so will the techniques used by fraudulent actors. VASPs must continually refine their risk assessment methodologies to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, whether they arise from inconsistent compliance levels or inherent features of the crypto&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Customer Education: As compliance requirements become more complex, so does the user experience. VASPs will need to educate their customer base on what these new rules mean for them and how they are being implemented to protect everyone involved.</p><p>Dialogue with Regulators: Open communication channels with regulatory bodies can help VASPs gain clearer insights into upcoming changes and possibly influence future&nbsp;policy.</p><p>The journey towards full compliance with the FATF Travel Rule is more akin to a marathon than a sprint. With an evolving crypto landscape, shifting regulatory paradigms, and emerging technological solutions, VASPs operating in the UK — and indeed globally — need to stay agile, vigilant, and proactive in their approach to meeting these new challenges.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

   The process of introducing new features to the US Open digital experience has never been smoother than it was this year, thanks to watsonx.

<p>This is, by far, my favorite time of year. The kids are back at school. My Miami Hurricanes are off to another strong start. And two of IBM’s marquee partnerships are in full swing: The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/usopen">US Open</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/fantasy">ESPN Fantasy Football</a>.</p>



<p>Right now, I’m in Queens, watching Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz battle it out in 90-degree heat for a spot in the US Open semifinals. Between games, I’m checking the waiver wire on the ESPN Fantasy app, looking for available players who can strengthen my lineup. I know it all sounds like fun and games. But this is my job, and it’s actually serious business.</p>



<p>In fact, our work with these partners looks a lot like the work IBM does with any other client, in any industry. We define business objectives. We develop technology solutions. And we work together to ensure flawless digital operations. For the US Open, that means enhancing one of the best digital experiences in sports, helping millions of tennis fans get up to speed on every match with AI-generated insights. For ESPN, it means using AI to help fantasy team managers make better decisions and field the best possible team, week after week.</p>



<p>Building solutions this powerful is hard work. But it was made considerably easier this year by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">IBM’s new AI and data platform, watsonx</a>. If you’ve been watching the US Open on TV, or in person, you may have seen the ads: “Multiply the power of AI with watsonx.” And this was certainly the case for the USTA and ESPN.</p>



<p>IBM has infused the US Open app with AI for nearly a decade. We were even <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/US-Open-AI-Tennis-Fan-Engagement#:~:text=Open%20Questions%20with%20Watson%20will,the%20best%20player%20in%20tennis%3F">using generative AI to curate tennis debates</a> years before anyone had heard of ChatGPT. But the process of introducing new features to the US Open digital experience has never been smoother than it was this year, thanks to watsonx. The USTA asked IBM Consulting to add spoken commentary to the match highlights they serve up on the app and website. watsonx made it easy, from connecting all the necessary data sets (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-data">watsonx.data</a>) to training a pre-built large language model to translate tennis scenes into complete sentences (<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai">wastsonx.ai</a>). We’re even using some of the forthcoming capabilities of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">watsonx.governance</a> to ensure the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/sports/usopen">AI Commentary</a> model doesn’t drift over time. If you want to know more about how we built the solution, check out the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/us-open">complete case study</a>.</p>



<p>The ESPN partnership, on the other hand, has always been about AI-powered decision making. And this year we used the foundation models found in watsonx.ai to develop an AI model that can identify the best available players on the waiver wire, specific to your team. In other words, the AI understands the weaknesses of your team, and guides you to the talent that can strengthen your lineup.</p>



<p>If you’re thinking these sound like familiar business challenges, you’re right. The AI Commentary solution is not unlike the work our clients are doing to improve customer service experiences, with AI chatbots that understand a specific domain and can guide a positive interaction. And the fantasy solution solves a classic HR problem: identifying and obtaining the best available talent. So while our team is helping our partners at the US Open and ESPN meet their business objectives (driving digital engagement), they’re also demonstrating the power of watsonx to address the business objectives of our clients.</p>



<p>The US Open and ESPN fantasy football are undeniably fun. But they are also big businesses. And that’s why I’m thankful to be working with IBM Consulting and watsonx, the AI and data platform “built for business.” Because when millions of people are hitting your app, you want to make sure the AI models behind them are enterprise grade. Now, back to my fantasy lineup…</p>

				 <p>One initiative in the rapidly growing field of blockchain and decentralized systems provides an excellent case study on how <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/what-is-a-minimum-viable-ecosystem/">Minimum Viable Ecosystems</a> (MVEs) and <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/ecosystem-governance-framework/">Ecosystem Governance Frameworks</a> (EGFs) can drive innovation and community participation: Project Catalyst. This Cardano-based community project organizes funding rounds to support ideas that answer set challenges, with proposals selected through a transparent and democratic voting process.</p>
 What is a Minimum Viable Ecosystem and its Role in Ecosystem Governance? 
<p>An MVE is the foundational layer of an ecosystem designed to be as simple as possible while still functional and able to grow. Much like Project Catalyst, which starts each funding round with specific objectives and involves its community in evaluating and selecting proposals, an MVE establishes the essential stakeholders and governance structures to create a sustainable, growing ecosystem.</p>
<p>The goal of an MVE is to attract and align the stakeholders that are needed to drive the entire value proposition. This isn’t the same goal as an MVP.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Understand that a Minimum Viable Ecosystem is not about doing the least amount of work possible. It’s about identifying and focusing on the most critical elements for success.”</p>
</blockquote>
 Key Components of Ecosystem Governance in a Minimum Viable Ecosystem 
<p>Drawing from the best practices of Project Catalyst, building an MVE involves several core elements:</p>
<p>Stakeholder Engagement: Every individual or entity involved—from users to developers—shapes the ecosystem. In Project Catalyst, community members are incentivized to review and evaluate proposals, making them passengers and co-pilots.</p>
<p>Data-Driven Decision-Making: Community sentiment and performance metrics guide Project Catalyst, and the same should be true for any MVE.</p>
<p>Value Proposition: In Project Catalyst, the value lies in community-driven innovation. Your ecosystem should similarly offer something compelling to its participants.</p>
<p>Ecosystem Governance Framework: Project Catalyst has a transparent voting and accountability system. Effective governance keeps an ecosystem fair, functional and aligned with its overarching vision.</p>
<p>Organizations can cultivate robust, adaptable ecosystems that innovate and drive sustainable growth by understanding and applying these principles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Conditional Access overview&nbsp;is a built-in dashboard that offers a comprehensive view of your Conditional Access posture. As an administrator, it provides a concise summary of your policies,&nbsp;identifies any gaps in your policy coverage, and provides valuable insights based on sign-in activity within your tenant. This feature enables you to swiftly pinpoint areas where you can enhance the enforcement of Zero Trust principles, ultimately bolstering your defense mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 1 Conditional Access overview
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard is now the default landing page of Conditional Access. As the first entry point into Conditional Access, the overview page lets you quickly create new policies using one of the Conditional Access templates which capture commonly used policies and best practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dashboard also offers the following insights and reporting capabilities:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 &nbsp;The “See all unprotected sign-ins” link under the Users tile helps you rapidly identify users that are signing in without the protections of a Conditional Access policy. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 2 Sign-ins without CA coverage during the last 7 days
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The ‘See all non-compliant devices’ and ‘See all unmanaged devices’ links under the Devices tile help you identify device compliance gaps. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 3 Non-compliant devices
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can discover the top 10 most accessed apps without Conditional Access coverage using the coverage tab and go one step further and identify the users without coverage for that app by clicking on the numbers in the ‘Users without coverage’ column. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Figure 4: Top accessed applications without CA coverage
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can discover security alerts generated based on sign-in activity in your tenant and take quick action on the alerts by deploying recommended zero trust conditional access policies using the Conditional Access templates. Speaking of which, let’s take a brief&nbsp;walkthrough of Conditional Access templates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates&nbsp;are a pre-defined set of conditions and controls that provide a convenient method to deploy new policies aligned with Microsoft recommendations. Customers are assured that their policies reflect modern best practices for securing corporate assets, promoting secure, optimal access for their hybrid workforce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditional Access templates are organized across five scenarios:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure foundation 
 Zero Trust 
 Remote work 
 Protect administrators 
 Emerging threats 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can choose from 16 predefined Conditional Access templates based on their specific needs. Here is an example!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the&nbsp;“Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for admins”&nbsp;Conditional Access template, customers can reduce the risk of compromise and phishing attacks on privileged users. This powerful template uses&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/conditional-access-authentication-strength-is-now-generally/ba-p/3773134">Conditional Access authentication strengths</a>&nbsp;to help you choose the right authentication method requirements for specific scenarios, making it easier than ever for organizations to move their most critical users towards more secure, modern, and strong authentication.</p>

 How identified signing can make a difference. 
<p>In this 2-part blog series we provide an overview of the problematics around digitization, specifically on the challenges with remote signatures and some of the options available to limit risks of fraud and increase confidence in your signing process.</p>
<p>We previously explained the challenges around remote signatures for business-critical process, and which options are available to ensure secure and identity-verified signing workflows. Two of these options are digital signatures and eID schemes.</p>
<p>Digital signing: high-assurance signatures from trusted authorities</p>
<p>A digital signature is a specific type of electronic signature; it is not just a visual mark on a PDF document, but a cryptographic operation that binds the signatory’s credentials – in the form of a digital certificate – with the document they are signing. Because a copy of the digital certificate is embedded into the electronic document that is being signed, anyone can verify the signature and identity data in the document, without the need for a separate audit trail.</p>
<p>Digital certificates are issued to individuals and organizations by publicly trusted certification authorities (CAs) – or qualified trust service providers (QTSPs) in the European Union – after these authorities have proceeded with a standardized identity verification process. These digital certificates embed the identity details that were verified. They are only considered “trusted” if they are issued by an authority that is trusted itself. Public CAs and QTSPs such as Entrust follow strict guidelines and go through audits and certifications to earn and maintain the relevant accreditations and remain trusted.</p>
<p>The beauty of digital signatures on documents is that they not only embed verified identity details of the signatory but also provide tamper evidence. A digital signature does indeed bind a digital certificate to the exact content that is signed. A single change in the signed document, even on its metadata, will break the signature. Finally, most CAs and QTSPs also provide a timestamping service, to affix the exact date and time of a signature. This helps to ensure that the existence of a document and the signature cannot be denied.</p>
<p>eIDs and the role of eIDAS in streamlining identity verification processes</p>
<p>eIDs are a growing alternative to identification services, whether from a software or a Certification Authority. An eID schemes consist in a database of verified identities of a specific population that enrolled for the scheme and went through an identity verification process. The most significant benefit of an eID scheme is that, once an eID is created, it can be re-used for a multiple of use-cases, which removes the need for further identity verifications.</p>
<p>To be recognized and accepted everywhere, eID schemes require strong standards and protocols to define, for example, how the identity is verified, how it is stored, how one requests access to some of this data, how a person consents to sharing their data, etc. This is why some regulations are emerging, and perhaps the most notable one is eIDAS.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with eIDAS, it is the European Union’s regulation on the use of eID and electronic signatures across EU member countries, and it’s a global reference when it comes to eIDs and electronic signatures. eIDAS aims to encourage cross-border transactions by ensuring that all EU member countries have the same definition of electronic signatures – note the plural for signatures, because eIDAS doesn’t define one but three types of signatures based on the level of assurance they provide.</p>
<p>eIDAS was published in 2016, and since then all EU member countries have been relying on it for electronic signature standards, and because signatures are inherently linked to identity proving, eIDAS is also driving the deployment of eID schemes across industries and countries in the EU.</p>
<p>It’s worth knowing that there are “private” eID schemes, which are typically industry specific. For example, BankID is an eID scheme managed by a consortium of Scandinavian banks and recognized by governments. But more and more EU governments are also preparing or deploying their own national eID scheme, which allows citizens to enroll for a national eID that can be used to prove their identity online, and notably as part of a signing process.</p>
<p>Do you need help with deploying identified signing solutions?</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">recent study by Price Waterhouse Cooper (PwC)</a> estimates that by 2030, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> will generate more than USD 15 trillion for the global economy and boost local economies by as much as 26%. (1) But what about AI’s potential specifically in the field of marketing?</p>



<p>From customized content creation to task automation and data analysis, AI has seemingly endless applications when it comes to marketing, but also some potential risks. Here are some key definitions, benefits, use cases and finally a step-by-step guide for integrating AI into your next marketing campaign.</p>



 What is AI marketing? 



<p>AI marketing is the process of using AI capabilities like data collection, data-driven analysis, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing">natural language processing (NLP)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a> to deliver customer insights and automate critical marketing decisions. Today, AI technologies are being used more widely than ever to generate content, improve customer experiences and deliver more accurate results. Before choosing an AI tool, organizations should fully explore the different types of AI marketing applications available and look at how they’re being used by other businesses.&nbsp;</p>



 AI in marketing use cases 



<p>Examples of AI in marketing abound as more and more organizations look to it to help them improve everything from their social media posts to their email marketing and content marketing efforts. Here are some examples of ways enterprises are increasing their use of AI to help them achieve marketing goals.</p>



 
 Content generation: The recent launch of OpenAI’s <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> platform ChatGPT in November of 2022 has prompted a flood of new use cases for AI. AI used for content generation can save marketing teams time and money by creating blogs, marketing messages, copywriting materials, emails, subject lines, subtitles for videos, website copy and many other kinds of content aimed at a target audience. 



 Audience segmentation: AI helps businesses intelligently and efficiently divide up their customers by various traits, interests and behaviors, leading to enhanced targeting and more effective marketing campaigns that result in stronger customer engagement and improved ROI. 



 Customer service chatbots: Increasingly, marketers are exploring the possibilities of enabling AI <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/chatbots">chatbots</a> to enhance certain aspects of customer service. Once trained, these bots can interact with customers no matter where they are on their customer journey, help resolve tickets quickly and effectively and increase customer satisfaction. 



 Programmatic advertising: Programmatic advertising is the automation of the purchasing and placement of ads on websites and applications. AI has significantly enhanced organizations’ abilities to conduct programmatic advertising using customer history, preferences and context to deliver more relevant ads with higher conversion rates. 



 Search engine optimization (SEO): Deploying an AI solution to enhance search engine optimization (SEO) helps marketers increase page rankings and develop more sound strategies. AI can help marketers create and optimize content to meet the new standards.&nbsp; 



 E-commerce: AI is helping businesses improve their e-commerce programs and digital marketing capabilities by giving them a more nuanced understanding of their customer’s needs and buying habits, automating tasks and simplifying workflows. 
 



 The benefits and challenges of using AI in marketing 



<p>As with other new technologies, there are both benefits and challenges to using AI for marketing purposes. From maintaining the quality of the large data sets needed to train AI to complying with the field’s ever-expanding privacy laws, organizations that haven’t used AI before are understandably cautious. But enterprises who have made the investment and identified an AI marketing solution tailored to their needs are enjoying many advantages.</p>



 Benefits 



 
 Faster, smarter decision-making: Marketing teams equipped with cutting-edge AI tools can see the impact of their marketing efforts in near real-time and adjust their tactics accordingly. AI marketing platforms can create AI marketing strategies and analyze data faster than humans using ML algorithms and recommend actions informed by sentiment analysis from historical customer data. 



 Improved return on investment (ROI) on marketing initiatives: AI marketing tools can help marketers identify actionable insights from data generated by a campaign in near real-time. Additionally, the same tools can help identify the right channels for a media buy and even the optimal placement of an ad based on customer behavior. Modern AI marketing solutions help stakeholders ensure that they are getting the most out of their investment in a campaign.&nbsp; 



 More accurate measurement of KPIs: Digital campaigns generate more data than humans can keep up with, which can make measuring the success of marketing initiatives difficult. AI-enhanced dashboards help marketers link the success of their efforts to specific tactics they’ve deployed, helping them better understand what’s working and what could be improved. 



 Enhanced customer relationship management (CRM) capabilities: AI technologies help marketing teams improve their customer relationship management (CRM) programs by automating routine tasks like the preparation of customer data. They can also reduce the likelihood of human error, deliver more personalized customer messages and identify at-risk customers. 



 More meaningful insights from customer data: Today, many marketers struggle with the sheer amount of data available to them when they’re planning a campaign. AI can help by performing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/predictive-analytics">predictive analytics</a> on customer data, analyzing huge amounts in seconds using fast, efficient machine learning (ML) algorithms. It uses the data to generate insights about future customer behavior, suggest more personalized content and spot patterns in large data sets for marketers to act on. 
 



 Challenges 



 
 Training AI solutions: Just like humans, AI&nbsp;requires significant training to learn a new task. For example, if you want an AI solution that will talk to your customers in an engaging way, you’ll need to invest the time and resources necessary to teach it. To build an application like this, you will need a large amount of data about customers’ preferences and, potentially, data scientists who specialize in this kind of training.  



 Ensuring the quality and accuracy of data: AI solutions are only as strong as the quality of the data they are trained on. This is true no matter how technically advanced a tool is—if the data it’s been trained on isn’t accurate and representative, the answers and decisions it generates will be low quality and ineffective. 



 Complying with privacy laws: Because AI is trained on personal customer information, the laws surrounding what can be used must be strictly followed. Companies who deploy AI for marketing purposes need to be able to adhere to consumer data regulations or they risk&nbsp;incurring heavy fines and reputational damage. According to <a href="https://ibm.northernlight.com/document.php?docid=IA20221202920000055&amp;datasource=IBM&amp;trans=view&amp;caller=all_results_widget&amp;context=headline_card">HFS Research</a>, reputational damage from errant AI deployments appearing in the media has increased the pressure in both Europe and North America for greater regulation. 
 



 A step-by-step guide to incorporating AI into your marketing strategy 



<p>Follow these five steps to effectively incorporate AI into your next marketing campaign. &nbsp;</p>



 Step 1: Establish goals 



<p>The first step to integrating AI into a marketing campaign is to set out goals and expectations. Assess what worked and didn’t about past campaigns and outline the ways in which you hope AI can help improve your results in the future. Once stakeholders have aligned on expectations, it will be easier to choose an AI solution and set meaningful key performance metrics (KPIs) to evaluate its success.</p>



 Step 2: Acquire the right talent 



<p>Data scientists or engineers with a background in AI, machine learning and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/deep-learning">deep learning</a> don’t typically sit on marketing teams, but their expertise is necessary for successful AI marketing initiatives. To address this issue, organizations have a choice—they can either make the investment to hire the data scientists and engineers they need, or they can go to a third-party vendor for help training and maintaining their AI marketing tool. Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, primarily around the level of investment an organization is willing to make.</p>



 Step 3: Adhere to data privacy laws 



<p>One of the biggest challenges facing AI marketing solutions is the use of customer data for training and implementation purposes without violating privacy laws. Throughout the training process, organizations must find ways to maintain their customers’ security and privacy or face heavy fines.</p>



 Step 4: Test the quality of data 



<p>The success of an AI marketing tool depends on the accuracy and relevancy of the data it’s trained on. AI tools that are trained on data that doesn’t accurately reflect customer intentions will fail to provide useful insights into customer behavior or make useful strategic recommendations. By prioritizing the quality of their data, enterprises can ensure that their AI solutions will help them better achieve the outcomes they seek for their marketing programs.</p>



 Step 5: Choose the solution that’s right for you 



<p>Organizations selecting an AI solution have many different platforms and capabilities to choose from. If they’ve followed the first four steps carefully—laying out their goals, hiring the right talent and ensuring the quality and accuracy of their data—the last step should be the most straightforward: Choosing the tool that’s right for them.</p>



 AI marketing solutions 



<p>Today’s most effective AI marketing solutions utilize AI and ML technologies to enhance customer experiences and deliver meaningful insights to marketers swiftly and accurately. IBM watsonx Assistant is a market-leading, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai">conversational AI</a> platform that enables enterprises to build voice agents and chatbots that can converse naturally with customers and help them resolve their problems.</p>

<p>As security becomes ever tighter, with businesses provisioning more of their infrastructure on private networks, flexible access requires a VPN solution. In this post, we examine how to leverage the IBM Cloud VPN as a Service (VPNaaS) offering for VPC, while managing authentication through IBM Cloud Secrets Manager.</p>



 IBM Cloud Secrets Manager 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/secrets-manager">IBM Cloud Secrets Manager</a> provides a centralised resource to manage various secrets. It provides for the grouping of secrets to simplify the management process while tightening access.</p>



<p>We will utilise Secrets Manager as a certificate-signing authority to store and manage the TLS certificates required for the VPN connectivity. This is an obvious approach as Secrets Manager is integrated into the VPNaaS offering to handle the client/server certificates.</p>



 IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vpc">IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)</a> is a highly scalable and secure cloud networking service, allowing businesses to create complex network topologies to mirror their on-premises setups, utilising the IBM Cloud infrastructure.</p>



<p>With VPC, users can deploy and manage cloud resources like virtual servers, storage and networking components in a logically isolated environment, ensuring enhanced security and control over their cloud-based assets. Additionally, VPC allows seamless integration with other IBM Cloud services, creating a unified ecosystem to host various applications and workloads.</p>



 Assumptions 



 
 VPC exists with configured subnet 



 Secrets Manager instance previously created 
 



 Using Secrets Manager as the certificate authority 



<p>IBM Cloud Secrets Manager provides a number of ways to handle VPN certificates. We will use the internal signing mechanism to generate a client and server pair of certificates for use by the VPN. Alternatives are to use an external signing authority or to import externally generated self-signed certificates into Secrets Manager.</p>



<p>For the following steps, open the Secrets Manager instance, which will produce a screen similar to that in Figure 1:</p>



Figure 1



 Step 1: Create a Secrets Group to contain the VPN certificates 



 
 Select Secret groups from the menu. 



 Click Create. 



 Enter a meaningful group name and optional description. 



 Click Create at the bottom of the screen. 
 



 Step 2: Create a private certificate Secrets Engine 



 
 Select Secrets engines from the menu. 



 Select Private certificates from the drop-down list. 
 



 Step 3: Create the root authority 



 
 Click the Create certificate authority button. 



 This starts a wizard to collect entries. On the next page, enter a meaningful name (e.g., myRootCA). 



 Very important: Toggle the encode URL switch as shown in Figure 2: 
 



Figure 2



 
 Click Next and complete the displayed form. The only required field is the Common Name, which can be used along with Subject Alternative Names later to accept/reject certificates. 



 Leave alternative names empty and set the common name as an arbitrary domain name ‘example.net’. 



 Click Next. 



 The next wizard screen requests Key algorithm. 



 Select the algorithm from the drop-down list. To increase our chances of success, we use the same algorithm throughout the entire certificate chain. 



 Click Next. 



 The next wizard screen is Certificate revocation list. 



 Toggle the CRL building switch to avoid issues with CRL handling. 



 Click Next. 



 The review page will display. 



 Click Create and the following screen will be displayed: 
 



Figure 3



 Step 4: Create the intermediate authority 



<p>Having created the root CA, we now create an intermediate CA by clicking on the link Create certificate authority shown in Figure 3.</p>



 
 On the next screen, enter a meaningful name (e.g., myInterCA). 



 Very important: Toggle the encode URL switch. 



 Click Next. 



 Complete the next three forms in the same manner as for the root CA above. When the certificate is created, the screen shown in Figure 4 will be displayed: 
 



Figure 4



 Step 5: Create the certificate template 



<p>From the screen shown in Figure 4, you are guided to the next step—create a certificate template. Click the Create template link, and complete the form using a meaningful name and the guidance below:</p>



 
 TTL: Validity of the certificate. For testing, 30 days is reasonable. 



 Key type: This is the same as key algorithm from the certificate authority. We chose the same setting for simplicity. 



 Allowed secret groups: Choose the secrets group created above. 



 Add domains, subdomains or wildcards: Add the common name used in the CA certificates created above (remember to push the ‘+’ button after typing the entry). 



 Toggle switches: For testing, select Allow any common name (CN) and Allow subdomains. 



 Certificate roles: Select Use certificates for server and Use certificates for client. 



 Subject Name: Because we are allowing any CN, leave this blank. 
 



 Step 6: Create the server certificate 



 
 Select Secrets from the left-hand menu. 



 Click the Add button on the secrets display screen. 



 Select the Private certificates tile. 



 Click Next. 



 Give the certificate a meaningful name and optional description. 



 Click Next and complete the form:  Select the certificate authority and template created in the previous steps.    Use the same CN as used throughout this exercise.    Set validity to the same as the template.    Leave the SAN field empty.  
 
 Click Next to see a review of the certificate, then click Add to create the certificate. 
 
 
 



 Step 7: Create the client certificate 



<p>Repeat Step 6, creating a second private certificate for the client end of the connection.</p>



 Enable communication between Secrets Manager and the VPC services 



<p>For the VPN service to retrieve the keys from IBM Secrets Manager, we must enable communication between the two services. From the Cloud portal top bar, select Manage &gt; Access (IAM). This will display the following screen:</p>



Figure 5



 
 Select Authorizations from the left-hand menu. 



 On the displayed page, click Create. 



 Complete the Grant a service authorization form as per the following, then click Authorize: 
 



Figure 6



Figure 7



 Creating the VPN 



<p>Having created the certificate authority, you’ll now create the IBM Cloud VPN as a Service (VPNaaS) instance. From the Cloud portal, select Create resource and choose Client VPN for VPC. The provisioning menu will be displayed:</p>



Figure 8



 
 Ensure the Geography and Region are correct. 



 Choose a meaningful VPN server name. 



 Select a resource group to match your resource grouping strategy. 



 Select the VPC to which this VPN is being attached. 



 Set the client address pool CIDR (for testing we chose 192.168.8.0/22). 



 For testing, choose Stand-alone mode, which only requires a single subnet to be utilised. 



 For authentication, the default action is to use Secrets Manager and the instance name and key name can be selected from the drop-down lists provided. 



 Select the correct key for the server. 



 Select the correct key for the client end. 



 Use the default security group which will be pre-checked. 



 Change the Transport protocol to TCP. 



 Set Tunnel mode to Split tunnel. 



 Click the Create VPN server button. 
 



 VPN routing and security group 



<p>To complete the process, we need to ensure traffic is permitted and routed correctly. First, ensure that the attached security group permits inbound traffic. As configured above, we require an inbound rule allowing TCP from 0.0.0.0/0 on port 443.</p>



<p>Second, return to the VPN for VPC overview page and open the VPN server routes page. Create an entry containing the CIDR for the VPC subnet with an action of translate. Doing this will enable the VPN server to publish the private IP address range back to the client.</p>



 Client setup 



<p>Having configured the server, it is now necessary to install and configure a client such that a communication path can be established. The VPNaaS offering is based around OpenVPN, so an OpenVPN-compatible client is required. After installing the client, the configuration file can be downloaded by clicking the Download client profile link from the Clients page of the created VPN.</p>



<p>The client certificate can be downloaded from the Secrets Manager portal. Select Secrets from the left-hand menu and the download option under the three vertical dots in the right-most column of the Secrets screen, as shown in Figure 9:</p>



Figure 9



<p>The downloaded zip file contains both the client certificate and private key. Extract these and embed the contents into the client configuration file (ovpn) as follows:</p>



<p>The ovpn file has the following structure: </p>



Figure 10



<p>Edit the configuration (ovpn) file and add the following four lines after the line starting <code>#key</code>:</p>



 <code>&lt;cert&gt;
&lt;/cert&gt;
&lt;key&gt;
&lt;/key&gt;</code> 



<p>Using a text editor, copy the block of text beginning with <code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code> and ending with <code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code> from the client certificate file and paste it between the <code>&lt;cert&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/cert&gt;</code> lines.</p>



<p>Next, using a text editor, copy the block of text beginning with <code>-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----</code> and ending with <code>-----END PRIVATE KEY-----</code> from the client key file and paste it between the <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/key&gt;</code> lines.</p>



<p>Lastly, save the ovpn file, which is now in a form suitable for import into an OpenVpn client.</p>



 Get started 



<p>Having completed the configuration from OpenVPN Client to private VPC network using Secrets Manager authenticated VPN, it should be possible to access your server instances by their Private IP addresses, assuming the attached Security Groups permit the connection. Note that the source IP for the connection is the CIDR from the VPN tunnel, not the originating client as routing is set to translate.</p>

 While the global gambling industry holds its collective breath for the formal approval of Brazil’s regulatory framework, we investigate what operators can expect from Brazil’s upcoming gambling license structure… 



 



<p>Online gambling is already big business in Brazil, despite the absence of a fully regulated environment or licensing structure.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, while the industry <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">awaits final regulatory approval </a>on an online regulatory framework, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.</p>



<p>Brazil’s lack of online gaming and gambling regulations means Brazilian gamblers are either using foreign gambling platforms, or Brazilian-owned platforms headquartered abroad. It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (a projected $1.5 billion in 2023) and bring it back into the Brazilian economy.</p>



 History of Brazilian gambling regulation. 



<p>Gambling has enjoyed a long-standing place in the heart of Brazilian culture. Until the early 1940s, games of chance, like rolling dice, was a popular activity in Brazil until the then President introduced a blanket ban. The belief is that this was driven by his and his wife’s devout catholic views.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This remained in place until the 1970s, when state-owned lotteries were permitted to run. In the mid-1980s, betting on horseracing was allowed, and in 1993, the Zico Act legalized commercial bingo and slot machines. However, the 1998 Pele Act (no relation to the football star) revoked commercialized bingo, leaving only non-commercial games permissible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The only game that has remained legal in the Brazilian gambling market is poker, which has always been regarded as a game of skill rather than chance. Even now, poker remains completely unregulated, however this is likely to change with upcoming regulations.<br>In 2015, alongside the passing of <a href="https://thelawreviews.co.uk/title/the-gambling-law-review/brazil">Law No. 13,155</a>, virtual and land-based instant lotteries (sweepstakes) were created.</p>



<p>Discussions regarding the regulation of Brazilian sports betting regulations have been ongoing since 2018, when Congress authorized the federal government to regulate online sports betting. A four-year timeframe was set for the government to implement a licensing regime, which expired in 2022. It was then&nbsp; decided that the regulatory regime should go through Parliament as a legislative bill, not as an emergency measure by the Ministry of Finance.</p>



<p>Further steps toward legalizing and maintaining a safe regulation of gambling in Brazil began in March 2023, with the formation of <a href="https://abradie.com/en/">Associação Brasileira de Defesa da Integridade do Esporte (ABRADIE)</a>. ABRADIE is a not-for-profit company founded and run by a wide range of sports and gambling legislation experts to provide a safe and secure environment for those partaking in online gambling in Brazil. The organization’s mission is to ensure the new Brazilian gambling licensing structure protects all relevant parties from fraud and other nefarious practices that can run rampant through this particular industry.</p>



 



 

 



 The current legal framework. 



<p>The current legal framework regarding gambling laws in Brazil remains largely uncontrolled. The only legalized forms of gambling are through state-owned means such as lotteries, horse racing, or non-commercial bingo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under current Brazilian gaming jurisdiction, poker, fantasy sports betting, and games of skill are legal but have no governing regulatory bodies and therefore offer no protection from fraud or other activities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the increasing popularity of online gambling in Brazil has called into question the effectiveness and logic of the ban, as the existing laws did not cover the concept of online gambling. </p>



<p>In 2018, the first steps toward change were made when fixed-odds sports betting was legalized through state-controlled means, and in 2020, non-commercial bingo was legalized. Unlike games of chance, games of skill like Fantasy Sports betting are legal but completely&nbsp; unregulated. Games of chance remain entirely illegal. However, the Brazilian gambling licensing structure will undergo a significant overhaul, alongside proposed gambling laws, overseen by ABRADIE.</p>



 The road to regulation: Brazilian gambling licensing. 



<p>Brazilian gambling regulations will add security and governance, and also, of course, permit the formation&nbsp; of new domestic-based companies. In fact, one of the core factors driving the need for licensing is monetary. It is worth noting that Brazil’s surge in online gambling has coincided with the decline of the Brazilian economy, which has dropped from being the <a href="https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/03/04/world-biggest-economies/">world’s 7th largest economy to the 13th&nbsp; in just over a decade</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By introducing gambling permits and online betting licenses in Brazil, the authorities aim to cash in on the immense tax revenue potential.</p>



<p>Online gambling in Brazil is expected to grow by<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil"> around 20% by 2027</a>. These optimistic projections reinforce the importance and need for online gambling regulations and licensing practices in Brazil.</p>



 Categories of gambling licenses in the Brazilian licensing structure. 



<p>There is not one specific&nbsp; government agency that is responsible for issuing gambling licenses in Brazil. For example, the Secretariat for Competition Advocacy regulates lotteries and bingo events, while the Ministry of Agriculture regulates horse racing events. The formation of ABRADIE is the first step toward a comprehensive regulatory system that includes a comprehensive Brazilian gambling licensing structure.</p>



<p>The Ministry of Finance and ABRADIE will develop and regulate a licensing structure pending the finalization of the gambling regulations. This new structure will enforce<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/"> gambling compliance</a> and protect the industry from fraud and other illegal activities.</p>



 Eligibility and application process for Brazilian gambling licenses. 



<p>As there are currently no gambling licenses available in Brazil , there is no established eligibility criteria or application process. While the much-anticipated changes to the current laws will undoubtedly usher in new standards and application processes, nothing has been disclosed to hint at how this will work.</p>



 Compliance and regulatory standards. 



<p>A major challenge in opening up the Brazilian market to legalized gambling is to ensure the correct levels of compliance and protection are in place to keep everybody involved safe. While there are no such regulatory standards, the proposed Brazilian gambling licensing structure will be spearheaded by ABRADIE.</p>



<p>The key to establishing satisfactory regulatory compliance for Brazilian gambling will be to ensure that stringent fraud and anti-money laundering measures are in place. A vital part of this will be establishing strict and well-monitored checks for<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/"> fraud protection and identity proofing</a>.</p>



 Fees, taxation and revenue allocation. 



<p>While the Brazilian authorities currently enforce no taxation or revenue allocation requirements, the increasing likelihood of legislation changes has given rise to discussions on&nbsp; taxation rates. These discussions are <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/sportsbook/2023/05/25/ibjr-calls-for-a-rethink-on-brazils-betting-tax-and-licensing-demands/">being led </a>by the IBRJ (Brazil Institute for Responsible Gaming) who are calling for negotiations over the proposed high tax and license rates.</p>



<p>Below is the current proposed structure for licensed gambling operators by the Brazilian authorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rumored cost to obtain a gambling license will be <a href="https://igamingbrazil.com/en/legislation-en/2023/03/22/licenses-for-betting-sites-in-brazil-will-cost-brl-30-million/">BR$30 million</a> (US$6.1 million) per operator for five years. Operators that wish to qualify for a Brazilian gambling license must be headquartered in Brazil and have a minimum capital of <a href="https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2023/08/31/68571-deputy-arthur-lira-says-brazil-sports-betting-bill-set-to-be-approved-next-week">BR$100,000 (US$20,000) </a>At this time, there is no further information on whether there will be different tiers of license, depending on the different online gambling offerings.</p>



<p>Operators within the online gambling sector will be taxed at 18% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR), of which 10% will go directly into Brazil’s social security budget. A sub-fund will be set up as part of the National Fund for Public Security, which will receive 2.55% of the total tax revenue. This fund will ensure correct and effective measures are set up to combat money laundering, match-fixing, and other illegal activities that could threaten those working in the Brazil gambling market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For players, a proposed tax levy of 30% will be placed on any winnings over BR$2,112 (US$430).</p>



 Challenges and controversies. 



<p>Changing a country’s gambling laws and introducing new regulations for an already multi-billion dollar industry is understandably not without challenges, concerns, and controversies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the core concerns is the social impact of introducing a regulated Brazilian gambling licensing structure. The safety of players should be paramount to the Brazilian authorities. While legalizing gambling will open up the sector to increased numbers of operators and customers, it will also result in increased risk of fraud, match-fixing, and other fraudulent activities that could cause irreparable harm. Ensuring due attention is paid to creating and enforcing safety rules, and responsible gambling measures must come first and foremost in operators’ plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The economic boost created by gambling legislation in Brazil is understandably appealing for new and old operators alike. However, in the race to become licensed, it is important to strike a balance between maximizing profitability and ensuring the safety of all parties.</p>

 Successful gambling licensing models. 



<p>To introduce a successful gambling licensing model, the Brazilian authorities would be well served to study and learn from the experiences of other markets, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/canada/regulation-igaming-ontario/">Ontario</a> or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/malta-gaming-authority-mga/">Malta</a>, as well as the <a href="https://iagr.org/">International Association of Gaming Regulators (IAGR)</a>. The IAGR consists of representatives from gaming regulatory organizations throughout the world, including ABRADIE, which meet and exchange knowledge on best regulatory gaming practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/how-get-uk-gambling-licence/"> UKGC gambling licensing structure</a>&nbsp; [which is also going through major revisions to bring it up-to-date with the online gambling era] provides a fantastic framework for successful licensing regulation and is a good case study for the Brazilian gambling licensing process. A clearly defined application process is crucial, as ensuring the correct level of information is provided for acceptance and ongoing protection creates a bubble of safety that encourages growth and attracts new business.</p>

 Technological advancements and future legislation. 



<p>With the rapid advancement of technology and the global expansion of online gambling, the future presents both lucrative opportunities and dangerous pitfalls. It is therefore essential to establish clear licensing structures that address emerging risks, ensure user safety, and prevent system abuse.</p>



<p>The rise in online gambling in Brazil began amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and has caused a groundswell pointing toward highly sustainable growth for the foreseeable future. Early predictions show expected growth from $2.1 billion to <a href="https://www.delasport.com/brazil-igaming-market-report/">£2.6 billion by 2026</a>. Of course, the forecast is based on the current landscape, which has no comprehensive regulatory framework. By introducing a well-managed legislation and licensing structure, the future of gambling in Brazil is even brighter, and would significantly boost its dwindling economy.</p>



<p>The proposed changes and introduction of a Brazilian gambling licensing structure will see gambling legalized and regulated for the first time since the 1940s. This will open up a world of possibilities for the emergence of new Brazilian-based gambling companies. The market would become instantly more accessible while also bringing a level of safety to all involved.</p>



<p>Online gambling is huge in Brazil, with&nbsp; <a href="https://tgmresearch.com/gambling-sports-betting-market-research-in-brazil.html">86,43% of sports fans</a> admitting to using online betting services. The current lack of active legislation and licensing for gambling in Brazil means other countries benefit from Brazil’s keen interest in the iGaming market. Although the potential impact of Brazil formally and legally entering the gambling market will benefit the iGaming industry on a global scale, it will likely impact the markets of the individual countries’ and gambling jurisdictions who are currently collecting Brazilian online gambling traffic.</p>



 Navigating the complex web of Brazilian gambling licensing.

 Brazilian gambling license FAQs. 


 
 
 
 What types of gambling activities are allowed under the Brazilian licensing structure? 
 

<p>The only forms of permitted gambling under the Brazilian licensing structure are state-owned, such as lotteries and horse racing. No non-state-driven operators are allowed to be active in Brazil. However, changes are in the works, with a finalized plan to issue gambling licenses in Brazil going through a final ratification process. This will see the introduction of purchasable gambling licenses and the revocation of a law in place since the early 1940s.</p>

 
 
 
 How does Brazil’s taxation system for gambling operators work 
 

<p>The Brazilian taxation system for gambling operators works by taxing operators approximately 18% of their GGR. This taxation will be spread across several government funds, primarily the Social Security budget, with an additional portion being appropriated to help track and prevent fraud and other illegal activities within the newly regulated space.</p>

 
 
 
 What responsible gambling measures are in place to address gambling addiction? 
 

<p>Under the final gambling regulation drafts, all gambling or iGaming operators in Brazil must point out the dangers of gambling addiction. Additionally, those currently listed as under the control of credit protection agencies or those with a poor credit rating are still prohibited from gambling through Brazilian-based iGaming companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An extensive campaign stresses the importance of self-control and responsibility when gambling to prevent people from getting into trouble.</p>

 
 
 
 Are foreign entities eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil? 
 

<p>Yes, under the current proposal, foreign entities are eligible to apply for gambling licenses in Brazil. Under the new proposals for gambling permits in Brazil, both foreign and national operators will need to meet the same set of requirements that will be scrutinized by the Finance Ministry.</p>

 
 
 
 Does Brazil allow gambling? 
 

<p>For more than seven decades, Brazil has maintained a strict prohibition on the vast majority of gambling pursuits. Since the sweeping decree of 1941 that outlawed games of chance, the nation has permitted only two legal forms of gambling: state-controlled lotteries and wagering on horse racing events. To date, Games of chance remain entirely illegal. Nonetheless, the Brazilian gambling licensing framework is poised for a substantial transformation, aligning with impending gambling legislation and overseen by ABRADIE.</p>

 
 
 
 What is the legal gambling age in Brazil? 
 

<p>The Brazilian Civil Code classifies bets as contractual agreements, hence permitting only individuals aged 18 and older to engage in legal gambling activities.</p>

<p>Budgeting, an essential pillar of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/planning-budgeting-and-forecasting">financial planning</a> for organizations, often presents a unique dilemma known as the “Budgeting Paradox.” Ideally, a budget should give the most accurate and timely idea of anticipated revenues and expenses. However, the traditional budgeting process, in its pursuit of precision and consensus, can take several months. By the time the budget is finalized and approved, it might already be outdated.<br><br>In today’s rapid pace of change and unpredictability, the conventional budgeting process is coming under scrutiny.<br><br>It’s not about dismissing traditional budgeting. Far from it. It’s about recognizing that the world is changing faster than ever before. And while precision is crucial, agility is becoming equally, if not more, important. When the market changes or a new opportunity comes up, businesses need the flexibility to adjust their financial plans quickly. This is the “Budgeting Paradox.”</p>



 Understanding the Budgeting Paradox 



<p>The paradox of traditional budgeting is that the more time and effort spent creating a detailed annual budget, the quicker that budget might lose its relevance. While organizations gather data and undergo detailed reviews to craft a budget, the market doesn’t stand still. It continues to change, shaped by technological advancements, shifts in consumer preferences and new challenges. So, the very timeline devoted to creating an accurate budget might end up being its downfall.</p>



 Why budgeting feels like a marathon 



<p>Just like marathon training takes months of preparation, crafting a budget involves a lot of data collection, metrics analysis, resource allocation and collaboration. Here are some budgeting factors behind the long budgeting process:</p>



 Data management 



<p>From historic sales reports to projected revenue charts, collecting past, present and future financial data is time-consuming. This data helps us understand earlier trends and is vital for making a realistic budget.</p>



 Use of spreadsheets 



<p>While other formats exist, many organizations still heavily use spreadsheets for budgeting. They’re flexible but can cause errors, especially with large data sets or multiple people making edits. Collaborative efforts often lead to version control issues, slowing down the process.</p>



 Collaboration and review 



<p>Working with various departments to match their goals with the company’s takes teamwork. The first draft of the budget then goes through many reviews. It needs approval hierarchies and adjustments based on feedback from top-tier leadership. This results in exhaustive review cycles.</p>



 External factors and complex dynamics 



<p>Budgets must consider uncertain market changes and have backup plans. Negotiations and complicated financial models add depth and time to the budgeting process.</p>



 The downside of delays 



<p>In the world of financial planning, timing is crucial. Delays, which might seem like small hiccups, can shake the very foundation of an organization’s financial health and competitiveness. When the budgeting process takes too long, the data it’s based on might become less relevant. Even if there are good reasons for a long budgeting process, the consequences cannot be ignored.</p>



 Obsolete data and financial projections 



<p>A budget, at its core, is a financial forecast. If it’s based on old information, it won’t be accurate. Rapid changes in market conditions, interest rates and economic growth indicators can make a budget from just a month ago seem off. Big changes can happen in regulations or economic conditions while still preparing the budget.</p>



 Missed opportunities 



<p>A slow budget can mean missed opportunities and potential ROI left on the table.&nbsp;This slows down an organization’s ability to capitalize on new investment avenues or adapt to market shifts.</p>



 Unanticipated risks 



<p>Good budgeting plans for risks. Using an old budget can result in inadequate hedging strategies, poor financial decisions, exposure to unfavorable currency fluctuations or misjudged credit risks.</p>



 Balance: A way forward for financial planning and budgeting 



<p>The secret is to find a balance. Businesses need a budget that’s both carefully planned and time-flexible enough to be easily changed as needed. This means combining the old ways of budgeting with some new strategies to make sure teams are ready for whatever comes next.</p>



<p>To navigate the Budgeting Paradox, organizations are leaning towards more agile budgeting models like rolling forecasts and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-zero-based-budgeting/?c=IBM%20Planning%20Analytics">zero-based budgeting</a> with other strategies, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-integrated-business-planning-ibp/">integrated business planning</a>. By integrating the financial planning process with sales, the workforce and beyond, an organization ensures that the budget reflects both the larger strategic vision and the ground-level operational needs. This approach provides flexibility to adapt, aligning the budget closer to real-time market conditions.</p>



 Rolling forecasts 



<p>These are a dynamic alternative to traditional static annual budgets. Rolling forecasts offer a constantly updated look at future performance. As the market changes, businesses can adapt quickly and move resources where needed. For the best results, finance teams should use solutions especially designed for such regular forecasting.</p>



 Scenario planning 



<p>This involves the proactive creation of multiple budget versions, each for different possible future situations, be they optimistic, pessimistic or neutral. By having these different plans ready, businesses can navigate unexpected shifts, such as sudden regulatory changes or economic fluctuations. To ensure these scenarios remain actionable, they should be updated regularly based on&nbsp;the latest data and insights.</p>



 Embracing technology 



<p>The use of advanced solutions, ranging from AI-powered forecasting software to data analytics platforms, can make budgeting faster and smarter. They help speed up work, give quick insights from data and make teaming up across different departments easier.</p>



 How can technology help with the Budgeting Paradox? 



<p>The development of financial planning and analysis solutions has begun to redefine the landscape of budgeting. Advanced analytics solutions, driven by artificial intelligence, analyze historical data and offer predictive insights that predict future market trends with a level of precision previously unattainable. Now companies can be more proactive rather than only reactive.</p>



<p>Transitioning from familiar tools like Excel to advanced platforms can be daunting for financial professionals. Recognizing this, IBM Planning Analytics <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics/excel">integrates natively with Excel</a>. This integration allows users to tap into its advanced capabilities while retaining the comfort and flexibility of spreadsheets. It’s a best-of-both-worlds solution that eases the transition and amplifies the benefits of modern financial planning.</p>



 Real-time data integration 



<p>As seen in platforms like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics">IBM Planning </a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics">Analytics</a><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/planning-analytics">,</a> real-time data integrations ensures that budgets are always up to date. Since data from different sources is instantly merged and processed, delays become a thing of the past.</p>



 Collaborative features 



<p>The collaborative features make teamwork easy across departments, ensuring everyone stays accountable. Instead of endless emails and meetings, teams can work together instantly on one platform, ensuring alignment and speeding up budgeting. The workflow shows a clear, step-by-step guide for everyone. Guesswork is removed from forecasting highlighting which data points to focus on.</p>



 Scenario planning 



<p>The scenario planning capability allows businesses to draft for multiple market conditions — optimistic, pessimistic or neutral — and swiftly adapt their strategies if necessary. All the assumptions and the reasoning for these budget choices can be saved and viewed easily in comments, making decisions clear for everyone involved.</p>



 AI for forecasting 



<p>The IBM Planning Analytics platform taps into the power of AI for forecasting. Gone are the days of shooting in the dark or relying solely on historical data. With predictive algorithms built-in, the software offers detailed insights, allowing businesses to plan with more accuracy.</p>



<p>In essence, the solution to the Budgeting Paradox lies in embracing the very force that exacerbates it: change. By embracing technology, businesses can ensure their budgeting process is both detailed and agile for the short-term and long-term, perfectly equipped to navigate the unpredictable waters of the modern world.</p>

				  Indicio’s new open-source tool enables websockets to quickly manage large scale mediation without dropping messages  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Colton Watkins</p>
<p>Imagine the following&nbsp; scenario. It’s a Friday morning, the first day of a convention that only comes around once a year, and you’re extremely excited about attending. It’s one of the few yearly events that you’re willing to ask your boss for time off to attend. This year, the convention happens to be using a digital ticket system built on the new <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">Aries Framework</a> technology, and they’ve issued a virtual ticket to a mobile app on your phone. Because the technology is so new, you chose the app that the convention’s website recommended you download.</p>
<p>The new ticket system is supposed to make the entire process of checking in and getting your badge quicker and more convenient than ever before. There’s no need to rush to be early as the lines should be pretty short. Getting ready for the day ahead, you grab your phone, leave your hotel room, and head to the convention center.</p>
<p>The Problem</p>
<p>A short walk later, you make it to the convention center only to be greeted with slow moving lines. This new technology is supposed to be faster, so why are the lines moving as slow as or slower than the previous system?</p>
<p>Turns out, you weren’t the only one who went with the first phone app recommended to you on the convention’s website. Most everyone chose to do the same and, upon checking-in, the convention staff encountered issues retrieving the tickets from each person’s phone. The massive amount of people trying to enter the convention at the same time have overloaded the Mediator the app on their phone was using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Mediator is a service that allows software agents (such as those issuing or verifying credentials) to contact other agents that may not have a static IP address—such as mobile devices—or that may be behind a firewall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overloaded Mediator leaves&nbsp; the convention center&nbsp; struggling to communicate&nbsp; with conference attendee’s mobile wallets.</p>
<p>Introducing SocketDock</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a> is a new tool service created by Indicio that we’ve donated to the open-source community via the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>. In the world of fast and responsive technology, websockets are the go-to solution for quick and snappy applications; however, using websockets means that an online service needs to be able to maintain a continuous connection with the user’s application. Depending on the server architecture, this could spell bad news when it comes to creating clustered applications. A clustered application is when&nbsp; more than one server is used to service many more users than a single server can service on their own. In practice, there are many different ways to handle this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our scenario, if the mediation were to be clustered out to distribute the load, performance would increase and the slowdowns would disappear; however, we would then encounter an issue with missed messages. When the convention center asks you for your ticket, its system would send the request to one of the clustered mediators for your ticket information.&nbsp; But unless it&nbsp; talks to the same computer system that your phone happens to be connected to, the Mediator would have no idea where to send the message and it would be forced to store it for later retrieval — resulting in your phone needing to manually request the messages from the mediator. This is not a great user experience.</p>
<p>How can SocketDock Help?</p>
<p>When Mediators are running on multiple servers, messages to mobile agents need to be sent to the mediator server that the mobile agent is directly connected to. To get around this, we need to separate the websocket server from the Mediator’s application server. Doing so allows mediators to instantly forward messages to mobile agents without concern for which server an agent is connected to. That’s exactly what SocketDock was made to do. SocketDock can sit behind a load balancer, forwarding any messages that it receives to a mediation system (or any system that runs an HTTP/S server). When a message is forwarded to the mediator, extra information is included in the request informing the mediator as to where it can send replies to.&nbsp;<br>Now the convention staff can request your ticket from the mediator and the mediator doesn’t need to have an active connection to the mobile wallet. All it needs to know is which instance of SocketDock to send a message to, bringing back the speed and snappiness to the application and providing the user with a better experience. The lines leading to the convention center’s check-in stations should be moving a lot faster now that the mediator isn’t overloaded.</p>

				 <p>Where can I get SocketDock?</p>
<p>All of this sounds fine and dandy, but it’s not very useful unless it can be deployed in front of a clustered mediator system. Fortunately, all of the code is open-sourced over on GitHub in the Hyperledger organization, which you can find here: <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock</a></p>
<p>How can I get involved</p>
<p>If you’re looking to learn more about SocketDock, or how you can help out, there are multiple ways to get involved. You can do so by joining the discord or the weekly User Group/Working Group meetings. Links to both of these are on the Hyperledger website.<br><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries">https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/aries</a></p>
<p>Another way to help out is by submitting any issues that you may find or submitting pull requests to contribute fixes over at the SocketDock repository. While it may not seem like it, users of the technology can have a larger impact than they realize, so don’t be afraid to lend a hand.</p>

<p><a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">Generative AI</a> is powering a new world of creative, customized communications, allowing marketing teams to deliver greater personalization at scale and meet today’s high customer expectations. The potential of this powerful new tool spans the entire end-to-end marketing process, from internal communications and productivity to customer-facing channels and product support. In a May 2023 survey carried out by IBM and <a href="https://www.momentive.ai/en/">Momentive.ai</a>, 67% of CMOs reported that they plan on implementing generative AI in the next 12 months and 86% plan to do so within 24 months.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/consulting/ai-for-business">AI for business</a> has long been able to achieve multiple marketing functions: seamless connection across any platform or device, immediate response when experiencing issues and customization based on current location and purchase history. But generative AI solutions can provide new capabilities for customer-facing teams in marketing to provide even greater personalization at scale and improve employee skills and performance.</p>



<p>Enterprise marketing teams stand to benefit greatly from generative AI, yet introduction of this capability will require new skills and processes. According to the IBM survey, when CMOs were asked what they thought the primary challenges were in adopting generative AI, they listed three top concerns: managing the complexity of implementation, building the data set and brand and intellectual property (IP) risk.</p>



<p>With the right generative AI strategy, marketers can mitigate these concerns. The journey starts with sound data.</p>



 Generative AI needs the right data 



<p>As with all AI implementations, generative AI requires attention to sourcing and maintaining the underlying data. The familiar IT adage, “garbage in, garbage out,” still applies; high-quality data is essential to yield a high-quality result. If the training data is biased or incomplete, the models may generate inaccurate content.</p>



<p>For marketing in particular, generative AI can help with content development and audience targeting. Data curation is key, along with setting guardrails and supervision to address bias and ensure consistency of brand voice and accuracy of product and service information.</p>



<p>For example, a retail clothing company might use generative AI to customize email or online experiences tailored for different customer personas. The advanced capabilities of generative AI for text, visuals and video have the potential to create a more personalized and engaging experience. This might include a virtual model wearing outfits that match the customer’s body type, fashion choices and activities of interest. The generative AI tool can also incorporate external factors like weather, upcoming events or the shopper’s location.</p>



<p>But what if the generative AI tool recommends the customer buy a bathing suit in the middle of winter or a snow parka in the summer? Because various generative AI solutions are trained on large swaths of data, they have the capability to pull and interpret existing data incorrectly. Thus, the tool has the potential to provide unexpected results.</p>



<p>When an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-what-are-foundation-models-and-why-do-they-matter/">AI foundation model</a> generates off-topic or incorrect content, that behavior is referred to as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfqtFvWOfg0">hallucination</a>. To mitigate this scenario, teams must ensure they customize their models with proprietary datasets, rather than relying solely on open-source internet data.</p>



 Create a data-driven generative AI marketing strategy 



<p>Before your marketing organization can introduce effective generative AI solutions, you need a strategy to implement AI foundation models. Given the vast landscape of available data (both external and internal), it’s essential to define your use cases in advance of sourcing and training your models. Understanding the benefit and risk of each use case will help to create a step-by-step path that prioritizes the model training process.</p>



<p>Marketers also need to work closely with IT to align on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-architecture">data architecture</a> needed to securely build and deploy foundation models while following necessary protections for intellectual property and confidential data. The appropriate usage guardrails will help monitor and safeguard your IP and the integrity of your brand.</p>



 Generative AI needs human marketing teams 



<p>Once deployed, your generative AI data journey isn’t over. Foundation models are continually being refined as they interact with customers, collecting increasing amounts of data, which in turn improves their capabilities. Human supervision (such as supervised fine-tuning with human annotations and reinforcement learning from human feedback) is required to align the output of generative AI apps running on foundation models with human intentions, ensuring they are helpful, ethical and reliable.</p>



<p>Even though generative AI can produce customer-facing work that seems humanlike, it still requires a human guide with expertise in navigating ethical and legal concerns regarding data use. Human reviewers can also identify and correct any instances of bias or hallucination that could have seeped into the content.</p>



 Add generative AI to your marketing toolkit 



<p>In the IBM survey, CMOs cited content creation and editing, SEO and social media marketing as the top B2B use cases for generative AI capabilities.1 In regard to B2B marketing function, these leaders called out lead generation and sales nurturing as the top use cases.1</p>



<p>When asked about their biggest concerns regarding generative AI, leaders were focused on data accuracy, privacy management and having the skilled resources to build this solution.1 To that end, adopting generative AI technology requires a practical approach to build, test and learn about its capabilities. This will ensure that proprietary data is protected, customer experiences are relevant and rewarding, and the marketing process is streamlined and cost effective.</p>



<p>For decades, IBM has been at the forefront of AI for business. We provide solutions and services that help marketers implement generative AI responsibly and effectively. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx">Watsonx</a>, IBM’s enterprise-ready AI and data platform, is designed to help marketing and other business leaders confidently move into the generative AI arena.

<p>Embossed payment cards have been the industry standard since their inception in the 1950s, when point-of-sale terminals included carbon copy card imprinters. With growing innovation in payment card ecosystems, flat card formats are rapidly gaining momentum around the world, as financial institutions, issuers, and consumers recognize the value and opportunity they bring. Even though traditional embossing offers a robust, tactile look and feel, it continues to wane in popularity vs. newer trends. This evolution to an un-embossed card, or more commonly called flat card, continues to drive positive outcomes. In fact, a recent Entrust survey showed that 77% of issuers polled experienced higher transaction volumes after adopting flat cards. Let’s look at a few reasons un-embossed cards continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Aesthetic Appeal</p>
<p>Flat cards are, put simply, cool, hip, and trendy. They aren’t exactly new to the card issuance market, but they continue to dazzle consumers with a sleek, durable finish. In fairness, the acceptance of this alternative to embossing took time to adopt, as first impressions for some were that the “flatness” of these cards gave them a cheap feel. In hindsight, those first-generation flat cards used an identical design layout to their predecessors, giving the initial user interface a “substitution effect.” Account information and other personal identifiers were all located in the same place, but the embossed characters were absent, leaving consumers to question whether this switch was merely a cost consideration or sourcing exercise from their card issuer. Over the past few years though, banks, issuers, and marketers alike have flipped the script to shift paradigm with flat cards by trying new things to entice consumers. The result has been nothing short of demonstrable eye-popping design and card-orientation flexibility, giving flat cards top-of-wallet status today with a clean, modern look.</p>
<p>Brand-Building Opportunities</p>
<p>With the movement of personal information to the back of the card, the front has morphed into a blank canvas to bring a bank’s brand to life. Banks are even able to call out niche programs like eco-friendly, loyalty, or others that connect more meaningfully to consumers. In parallel, flat card designs offer an enhanced user experience (UX) by offering <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/central/financial-card/c/print-on-demand">print-on-demand</a> features like the ability to customize them with high-quality personal pictures directly printed onto a card (i.e., family portrait, kids, pets, sports, etc.). Additional options like vertical card orientation, stacked primary account number (PAN), and full edge-to-edge printing offer limitless opportunities to make the physical card experience exciting. Banks and consumers continue to connect with each other through these designs, while dynamic card verification value (CVV), embedded biometric sensors, and digital credentials also continue to surprise and delight customers throughout their financial credential journey.</p>
<p>Operational Efficiencies</p>
<p>Bureaus and card issuers continue to see shifts to flat card technology as their customers incorporate new requirements to capitalize on these enhanced benefits. In a recent Entrust survey, 60% of card-issuance respondents cited increased efficiency and/or reduced cost as a primary driver for switching to flat cards, in addition to market demands. As the scale of flat cards continues to ramp, so will operational gains, eventually leading to its place at the top of the preferred issuance technology list.</p>
<p>Overall, flat cards offer more flexibility and operational efficiency. Card marketers can simply go further with design, customization, and UX, and consumers like the look and feel of flat card technology. Banks can leverage flat card benefits to go further with top-of-wallet status, and issuers are citing improvements in their operating expenses.</p>

<p>In May 2023, Utah’s Governor <a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Spencer</a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/"> </a><a href="https://governor.utah.gov/">Cox</a> appointed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">Steve</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown"> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccown">McCown</a> (Chief Architect, <a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>) to serve on the state’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC). The PPOC was created in 2021 by the Utah State Legislature (see <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>) in order to develop guiding standards and best practices for protecting personal data and to work directly with the Chief Privacy Officer to have those standards and practices adopted by government entities.</p>



 What is the Personal Privacy Oversight Commission (PPOC)? 



<p>The PPOC is comprised of twelve representatives from industry and government who collectively have expertise in cybersecurity, information technology, operational technology, law enforcement, data privacy law, civil liberties law, and prosecutorial / appellate law. Each of the members has been appointed by either the governor, state auditor, or the attorney general.</p>



<p>Government entities are required to collect, use, and share some personal data in order to provide public services. However, all processing of personal data by public entities must be done in a manner that protects privacy rights. Privacy and security principles and best practices must guide the way.</p>



<p>Utah has a pioneering history in privacy and security. In 1862, legislators in the Territory of Utah introduced the nation’s first communications privacy and security law, entitled An Act For the Regulation of the Telegraph, and to secure Secrecy and Fidelity in the transmission of Telegraphic Messages (<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Acts_Resolutions_and_Memorials_Passed_by/Y2xLAQAAMAAJ">source</a>). Passed in January 1863, this forward-thinking law also established the legal standing and privacy requirements for electronic “Contracts”, “power of attorney”, “payment or delivery of money”, etc. when delivered by telegraph. Codifying a variation of e-commerce in the 1800s is pretty forward thinking!</p>



 Modern Challenges in Data Privacy 



<p>The expanding use of digital services experienced over the last few decades has changed the landscape for privacy and how it must be protected. Like most other governments, Utah’s data privacy and security practices grew organically in a time when personal privacy threats were rare and difficult to identify. Utah is responding to changing times, just as it did in 1862, by investing in proactive efforts to protect privacy rights. Rather than simply enacting data breach penalties, Utah is demonstrating a special concern for “the privacy implications and civil liberties concerns of the privacy practices of government entities” (<a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2021/bills/static/HB0243.html">H.B. 243</a>).</p>



<p>In June 2023, Utah’s Office of the Legislative Auditor General published a report entitled “<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_RPT.pdf">A Performance Audit of the Collection, Protection, and Use of Personal Information by State Agencies</a>” (<a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_SMRY.pdf">summary</a>, <a href="https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2023-07_PRSNT.pdf">slides</a>). Leading up to this report, the state conducted a statewide self-audit and found numerous different data collection policies and handling procedures. Given the current and emerging threats to personal data, the reported found that “current data collection and sharing practices create data privacy risk.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to protect the personal data collected and held by state agencies, the report recommends “defining data privacy in statute for all state agencies” and “requiring government entities to adopt data privacy principles that include items such as: clear consent, notice, and the disclosure of data collection, use, and sharing”. The report went on to recommend that “Statutory data privacy guardrails could alleviate the risk.”</p>



 Privacy Guardrails: Defining the Future 



<p>What are the “privacy guardrails”? That is the central focus of what is being created in the very near-term. Defining and proposing specific actions and requirements is currently underway and is expected to include a cohesive combination of legislation, policy, and training, together with leading technologies and technology standards.</p>



<p>Utah’s efforts are not only vital to the protection of Utahans’ data but are foreseen to provide an example or blueprint for other states and governments to follow. The work of the PPOC gives the state government important insights from experts in several key legal and technology domains, which will ensure that Utah’s solution meets the state’s technical and legal requirements. Utah’s privacy efforts are expected to provide far reaching benefits to government and private organizations globally. Anonyome Labs is proud to support Steve McCown as he serves as a member of Utah’s Personal Privacy Oversight Commission.</p>

 Platform solution fights underage gambling and bonus abuse, while preventing money laundering 



<p>Munich, September 5, 2023 – IDnow, a leading identity proofing platform provider, announces the integration of the Brazilian CPF database check (Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas, Register of Natural Persons) into its multi-dimensional identity proofing and fraud prevention solution.</p>



<p>IDnow’s platform solution combines the new CPF database checks with automated document liveness capabilities, fully automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money-Laundering (AML) services, the latter of which screen against multiple global Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) and Sanction lists. To detect single and serial fraud attempts, IDnow’s platform uses proprietary fraud prevention technology that collects risk signals from biometrics, documents, devices and other data sources.</p>



<p>Issued by the Brazilian Federal Revenue Department, the CPF document provides name, date of birth, and situation of CPF, among others, and is needed to vote, enter university, or go into politics in Brazil. The newly added CPF checks provide an additional layer of identity assurance from a trusted, federal source within the IDnow onboarding process.</p>



<p>In addition to the CPF, Brazilian citizens carry numerous kinds of paper-based documents with no standardized or centralized ID scheme from the federal government. Historically, this has made the automation of document proofing challenging. IDnow’s new solution addresses this problem head-on.</p>



<p>“We have collaborated with government and industry experts to ensure our solution delivers high automation for Brazil’s paper-based documents, in addition to an integration with the CPF database. This provides <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/south-america/">holistic, scalable identity assurance to Brazilian gaming and gambling operators</a>. When designing our solution for the Brazilian market, we quickly realized that without the additional security step of the CPF checks, it would be easy for fraudsters to forge documents. Out of all document proofing solutions, IDnow’s is one of the only ones to implement this check into its document verification process without any extra costs to the operator. KYC should never be a burden, but an enabler and we will continue to focus on that for our customers and players”, explains Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow.</p>



<p>Seamlessly verify age and protect players, platform, brand and reputation</p>



<p>In light of <a href="https://igamingbusiness.com/legal-compliance/brazil-sports-betting/">the recent move of the Brazilian government to regulate sports betting</a>, the market is expected to grow further while operators will be looking for fully compliant solutions that stop money laundering and other financial crime in its tracks.</p>



<p>Redfearn-Tyrzyk explains: “One of the goals of the new regulation is to make sports betting safer for players and platforms by preventing fraud and underage gambling. IDnow’s automated solution with the integrated CPF checks can stop and protect underage individuals from engaging in gambling while still enabling a seamless and efficient onboarding that balances consumer demands for security and privacy without adding friction to their journey. Thanks to our high level of automation and orchestration, gambling providers can drive conversions and increase operational efficiencies while adhering to the new gambling regulations.”</p>



<p>An operator in the online gaming industry,&nbsp;<a href="https://eyasgaming.com/">Eyas Gaming</a>, is already partnering with IDnow in the Brazilian market. Andrejs Cuzans, Head of Fraud, Risk and Payments of Eyas Gaming, says: “Some new players who wish to sign up will go through an automated, AI-based document verification process. After having successfully partnered with IDnow in New Zealand, Eyas is expanding the collaboration to Latin America, by relying on the wide document coverage that IDnow provides.”</p>

			 Marçal Torà is a Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Marçal Torà, and I was born and raised in Barcelona. Before the age of 6, I always said, “when I am older, I want to be a firefighter!” — my father “ruined” that when he gave me a computer. From that moment on, I began experimenting with it in every possible way; I would install viruses disguised as regular software and then ask for his help to remove them. Then, at some point, I started playing online video games that were infested with cheaters, which led me to learn programming languages so that I could write my own, secure code and have a fair chance against them.</p>
<p>Being exposed to computers and technology at such a young age sparked a profound interest in me, and I was soon convinced that writing code was more interesting than extinguishing fires. I even forgot about video games completely to focus solely on personal projects. Later on, after finishing mandatory studies, I enrolled in a vocational degree program to continue learning in this field, and that’s how I became a Software Developer.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny, and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I was part of an emerging startup in Edinburgh. It is a very small team of four members, working on building an ad-free, privacy-preserving search engine. Working in such a recently-established and small company was enjoyable because we had a lot of freedom to shape the product to our liking.</p>
<p>At the time, however, I was looking for a change and came across an employment opportunity at Tokeny. I read about their modern and familiar tech stack, mission, and involvement in cutting-edge blockchain technologies. Since I have a keen interest in machine learning, cryptocurrencies, and blockchain, I was very interested in getting involved in a project like this. So, I reached out to Xavi, Head of Product, and on the day of my birthday, we had our first introductory call.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fantastic! Working at Tokeny is an authentic definition of WFH (Work From Home)! Although there is an office in Luxembourg and a co-working space in Barcelona, most of the time, everybody works in silence from their homes. The traditional physical office has been reduced to Slack, which suits all our communication needs.</p>
<p>It’s certainly good to see each other once in a while, so if you happen to be around the aforementioned cities, you have the option to meet up with some of the other members of the company. However, not needing to work in a physical office gives you the freedom to organize your day according to your personal needs while also managing to complete all your tasks by the end of the day!</p>
<p>I am very happy to be here, surrounded by other committed individuals who are making a shared vision a reality.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p></p>
<p>To be honest, I enjoy what I do — writing code. However, over the years, I’ve come to realize that there is nothing like the outside world, nature, sports, or anything that brings a sense of well-being. To me, one of the best ways to spend my time nowadays is outdoors. I have become very passionate about doing a little bit of everything: running, cycling, swimming, and in the warmer seasons, I tend to do hikes around the region, whereas in winter, I exchange that with ski mountaineering.</p>
<p>Engaging in so many disciplines is challenging but fun and entertaining. It has also revealed a lot about myself and made me more conscious of how I treat my body because injuries are setbacks, but they also force you to learn more about the anatomy of the body to find ways to overcome them.</p>
<p>It’s not all about sports and nature. One also needs to rest and nourish oneself properly, both physically and mentally. In the last few years, I have been learning a lot about nutrition and neuroscience, respectively. In summary, I would say that these topics have become my biggest interests, and my greatest passion has been putting all this knowledge into practice.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I would love to learn a language, travel to its country of origin, and sound like a native. This would be a dream come true and a very fulfilling experience!</p>
 What excites you about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>Being part of a relatively small-sized company that has already become the leader in the industry is very exciting in itself! I think that we are all aware that Tokeny is bringing a unique and disruptive infrastructure solution for public markets. Besides, its standard, the ERC3643, has already become the industry standard for permissioned tokens and digital assets. It’s only a matter of time before traditional public markets migrate to the public blockchain, either by using the standard or by contracting our solutions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Operational Technology is comprised of the hardware, software, and networks that actuate, control, monitor, and analyze physical processes, machines, and infrastructure used in various industries such as manufacturing, transportation, health care, power generation and distribution, pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, water treatment, etc. OT encompasses multiple categories including Critical Infrastructure Systems (CIS) for civil and national interests, such as power generation and distribution, traffic control, water treatment, etc.; Industrial Control Systems (ICS) such as SCADA nodes, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) that are in used in manufacturing, warehouses, pharmaceutical, agricultural, transportation, and oil and gas industries; and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), which include commoditized IP-enabled sensors that are commonly used in CIS and ICS environments today.</p>
<p>OT systems face cybersecurity threats that are different from enterprise IT because the equipment, software, and communications protocols used in these areas are often not the same as found in IT environments. However, given the push for Digital Transformation and the benefits it offers, many OT-deploying organizations have connected ICS, IIoT, and even CIS networks to their IT infrastructure and cloud services. Moreover, many organizations have deployed common enterprise IT hardware and software as well as commoditized Internet of Things (IoT) devices (such as temperature and lighting sensors, Wi-Fi cameras within their OT networks. This opens these OT environments, some of which had been physically air-gapped previously, to the ever-evolving threat landscape of IT.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, enterprise IT departments have developed management hierarchies for handling their sprawling technology estates. However, some organizations that have OT assets have not integrated OT management, particularly security, into that enterprise IT management array. In most cases, there are historical reasons for this separation of duties.</p>
<p>Why IT and OT are often not aligned at the enterprise level</p>
<p>Power utility companies: These organizations have highly specialized and critical OT hardware and software. In some jurisdictions, regulations mandate logical and physical separation of OT assets from the enterprise. Different teams have managed the OT and IT environments, and to this day their reporting structures are not combined. They may have different budgets and even different security policies.</p>
<p>Conglomerates with autonomous or semi-autonomous business units: Companies that have acquired others but without strong centralization of IT (not to mention OT) very often leave most of the management and infrastructure as it was prior to the acquisition. This means that there may be multiple CIOs and CISOs as well as OT security managers, and little impetus for alignment of security technologies and policies.</p>
<p>Security and safety: IT security departments seek to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and assets. Organizations with OT must also maximize human safety, which means that OT equipment must fail-safe to prevent worker injuries, prevent contamination of products and services, ensure national security, and protect the public at large from catastrophic incidents. These objectives may sometimes compete with enterprise IT policies; therefore enterprise IT security and OT security remain distinct in some of these organizations. For examples of security solutions for ICS, see our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80913/cybersecurity-for-industrial-control-systems">Market Compass</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), in their special publication <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-82r2.pdf">NIST SP800-82r2 Guide to Industrial Control Systems Security</a> (p. 45), states that:</p>
<p>The information security team should report directly to the information security manager at the mission/business process or organization tier, who in turn reports to the mission/business process manager (e.g., facility superintendent) or enterprise information security manager (e.g., the company’s CIO/CSO), respectively. Ultimate authority and responsibility rests in the Tier 1 risk executive function that provides a comprehensive, organization-wide approach to risk management. The risk executive function works with the top management to accept a level of residual risk and accountability for the information security of the ICS.</p>
<p>Though NIST recommends that ICS security responsibilities bubble up to enterprise CISOs, that is largely not the case in many enterprises with OT (of which ICS is a subset), as reflected in the <a href="https://www.fortinet.com/content/dam/maindam/PUBLIC/02_MARKETING/08_Report/report-2022-ot-cybersecurity.pdf">Fortinet 2022 State of Operational Technology and Cybersecurity Report</a> (p. 9), which states that only 15% of organizations with OT have the security responsibility aligned through the enterprise CISO.</p>
<p>Aligning enterprise IT and OT security is certainly a best practice for risk management, considering the increasingly blurry lines of demarcation between the types of technology. Combining IT and OT security at the enterprise risk management level as well as at the technical integration levels present opportunities for synergies that can increase the overall cybersecurity posture of organizations with OT.</p>
<p>Recommendation: Enterprises with OT components must begin the journey toward centralizing security policies, technologies, and management under the purview of enterprise CISOs.</p>

			<p>4th September, Luxembourg, and Seoul – Tokeny, the global leading tokenization platform, announces its strategic alliance with Klaytn Foundation, an EVM-compatible public blockchain developed by the renowned Korean IT giant, Kakao. This strategic alliance is set to catalyze the widespread adoption of Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, empowering the Asian markets to embrace this cutting-edge financial evolution. A number of RWA projects relating to commodities, accounts receivables, and more are already live or in development on Klaytn.</p>
<p>The cornerstone of this partnership lies in the provision of a seamless infrastructure for companies to effortlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized RWAs via Klaytn’s robust network. Tokeny’s state-of-the-art tokenization platform adheres to the industry-standard ERC3643 for RWA tokenization, ensuring compliance and interoperability.</p>
<p>Diverging from the world of cryptocurrencies, fractionalizing RWAs requires issuers to establish investment vehicles, holding these assets. By issuing financial instruments such as shares or debts of the vehicles, issuers enable investors to participate in the RWA investment opportunities. Tokenized RWAs are the representation of these financial instruments on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The complexity arises from the necessity to enforce compliance on the blockchain with existing regulations. This entails that only investors meeting predetermined criteria can qualify as asset owners, thereby mandating rigorous adherence to the stipulated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements.</p>
<p>Tokeny’s platform elegantly resolves this intricate challenge by leveraging the ERC3643 token standard. Through reusable digital identities and verifiable credentials, this standard ensures that only qualified investors can engage in transactions involving tokenized RWAs. Their platform has been used to tokenize more than $28 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    RWA tokenization is rapidly gaining traction in the Asian market. Drawing from our six-year track record in Europe, we are thrilled to collaborate with Klaytn, extending our expertise to Asia to simplify the capital market through tokenization. As digitization takes center stage in Asia, in line with the efficiency seen in other aspects of daily life, investors are demanding real-time and user-friendly financial services. The time is ripe for Asian issuers to seize this market opportunity, and we're eager to accelerate their market entry with our platform, enabling them to retain current clients and attract new ones.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny       In the world of RWA tokenization, ERC3643 reigns as the paramount standard. It is the catalyst that propels us towards a token-centered economy, where compliance harmonizes with interoperability. As this standard sweeps the industry across the globe, we're determined to extend its reach within our community, forging a new era for tokenization. Tokeny takes the center stage, an enabler that propels the Asian market into an era of massive adoption, meticulously crafting the most comprehensive platform atop this very standard.  Sam SeoRepresentative Director of Klaytn Foundation

Their shared goal transcends complexities, aiming to make value transfer as effortless as an e-commerce experience. Together, they forge an ecosystem that thrives on real-time interaction, peer-to-peer transactions, unwavering transparency, and seamless interoperability—a visionary financial realm sculpted by RWA tokenization.</p>

  <p>On July 11, 2023, we introduced <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-expands-into-security-service-edge-with-two-new/ba-p/3847829">Microsoft’s identity-centric security service edge (SSE) solution</a> and two new services: Microsoft Entra Private Access and Microsoft Entra Internet Access, which are now in public preview. In this blog, we take a deeper look into Microsoft&nbsp;Entra Private Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Traditional network security stacks and legacy VPNs are no longer sufficient</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional network security approaches that use legacy VPNs simply cannot scale to modern demands. Once your remote users connect to your corporate network through VPN, they are granted excessive access to your entire network, all it takes is a single compromised user account, infected device, or open port for an attacker to gain entry, move laterally, and access your most critical assets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access, an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), reduces the operational complexity and cost of legacy VPNs, while eliminating excessive access and preventing lateral movement. It modernizes access to private applications and resources, helping users quickly and easily connect to private applications from any device and any network, whether they’re at home, remote, or in their corporate office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What makes Private Access unique&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of Microsoft’s SSE solution, Private Access is built on Zero Trust principles. It verifies every user and enforces least privilege, giving users access only to the private applications and resources they need. Private Access significantly expands Entra ID Application Proxy capabilities in Microsoft Entra to a complete ZTNA solution that shares the same connectors but offers so much more, it helps you simplify and secure access to any private resource on any port, and protocol. You can apply policies that enable secure, segmented, and granular access to all your private applications in your corporate network, on-premises, or in the cloud. For customers already using Application Proxy, they can seamlessly transition to Private Access – all existing use-cases and access to existing private web applications would continue to work with no disruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create and enforce per-app, least privilege access controls based on the granular Conditional Access policies that are enriched with context about users, devices, and their locations. You can also terminate ongoing sessions in response to anomalies or changes in user context or device health. For example, if a user connects from one part of the world and then immediately connects from another part of the world (what we call “impossible travel"), you can enforce re-authorization or step up to a stronger authentication method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Access enables secure access to any application, on-premises or cloud-based, and it works across any port or protocol, including RDP, SSH, SMB, FTP, and anything else that uses TCP or UDP. In addition, you can enable single sign-on (SSO) using SAML or http headers or even legacy Kerberos authentication for both web and non-web applications, without making any changes to those applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Private Access delivered from one of the largest global private networks, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/microsoft-global-network">Microsoft global network</a>, your private applications are not only more secure, but your employees can also access them faster compared to legacy VPNs. The unmatched scale and vast global network edge presence enables you to optimally connect your users and devices to private resources, especially those who work in a hybrid or remote work environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Secure access to all private applications, for users anywhere, with an identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Private Access key capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Private Access can help you enable secure access to all your private applications and resources. Key capabilities include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access. Replacing legacy VPNs with an identity-centric ZTNA minimizes the risk of implicit trust and lateral movement. Using Quick Access, you can easily configure broad private IP ranges and fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to quickly enable identity-centric, Zero-Trust-based access to all private resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Fast and easy migration from legacy VPNs with Quick Access</p>
<p> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications. With Private Access, you can create Conditional Access policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that require modern authentication for accessing any private application, even those using legacy protocols such as Kerberos and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). This brings policies based on the sensitivity of the application, level of user risk, network compliance, and so forth to legacy applications. For example, you can easily require multi-factor authentication (MFA) and device compliance checks for users trying to access remote desktop (RDP), secure shell (SSH) or SMB applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Enhanced identity-centric security controls for all private applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automatic private application discovery and onboarding. You can discover private applications, including existing App Proxy private web applications, whether the applications are hosted locally in a private network, in an on-premises data center, or in the cloud.&nbsp; You can then onboard them to Microsoft Entra ID, group them, and define granular access policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Automatic private application discovery and onboarding</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Granular segmented application access. Instead of granting remote users access to your entire network, as traditional VPNs do, you can define granular segmented access policies for each application or group of applications based on user, device, or processes running on the endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 6: Granular segmented application access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intelligent local access. Employees need a consistent security posture whether they’re accessing private applications remotely or on-premises. The intelligent local access capability enables fast and seamless ZTNA for users, whether they’re within the corporate network or connecting remotely from anywhere outside corporate network boundaries. For example, a user while on the corporate network can connect to on-premises private applications such as RDP or SMB while CA policies such as MFA are still enforced, and application traffic remains local on the corporate network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Intelligent local access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with Entra Private Access&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">Global Secure Access</a> (preview) is the centralized location in the Microsoft Entra admin center where you can configure and manage Microsoft Entra Private Access. Remote workers don't need to use a VPN to access these resources if they have the Global Secure Access Client installed. The client quietly and seamlessly connects them with the resources they need. The most current version of the client can be downloaded from the Microsoft Entra admin center. You can install the client interactively, silently with the /quiet switch, or use mobile device management platforms like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-app-management">Microsoft Intune to deploy</a> it to their devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>QuickAccess makes it very easy to get started with a minimum configuration for Private Access, especially when you are planning to move from legacy VPN to ZTNA. After completing <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/global-secure-access/how-to-get-started-with-global-secure-access">initial configurations</a>, and once you deploy a connector agent on-premises, to enable quick access all you need to do is specify the IP address, IP address range, or FQDN and port number. You can then assign specific conditional access policies, which QuickAccess applies to ALL app segments you configured. For example, you can create a “myRDP app” and assign it an IP address-based app segment. You only need to provide a name for the private app, then select the connector you wish to use with the app, and then specify the IP address/range and port number. You can then access your destination by simply launching an RDP session from your remote client machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

   Most organizations house their non-employees and non-humans in their identity junk drawer: The contractor with the two-month assignment, the new third-party partner you’re starting business with, the consultant that requires a lot of access, an RPA with assigned privileges, the seasonal help hired around the holidays.

<p>This month, we're joined by the founders and organizers of Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences. <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/about.html">Strange Loop</a> was founded by Alex Miller in 2009 and is regarded as one of the most prestigious multi-disciplinary tech conferences. Strange Loop talks span both academia and industry, covering a range of topics, including emerging languages, alternative databases, distributed systems, security, AI, the web, and more. </p><p>Papers We Love is a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> of academic computer science papers and a <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/wiki/Creating-a-PWL-chapter">community</a> that loves reading them. Organized by Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, Papers We Love was a collection of local meetups until it joined forces with Strange Loop as part of the pre-conference programming a few years ago.</p>     EP02: In Conversation: Strange Loop and PWL Organizers  0:00 /60:02 1×   <p>In this episode, you'll hear:</p>  How Strange Loop and Papers We Love conferences got their start  How having a background outside of computer science helps to gain perspective on new ways to explore technology  How opportunity grants have left a positive impact on both recipients and the Strange Loop Conference itself  Alex's thoughts on the future of conferences, including why he's bullish on hybrid conferences  <p>Here's a glance at the episode...</p>  [2:00] Alex Miller created Lambda Lounge, a meetup for folks interested in functional programming, dynamic languages, and no-SQL databases. He regularly had 50-100 people in attendance and realized he could turn it into a conference. The first Strange Loop had 300 attendees!  [4:30] David Ashby shares how he, Zeeshan, and Darren came together to read academic papers in New York City and started to get requests from folks in other cities who wanted to replicate what they were doing locally. Hence, the Papers We Love chapters were born! The number of chapters in existence at one time was 30.  [10:56] Alex shares his marketing strategy for Strange Loop, where he began with the Lambda Lounge audience and initiated a more grassroots effort to raise awareness.   [15:20] Alex talks about how he became acquainted with the Papers We Love crew and how it became part of the pre-conference track of Strange Loop.  [16:45] Zeeshan explains how Strange Loop was his first exposure to people from academia talking about obscure programming languages and how it inspired PWL.  [19:00] David shares how none of the PWL team had a background in computer science but rather came from the humanities. This drove them to read computer science papers to better understand their field. Alex expands on this by talking about technology's implications in various other disciplines, which is often something technologists forget about. They are so focused on solving interesting problems that they sometimes can't see the forest through the trees.  [32:30] Alex talks about how the Strange Loop opportunity grants started and the impact their recipients have had on the conference over the years.  [43:16] Alex talks about the emerging hybrid model for conferences and how it can help build community while reducing climate impact.  [46:40] Alex shares why he's sunsetting Strange Loop.   [53:40] Boris talks about unconference-style conferences  <p>Listen to the podcast embedded above, or head to our <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/podcast">podcast landing page</a> to subscribe to the podcast on your preferred platform.</p> Episode Links and Shoutouts: <p><br>Co-Host: Boris Mann - CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Organizer of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a></p><p>Co-Host: Zeeshan Lakhani - Staff Research Engineer at <a href="https://fission.codes/">Fission</a>, Member of <a href="https://www.causalislands.com/">Causal Islands</a> Programming Committee</p><p>Causal Islands Theme Song by <a href="http://depatchedmode.xyz/">depatchedmode</a></p><p>Editing by Becky Vazquez</p><p>Guests: Alex Miller, Founder of <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html">Strange Loop Conference</a>, and Zeeshan Lakhani, Darren Newton, David Ashby, and Chas Emerick, organizers of <a href="https://paperswelove.org/">Papers We Love Conference</a>.</p><p>Additional Links:</p>  <a href="https://theorizingtheweb.tumblr.com/">Theorizing the Web</a>  <a href="https://www.polyglotsoftware.com/">Polyglot Conference</a>  <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691208480/you-are-not-expected-to-understand-this">"You Are Not Expected to Understand This"</a>  <a href="https://github.com/bridgethillyer">Bridget Hillyer</a>  <a href="https://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a>

 Tokeny becomes the 1st tokenization platform to achieve SOC2 Type I Compliance 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in August 2023.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>In the dynamic financial landscape, trust with your stakeholders and users is the lifeline of any successful organization. With fraud and theft in the blockchain space experiencing high activity, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure the security of users’ privacy and confidential data. While many companies advocate for their security and protection measures, without third-party validations, the true integrity of a tech stack remains uncertain.</p>
<p>At Tokeny, we always took security at heart, starting with the evaluation of our software solutions and, today, with the audit of our whole organization.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that we have achieved SOC2 Type I compliance, making us the pioneering tokenization platform in the world to earn this esteemed certification.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with SOC2, this report recognizes Tokeny’s commitment to creating the secured enterprise-grade solution that the market deserves. After a careful review conducted by a third-party independent auditor, we can now confidently prove that all of our departments have the procedures in place to meet the security requirements of the financial markets including:<br>
<br>
HR (from recruitment to employee management), Production (change management, code security, release management, etc), IT (privacy controls and asset classification), Customer Success Management (BCP and DRP regularly tested, incident communication management).</p>
<p>In this review, we had no less than 99 security controls carefully reviewed amongst all departments making Tokeny the most secure tokenization platform on the market, allowing us to not only bring trust and confidence through our products and services, but also by the way we manage the company.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The standards and guidelines were provided by <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/interestareas/frc/assuranceadvisoryservices/aicpasoc2report">The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA),</a> an organization that has been involved in the public interest for over 136 years.</p>
<p>Obtaining this report was only the first step towards the “Security and Compliance” pillar of our Technological Strategy, with plans to go even further than this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we are aiming to get ISO27001 certified in the coming months, completing the controls from SOC2 and making Tokeny even more secure. Then we will be pushing for the SOC2 Type II certification, confirming that all the hard work that has been done for the Type I report has been efficiently implemented next year.</p>
<p>Thank you for trusting us on this journey. We remain dedicated to advancing the frontier of secure, compliant, and efficient financial solutions in the digital age.</p>

			<p>The tokenization industry has seen interest blossom over the last few years, with many key financial incumbents jumping on the bandwagon. It unfortunately took longer than ideal, but that’s expected as some of the ‘low-hanging fruit’ blockchain use cases like NFTs and cryptocurrencies were in the limelight initially,</p>
<p>Once institutions finally understood the powerful ‘weapon’ that blockchain can be for their infrastructure, it didn’t take long to begin to experiment and engage with leading experts in the field</p>
<p>Prominent entities such as Invesco, KKR, Hamilton Lane, Aberdeen, Franklin Templeton, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of China, BlackRock, and more are now active participants in the tokenization space – a shift that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the first movers were small issuers tokenizing as a way to either fundraise and expand their investor base or to tokenize their existing cap table, but now everyone is seeing the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>In fact, Boston Consulting Group, anticipates that up to $16T of illiquid assets could be tokenized and unlocked by 2030.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is that according to a report from Bain &amp; Co, the real estate industry alone has a global value of approximately $330T.</p>
<p>In this two-part interview series conducted by CMS, Daniel Coheur, our Chief Commercial Officer had the pleasure to further expand and provide insights on the current status of the tokenization industry and where we are heading:</p>

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 1:</p>
 
 The momentum is building fast for tokenization 
 Smaller jurisdictions have been pioneering an attractive regulatory framework with larger jurisdictions lagging behind 
 The fraudulent actors have only shed more light on the opportunity to enforce compliance on-chain 
 Blockchain applied to real-world assets and securities is extremely powerful 
 

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>Main takeaways from part 2:</p>
 
 Institutions are moving from private chains to public ones&nbsp; 
 Tokenization isn’t as sexy as AI but it’s the essential ‘plumbing’ necessary to transform our financial system 
 AI and blockchain have potential to complement each other very well 
 How we tackle blockchain complexities for massive adoption

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF.

To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF53 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>We have an important update to provide on MS Graph Device Registration Policy resource type currently in preview and available in beta API version. We are making some changes to resource type properties that introduce breaking changes. These changes are expected to happen in the week of September 25, 2023. To ensure continued support and functionality, and minimize impact, it’s very important that all customers take note of these changes and prioritize modifying their applications that depend on this resource type accordingly.   &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Why and when are we making this change? &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we make the devcieRegistrationPolicy resource type generally available in our v1.0 API version, we need to align to MS Graph REST API best practices and design patterns. This change will be made to beta endpoint in the week of September 25, 2023, and then generally available to v1.0 endpoint later this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 What are the Required Actions?&nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
  If you’re using Entra ID portal to configure device registration policy settings then no action is required.&nbsp; 
 If you’re crafting your own MS Graph API requests to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type, then you need to immediately update your application to start configuring the resource type with both the new and deprecated properties.&nbsp; 
 Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with new properties is deployed in the week of September 25, 2023, verify using GET call that you see the new properties and their values as being configured by your application. &nbsp; 
 At a later point in time of convenience, remove the deprecated properties from your application.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are the updates to MS Graph deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 
 The "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" property is changing from an integer to a string value. The old integer value of “0” represented "notRequired" and “1” represented "required". The new string property will now support the values of "notRequired" and "required".&nbsp; 
 The "appliesTo", "allowedUsers" and "allowedGroups" properties within "azureADJoin" and "azureADRegistration" are being deprecated. Instead, these will be replaced by the "allowedToJoin" and "allowedToRegister" properties, which are of the type microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership and contain one of the following values for "@odata.type":&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that all users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.noDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that no users are allowed to join or register devices.&nbsp; 
 "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership": Indicates that a selected group or users and groups are allowed to join or register devices. Only for this value, the "allowedToJoin" or "allowedToRegister" values contain two additional properties, "users" and "groups", each being an array of user and group IDs which are allowed to join or register devices. 
 
 
 The changes will be deployed to MS Graph beta endpoint the week of September 25, 2023, at which point the deprecated properties of the resource type will stop working.&nbsp; 
 Customers should prepare to update their applications and start using the new properties of the resource type as soon as possible.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What happens to applications if they don’t use the new properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The applications will encounter an error (Bad Request) as new properties will be expected when configuring the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I do something now to prepare my application for this change without waiting until the week of September 25, 2023? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you modify your application immediately to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties. The resource type available in beta endpoint today will honor both the deprecated and new properties. It will stop honoring deprecated properties during the week of September 25, 2023. Here’s an example of how you’ll use PUT to configure both new and deprecated properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>{ &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "@odata.context": <a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#policies/deviceRegistrationPolicy/$entity</a>, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "multiFactorAuthConfiguration": "notRequired", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "id": "deviceRegistrationPolicy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "displayName": "Device Registration Policy", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "description": "Tenant-wide policy that manages initial provisioning controls using quota restrictions, additional authentication and authorization checks", &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "userDeviceQuota": 20, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADRegistration": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": false, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToRegister": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.allDeviceRegistrationMembership" &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "1", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "azureADJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isAdminConfigurable": true, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedToJoin": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.enumeratedDeviceRegistrationMembership", &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "users": [ &nbsp;</p>
<p>        "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4" &nbsp;</p>
<p>      ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>      "groups": [] &nbsp;</p>
<p>    }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "appliesTo": "2", &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedUsers": [&nbsp;</p>
<p> "a6aebac8-1faf-4ebd-9a68-727fa53376f4"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ], &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "allowedGroups": [], &nbsp;</p>
<p>  }, &nbsp;</p>
<p>  "localAdminPassword": { &nbsp;</p>
<p>    "isEnabled": true &nbsp;</p>
<p>  } &nbsp;</p>
<p>}&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes: &nbsp;</p>
 
 "multiFactorAuthConfiguration" should always be sent as a string value ("required" or "notRequired").&nbsp; 
 users and groups list are only needed when you set&nbsp;microsoft.graph.deviceRegistrationMembership data type to enumerated.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 When should I remove configuring old properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you follow our above recommendation to configure deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type with both new and deprecated properties, you can remove deprecated properties at any future time of convenience. Once the deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type is deployed with the new properties during the week of September 25, 2023, deprecated properties will be ignored by the resourceType.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Can I selectively configure the new properties from my application? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not currently. The API supports PUT operation for update, which means you need to configure all properties of deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What will the GET call return? &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deviceRegistrationPolicy resource type will return the deprecated properties until the week of September 25, 2023, after which the resource type will return the new properties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With cybersecurity threats constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated, organizations are grappling with the challenge of safeguarding their sensitive data and systems. The rise of AI-strengthened phishing attacks and vulnerabilities associated with traditional password-based authentication methods have pushed organizations to explore innovative and secure authentication solutions. In response to these pressing concerns, a dynamic partnership has emerged between two industry leaders: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/yubikey">HYPR and Yubico</a>. This partnership offers a comprehensive solution that provides flexible and choice-driven passwordless multi-factor authentication (MFA), effectively addressing the diverse needs of modern businesses.</p> 
 The Landscape of Security Challenges  
<p>As technology advances, so do the methods employed by cybercriminals to breach systems and steal sensitive information. Traditional password-based authentication methods have proven to be vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To counteract these threats, organizations need authentication solutions that are not only robust but also user-friendly. This is where the HYPR | Yubico partnership comes into play.</p> 
 The Power of Choice: Hardware vs. Software-Based Passwordless Security Keys for Authentication  
<p>The heart of the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-hypr-yubico">HYPR | Yubico solution</a> lies in providing organizations and users with the freedom to choose between hardware and software-based passwordless security keys; both support passkeys and are FIDO Certified. This unique approach caters to different use cases and user preferences, ensuring a seamless and secure login experience across diverse environments and devices, including Windows, MacOS, Linux and VDI workstations.</p> 
<p>Hardware-based authentication options are critical in scenarios where end-users may lack access to smartphones or may prefer not to use them for authentication. This includes sectors such as call centers, banking, retail, and remote locations, where mobile phones may be prohibited or impractical.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On the other hand, organizations can opt for software-based authentication, where smartphone-based virtual FIDO-based tokens eliminate the need to purchase and provision physical tokens for each user. This streamlines the enrollment process and enhances user convenience.</p> 
 The Strength of the Partnership: Features and Benefits  
<p>The HYPR | Yubico partnership brings forth a host of features and benefits that contribute to an organization's security, compliance, and operational efficiency:</p> 
  
  User Choice: Users are empowered to authenticate securely in any environment, at any time, by choosing between hardware or software-based FIDO Certified passwordless security keys.  
  Complete Coverage: The joint solution seamlessly integrates with major identity technologies, including Identity Providers (IdPs), Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and Single Sign-On (SSO) services, providing comprehensive coverage adaptable to diverse environments.  
  Compliance and Regulatory Alignment: The availability of both virtual and physical passwordless security keys enables organizations to comply with varying security standards and guidelines across industries and jurisdictions, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements.  
  Administrative Ease: Organizations can efficiently provision and manage both YubiKeys (physical security keys) and HYPR virtual FIDO tokens from a single console. This streamlines authentication management, enhances administrative efficiency, and simplifies onboarding processes.  
  Future-Proofing: The combination of virtual and physical tokens ensures organizations are prepared for future authentication technologies, guaranteeing ongoing security enhancements.  
  Risk Reduction: The deployment of FIDO and smart card-based MFA effectively combats various attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing, and credential stuffing. This enhances security across all users and use cases.  
  Improved User Experience: By reducing login streams and offering the choice between passkeys (FIDO credentials) or smart cards, user satisfaction increases while minimizing security fatigue and failures.  
  Cost Efficiency and Revenue Growth: The unified provisioning, management, and auditing platform reduces costs related to password resets, help desk calls, and authentication-related downtime. This efficiency enables organizations to redirect resources toward core business objectives, thereby increasing overall value and customer trust.  
  
 Building a Secure Foundation for the Future  
<p>In the face of relentless cyber threats, the HYPR | Yubico partnership delivers a robust and forward-looking passwordless authentication solution. By empowering organizations to effectively counter threats, meet compliance requirements, reduce costs, and enhance user experiences, this partnership sets the stage for more secure authentication operations.

  A Travel Rule Solution streamlines compliance with FATF’s crypto transaction guidelines, specifically designed for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs).  Travel Rule Solutions bridges the gap between regulatory requirements and the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies.  A well-designed Travel Rule Solution, like Shyft Veriscope, is a balance of data security, interoperability, and regulatory adaptability, making it an essential tool for&nbsp;VASPs.  <p>Understanding the complexities of financial regulations, especially ones like the FATF Travel Rule, is crucial for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). When grappling with these compliance issues, understanding the FATF Travel Rule Recommendation 16 is a necessary first step, and a Travel Rule Solution becomes an invaluable asset.</p> What is a Travel Rule Solution? <p>A Travel Rule Solution is a specialized software designed to help VASPs comply with FATF Travel Rule requirements. This rule mandates sharing customer details for transactions exceeding a certain monetary threshold, which varies by jurisdiction.</p><p>For instance, the European Union has set this minimum transaction value at zero euros, while the United States has set it at $3,000. If you wish to learn more about the Travel Rule in EU’s context, you can head over to <a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/eu_tfr">our EU Travel Rule PDF&nbsp;guide</a>.</p><p>While this is a simple task in traditional banking, the Travel Rule in crypto environments calls for a specialized approach. That’s where our Travel Rule Solution, Shyft Veriscope, distinguishes itself. It offers unmatched levels of automation and security, outpacing other solutions in the&nbsp;market.</p> Why do we Need a Travel Rule Solution? <p>The FATF Travel Rule sets out requirements to curb money laundering and terrorist financing. However, these mandates interact complexly with the decentralized and anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies. In this context, an effective Travel Rule Solution becomes crucial. It allows VASPs to adhere to FATF guidelines while still respecting the core blockchain principles of security and&nbsp;privacy.</p> How Does a Travel Rule Solution&nbsp;Work? <p>Fundamentally, a Travel Rule Solution operates as a secure pipeline between VASPs during transactions. It standardizes the data exchange format to ensure that sensitive customer information is consistently and securely communicated between participating parties. Solutions usually integrate well with a VASP’s existing tech stack, making the entire compliance process less burdensome.</p> Essential Attributes of a Comprehensive Solution  Seamless Integration <p>The most significant challenge lies in creating a solution that can easily integrate with existing systems — each VASP might be operating on entirely different tech stacks, employing different data formats and protocols. Therefore, a viable solution must offer a certain level of adaptability and customization to align with these various systems without requiring a complete overhaul.</p> Security and Encryption <p>Handling sensitive user data requires the highest security standards to prevent data breaches. A robust Travel Rule solution would incorporate advanced encryption techniques and secure channels for data transmission. This ensures that while compliance is met, user data is also shielded from unauthorized access.</p> Regulatory Adaptability <p>Regulations are not static. They evolve. Any effective Travel Rule solution must be agile enough to adapt to changing regulatory landscapes across different jurisdictions. This adaptability will save VASPs from the recurring costs and time-consuming efforts of having to frequently update their compliance systems.</p> Data Minimization <p>It’s crucial to collect only the information necessary to meet regulatory requirements and nothing more. The less personal data stored, the lower the risks associated with potential data breaches. Therefore, a good Travel Rule solution would employ a principle of data minimization, ensuring that only essential information is captured and transmitted.</p> Decentralization <p>Given that the cryptocurrency space values decentralization, it would be antithetical for the industry to adopt a centralized solution for compliance. A decentralized approach, such as the Shyft Veriscope Peer-to-Peer system, would retain the ethos of the blockchain community while still meeting regulatory standards. This is a complicated balance to maintain, but it’s essential for industry-wide adoption.</p> Shyft Veriscope: A Seamless &amp; Privacy-compliant Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution <p>Shyft Veriscope excels in features beyond mere compliance, addressing future challenges and opportunities in the digital asset space. Its real-time auto-detection of counterparty VASPs, and its comprehensive data retention features stand out. It also solves the complex “Sunrise Issue,” facilitating transactions with VASPs in jurisdictions that haven’t yet embraced the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>More on Veriscope here: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/addressing-the-new-fatf-report-shyft-veriscope-solving-the-travel-rule-challenges-like-no-other">Addressing the new FATF Report — Shyft Veriscope Solving the Travel Rule Challenges Like No&nbsp;Other</a></p> Conclusion <p>In a fast-paced crypto world with ever-changing rules, a Travel Rule Solution is more than a handy tool — it’s a must-have for any Virtual Asset Service Provider. By balancing regulatory demands with crypto’s decentralized spirit, the right solution can make all the difference for secure and compliant transactions.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard to believe it’s been almost a year since we made cross-tenant access settings generally available. Since then, it’s been awesome seeing you adopt this feature to secure your cross-tenant collaboration scenarios and improve end-user experiences for partners by setting up trust of multi-factor authentication (MFA) from their home tenants. With that said, we’ve also heard your feedback on a few critical areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been hard at work to address that feedback and we have some new improvements to share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 You can create custom roles and use protected actions to secure changes in cross-tenant access settings. 
 We've removed limits so you can set up policies for as many partners as you want. 
 Invitations respect cross-tenant access settings protecting your tenant from unapproved users and preventing user&nbsp;confusion. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s great to see the team making continuous improvements, thank you for your feedback! Now I’d like to welcome back Senior Product Manager, Josh Douglas, to the blog to walk you through the details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone, this is Josh. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm excited to share how cross-tenant access settings can better assist you on your zero-trust journey! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s dive right into the changes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Create custom roles and protect cross-tenant access settings administration 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the things we hear a lot is that you want to create your own roles for managing cross-tenant access settings. Today, you need to use either a Global or Security admin to fully manage cross-tenant access settings. Now you can use custom roles to create roles that meet the requirements you have. We’ve seen customers create a full cross-tenant access administrator, a partner administrator, and even a cross-tenant access reader. This allows you to delegate only the rights needed to perform these management actions without granting too many permissions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cross-tenant access settings admin experience has also been updated to respect these new custom roles. If a user does not have the proper permissions, the experience will update and only allow them to perform the actions they have access to perform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: A read-only role cannot perform any edit actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: A read-only role can view settings but is informed they are in a read-only view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-overview#custom-roles-for-managing-cross-tenant-access-settings">custom roles in cross-tenant access settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting custom roles, cross-tenant access settings permissions have also been onboarded as protected actions. This allows you to protect management actions with Conditional Access policies. For example, to change default settings for B2B collaboration first requires that you perform MFA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: A conditional access policy for protected actions requires MFA before making updates to default settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe with these new capabilities it will empower you on your journey to zero-trust to give admins only the permissions they need to perform management of cross-tenant access settings and keep those highly privileged actions protected with Conditional Access policies!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 No more limits on number of partners in cross-tenant access settings 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard from many of you that you have needs to collaborate with hundreds, or even thousands, of organizations and you needed a way to manage all those relationships. Cross-tenant access settings originally had limitations and we realized that those limitations stood in the way of enabling you to manage all of your partnerships.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we’ve created a new way of storing data for partners in cross-tenant access settings, where each partner has their own partner policy. With this new model, you can add as many partners as required. From your standpoint, nothing will change with how you manage cross-tenant access settings. You’ll still manage things exactly the same way via the Entra portal or Microsoft Graph, but you’ll no longer hit any size limitation when adding new partners in cross-tenant access settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are beginning to migrate all customers who use cross-tenant access settings to this new, scalable model in CY23 Q3. You may notice an audit log entry for our service that conducts the migration once your tenant is migrated, but there is nothing to worry about! This is our service just moving your configuration to the scalable model, unlocking this new capability for adding as many partners as you need!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Invitations respect cross-tenant access settings 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until now, even if you had blocked someone in cross-tenant access settings, or only allowed specific partners, you could still send B2B invitations to any of the users who may be blocked. After receiving the invitation, they would be blocked as they tried to redeem the invite and access resources. This is a confusing experience for both the inviter and invitee, as the invite went through and then the user was blocked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve introduced a change to make this a better experience all around. We now respect your cross-tenant access settings when sending B2B invitations. This means that for any organization you have blocked, you will no longer successfully invite those users and we will instead fail the invitation and make it clear you need to update cross-tenant access settings if you’d like this invite to go through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope you’re excited about these improvements in cross-tenant access settings and can leverage them to work towards a zero-trust posture. As always, let us know if you have any feedback by reaching out to us through the Azure forum or tagging @AzureAd on Twitter!</p>

  <p>It's been about 15 years since the electric vehicle (EV) was introduced broadly to the American automobile market. While the early EVs drew tons of interest, they were prohibitively expensive for most consumers. As more affordable models began to arrive, they drew interest from a larger pool of potential buyers, but their limited range between charges turned many consumers toward hybrid vehicles instead. Hybrids were affordable and could satisfy consumers' demand for greater distance before refueling (or recharging).</p>

<p>Hybrids combine the best qualities of two or more different worlds — and the same is true with hybrid cloud and hybrid IAM. Before we go any further, let's define hybrid cloud and look at its benefits, and then we'll look at hybrid IAM.</p>

<p>Hybrid cloud represents applications, services,and systems that use a mix of on-premises infrastructure along with one or more private cloud or public cloud services. If that on-premises environment is running in a private cloud, it can be considered a hybrid cloud. Because you can choose which environment to use for what applications, combining the best of both worlds, you get the data residency, privacy, and control of on-premises with the agility, flexibility, and scalability of cloud computing.</p>

<p>Like the car analogy, one of the other advantages of hybrid cloud comes down to cost. Because you are using the investments you already made in your on-premises infrastructure and paying only for the cloud capacity you use, a hybrid cloud environment is cost-effective.</p>

 Hybrid cloud can create identity silos, and that's where hybrid IAM comes in 

<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of hybrid cloud is that it fragments digital identities and spreads them across multiple environments. These identity silos can lead to duplicate identities and increased risk. Without visibility across all environments, it's difficult to identify and monitor high-risk requests. On the other hand, unifying all identities across all digital services and avoiding a new set of silos is critical for closing security gaps and delivering great access experiences to users. This unification is known as hybrid IAM.</p>

<p>Hybrid IAM is an IAM platform capable of running, unifying, and securing all digital identities in a hybrid cloud environment.</p>

 Hybrid IAM delivers three key benefits 

<p>Hybrid IAM enables organizations to seamlessly integrate, centralize, and manage identities across any environment in a single IAM platform.</p>

<p>Cost savings: By having a single IAM platform that can run in a hybrid cloud architecture — with you controlling how much will be on-premises and how much will be in the cloud — you have the flexibility to keep costs down and move to the cloud at your own pace without worrying about additional future IAM costs, which could include investment in migration activities and maintenance.</p>

<p>Great experiences: By unifying siloed identity information on a hybrid IAM platform, you can deliver a consistent user experience at any scale for any type of user identity, including IoT devices and services, no matter where the user (customer or employee) or application is housed within the hybrid cloud.</p>

<p>Uncompromising security: By adding user and device context to authentication, including the ability to continuously authorize every transaction, hybrid IAM can enable you to quickly adopt a Zero Trust strategy. By adding full user lifecycle management on top, you can truly unify identities to improve audit and compliance.</p>

   Why success matters to federal agencies — and how to choose a solution 

<p>The recent guidance document released by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), "<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/csso-scuba-guidance_document-hybrid_identity_solutions_architecture-2023.03.22-final.pdf">Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Hybrid Identity Solutions Architecture</a>," proposes a number of architectures and solutions to move more identity management functions to a SaaS model, also known as identity as a service, or IDaaS. The CISA publication is timely, given the prevalence of IDaaS solutions that are providing modern use cases to help secure organizations.</p>

<p>There are still many self-managed identity management solutions on the market, and IDaaS solutions have been available for over a decade. But federal agencies have struggled to migrate the full breadth of identity functionality to SaaS solutions. The hybrid models suggested by CISA do address ways to work through many of the common challenges.</p>

<p>There are a few areas that ForgeRock would like to address, complementary to CISA's comprehensive document. Having a single vendor that can address all of the core identity functionality needed by an agency, no matter how it is deployed, is key. The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">ForgeRock Identity Platform</a> is a complete identity and access management (IAM) solution. The following points underscore what a complete identity platform is and why it's important for agencies.</p>
	
 Flexible deployment 
	
<p>Identity solutions should facilitate the hybrid models presented by CISA without relying on legacy identity solutions. ForgeRock maintains its self-managed, as-a-service, and DevOps deployments. The licensing for IDaaS allows for the other deployment models to be deployed in a hybrid model without additional license charges. You can have an unlimited number of instances of the ForgeRock platform deployed on-premises or to the agency's virtual private cloud. Flexibility supports CISA's hybrid deployment models without increasing the license costs.</p>
	
 Modernizing existing architectures 
	
<p>Agencies need modern features that are more complete than many IDaaS solutions provide. This includes the flexibility to run a next-generation, scalable LDAP on-premises while leveraging an IDaaS solution. ForgeRock has both deployments available to support these use cases. The ForgeRock solution also provides multiple solutions to authenticate securely into legacy apps and a robust <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iot">IoT solution</a>.</p>
	
 Support for open standards 
	
<p>When there is heavy reliance on federation standards, as CISA calls out in its report, the identity vendor needs to proactively support and update the specification for standards like SAML, OIDC, and WebAuthn. ForgeRock releases updates for specification changes to standards and references the changes in release notes. This enables our customers to quickly leverage security updates and feature changes included in the specifications.</p>

 The pricing model 
	
<p>The impact of monthly surge pricing, charging by integrated apps or by multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions in use have to be eliminated from the identity space, both for scalability and to stabilize budgets. ForgeRock's license is based on annual identities for the modules purchased. This allows for agencies to budget confidently for their identity solutions. This license model also frees agencies from monthly surge pricing and reduces the complexity of the licensing model.</p>

<p>When an agency is looking to modernize their identity solution, they should look for flexibility and stability in a comprehensive identity platform that can be deployed for any core identity use case. ForgeRock is a comprehensive identity platform that will solve your hybrid identity use cases.</p>

<p>The starting whistle has gone off in the race for quantum-safe cryptography solutions. Last week, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released their <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-standardize-encryption-algorithms-can-resist-attack-quantum-computers">draft standards</a> for post-quantum cryptography (PQC).</p>
<p>As my colleague <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/nist-standards-for-post-quantum-cryptography-are-coming-soon-what-does-this-mean-for-enterprises/">Greg Wetmore noted in July</a>, all eyes have been on the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/08/nist-post-quantum-competition-and-the-round-3-finalists-are/">NIST PQ competition</a> for the last several years, with the third-round finalist algorithms announced last summer, and now the release of the PQC draft standards – a major milestone in quantum readiness and the future migration to quantum-safe cryptography.</p>
<p>Despite knowing the high stakes – by most analysis, advancements in quantum computers will result in them being capable of breaking <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">traditional public key cryptography</a> within the decade – some organizations have been hesitant to begin their PQC preparations until NIST’s draft standards were released. That barrier has been crossed.</p>
<p>Now, draft standards for three algorithms are open for public comment and feedback until November 22, 2023; with the standards likely to be finalized in 2024. Once this happens, organizations will be expected to make the transition to these algorithms designed to withstand quantum computer attacks in order to protect their sensitive data. And with the fourth round of the competition still underway, it’s no surprise that the NIST release also states that “While these three will constitute the first group of post-quantum encryption standards NIST creates, they will not be the last.” So, more to come.</p>
<p>The draft standards weren’t the only quantum-related announcement last week. NIST, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency (NSA) released a joint factsheet titled <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/quantum-readiness-migration-post-quantum-cryptography">Quantum-Readiness: Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/08/governments-across-the-globe-are-looking-to-prepare-for-and-mitigate-the-quantum-threat/">intention</a> of the joint factsheet is to further encourage – both government agencies and organizations – to begin their planning for the migration to PQC now. Why?</p>
 
 The migration will take time. The factsheet notes that “creating quantum-readiness roadmaps, conducting inventories, applying risk assessments and analysis, and engaging vendors” will take time – likely several years. Not only that, but the migration to PQC will be more complex than anything we’ve ever done before and will touch almost every piece of infrastructure. 
 Harvest now, decrypt later attacks. There is a known threat to long-life data (any sensitive data that needs to remain confidential for 10+ years) where bad actors are harvesting it today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. This same threat also exists for long-life connected devices. 
 
<p>Regardless of the nature of your organization, steps need to be taken to protect your data from the quantum threat. From inventorying cryptographic systems and assets, to creating a migration plan, to speaking with your technology vendors about their own PQ roadmap – there is much to be done and there’s no time to waste in getting started.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Money laundering, the process of making illicitly gained money appear legitimate, has far-reaching implications for the global economy. It can serve as a lifeline for criminal organizations, fostering illegal economic activity such as terrorism financing and drug trafficking. To counter this, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures are essential to a legitimate financial system. This blog post aims to provide an in-depth exploration of AML, its crucial role in today’s economic landscape, the components of an effective AML program, and how technology can aid in AML compliance.</p>
 What’s Anti-Money Laundering? 
<p>In simple terms, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. AML measures involve identifying the origins of these foreign assets, controlling well and tax evasion, monitoring suspicious activities, and reporting potential money laundering activities to the relevant financial sector and authorities.</p>
 What Are Some Ways That Money Is Laundered? 
<p>Money laundering involves a three-step process: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, illicit funds are introduced into the financial system. This is often done by breaking up large amounts of cash into less conspicuous smaller sums deposited directly into a bank account or used to purchase various assets.</p>
<p>Layering is the most complex phase, involving multiple transactions to obscure the source of the laundered funds. These could include wire transfers, purchasing and selling investment instruments, or other means of distancing the dirty money from its inception. Integration is when the ‘cleaned’ money is returned to the criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources.</p>
 Can Money Laundering Be Stopped? 
<p>While stopping money laundering is challenging due to its pervasive and covert nature, AML programs can significantly deter and disrupt these illicit activities.</p>
<p>By establishing a combination of legislative measures, private banking, financial institutions, and industry know-your-customer norms, vigilant transaction monitoring, stringent reporting requirements, and promoting international cooperation, the prevalence of money laundering can be drastically reduced.</p>
 What’s the Difference Between AML, CDD, and KYC? 
<p>While AML, CDD, and KYC are all essential components of financial regulation, they have different focuses. AML refers to the laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent the act of disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate.</p>
<p>CDD, or Customer Due Diligence, is a vital part of these AML procedures, involving checks on customers to ensure they are who they claim to be and are not engaged in criminal activities.</p>
<p>KYC, or Know Your Customer, is a subset of CDD that involves verifying the identity of clients and assessing their suitability, along with the potential risks of illegal intentions towards the business relationship.</p>
 The Regulatory Framework of Anti-Money Laundering 
<p>Combating terrorist financing is not just a singular country’s problem; it is a complex, international issue requiring cohesive global efforts. Recognizing this, regulators worldwide have implemented AML laws to combat terrorist financing, foster transparency, and reduce opportunities for financial crime.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of this framework is the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/Fatf-recommendations.html">Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations</a> – a comprehensive, 40-point guideline designed to help countries establish effective legal and regulatory measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing together.</p>
<p>Another influential anti-money laundering legislation is the <a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/supervision-and-examination/bsa/index-bsa.html">US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)</a>. Introduced in 1970, the BSA obliges financial institutions to aid government and law enforcement agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering.</p>
<p>These efforts include reporting transactions above a set threshold and maintaining records of cash purchases. However, AML laws, while sharing a common objective to launder money less, can vary significantly between jurisdictions, creating a challenging issue for cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>The consequences of non-compliance with these AML regulations are severe, extending beyond substantial financial penalties. They can also lead to damaged reputations, loss of business, and potential civil and criminal penalties and charges for individuals involved in non-compliance.</p>
<p>Therefore, implementing a robust AML program is more than just a regulatory requirement; it’s essential for the survival and growth of financial institutions.</p>
 Impact on Cross-Border Business Transactions 
<p>Cross-border transactions can become complicated due to the variation in AML laws across jurisdictions. Navigating these disparities is crucial for businesses involved in international trade or services.</p>
<p>Understanding and adhering to the AML regulations of all affected jurisdictions can help businesses mitigate risks, avoid penalties, and maintain their international partnerships.</p>
 Cost Implications of Non-compliance 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance with AML regulations can be financially damaging. As seen in several high-profile cases like…., businesses face substantial penalties, sometimes billions of dollars.</p>
<p>In addition to fines, businesses can suffer from reputational damage, loss of customer trust, reduced operational efficiency due to increased regulatory scrutiny, and even loss of operating licenses in extreme cases.</p>
 Key Components of an Effective Anti-Money Laundering Program 
<p>Establishing an effective AML program is no small feat, requiring a blend of rigorous processes, dedicated resources, and continuous monitoring. A comprehensive AML compliance and risk assessment program typically consists of several key components:</p>
 
 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): Understanding who your customers are central to any AML compliance program. This is achieved through CDD, which involves verifying the customer’s identity, understanding their financial activities, and assessing their risk profile. In cases where a customer poses a higher risk (such as those with political influence or those from high-risk jurisdictions), businesses should implement Enhanced Due Diligence. This involves more rigorous steps to understand the customer’s wealth source, financial transactions, and business relationships. 
 Transaction monitoring systems: Transaction monitoring systems are designed to analyze customer transactions continuously. Identifying any activities that fall outside the customer’s standard behavioral patterns or appear suspicious is critical. Businesses should invest in advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning, which can swiftly analyze vast amounts of transaction data and identify patterns that might escape human detection. 
 Regular audits and AML training for employees: Regular audits are essential to ensure AML procedures are followed correctly and any compliance gaps are promptly addressed. Simultaneously, continuous AML training for employees is critical to ongoing monitoring, informing them of the latest AML legislation and regulations, emerging risks, and best practices. Businesses should make this training a regular part of their operations to maintain the highest compliance standards. 
 
 Who is Using AML? 
<p>A wide range of entities across various sectors implements AML measures:</p>
 
 Banks: The traditional banking sector is key in implementing Anti-Money Laundering measures. Banks conduct rigorous Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) protocols to verify clients’ identities and scrutinize transactions. They also work closely with regulatory bodies to stay updated. 
 Credit Unions: Similar to banks, credit unions have a crucial role in preventing money laundering. They follow comprehensive AML procedures, including customer identification, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting. These community-based institutions provide services to numerous members, making them significant gatekeepers in the fight against financial crimes. 
 Fintech Companies: As technology advances, the fintech sector has become a significant player in the financial industry. These digital platforms must implement stringent AML protocols, including automated CDD, transaction monitoring, and machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious patterns. Their digital nature demands high cybersecurity measures to prevent online financial fraud. 
 Cryptocurrency Exchanges: With the rising popularity of digital currencies, cryptocurrency exchanges are now integral to AML efforts. These platforms are often targets for illicit funds due to their relative anonymity and cross-border capabilities. Therefore, they have robust AML programs, including blockchain analysis tools, to trace transactions and detect illegal activities. 
 Non-Financial Businesses: Non-financial businesses like casinos, real estate companies, and law firms also use AML measures. For example, casinos must report any high-value transactions to regulatory authorities. At the same time, real estate companies and law firms must ensure the money used in property transactions and trust accounts is legitimate. 
 Government Agencies and Regulatory Bodies: Government agencies use AML measures to enforce compliance and track financial crimes. They are responsible for setting the AML regulations, conducting audits, levying penalties for non-compliance, and collaborating with international counterparts to combat money laundering globally. 
 
<p>By adhering to stringent AML procedures, these entities contribute to a more secure and transparent financial ecosystem. They deter criminal organizations and foster trust among customers, partners, and regulators.</p>
 Utilizing Technology for AML Compliance 
<p>The advent of technology has revolutionized the way businesses approach AML compliance. With the volume of transactions increasing exponentially, manual monitoring of financial fraud and customer due diligence processes are no longer feasible or practical. In response, other financial institutions are turning to cutting-edge technologies to enhance their AML efforts:</p>
 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML): AI and ML can analyze vast amounts of transaction data swiftly and identify patterns or anomalies in criminal economic activity that might escape human detection. This can help flag suspicious activities more accurately and in real time, enhancing the effectiveness of transaction monitoring efforts. 
 Blockchain technology: Blockchain technology can improve the traceability of transactions. Providing a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger of transactions can offer higher transparency and security to report suspicious transactions, reducing opportunities for money laundering. 
 Automation: Automating KYC and CDD processes like <a>BlockID</a> can significantly reduce the time and resources required while minimizing the risk of human error. It enables staff to focus on higher-value tasks, such as regarding suspicious activity reports investigating flagged transactions, or enhancing AML strategies. 
 
 Challenges and Solutions in AML Compliance 
<p>Implementing an effective AML program has its challenges. Data management issues stemming from transaction data’s sheer volume and complexity can hinder accurate monitoring and reporting to prevent money laundering.</p>
<p>Cross-border regulation complexities can lead to compliance issues, especially annual money laundering flows, for institutions operating in multiple jurisdictions. Also, money laundering tactics continuously evolve, requiring institutions to stay updated and adapt their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>Overcoming these challenges to practical anti-money laundering efforts requires a combination of technological innovation, strategic planning, and international cooperation:</p>
 
 Data Management and Technology: Advanced data analytics and investing in AI and ML can help manage large volumes of transaction data effectively. Consider investing in these technologies to streamline your compliance processes and risk management. 
 Cross-Border Regulation and Collaboration: Harmonizing AML regulations and fostering international collaboration can address cross-border compliance issues. Maintain an open line of communication with regulatory bodies in your region to stay on top of new rules and understand regulatory expectations. 
 Continual Strategy Updates: Continual updates to AML strategies, in line with emerging risks and technologies, can help stay ahead of evolving money laundering tactics. Regular audits and ongoing employee training will help ensure your business remains compliant as regulations change. 
 Outsourcing AML Compliance: If managing AML compliance in-house is overwhelming, consider outsourcing to professional service providers specializing in this field. They can help ensure your business complies with the latest regulations and best practices. However, always ensure you choose a reputable provider with demonstrated knowledge and experience in AML compliance. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Enhancing global stability necessitates robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices, underscored by emerging technologies like AI and blockchain. These innovations empower businesses to anticipate and mitigate risks and financial crimes, thus strengthening AML compliance. Experience the benefits of these advanced tools in simplifying compliance and enhancing efficiency by <a>booking a meeting with our team</a> for a  BlockID demo.</p>

				  When it comes to decentralized identity, Indicio is technology agnostic. This enables us to offer customers the best possible solutions to meet their exact needs.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In a rapidly expanding field, there are many approaches to solving a multitude of use cases and requirements. This is why Indicio’s approach is to solve the customer’s problem rather than sell them a specific protocol or single technology. Within the overall framework of decentralized identity and using verifiable data to create trusted digital relationships, we are and have always been technology agnostic.</p>
<p>At present, this agnosticism applies most of all to credential formats. There is no single format — at least not yet — that meets every customer’s needs or legal requirements. So we help our customers assess what is important to their use case, for example:</p>
<p>Does regulation require them to use a particular credential type?<br>Do they need to be able to use selective disclosure?<br>Do they need to be able to use predicate proofs?<br>Do they need privacy-preserving holder binding?</p>
<p>Where preserving privacy is critical, we recommend AnonCreds, as it is the most feature rich. If regulation or interoperability require a different credential format, we’ll support that as well.</p>
<p>The same situation also exists for the protocols in an ecosystem. Our clients often have requirements that are well met by the rich interaction models and power of DIDComm-based credential exchange and communication protocols.</p>
<p>Increasingly, our clients require interoperability with the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS 2.0 standards</a>, including the OID4VCs protocols. We support these as well, and advise our customers on the best way to achieve their goals within the limits of those protocols. If a customer is already using DIDComm for its rich interaction model and protocols, they are usually able to keep those features while adding additional protocols for compliance reasons.</p>
<p>Our mission is to always meet the needs of our customers and generate solutions that deliver the most benefits. For us, this means delivering a complete solution that works right “out of the box” and that they fully own and can develop on as technology evolves.</p>
<p>Providing this future flexibility is why we use and support open-source projects whenever possible. In the adoption of additional credential types and protocols, we are working with open-source collaborators to realize these goals. These collaborative efforts lift and support the community as a whole for a stronger, more capable, and broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>When it comes to deployment, we can do as much or as little as a customer’s development team needs. This is why our product range is available both as complete ecosystem solutions and as individual building blocks—and why we are continually adding blocks, new features, and full ecosystems to our product range.</p>
<p>Our most recent addition is an update to Aries Cloud Agent-Python (ACA-Py) so that it can handle <a href="https://indicio.tech/breakthrough-in-didcomm-mediation-indicio-achieves-significant-scale-with-new-solution/">thousands of interactions per minute</a>, thereby enabling verifiable credential ecosystems to rapidly scale.</p>
<p>For those curious about the technologies we have on our roadmap, here are the technologies we are asked about most often:</p>
<p>Credential types: SD-JWT, JSON-LD, OpenBadges 3.0, mDL/mDOC<br>Protocols: DIDComm v2, OID4VCI/OID4VP, WACI<br>DID Methods: did:web, did:indy, did:ion<br>Governance: DIF CredentialTrustEstablishment, eIDAS PKI, TOIP Trust Registries<br>Signature Types: RSA, ECDSA, Secp256k1</p>
<p>There is no single technology choice that will rule the entire decentralized identity landscape in every environment and across time. The important thing is that we keep our eyes on the overall value proposition: solutions that create trusted digital relationships.</p>
<p>If you have questions or would like to learn more we encourage you to <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

  <p>Just today I received an email from one of my financial services providers warning me about imposter scams and fraudsters. Their warning was to alert me that fraudsters are impersonating financial institutions and contacting their customers. My institution’s goal was to help me understand how to identify someone taking the first steps to perform<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_fraud"> identity fraud</a>, which involves gaining some user credentials or parts of my identity to commit fraud. It’s a good first step in fraud prevention, but more is needed.</p>

<p>Attackers are innovative and highly motivated to use new technologies and techniques in pursuit of a big payoff. With data from prior breaches and publicly available information, they have access to a wealth of identity tidbits, if not rich data, that they can use to commit identity fraud.&nbsp;</p>

 Our personal information is everywhere, ripe for misuse 

<p>Every month my identity monitoring service warns me about pieces of my personal information turning up on the dark web, enriching the information fraudsters need to execute their plans. This didn’t come as a huge surprise to me. According to the ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report"> 2023 Identity Breach Report</a>, users’ names and physical addresses were in at least 99% of breached records and, in the last year, there’s been a sharp increase in more valuable information, such as date of birth and protected health information (PHI). And an eye-opening 72% of U.S. breaches contained Social Security numbers.</p>

<p>With all this information, layered with artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI, perpetrators gain fidelity and higher-quality information to use in their activities. They can analyze and predict the credentials I might use for one account based on what they have seen with my other accounts. What is my password selection process and what might I have created?&nbsp;</p>

<p>With bots, fraudsters gain scale and speed to carry out identity fraud attacks. In the event that I opt-in for multi-factor authentication (MFA), they can attempt to get me to click the wrong button through<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/how-attackers-are-circumventing-mfa-and-how-stop-them"> MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>The fraudsters’ goal is to garner login credentials to do harm, mostly for financial purposes. If they are successful in an<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover"> account takeover (ATO)</a> attack, they can fraudulently purchase goods and services, abuse healthcare processes and claims payments, steal tax refunds, or open new bank accounts and move money around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of AI, cybercriminals are also creating synthetic identities using pieces of information gleaned from identity theft. A synthetic identity may use a valid Social Security number and birthdate and combine it with fraudulent information, such as a fake name, to obtain a new credit card. Using bits of information either stolen or obtained from public sources (social media posts can be a rich source for pet names, schools, birthdays, and much more), can enable identity fraud if organizations do not have controls in place to help prevent it — whether the fraudsters have pieces of information or even full credentials.</p>

 How IAM can stop identity fraud 

<p>In addition to facilitating the login process, identity and access management (IAM) systems can perform a variety of actions to detect and prevent identity fraud and other misuse of a user's identity that results from a successful ATO attack.</p>

<p>IAM systems can generate risk scores during the login process, calculated based on IP address, geolocation, and other user behaviors. These and other access patterns can also identify and block bot attacks, such as credential stuffing, password spraying, and MFA prompt bombing.</p>

<p>Even if a bad actor has the right credentials, IAM can detect anomalous behavior, such as an unusual location or device, and demand further proof of identity, known as step-up authentication. With MFA, the identity system moves from basic authentication to include an out-of-channel factor from, say, a mobile device authenticator app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Implementing<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication"> passwordless authentication</a> can reduce the risk even further, making one piece of the authentication a cryptographic function instead something on a sticky note. With different factors to reduce risk in the user authentication process,<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration"> identity orchestration</a> comes into play to build a workflow that integrates risk factors and tailors the user experience based on the goal of reducing identity fraud.</p>

<p>The ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform"> Identity Platform</a> can help you reduce the risk of identity fraud using its full-suite IAM capabilities and our AI-driven fraud prevention product, ForgeRock<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access"> Autonomous Access</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today we're announcing a powerful enhancement to these capabilities - Platform SSO for macOS. This enhancement is designed to make using your macOS devices more seamless and secure than ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO is an enhancement to the existing SSO Extension capabilities for macOS, which allows users to sign into their Macs using passwordless credentials or passwords managed and validated by Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enabled by Platform SSO and powered by Microsoft’s Enterprise SSO plug-in, Platform Credentials for macOS allow users to go passwordless by using Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device bound cryptographic key. It uses phishing-resistant credentials, based on the technology we use for Windows Hello for Business, and backed by Apple’s hardware already in your device. This will save your organization money by removing the need for security keys or other hardware. Once you sign in, the existing Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in continues to do its magic keeping you signed into&nbsp;the apps you use for work, but with a credential that’s safer and more secure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those not ready to completely remove passwords from Entra ID sign-ins, Platform SSO for macOS allows organizations to synchronize their local account password and their Entra ID passwords so users can use one credential across their macOS device. No more remembering separate passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS also allows admins to configure the end-user authentication method, specifying either the phishing-resistant credential or a traditional password as the authentication method.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplified Management&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this update, we’ve reimagined the employee onboarding experience on Macs for users of Microsoft Intune. Platform SSO for macOS simplifies the employee onboarding experience on Microsoft Intune by enabling a familiar and native macOS experience that Mac users will love. As an example, it eliminates the need to launch the Company Portal app to access resources protected by Conditional Access on Intune-managed Macs. To learn more about how Microsoft Intune is innovating in Apple device management, see <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-intune-blog/10-ways-microsoft-intune-improves-apple-device-management/ba-p/3766718">10 ways Microsoft Intune improves Apple device management - Microsoft Community Hub.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upcoming public preview of Platform SSO for macOS will work with Microsoft Intune. Other MDM providers will be coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Helping You Go Zero Trust&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our integration with the Secure Enclave included in modern Macs, the passwordless authentication method offers a powerful means for enterprises to advance their zero trust security objectives. By eliminating passwords as a primary attack vector, organizations can significantly enhance their security postures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The credentials used in passwordless systems are bound to physical hardware. This requires attackers to gain physical access to specific hardware rather than steal login information, making unauthorized access even more challenging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Prepare&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are currently in private preview with select customers today with public preview coming soon. If you’d like to be considered to be added to the private preview, please contact <a href="mailto:macos-sso-feedback@microsoft.com">Platform SSO for macOS feedback</a>. Spaces are limited.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can prepare your organization for Platform SSO for macOS by taking the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in.</a>&nbsp; 
 Ensure users are registered for <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted">Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication;</a> for the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.&nbsp; 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13 (Ventura) or later.&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; 
 Summing up&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Platform SSO for macOS is a big step towards enhancing the SSO experience and security of the Macs in your organization. Users benefit from SSO through a hardware-bound key or by signing in to a Mac using their Microsoft Entra ID password. The integration with the Secure Enclave enables hardware-bound, passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication on macOS devices advancing enterprises' zero trust security objectives. At public preview launch, Platform SSO for macOS can be natively managed with Microsoft Intune, with support for other MDM providers coming soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this latest feature, credential issuers can now request specific data from holders if they’re missing information to issue a credential such as their last name, email, or date of birth. This functionality makes the issuing process more efficient while ensuring all of the necessary details are up to date before issuing a credential. </p><p>The issuer would request the missing information by simply sharing a QR code or link to the holder. The holder would then present the missing information from their Dock Wallet and once the issuer receives all of the information, the credential will automatically be sent afterwards.</p> Use Case Examples for the Request Data Feature <p>There are many instances where issuers would need to request missing data from holders to validate information associated with credentials. This ensures that the data is accurate and strengthens the overall credibility of the issued credentials.</p><p>University Transcripts</p><p>A university may want to issue digital transcripts to their graduates, but it might not have the most current contact details for each graduate. By using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a>, the university can request the missing information directly from the alumni. Once they provide the needed details, the university can issue the credentials.</p><p>Professional Certifications</p><p>A professional certification board, such as one for engineers or medical professionals, may need to issue digital certification credentials to its members. However, if the board doesn't have the most recent details like the updated email, they can use Dock Certs to request this information. Once the members update their details, the digital certifications can be issued.</p><p>Event Management</p><p>For a large conference or event, the organizers may wish to issue digital attendance certificates or badges to attendees. If they lack certain details (like a correct email address or full name), they can request this information from attendees from Dock's platform. Once the attendee provides the missing information, their digital attendance certificate or badge can be automatically sent.</p> Request Data Process <p>Successo Academy provides an online course for people to learn about Content Marketing. They want to confirm the full name of participants that will be added on the credential and their preferred email address. </p>  Successo Academy uses <a href="https://certs.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Certs</a> to create a custom credential template and selects Add Manually. From here, they can choose which field is missing and request the information from the credential recipient. In this example, they request their full name and email in order to issue the course completion certificate.   <p>2. Successo Academy can preview the message before sending it to the holder Anna Ly. </p><p>3. Anna receives the credential request in her email and scans the QR code with the Dock Wallet. She selects the DID she wants to use to submit the information. The QR code can only be scanned once. Anna fills in the missing information.</p><p>4. Once Successo Academy receives the information, the credential is automatically issued to Anna.</p> About Dock <p>Dock’s Verifiable Credential platform makes any data fraud-proof and instantly verifiable. It comprises the <a href="https://www.dock.io/certs-api?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs API</a>, the <a href="https://certs.dock.io/dashboard?ref=blog.dock.io">Certs no-code web app</a>, an <a href="https://www.dock.io/dock-wallet-app?ref=blog.dock.io">ID wallet</a> and a dedicated blockchain.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th August to 28th&nbsp;August <p>Welcome to the latest edition of our Veriscope crypto regulatory newsletter, where we navigate the intricate maze of rules and developments shaping the future of digital currencies worldwide.</p><p>In today’s edition, we kick off with the United Kingdom’s stringent new rules following FATF guidelines and contrast that with New Zealand’s more cautious, observant stance.</p><p>We’ll also cover India’s call for global regulatory unity at the recent G20 summit and wrap up with the United Arab Emirates’ flexible approach centered on Dubai’s recent&nbsp;updates.</p><p>Now, let’s dive straight into&nbsp;it.</p> Unpacking the Global Patchwork of Crypto Regulations <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is as varied as it is intricate, with countries worldwide adopting distinct approaches. From stringent measures in the United Kingdom to cautious observation in New Zealand, the debate is global and complex. Add India’s plea for international unity and Dubai’s flexible stance, and it’s clear that a one-size-fits-all approach is unlikely to work for a foreseeable future.</p><p>The UK: The United Kingdom has set a strong regulatory precedent by imposing the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule on all crypto businesses. Under this rule, crypto firms must share customer data during transactions, a move reportedly aimed at combating financial crimes like money laundering.</p><p>New Zealand: However, not all nations are taking the U.K.’s hardline approach. New Zealand, for example, is advocating for restraint and careful study before enacting stringent regulations. This nuanced view, outlined in a report by the country’s Finance and Expenditure Committee, highlights the discord in international perspectives on crypto governance.</p><p>India: Meanwhile, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is pressing for a global perspective. Calling for a broad regulatory approach that considers impacts beyond financial stability, PM Modi’s comments were a focal point at the recent G20 summit. His vision for international cooperation adds another layer to the ongoing discussions about how best to regulate the crypto&nbsp;space.</p><p>UAE: Dubai, too, is making waves in the regulatory sphere. The city’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority recently updated its rulebook, easing licensing requirements for staking services. This flexible approach further complicates the global regulatory landscape, showing that countries are far from unified in their&nbsp;methods.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>So, where does this leave us? The quest for balanced, effective, and globally cohesive crypto regulation is ongoing. Each country’s unique approach adds another piece to an already complex puzzle. The challenge now is to find a way for these disparate pieces to fit together, promoting both innovation and security in the rapidly evolving world of digital currencies.</p><p>Now, let’s zero in on two of these major developments and analyze them in&nbsp;detail.</p> New Zealand Takes a Balanced Approach to Crypto Regulation <p>New Zealand is setting itself apart in how countries are dealing with cryptocurrency. A detailed report from its Finance and Expenditure Committee suggests watching and learning rather than rushing to set strict rules. The report sees the value and risks in crypto and recommends learning from what works and doesn’t work globally.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1694786889838891210?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>The benefit of New Zealand’s approach is clear: it leaves space for new ideas to grow. By not setting up too many rules too quickly, the country could become a go-to place for crypto businesses looking for a more open environment.</p><p>But this careful approach also has downsides. Without set rules, things can feel uncertain. For investors and companies, clear guidelines often make it easier to plan for the future. New Zealand’s wait-and-see strategy could turn away those looking for quick, clear&nbsp;answers.</p><p>In short, New Zealand aims for a careful balance between letting the crypto market grow and keeping it in check. Whether this approach will serve as a strong model or a cautionary tale remains to be&nbsp;seen.</p> UK Adopts FATF Standards, Broad Implications Loom <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom is set to enforce the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing rules, popularly known as the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Starting September 1, UK-based crypto businesses must share customer information for transactions, aligning the country with 2019 FATF standards. This move comes as part of a slew of upcoming regulations in the UK’s crypto landscape, including new FCA marketing standards this&nbsp;October.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1692589864665928125?s=20">Image Source</a>) Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem  Positive Aspects   Global Trust: Aligning with FATF standards could boost international trust in the UK’s crypto&nbsp;market.  Risk Mitigation: The rules aim to curb illicit activities, thereby making the ecosystem safer for investors.   Negative Aspects   Compliance Burden: Companies, especially startups, may find the compliance costs burdensome.  Privacy Concerns: Sharing customer data may raise privacy issues, potentially deterring participation in the crypto&nbsp;market.  <p>This move is a telling sign of how nations are striving for a regulated yet thriving crypto environment. However, the increased oversight could serve as a double-edged sword, enhancing legitimacy while also stifling innovation and flexibility.</p><p>In navigating this complex regulatory landscape, Shyft Veriscope offers a solution that could ease the transition. Its automated features simplify compliance, mitigating risk without adding undue burdens on businesses. At the same time, its secure, peer-to-peer data sharing addresses privacy concerns, making it a noteworthy tool for a crypto industry in&nbsp;flux.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-shyft-perspective-crypto-regulations-the-south-american-way">The Shyft Perspective: Crypto Regulations — The South American&nbsp;Way</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/fatf-travel-rule-myths-debunked">FATF Travel Rule Myths&nbsp;Debunked</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-state-of-global-crypto-regulations">The State of Global Crypto Regulations</a></p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

				 <p>Indicio’s new Google Marketplace product enables mobile devices to communicate with credential issuers and verifiers in decentralized identity solutions that are built using DIDComm. Reliable mediation is critical to building a successful Trusted Digital Ecosystem that supports rich, trusted interaction models including the exchange of verifiable credentials. Indicio’s mediator has proven itself in deployment, is capable of handling scale, and will accelerate your implementation.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE, August 28, 2023/ <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a>, the market leader in delivering enterprise-class verifiable data solutions, today announced the availability of the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-proven-aca-py-mediator?project=indicio-public">Indicio Proven™ Mediator on Google Cloud</a>. This is a critical product for decentralized identity infrastructure designed for rich interactions, as it provides a way for mobile devices, which lack fixed IP addresses, to reliably communicate with credential issuers and entities that wish to verify the information presented in those credentials. Now available in the Google Cloud Marketplace, the Indicio Proven™ Mediator solves an important development challenge for teams using DIDComm-based communications, accelerates solution deployments, and ensures operational success. In addition to the rich protocols within DIDComm, Indicio’s products also support protocols focused solely on credential issuance and presentation such as OID4VC.</p>
<p>A mediator provides a cloud-based connection point to send and receive requests between mobile holders and credential issuers and verifiers. As the ability to hold a verifiable credential on a mobile device is central to sharing and verifying data, mediation is a critical element of any decentralized identity deployment using DIDComm. DIDComm based protocols allow individuals using a combination of mobile phones and other internet-enabled devices to be full participants in trusted interactions. Reliable mediation ensures a smooth interaction between all parties. The Indicio Proven™ Mediator comes from Indicio’s extensive experience in building award-winning Trusted Digital Ecosystems for enterprise clients.</p>
<p>“Mediation is an essential component to any decentralized identity deployment designed for rich interactions,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “With the Indicio Proven Mediator, we’re providing Google customers with the result of our years of successful work on mediation — a product that reduces development roadmaps and deployment anxiety and enables you to grow your ecosystem solution to meet increased demand.”</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">open sourced the base code</a> for the Mediator to the Hyperledger Foundation Aries project in 2021 and subsequently deployed a <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">free Indicio Mediator</a> for shared use to develop and test solutions. A key operational difference between the public Indicio Mediator and the Proven Mediator on Google Cloud is that the former is shared with other users and is unsuitable for business deployment where 100 percent availability is essential. The Proven Mediator deepens Indicio’s commitment to bringing open-source, Web3, decentralized solutions to the hybrid cloud, making it easier for customers and partners to confidently deploy enterprise-grade solutions. Indicio also offers a <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/mediator-agent-training/">Mediator Agent Workshop</a> to help teams gain a deeper understanding of Mediator technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven™ Mediator joins <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-node?project=sunlit-apricot-360315">Indicio NoDe</a>, a quick-start solution for setting up and operating a node on any Hyperledger Indy network, on Google Cloud Marketplace, and <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/indicio-public/indicio-proven-sandbox?project=indicio-public">Indicio Proven Sandbox</a>, the easiest way to create and build verifiable credential pilots, demos, and architectures. This is the first of several releases that support a variety of approaches for implementing decentralized identity. Adoption of Indicio Proven™ Mediator in Google Cloud Marketplace can count toward any existing committed spend agreements with Google.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p><p>Or, Passwordless as the 0th Factor of Authentication</p>
<p>Passwordless authentication is kind of hot right now, even though “passwordless” predates the password—much like horse-drawn carriages predated cars (which were first known as “horseless carriages”). But after witnessing a groundswell of support for new passwordless methods such as <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/">YubiKey</a>, <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO Passkey</a> (not to be confused with Apple Passkey), and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/solutions/passwordless-authentication">MS passwordless</a> authentication methods, I resolved to determine for myself whether that brave new world that has such security in it had in fact arrived. In short, we’re still not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, my recent search for KuppingerCole Analysts. As many of you are aware, I took some needed time off before joining KuppingerCole Analysts — a kind of self-directed sabbatical. During that time, when I found any job listing that seemed interesting, I’d naturally apply. That usually meant setting up an account with the employer and then connecting to LinkedIn to autofill my profile and work experience. But the authorization flow on LinkedIn requires username and password.</p>
<p>The risk of Zero Factor Authentication</p>
<p>I panicked! I didn’t know my password—Apple Keychain had it. So, I scrambled to authenticate to Keychain on my phone and then realized, “dang it! How do I transfer this ridiculous password that’s longer than my screen onto this web browser??” I thought about copying and pasting the password somewhere I could see it in a large, easy to read font—but then my Apple Passkey is out there in the universe! I then realized I could go get the MacBook I sync my Keychain to, start the flow over from there, then open Keychain on that MacBook and copy and paste from there (note: this is an embellishment—I don’t actually own a set of security-separated MacBooks, but it illustrates a point).</p>
<p>Hmm… I mean, I normally like having options, as long as one of them is good. But, in this case I realized that in pursuit of multi-factor authentication I had ended up with none—I now call it Zero Factor Authentication (ZFA). I guess that’s what is meant by Zero Trust? Anyway, after a couple such occurrences, I reset my LinkedIn password back to something I actually know.</p>
<p>What kind of factor is passwordless?</p>
<p>Now, some of you may be thinking, that if had only used a FIDO Passkey instead, things would have gone smoothly. But, allow the pun: not so fast. A FIDO Passkey uses a Private Key that resides on my device. This begs invoking the “practitioner’s refrain”: is this something I know? is it something I have? is it something I am? OK, it’s something I have, so that’s 1-for-3 and arguably stronger than something I know.</p>
<p>So, what kind of factor is passwordless? The way I see it, it’s a flow that provides evidence to a website you’re visiting that you have successfully enabled your device to sign a challenge that the site just sent. See? But again, what kind of factor is that? Well, it’s “something special you enable a pre-registered device to do,” which strongly implies to the website that it can consequently continue with the operation at hand … conveniently. So, maybe passwordless defies our decades-long adherence to the 3-pronged approach to identity verification; maybe passwordless is more of a root factor—say, a “0th“ factor?</p>
<p>The absence of a priori technology agreements</p>
<p>The quality of passwords that continually escapes our security consciousness is their utility; no other authentication method even comes close to the utility of a password. Passwords can be used anytime, anywhere, by anybody for whatever reason, and across any technology. Passwords don’t require a priori agreement on technology or standards. These qualities must also be part of any passwordless solution if it is to become ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This all reminded me of a Lex Fridman <a href="https://www.happyscribe.com/public/lex-fridman-podcast-artificial-intelligence-ai/124-stephen-wolfram-fundamental-theory-of-physics-life-and-the-universe">podcast</a> I once heard during which Steven Wolfram discussed his ideas on entropy, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics">2nd Law of Thermodynamics</a>. In Wolfram’s interpretation, this law predicts that closed systems prefer to settle in a state that appears chaotic from the human perspective, while eschewing states that we find much simpler and more organized.</p>
<p>To apply Wolfram’s definition here, passwords exist because that’s the state the system is most likely to be in, whereas passwordless is a state that requires vast amounts of energy or luck to arrive at and sustain. Why do we still use passwords? It’s elementary, everyone: entropy; or as I call it “The Second Law of AuthN Dynamics.”</p>
<p>For the record, I’m still working out the First Law, so stay tuned! One way you can do that is by attending my next (and first) webinar at KuppingerCole, “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2023/09/digital-transformation-for-finance-with-biometrics">Digital Transformation in Financial Services Using Biometrics</a>” on September 19. I’ll be hosting Pascal Tavernier, Identity &amp; Access Management Architect, Executive Director at UBS, to get his insights on how to make strong forms of authentication ubiquitous. In the meantime, feel free to reach out to me with questions or comments.</p>

<p>Large enterprises often face complex risk factors, such as counterfeit products, compliance violations and supply chain disruptions. With UNISOT’s blockchain-based traceability, enterprises can verify the authenticity of products, ensure compliance with regulations, and anticipate potential disruptions, allowing them to mitigate risks proactively.</p>
       Federated Learning 
<p>In addition to UNISOT’s blockchain prowess, federated learning plays a vital role in empowering large enterprises. <a href="http://(https://seafoodchain.no/federated-learning-in-the-fishing-and-seafood-industry/)">Federated learning</a> is a machine learning approach that enables training machine learning models across multiple devices or servers while keeping data decentralized and secure. This technology allows enterprises to collaborate and gain insights from collective data without sharing sensitive information.</p>
 Key Benefits of Federated Learning: 
      <p>Privacy Preservation</p>
<p>For large enterprises, data privacy is of paramount importance. Federated learning ensures that sensitive data remains on-premises, never leaving the organization’s servers. This way, enterprises can collaborate on improving machine learning models without compromising data confidentiality.</p>
      <p>Enhanced Model Performance</p>
<p>By pooling knowledge from various entities, federated learning enables the creation of robust and accurate machine learning models. The aggregated insights from diverse data sources result in better models that can benefit all participating enterprises.</p>
       Web3 Technology 
<p>Web3 technology is the next evolution of the internet, emphasizing decentralization, transparency and user ownership of data. UNISOT Web3 Supply Chain Traceability Platform, implementing Blockchain and AI in the form of Federated Learning, creates a powerful ecosystem that empowers large enterprises further.</p>
 Key Benefits of Web3 Technology: 
      <p>Decentralization and Transparency</p>
<p>Web3 technology leverages blockchain’s decentralization to create transparent and trustless interactions. In the context of supply chains, this means verifiable and auditable records of every transaction, providing unparalleled transparency for enterprises and their customers.</p>
      <p>User-Centric Data Control</p>
<p>With Web3, organizations and individuals have greater control over their data, deciding what information to share and with whom. For large enterprises collaborating on federated learning models, this user-centric approach ensures that data contributors have ownership and agency over their valuable information.</p>
       <p>UNISOT opens a world of opportunities for large enterprises seeking to optimize their supply chains, enhance operational efficiency and foster customer loyalty. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, businesses can create a seamless, transparent and secure ecosystem that drives growth and success in the modern digital landscape.</p>

<p>Framing matters. How you frame an issue or picture determines what you include and what you leave out, how the relationships between the different elements present themselves, and therefore what you focus your attention on.</p><p>The Mona Lisa’s hands are, no doubt, beautifully painted. But would this picture have achieved its iconic world-wide status if the hands were all we were looking&nbsp;at?</p><p>Today we’ve got a ‘Mona Lisa hands situation’ with personal data. The issues have been framed in such a way that the full significance and opportunity of what is unfolding is being left out of the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Two common narratives about personal data illustrate this problem. The first is the classic ‘corporate asset’ picture of personal data, which creates a story that goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Data, including personal data, is one of the modern corporation’s greatest assets because the analytics-driven insights it generates can drive innovation, improve marketing targeting, and provide competitive edge (especially if other corporations can’t get their hands on the data that you can). Therefore, the corporation needs to amass as much data as it can, and policy makers need to support corporations in these efforts as much as they can — because this is the route to economy-wide innovation and growth which will benefit us&nbsp;all.”</blockquote><p>This, basically, was thinking behind the current Government’s earlier (but now defunct) attempts to take data in “a new direction”. [LINK] It also lies behind many of today’s biggest problems as they relate to personal data including corporate agendas focused on data monetisation that drive them to invade peoples’ privacy and abuse of the power it provides. Cambridge Analytica springs to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>In response to this narrative, another counter-narrative has grown up. It goes something like&nbsp;this.</p><blockquote>“Organisations’ unrestrained collection and use of data has resulted in multiple abuses of power and privacy and an unfair share of rewards. Therefore individuals should be given more control over the data that organisations collect about them and these rights should be legally enshrined in legislation such as&nbsp;GDPR.”</blockquote><p>At one level, these two different narratives are complete opposites. The first ‘corporate asset’ narrative focuses on commercial benefits unleashed for corporations; the second ‘human rights’ narrative focuses on laws and policies designed to counter and ameliorate the harms caused by corporations’ over-zealous pursuit of financial gain.</p><p>On the other hand, they are both organisation-centric in their underlying assumptions. They both assume that what happens in the world of personal data revolves entirely around how organisations collect and use it. To this degree, they are like the Mona Lisa’s hands. They come as a pair, the one being the mirror image opposite of the&nbsp;other.</p><p>And as narratives, neither is actually ‘wrong’. They are indeed part of the picture. But focusing on them alone means missing what it has really got to&nbsp;say.</p><p>Only if you zoom out to see the bigger picture — the one that includes the Mona Lisa’s face — can the limitations of this organisation-centric framing be seen. This reframing of the narrative goes like&nbsp;this.</p> A system trapped by its&nbsp;history <p>Our current data ecosystem is trapped by its history, with its total dependence on the organisation-centric database.</p><p>With the organisation-centric database, organisations collect and generate data which they place in their systems and use to add value in various ways. The organisation-centric database was a game-changing invention. It was how the data economy developed. It is still how organisations use data to add value and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. It is immensely valuable and important.</p><p>But it has a design flaw in its very foundations. At a certain point, it cannot help but run slap-bang into the essential nature of data e.g. that data doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used; that the same data points can be used by many different parties for many different purposes.</p><p>So the way our data ecosystem has evolved means that it has hit a systemic brick wall. For the full potential of data to be realised it has to be shared. But the organisation-centric database stands in the way of&nbsp;this.</p><p>People are trying to address this problem in many ways, for example by seeking to create data ‘markets’ or ‘Open Spaces’ or initiatives around Open&nbsp;Data.</p> The problem of personal&nbsp;data <p>However, all these ways of getting round the problem hit another fundamental snag when it comes to personal data. Data use and sharing raises important questions relating to privacy, ethics and human rights. Laws such as GDPR have been passed to establish and protect individuals’ rights in these areas. It has been determined that unlike virtually every other corporate asset, personal data is not the organisation’s private property that it can do anything it likes&nbsp;with.</p><p>These issues relating to privacy, ethics, human rights and data protection are big enough when data use is restricted only to organisation-centric silos. They explode out of control once we start trying to share personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Again, many attempts have been made to address these issues, virtually all of them based on the human rights narrative summarised above. But in the end, all these attempts really do is throw sand into the gears of efficient data operations.</p> A fundamental structural question <p>What’s needed is to find a way to share data that respects individuals’ rights and retains their trust, but which also works efficiently, so that they become mutually supporting rather than mutually opposing.</p><p>This is not just a moral, ethical, human rights and governance issue. It is also a structural issue. It relates to the structure and architecture of the data ecosystem itself.</p><p>The structure of today’s organisation-centric data ecosystem is a bit like a redwood forest, full of towering trees, each a vertical silo in its own right, but without any roots connecting them in the soil. (Or you could think of this structure as a set of buildings made up only of pillars with no floors connecting them.)</p><p>Within this system, when it comes to data, individuals are tied to the organisations they have data relationships with. Their data is held by the organisation and the individual cannot go elsewhere with it. This is like the feudal system where serfs were tied to the&nbsp;land.</p> The need for a new layer of personal data infrastructure <p>To unleash the full potential of personal data — to enable safe, efficient data sharing — we need end data serfdom so that individuals can collect, store, use, manage and share their own data independently of the organisations that collect and use data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>This isn’t just about giving individuals the right to ask for their data to be ported from one siloed organisation to another, as in Open Banking. It is about equipping individuals with their own databases for their own data which operate independently of and outside of organisations’ software systems and estates. So that the data becomes the individual’s asset, as well as a corporate asset with shared rights as defined by terms of service and data sharing agreements approved by the individual.</p><p>As well as safely storing individuals’ data (for example for their own use), these personal databases need to do something else: they need to enable individuals to share their data with other parties if they wish to — including other organisations.</p><p>What this does is transform the architecture and structure of the data ecosystem. All the existing separate, isolated, parallel data silos remain just as they are, fulfilling their old functions. But a new ingredient — a new layer — is added to the system: a data sharing network with each individual acting as a data sharing node within the network, connecting that individual to all the entities she has data relationships with. This is what personal data store infrastructure does: change the structure of the system to enable safe, efficient data sharing that unleashes the full personal, social and economic potential of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>To continue the analogy from above, this new personal data store infrastructure places a new mycelial network under each of the redwood trees in the forest, enabling the exchange of nutrients and information between them — in a way that also empowers the citizen and slices through all the moral, ethical, human rights and governance issues that were previously blocking the system’s efficient working.</p> Win-win economic&nbsp;benefits <p>Economically speaking, this structural change opens the door to a productivity and innovation revolution which is potentially as big as that created by mass production in the early 20th century. (It operates by the same principles). But most people, stuck as they are with organisation-centric blinkers to their vision, simply cannot see it, just as craft producers could not see the potential of standardised parts and moving assembly&nbsp;lines.</p><p>The economic revolution arises because today’s organisation-centric silos generate massive, system-wide duplication of effort and cost. Just as craft producers were piling on cost by continually re-working every item they hand-produced in order to fit them together, so today’s organisations are each duplicating the effort and costs needed to do basically the same things with much of the same data. In the meantime, they are also massively restricting the potential uses of this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Mydex has outlined the economic opportunities opened up by the structural change we are talking about in our White Paper on<a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf"> The Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a>. Actually, there are seven different economic revolutions all bound up together in a mutually reinforcing way. But basically they boil down to a very simple insight. If individuals are equipped with tools that enable them to safely bring their own data with them to data relationships — including data previously generated and used by other organisations — then layer upon layer of duplicated cost and effort can be stripped out of the workings of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>Of course, these tools are what is provided by the personal data&nbsp;store.</p> Conclusion <p>Different frames generate different pictures which in turn create different action agendas. The ‘corporate asset’ framing of personal data creates its own particular ‘therefore’: therefore organisations need to accumulate and monetise as much data as they can. The human rights framing of personal data creates a mirror-image opposite: therefore individuals need to have legally backed rights to exert some control over what these organisations do with their data. These, together, are the Mona Lisa’s&nbsp;hands.</p><p>But if you reframe the personal data picture to include her face, in context, a very different picture emerges with an equally different ‘therefore’: therefore we need to build a person-centric, citizen-empowering view where personal data also becomes a personal asset; where every individual is equipped with their own, independent personal data store. Equipping citizens in this way should be seen as a vital 21st century infrastructure project, just as providing water, electricity, road and rail transport were seen in their&nbsp;day.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-do-you-think-of-the-mona-lisas-hands-and-other-such-problems-bfc284bee919">What do you think of the Mona Lisa’s hands?

 Introduction 
<p>Cybersecurity is no longer just about setting a strong password or having an encrypted connection. As digital threats have evolved, so too have the mechanisms to counteract them. Continuous authentication offers a fresh perspective, moving beyond the initial login verification to ensure secure identity verification a user remains genuine throughout their session.</p>
<p>How can organizations maintain top-notch security as threats become more intricate without hampering user experience? That’s exactly what we are going to cover in this blog post.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Evolving Security Paradigm: The evolution of cybersecurity from simple password-based protection to continuous authentication reflects the need for a dynamic approach that monitors user behavior throughout their session to counteract evolving threats. 
 Integration and Fortification: Continuous authentication’s strength lies in integration with other security systems, such as intrusion detection, firewalls, and SIEM, forming a multi-layered defense strategy against cyber threats and minimizing potential breaches. 
 Balancing Costs and Benefits: While initial costs are associated with implementing continuous authentication, the potential savings from preventing breaches, reducing downtimes, and enhancing user trust make it a strategic choice with a clear Return on Investment (ROI). 
 
 The Evolution of Authentication Methods 
<p>The evolution of authentication methods has responded to the ever-growing sophistication of cyber threats. Here’s a look at how these methods have developed over time:</p>
 
 Password-based authentication: Once upon a time, a strong password was deemed the gatekeeper of digital information. But as hacking tools improved, merely having a complex password combination wasn’t enough. Intruders found ways to decipher logic credentials, leading to unauthorized breaches and compromised passwords. 
 Two-factor &amp; Multi-factor authentication: Recognizing the limitations of single-password protection, the digital security community introduced multi-layered authentication verifications. This involved not only something users know (password) but also something they have (a mobile device, for instance) or something they are (biometrics). 
 Biometrics: Biometrics brought forth unique identifiers such as fingerprints, retina scans, and facial recognition. These, being unique to individuals, offered a more personalized security approach. But, even then, once authenticated, the user had unlimited access until logout. 
 
<p>Our journey in the authentication realm began with simple password systems called single-factor authentication. As threats evolved, so did the checks, leading to two-factor authentication, knowledge-based authentication (like secret questions), and possession-based authentication (like smart cards or tokens).<br>
While all these methods offer levels of protection, they’re typically static, emphasizing the need for the dynamic verification processes we see today.</p>
 Integration with Other Security Systems 
<p></p>
<p>Continuous authentication, while powerful on its own, achieves its full potential when integrated with other security systems. Here’s how such integration can fortify your defense against cyber threats:</p>
 
 Integration with Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): IDS ensures that any abnormal behavior can be flagged in real-time, even if authenticated. This proactive approach drastically reduces the window of opportunity for malicious actors. 
 Empowering Firewalls: Firewalls are the first line of defense against cyber threats. They can be more adaptive when fed with continuous authentication functionality and data, allowing them to respond quickly to potential threats. 
 Unified Dashboard with SIEM Systems: Integrating continuous authentication with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems creates a unified dashboard where multiple security events can be monitored and analyzed concurrently, ensuring no threat slips through the gaps. 
 
<p>By fusing user authentication with these vital security components, organizations can establish a multi-layered defense strategy that efficiently safeguards their digital landscape against evolving cyber risks.</p>
 Cost Implications and ROI 
<p></p>
<p>The financial implications of implementing continuous authentication are twofold:</p>
 
 First, there’s the direct cost associated with setting up the system, which includes the technology, infrastructure, and manpower. 
 Second, there are indirect savings – reduced potential losses from breaches, decreased downtimes, and enhanced user trust. 
 
<p>The ROI for continuous authentication becomes evident when weighed against the financial and reputational damage caused by data breaches – which can run into millions or even billions of dollars. For decision-makers, understanding this balance is crucial.</p>
<p>The initial investment in a continuous authentication solution can prevent far more significant potential losses, making it a strategic choice rather than just a cost.</p>
 User Education and Training 
<p>While technology forms the backbone of continuous authentication, users significantly influence its efficacy. Organizations should prioritize user education and training. By making users aware of the reasons behind constant checks and their benefits, resistance to adoption can be reduced.</p>
<p>Training sessions can familiarize users with the new processes, helping them understand the nuances and the importance of their role in this system. Cultivating a security-first mindset ensures that the authentication system functions seamlessly and that individual users are partners in the organization’s security endeavors, not just passive participants.</p>
 Future Innovations in Continuous Authentication 
<p>The realm of continuous authentication is ripe for innovations. With advancements in AI, the capacity for real-time behavioral analysis is set to grow exponentially.</p>
<p>Biometrics, too, is seeing a surge in research, with possibilities ranging from gait analysis to biometric authentication to heartbeat recognition.</p>
<p>The most exciting frontier is quantum computing. With its ability to process vast amounts of data at unprecedented speeds, quantum computers can revolutionize how the authentication process analyzes and responds to potential cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Such advancements ensure that continuous authentication remains adaptive, evolving with the ever-shifting cybersecurity landscape.</p>
 Comparison with Traditional Methods 
<p>Continuous authentication methods and traditional methods clearly distinguish their efficacy. Traditional methods, like single-factor authentication, rely on one-time checks, making them susceptible to breaches post-verification.</p>
<p>In contrast, continuous authentication remains vigilant throughout a user session, offering dynamic protection. While traditional methods might be less resource-intensive upfront, they can be costly in the long run, given their vulnerability to breaches.</p>
<p>Continuous risk-based authentication, with its initial investment, offers a more fortified defense. For organizations making a choice, the question becomes: “Is it more prudent to invest now and be secure or save now and risk potential breaches?”</p>
<p>Now that we got familiar with the evolution of authentication methods let’s explore deeper what Continuous Authentication exactly is.</p>
 Understanding Continuous Authentication 
<p>Unlike earlier methods, continuous risk-based authentication isn’t a one-time identity verification. It actively and unobtrusively monitors users, ensuring they’re who they claim to be every second of their session. This approach enhances security and aligns with the modern demand for seamless user experiences.</p>
<p>The fundamental cornerstone of this method is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-based_authentication">risk-based authentication</a>. Instead of merely accepting a user post-login, the system consistently evaluates the risk associated with the user’s behavior and actions. Depending on the perceived threat, it either allows access or triggers additional security measures.</p>
 Specific Threats Continuous Authentication Mitigates 
<p>Continuous authentication addresses several modern-day cyber threats that more traditional authentication methods might overlook.</p>
<p>One looming threat is session hijacking, where a malefactor takes over a user’s session post-authentication. This method bypasses initial login checks, making continuous verification crucial.</p>
<p>Then there’s the risk posed by insiders – employees with malicious intent or compromised accounts. User authentication helps detect unusual behavioral patterns, ensuring that an insider doesn’t misuse their privileges.</p>
<p>Lastly, while credentials might be compromised, mimicking user behavior throughout a session is a tall order, making continuous checks a robust deterrent against such breaches.</p>
<p>Now that we have a brief understanding of what continuous authentication is, let’s delve into key components of how it works.</p>
 How Continuous Authentication Works 
<p>Continuous account Authentication offers a sophisticated and dynamic approach to verifying identities. This multi-faceted process leverages various techniques and factors to ensure ongoing user validation:</p>
 
 Behavioral Biometrics: Everyone has unique ways they interact with their devices. Some might type rapidly, others more deliberately. These interactions, like keystroke dynamics or mouse movement patterns, are invaluable for continuous verification behavioral biometric authentication. These patterns remain consistent over time and are challenging to replicate. 
 Contextual Attributes: The context surrounding user activity offers numerous clues. Is the user logging in from a previously unrecognized device? Is the IP address from a different country than usual? Such deviations can indicate a potential breach of user identity verification and are considered in real-time by continuous authentication systems. 
 Time-based Patterns: Humans are creatures of habit. If an employee routinely accesses the system during office hours, a sudden login at an odd hour could be considered suspicious behavior. Continual monitoring allows for instant risk assessment based on these patterns. 
 Machine Learning &amp; AI: The beauty of continuous authentication lies in its learning capabilities. Using AI, the system adapts to evolving and continuous user authentication behaviors, ensuring that genuine activities are rarely flagged and anomalies are swiftly identified. 
 
 Continuous Authentication with Typing Biometrics 
<p>Typing biometrics offers a unique dimension to continuous authentication. It isn’t merely about the password entered but how it’s typed: the rhythm, speed, and finger pressure used by keystrokes – can be as unique as a fingerprint.</p>
<p>The technology captures these nuances, creating a behavioral profile for users. Over time, systems recognize this pattern, ensuring that replicating the typing pattern becomes a formidable challenge even if someone knows your password. When integrated into continuous user authentication frameworks, such biometric data provides a dynamic layer of security that’s subtle and powerful.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it’s time to look deeper into the advantages of continuous authentication and what makes it a very important security solution.</p>
 Advantages of Continuous Authentication 
<p>Here are some of the most common advantages of continuous user authentication:</p>
 
 Enhanced Security: Continuous authentication is akin to having a security guard who doesn’t just check IDs at the entrance and ensures only authorized personnel act within the premises. Continuously verifying users minimizes the window of opportunity for malicious activities. 
 User Experience: One of the main drawbacks of heightened security has often been compromised user experience. Continuous user authentication sidesteps this by working seamlessly in the background, ensuring constant security checks do not inconvenience genuine users. 
 Adaptable Security: Different users might present different risk levels. Continuous authentication scales its scrutiny based on perceived risk, ensuring that high-risk actions get attention. 
 Reduction in False Alarms: Traditional systems might flag genuine actions as threats, leading to unnecessary disruptions. By understanding the user better, continuous authentication reduces such false positives. 
 
<p>Embracing these benefits of continuous authentication fortifies an organization’s defenses and paves the way for a more intuitive user experience. Yet, as with any evolving technology, specific challenges warrant consideration.</p>
 Challenges and Concerns 
<p>While the merits of continuous authentication are undeniable, it’s essential to approach this method with a holistic perspective. No matter how advanced, every technology comes with its challenges. Recognizing these concerns ensures that organizations are better prepared to address them:</p>
 
 Privacy Concerns: Continuous monitoring, though for a noble cause, can raise eyebrows. Users might feel their privacy is invaded, leading to resistance against its implementation. 
 Technical Hurdles: Implementing continuous authentication is more than just a plug-and-play affair. It demands a synergy of advanced tech infrastructure and skilled personnel to integrate it seamlessly. 
 False Flags: No system is foolproof. There might be instances where genuine user actions are misconstrued as anomalies, leading to unwarranted security measures. 
 
<p>While these concerns present valid roadblocks, understanding them is the first step in addressing and mitigating potential issues. The ongoing evolution of continuous authentication hints at a transformative horizon.</p>
 Compliance with Security Standards 
<p>Adopting continuous authentication isn’t just about fortifying defenses; it’s also about aligning with global security standards. For instance, under GDPR, organizations must ensure data protection by design and default.</p>
<p>Continuous authentication aids in fulfilling this mandate. Similarly, adhering to HIPAA standards becomes paramount for industries dealing with healthcare data. Implementing ongoing checks can significantly reduce unauthorized data breaches, ensuring compliance. Non-adherence to such measures can lead to hefty penalties and reputational damage, making the case for continuous authentication even stronger.</p>
<p>All tech solutions need user acceptance and buy-in, irrespective of their brilliance. For continuous authentication work on an organization-wide rollout, users need to understand and appreciate the value continuous authentication brings.</p>
<p>So, keeping those challenges and concerns in mind, what is the future of continuous authentication and different continuous authentication methods? Let’s look into that next.</p>
 Future of Continuous Authentication 
<p>Continuous authentication stands out as a beacon, signaling the direction in which secure user verification might head. What does the horizon hold for this emerging authentication method? Let’s speculate on the coming developments:</p>
 
 Predictive Analytics: The next frontier is not just to identify but also to predict. Systems can anticipate and ward off threats by understanding user behavior patterns and behaviors before they materialize. 
 IoT Integration: With the proliferation of intelligent devices, the boundaries of what needs protection have expanded. Continuous authentication solutions can be pivotal in ensuring these devices remain uncompromised in a hyper-connected environment. 
 Broader Applications: E-commerce platforms can leverage this tech to ensure transactional security, enhancing trust and minimizing fraud. 
 
<p>The horizon for continuous authentication seems promising, teeming with innovations and enhancements. As we advance, it becomes imperative for organizations not just to understand its potential but also to take proactive steps toward its implementation.</p>
 Implementing Continuous Authentication in Your Organization 
<p>The journey from traditional password-based systems to continuous authentication can appear daunting for many organizations. However, the transition can be smooth and rewarding with a structured approach and clear roadmap. If you’re contemplating the incorporation of continuous authentication within your organization, here are a few actionable steps:</p>

<p>You should own your thoughts.</p><p>This may seem like an odd statement. "Of course, I own my thoughts," you think to yourself. But when you take those thoughts and enter them into a notes app, are you always guaranteed access to those ideas?</p><p>Most note-taking apps are centralized tools. If a company that runs the app goes out of business, users lose all of their content - that's years of valuable insights.</p><p>And what if you become unhappy with the direction the app is taking, and you wish to take your notes to one that has more of the features you desire? Good luck trying to switch seamlessly. It's unlikely that the apps will interoperate with each other, leaving you stuck spending countless hours trying to reconfigure your notes on the new platform.</p><p>Furthermore, since these centralized apps are walled gardens, your friends and connections are left behind, leaving you missing out on the social aspect of shared note-taking.</p><p>But the web wasn't always this way.</p><p>It started as a way for researchers and academics to share information worldwide. Distributed nodes were established at institutions and universities, enabling users to uncover important insights faster and make breakthroughs. Everything interoperated because it was built on open protocols, and data always stayed with the user first.</p><p>How can we return to this way of working and collaborating on the web?</p><p>That was the question <a href="https://twitter.com/gordonbrander">Gordon Brander</a> and <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@cdata@mastodon.social">Chris Joel</a> had two years ago. Brander and Joel wanted to find a way to build a worldwide knowledge graph that would empower users to own their thoughts and surface connections that they wouldn't have otherwise realized were there, all while connecting with others to work more efficiently.</p> Open Protocols and Their Benefits <p>Brander and Joel started building Subconscious, a local-first decentralized note-taking app. They began with the protocol that would power the app - Noosphere. Noosphere is permissionless and open source, like HTTP or IMAP; anyone can build on top of it. That means even if the Subconscious app goes away one day, anyone running the Noosphere protocol can resurrect it. Content AND contacts can also move with the user to another platform built on Noosphere, creating a <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fcredible%2520exit&amp;utm_medium=reader2">credible exit</a>. </p><p>All the content users create is stored on IPFS. IPFS uses content-addressable data created by a cryptographic hashing process that generates a unique identifier (CID). The CID acts as a hard link that points to a specific version of a file. This data structure enables two important things - distributed file storage and version control.</p><p>Distributed file storage makes the Subconscious app more resilient and able to work offline and local-first. And since IPFS is a shared resource with high adoption in both the Web3 and DWeb spaces, this is another reassurance that the user's notes are safe. </p><p>Version control allows Subconscious to create a daisy chain of edits synced across all devices. Furthermore, users can use this structure to review previous versions if they need to restore their notes or memo to an earlier state.</p><p>Data is linked using hypertext. These integrated hyperlinks enable users to build their knowledge networks. </p> The Heart of Subconscious - Notes, Memos, and Spheres <p>Noosphere is a protocol made up of networked "spheres." Your sphere is your portable data backpack. Spheres contain your content as "notes" and "memos". </p><p>Like a letter envelope, memos wrap your notes and add some additional metadata, including an IPFS content ID that points to the version history for that file (the previous version of that memo). Subconscious puts note files in memos, but you can put any file in a memo, making Noosphere a versatile tool. </p><p>Spheres also contain contacts, similar to an address book of other spheres you follow. </p><p>Finally, spheres are not a server. They are a data structure that lives on your device (local first) and on IPFS. That means your sphere is decentralized, and you always have your data. And spheres are signed with your cryptographic key, so they are secure and can be verified as belonging to you.</p><p>Subconscious users can delegate and revoke access to their spheres anytime because the tool utilizes <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCANs</a>. Created by Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, UCANs handle authorization in distributed systems by leveraging capabilities rather than ACLs. Users delegate their capabilities rather than their keys, making it very secure. Each agent in the system identifies itself using a keypair, and the user delegates capabilities (permissions) to the keypair. </p> In Summary <p>Subconscious is open source and transparent and provides users with a credible exit. No walled gardens or predatory privacy policies leaving users feeling powerless with few viable alternatives. &nbsp;Open source protocols that bring transparency and trust are utilized to thwart centralization.</p><p>Users don't sacrifice the multi-player experience. Subconscious users will enjoy networked intelligence effects when they follow other users, making connections and gleaning insights that might have otherwise eluded them. This will amplify users' productivity, creativity, and ability to collectively solve big problems.</p> Getting Started <p>Subconscious is now in <a href="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/subconscious-beta">beta</a>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9l6eo5KQiEuT9JuomtTagd8DU37b6fXUrqlKbSWRfBBP-Bg/viewform">Join the waitlist</a>! </p><p></p><p></p>

<div class='wrap'>

 We sit down with the financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach to discuss why he left the police force, how criminal investigations have changed over time, the importance of education and accountability in an anti-fraud strategy, and why he would never become a KYC specialist. 



 



<p>Paul Stratton has always wanted to be a police officer. In fact, during a recent house clean-up, his wife discovered a childhood picture of Paul and his brother dressed up as characters from ‘Chips’ (an 80’s TV show about two motorcycle officers from the California Highway Patrol).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after 22 years of working for Merseyside Police, including almost four years in the Fraud Unit, Paul knew he had to leave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It got to the point where I was struggling with the lack of team ethos and internal politics. Before moving to the Fraud Unit, I was investigating domestic abuse, violent crimes, and sexual offences, and was starting to feel like an Uber driver, where the next job would just pop up in my inbox. I just didn’t have time to follow up as much as I wanted to with the people I had helped and that always bothered me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Victim care is something that the police talk a lot about and I think it’s just become a soundbite. I don’t think we are doing as well as we could with victim care in certain areas of policing, and it frustrated me to just follow up with phone calls.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Little wonder then, that Paul left the police to pursue a career in fraud and financial crime training and raising awareness of the harm of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of education, accountability, and tangible messaging in the battle against fraud was a recurring theme in our discussion, as Paul believes a lack of consistent education – to the public, to the police, and the wider public sector – is a significant issue in the UK’s fight against fraud attacks. These rates, Paul believes, will not go down until that education gap is filled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the UK’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">recently-released fraud strategy</a>, Paul said:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>You can create the best strategy in the world, but it’ll just collect cyber dust unless there’s tangible messaging that is shared with the public. There’s no real messaging, and that’s where I fear it’ll fail.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>“We can’t hold departments accountable because, besides the general aim to reduce fraud by 10% by 2025, there are no specific figures [that they wish to hit] or how they’re going to do it,&nbsp;and no one knows what they’re tangibly supposed to be doing. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-outlines-his-five-key-priorities-for-2023">British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak set out his five priorities for 2023</a>, and, like them or not, they are clear, so why aren’t we doing something similar with the UK’s fraud strategy?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss everything from Paul’s skepticism regarding the strategy’s 400 promised new fraud officers, why he hates words like ‘scams’, ‘white collar crime’, and ‘money mules’, and why we’re still probably one or two generations away from fully recognizing the impact of social media and acting upon the dangers of online crime.</p>



 From detective at Merseyside Police to fraud specialist at Liverpool City Council, and currently, a full-time fraud apprenticeship coach and fraud and financial crime trainer, why the career change, and what are the main differences and similarities in roles, if any? 



<p>I spent 22 years with Merseyside Police, and never wanted to leave, in fact I still consider myself police, but I had to leave as I knew there had to be something better out there. Somewhere where a work/life balance is achievable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I brought the same principles and work ethic into my role at Liverpool City Council. In fact, it was working at the Council where I learned the most about fraud, corruption, bribery, conflicts of interest, gifts and hospitality, social media, KYC, and all the other typical red flags you look out for in police investigations.&nbsp;</p>



 What did a typical day look like at Liverpool County Council? 



<p>I oversaw the Whistle Blowing process, reviewing, and allocating cases, and I was the lead investigator for all allegations of internal fraud and potential criminal activity. I was also part of the council’s effective Due Diligence Group and developed the council’s new Fighting Fraud &amp; Corruption Together strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2020-2021, Liverpool City Council received a lot of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/nov/25/scale-of-problems-at-liverpool-city-council-revealed-in-commissioners-report">bad press</a> due to claims of widespread corruption, which led to numerous police investigations and government intervention.</p>



<p>I started my role just after the controversy started, so a lot of my work was focused on trying to bring Liverpool City Council to a point where there was that awareness of fraud and best practices. So, I would work virtually every day on building and delivering educational and engaging training sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We talk a lot about anti-fraud culture, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/counter-fraud-culture-uk/">counter-fraud culture </a>– that’s a phrase that’s bandied around. But anti-fraud culture is a difficult thing to achieve, as that would mean everybody knows about fraud, and how to prevent it and protect themselves from it.</p>



 What led you to leave the Council and launch your fraud and financial crime training and consultancy business? 



<p>It’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I am committed to providing quality training to delegates. Long gone are the days when trainers could just sit in front of a PowerPoint and talk for an hour. It must be immersive, with tasks, real-life examples, and problem-solving sessions. People want, need, and deserve more. This is especially true in the public sector, where there’s very little money to train people, so when a trainer does come in, it’s vital they deliver the best learning they can.</p>



 How have criminal investigations and intelligence operations changed in the two-plus decades since you began? 



<p>Since I started, back in 1998, it’s changed dramatically. For example, when I joined there was very little education on evidence-gathering at a scene, but now, with technology, recruits are even receiving Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) and social media training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether it’s over Facebook (which it inevitably is), or Instagram or Twitter, investigators need to know and understand how to secure digital evidence. That’s where a lot of the crime exists now. It’s not in person anymore – it’s online.</p>



 Would you say the perception of fraud has changed over the years? 



<p>Yes and no. When I started in the police, the Fraud Unit, which was called the Cheque and Fraud Wing, would only deal with cases of a certain amount; it had to be of high value for them to even become involved.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Some police forces, like Merseyside Police, have now shifted to harm-based assessments, where they look at the harm caused by fraud. Yes, the monetary amount is important, but it’s not everything.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>For example, £1 million in losses to a huge organization is a speed bump in relation to a single parent losing £500 in a month and being unable to pay the rent. You see this with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance frauds</a>, where people lose everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think the perception of fraud can be too rarefied; we think ‘fraud’, we think “white collar crime,” and it’s a phrase I can’t stand, because many equate “white collar crime” with a business crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last suspect I ever interviewed before I left the police was a young lad involved in a gang that were dealing drugs and other types of criminal activities like selling fake Liverpool and Everton tickets. And they were doing all that through a bank account they’d created with the name of a vulnerable neighbor, and had done it horrifically easily at the time. There are increasing numbers of gangs moving into fraud and money laundering now.</p>



 What are your thoughts on the UK’s recently-released fraud strategy? Do you think it goes far enough, and is dedicating resources in the right place? 



<p>I think anything that looks at reducing fraud is a good thing. However, [in the strategy] there are a lot of new names for old teams, and reinventing the wheel somewhat, but that’s often law enforcement’s way. We go from priority to priority. You won’t have a burglary team for two years, but then you have a huge burglary problem, so you assemble a burglary squad and solve that problem, then move onto something else. Such is the lack of resources to specialize in everything at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the things that I’m skeptical about is the government’s pledge to get 400 new specialist investigators. I don’t think these can be existing police officers, as no police force has enough staff to do what they need to do right now. So, I’m not sure where any new fraud specialists are going to come from, and whether they’re going to be trained or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I also don’t think the fraud strategy factors in the educational component. The strategy may be on gov.uk, but are people seeing it in any kind of usable format?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are we doing enough education-wise with the public? I can’t ever remember seeing an advert on fraud prevention from the government. I see adverts about giving to charity and how people can spend money, but I don’t see adverts on how people can protect their money.</p>



 In the Foreword to the strategy, Home Secretary, Suella Braverman spoke of the need for coordinated collaboration between the police, the public and private sectors, as well as allies abroad. In your opinion, what is the most important component of a successful fraud strategy? Conversely, what hinders or can negatively impact the strategy, or a fraud investigation? 



<p>Intelligence sharing between the public and private sector and international arena is nothing new. The fact that, in 2023, we’re still talking about better intelligence sharing shows how far behind we are. From an investigator’s point of view, the mechanisms already exist for effective intel sharing. We have the National Crime Agency, which does a lot for police forces when they’re investigating abroad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, if I was investigating bank accounts or looking to get an IP address, we have Financial Intelligence Units that can act in the international arena. We have the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/financial-action-task-force-fatf/">Financial Action Task Force</a> for money laundering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We need to look at how this affects investigators, and how we can make their jobs easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I know they’ve assigned an MP (Member of Parliament) with the role of Anti-Fraud Champion [Anthony Browne, MP], which is fantastic, but I think it needs to be more effective than just naming someone a champion. Is giving this role to one MP enough? How is he going to do that amongst his constituency work, and other responsibilities? (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Read more about the UK’s Anti-Fraud Champion, Anthony Browne here</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Fraud accounts for 40% of all crime, 80% of that fraud is cyber. If this was burglary (or firearms), I can guarantee there’d be more press, and people would understand what steps the government is taking, and people would be more educated.</p>Paul Stratton, financial crime trainer and apprenticeship coach.</blockquote>



<p>But, for some reason, fraud is just not considered as severe. It’s almost perceived as a sort of invisible crime, where a lot of victims may report it but be too embarrassed to tell people about it.</p>



<p>For example, with romance fraud, many people may think the victim has brought it on themselves and should have been wiser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t like the term ‘money mules’; I call them money movers. I also don’t like the word ‘scam,’ people do not ‘fall for scams.’ They are defrauded by criminals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People may have a lack of empathy when they hear “falling for a scam,” and think how could they send £500 pounds to someone they’ve never met? Well, that’s the way of the world now – that’s how we meet people in 2023. We’ve moved on; we’re probably one or two generations away from a full understanding of the impact of social media.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People now spend their lives online; on LinkedIn, on Instagram, everything’s done over email, if someone even rings you now, you think there’s a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s the same with fraud and understanding the full effects of it. I don’t think we’re going to get over the “How could they fall for that scam” for a couple of generations because people just think, “Well, I met my partner in person or I still bank in branch,” and it doesn’t work like that. Those days are gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s for the same reason that people don’t like to be called “victims.” In the police, we call them complainants because they are complaining about a crime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Words matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 
 Apparently, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1154660/Fraud_Strategy_2023.pdf">just </a>1% of police resources are dedicated to tackling fraud, despite fraud accounting for 40% of all crime in the UK.&nbsp; Why do you think fraud is such a neglected area? 



<p><a href="https://www.actionfraud.police.uk">Action Fraud</a> has had a lot of bad press, and I don’t think people actually understand what they do. Not to diminish their work at all, but Action Fraud is like a call center and data warehouse. People call up and make a complaint; they’re not staffed by experts, or detectives or fraud experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What hinders the effectiveness of Action Fraud is that we don’t tell people what Action Fraud is or manage people’s expectations enough to say that the complaint may not be investigated. So, when they get a letter a few weeks later, saying that the complaint is not being investigated, with no explanation, it’s tough. Whether it’s £50 or £5 million, you deserve a reason why the suspected crime isn’t being investigated, and you would get that if you were assaulted, for example. [<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">Action Fraud will be replaced in Q2, 2024 with a new division. Read more about how it fits into the UK’s wider fraud revamp here.</a>]</p>

 And that understandably has an impact on future reporting habits? 



<p>Of course, people just won’t bother reporting fraud. For years, victim support has been around the physical: assaults, sexual offenses, murders. But what do we do for people suffering financial and emotional loss because of romance fraud? Not enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What most hinders an investigation, however, are the low numbers of staff, and inadequate training. Officers, detectives, and investigators all need to be trained, whether that’s in document fraud, cybercrime, or how to find an IP address from an email. Unfortunately, this is not always the case in the public sector, with local authorities. Although this is being changed with the recent <a href="https://findapprenticeshiptraining.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/courses/503">Counter Fraud Investigator Apprenticeship</a>.</p>



 I suppose if complainants believe they are unlikely to receive any of the stolen funds back, then this would also have a knock-on effect in reporting rates? 



<p>Yes, you’re right, the ease with which <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/proceeds-of-crime-act-poca/">Proceeds of Crime </a>(stolen funds) can be moved around into multiple bank accounts is scary.&nbsp; A lot of people may think that if it’s only £100, they won’t report it, because they’re not going to get their money back, and it’s more effort than it’s worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once that money is spent, even if the perpetrator is caught, it’s very difficult to get it back.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s say the perpetrator resides in the UK, and you get them, the likelihood is they’re doing it for a reason: because they have no money or they’re greedy, so they’ll just spend it. It may not bother them if they get convicted, because they’re not going to get a job where they need a DBS check anyway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless of how much money has been lost, that shouldn’t necessarily factor into the decision to a) report it, and b) investigate it. We must look at harm. Unfortunately, currently, Action Fraud just does not do that.</p>



 The fraud strategy has earmarked £100 million for additional police resources. Is that enough? 



<p>No, it’s not; we lose millions of pounds every day to fraud. Again, it’s not the amount, it’s where it’s going.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Putting maybe one more detective into a fraud squad will take the pressure off, and really help get more positive outcomes, but I think there needs to be real education, and refresher courses on, for example, the blockchain. Can some of the money be used to procure external services, and bring someone in to talk about it? We just don’t know. Can we bring experts in to help the police with investigations, because we don’t know everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there’s a balance to strike, and you don’t want to saturate people with information on fraud and get people scared. Perhaps the best approach would be to properly publicize new fraud initiatives that show how the money is being used. Help teachers get training on fraud prevention, train doctors in how to deal with the mental health ramifications of fraud.</p>



 Education is a recurring theme, as is responsibility. Responsibility of the government to educate people, responsibility of victims to report complaints. What about companies and service providers, where does the responsibility lie there? What role will technology, and in particular KYC and identity verification services, play in the future of fraud prevention? 



<p>They bear a huge responsibility, don’t they? Having recently been onboarded by a company, it’s all completely digital now, isn’t it? One of the cases I dealt with before I left the police was with a new online bank, where a lot of criminals were using their friends’ photographs, passports and licenses to open bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Knowing Your Customer (KYC)</a> is everything really. And, it’s not just knowing your customer, it’s knowing your applicants, and knowing your staff. It’s having all these things in place, especially in recruitment, as document fraud is rampant, so it’s a huge responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You’ll have KYC specialists in banks, but what about the public sector and other private companies? In recruitment, for example, you’re relying on recruitment staff – are they getting the training they need? Are they all aware of the threats of fraud? Do they understand what KYC is?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I can only speak from the public sector, but the public sector and local authorities can learn a huge amount from banks and a huge amount from the private sector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From a fraud investigator’s point of view, I think it’s going to get harder and harder, because long gone are the days where an applicant or consumer must come to a business, and if you’re opening a bank account nowadays, it’ll be online, and you don’t have to see anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t envy KYC staff – let’s put it that way. It’s not a job I’d like to do; there’s a lot of risk on their shoulders to develop, keep themselves regularly updated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this technological age, it’s also important to remember that fraud is about people as much as it’s about AI and machine learning. Someone must press that button at the start, and someone must be a victim at the end.</p>

  <p>Divestitures, dissolution of partnerships, and other business <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/split-up.asp">split-ups</a> are rarely fun, but they do happen and can have significant implications for your digital assets. Whatever the reason for a business split-up, it's important to prioritize digital security.</p>

<p>The average <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">data breach in the U.S.</a> costs a company $9.4 million. Your digital assets need to be protected before, during, and after the split.</p>
	
 What are digital assets and why are they vulnerable to cyberattacks? 
	
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/digital-asset-framework.asp">Digital assets</a> are any virtual item created and maintained/stored online. They're identifiable to your particular company or someone within your company, and they're of a certain value. Digital assets also must be searchable and discoverable, typically through metadata.</p>

<p>During business split-ups, you have to take inventory of all of your digital assets and who may have access to them. You also have to preemptively determine how hackers could exploit vulnerabilities to find and exfiltrate data and assets that could be of value to bad actors — or damaging to your company. You never want to think your former business partner would use sensitive information against your company, but it happens, often accidentally.</p>
 Best practices for protecting your digital assets 

<p>When separating your business, it's wise to implement <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-and-access-management">identity and access management</a> (IAM) best practices. Some of these include:</p>

  Requiring <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA) 
   Implementing single sign-on (SSO) 
   Managing authorization 
   Ensuring the right identities have access only to the appropriate resources, and nothing more, through <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> 
  Strategies for enhancing your security posture 
	
<p>You may already have a strong foundation of IAM best practices in place. Even so, there are tools that help you keep your accounts secure, particularly in the instance of a business split-up.</p>
	
 Institute a cybersecurity policy 
	
<p>A shareable, company-wide cybersecurity policy should be available in times of dissolution. Set it up as soon as possible, even if there's no business split-up planned for the foreseeable future. In the event that one does happen, you'll then have something to refer to and mark off as a sort of checklist to ensure all your cybersecurity bases are covered.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity policy for digital assets during business split-ups should include some of the following:</p>

  A list of all accounts managed by your organization 
   A list of all third parties with and their access privileges 
   A guide for managing account access 
   When to revoke account access upon dissolution 
   Risk assessment instructions 
   An acceptable use policy (AUP) that parties have to sign 
   A response plan in the event of a data breach 
 <p>You can find variations of these types of policies online, but tailor them to your specific situation. Have an overall cybersecurity policy and include a section on business divestiture or dissolution, or make a separate document for this entirely. The important thing is that the right people in the organization have access to this policy to refer to as needed.</p>
	
 Implement strong authentication 
	
<p>Strong authentication practices are a hallmark of cybersecurity. While many organizations continue to rely on username and password combinations for authentication, this practice is known to be risky. For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been unauthorized access, which is another way of saying the use of stolen credentials.</p>

<p>For environments where passwords remain in use, the first line of defense is to require strong and unique passwords for every account, and changing them regularly (and immediately in the event of a business split).</p>

<p>Attackers often use "brute-force" techniques to guess weak passwords, including using random password generators to guess passwords rapidly, or by simply guessing the password due to its weak nature — for example, if the password is "password1234" or "Qwerty!" Despite stronger enterprise policies, employees commonly use such weak, guessable passwords, and use them for multiple accounts. These practices expose your organization to risk, as hackers also frequently turn to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/glossary-page#Credential-Stuffing">credential stuffing</a>, which is the practice of using credentials for one account to gain access to other accounts.</p>

<p>A better approach to strong authentication is <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>, which can reduce the risk of a data breach following a business dissolution. By eliminating passwords and replacing their use with biometrics, like fingerprints or facial scanning, passwordless offers are far more secure way to ensure that only the right account holders can access your digital assets.</p>

<p>Another way to strengthen security is through risk-based authentication, which uses AI to detect unusual behavior. For example, a legitimate employee may sign in to an account using the correct credentials and a trusted device, but the location is unusual. An <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">AI-driven tool</a> would automatically flag such a request and require additional authentication steps during that first attempt. If the login attempt is deemed a high risk, it is automatically blocked or redirected for analysis.</p>

 Eliminate identity silos 
	
<p>Identity silos occur when different systems, applications, or business units have disparate identity systems that don't talk to each other. What you need is an enterprise-wide view of all your identities and their access permissions, no matter where they are connecting or where the assets they seek are hosted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/iam-for-hybrid-enterprise">Hybrid IAM</a> is the way to unify and secure all your digital identities and access requests whether your data and resources are running on-premises, in public and private clouds, or all of the above.</p>
	
<p>By implementing a modern <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-and-access-management-platform">identity platform</a>, you can manage and protect digital assets, even if you have a hybrid work model or are moving to a different business workflow process along with the divestiture.</p>

<p>Blog post by Apillon&nbsp;below</p> The joint initiative by Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet marks another step towards simplification of Web3&nbsp;UX.   What is&nbsp;w3ndi?  How does w3ndi&nbsp;work?  Apillon, KILT Protocol, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces   What is&nbsp;w3ndi? <p>w3ndi (you can call it Wendi, too) is an Apillon-built decentralized index of digital accounts that links your web3name (w3n) by KILT Protocol with your digital addresses. It currently supports Polkadot (including KILT and other parachain address types) and other popular chains, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>With w3ndi, you can browse digital wallet accounts tied to your web3name, KILT’s human-readable format for DIDs (decentralized identifiers). The addresses can be differentiated by chains and tags, and thanks to easy browsing via w3n, replace copy-pasting of lengthy, meaningless strings of alphanumeric characters and simplify crypto transfers.</p><p>The first app to integrate w3ndi is Nova&nbsp;Wallet.</p> Why w3ndi and how does it&nbsp;work? <p><a href="https://blog.apillon.io/why-web3-needs-a-ux-framework-e0db6806a579">UX is a huge friction point of Web3</a>. Everyone is familiar with using lengthy strings of characters and numbers, double-checking just the first and the last few ones, if at all. Too often, users neglect their responsibility to verify addresses, which could even lead to <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1686764372616515585">funds drain</a>. Or, they verify a recipient’s address by first transferring a small test amount before moving larger crypto numbers. But users are hardly to blame. Clumsy UX&nbsp;is.</p><p>The user interface of dapps has come a long way since the early days of Web3, with new solutions that stay true to the principles of decentralization while going easy on end users. KILT has redefined how we think of decentralized digital identity by introducing W3C-compliant DIDs, how we attach and attest its components (digital addresses included), and how we represent DIDs in a human-readable, memorable form with <a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/web3names/">web3name</a>(w3n).</p><p>A few months ago, KILT <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/send-funds-to-a-web3name-via-nova-wallet-b3182457c90b">partnered with Nova Wallet</a> to allow for easy user and digital address search. However, <a href="https://docs.novawallet.io/nova-wallet-wiki/help-and-support/associate-address-with-web3name">the initial process of associating addresses with web3name</a> required users to master certain technical skills.</p><p>Now, a more user-friendly w3n-address linking method has come to life with&nbsp;w3ndi.</p><p>Link addresses once, and use them as you go with just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p> w3ndi app by&nbsp;Apillon <p>w3ndi simplifies the process of attaching digital wallet addresses to your DID and w3n by KILT, ultimately, your digital identity.</p><p>The first integration of the w3ndi app by Apillon is live on <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a>, a leading crypto wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem. With w3ndi enhancing the Nova UX, you can easily find peers in the Web3 community by their web3name, and initiate transactions without having to know or double-check the exact and complete alphanumeric strings of their addresses.</p> How does it&nbsp;work? <p>The free-to-use w3ndi app is accessible at <a href="https://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi.apillon.io</a>.</p><p>Once you connect with your Sporran wallet from KILT and select the digital identity represented by your DID or w3n by KILT, you can start attaching your digital wallet addresses from multiple networks and create a self-sovereign wallet registry under a single&nbsp;name.</p><p>Using tags, you can differentiate between various-purpose addresses, e.g. Friends and family, Business, Charity, etc. You can also choose to make an address work on multiple&nbsp;chains.</p><p>In the process of linking w3n with digital addresses, w3ndi generates a JSON file containing identifiers for different wallet addresses that you attached to your web3name on the KILT parachain. To ensure unstoppable access, the file is stored on <a href="https://ipfs.tech/">IPFS</a> and pinned via <a href="https://crust.network/">Crust Network</a>. Find w3ndi on GitHub&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Apillon-web3/w3ndi-app">here</a>.</p><p>With w3ndi on Nova Wallet, your human-readable w3n nickname opens up an index of all your linked digital addresses. Thanks to added tags, you can easily differentiate accounts and mitigate the risk of interacting with the wrong&nbsp;one.</p><p>To send funds, simply type in the recipient’s w3n using “w3n:[name]” and select an account based on its tag. Or, to receive a deposit, let the sender know your w3n and the tag that defines the correct address. All in just a few&nbsp;clicks.</p><p>In Nova Wallet, w3ndi makes digital asset exchange seamless and user-friendly. When integrated into other apps, w3ndi could expand its usability of linking human-readable w3n with digital addresses.</p><p>Learn step-by-step how to use w3ndi&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.apillon.io/guide-use-w3ndi-to-connect-your-digital-addresses-to-w3n-by-kilt-and-use-it-in-nova-wallet-de98a1289aae">here</a>.</p> Fully decentralized <p>As you save and deploy an address in w3ndi, the address index file is pinned to IPFS via Crust with a unique CID, enabling the w3n name resolution service and keeping it fully decentralized.</p><p>Each time you change or add a new address, the address pointers change, too, and a new unique CID is generated.</p><p>If you decide to delete all addresses, you must deploy changes, resulting in an empty w3n name resolution. Keep in mind that the minimal period of file pinning is six months, so files are deleted only after that period has&nbsp;passed.</p> Apillon, KILT, and Nova Wallet joining&nbsp;forces <p>w3ndi is a result of collaboration among three Polkadot projects, each contributing its distinct qualities:</p>  <a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT Protocol</a> powers decentralized digital identities via DIDs and web3names (w3n)  <a href="http://w3ndi.apillon.io/">w3ndi by Apillon</a> builds up registries of digital addresses linked to a user’s w3n by&nbsp;KILT  <a href="https://novawallet.io/">Nova Wallet</a> integrates w3ndi’s w3n registries as an enhanced UX functionality  <p>In addition, Crust Network supplies <a href="https://wiki.apillon.io/build/2-web3-services.html#web3-storage">decentralized storage</a> and pins w3ndi’s index JSON file on IPFS, ensuring permanent access to the owner of the file’s&nbsp;link.</p><p>Try w3ndi on Nova Wallet today, and use your w3n by KILT for seamless crypto transfers.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a blockchain protocol for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, providing secure, practical identity solutions for enterprise, government and consumers.

 Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) — Provable, Decentralized Cross-chain Communication  Written by Mike Toutonghi, lead developer of the Verus Protocol.  How it&nbsp;started <p>Bitcoin proved that decentralized, secure, permissionless and provable agreement on a worldwide blockchain network of participants is possible.</p> How it’s&nbsp;going <p>Beyond Bitcoin, most leading blockchain networks today were initially centralized through ICOs or large pre-mines, rather than a fairly launched protocol. In some cases, the ICO or pre-mined share of ownership was further entrenched by switching from proof of work, as a way for anyone to earn, to pure proof of stake, where owning the network currency is required to earn and those with the most earn the most. As part of prioritizing early growth to capture maximum crypto market share, these platforms generally abdicated the hard work of designing or implementing core protocol primitives, such as currencies or identities, beyond one native currency, as originally conceived in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Instead, the popular VM model of many blockchains today, which generally provide a shared “computer” or VM on top of a decentralized blockchain, leaves building critical primitives as someone else’s problem, usually companies and app designers, basically writing centralized apps. Instead of a secure set of underlying rules for currencies, we get best practices and the evolutionary legacy of thousands of “dApps”, which ironically, are mostly just partial or full re-implementations of the secure primitives missing in the consensus-based L1 protocols themselves.</p><p>As a result of the focus on pumping and market capture vs. evolving what we could learn from Bitcoin with sustainable, decentralized, more secure primitives and better protocol design, billions of dollars of value has been lost or transferred from naive early users who bought into the pumped crypto hype to hackers, scammers, VCs, centralized exits, and MEV-exploiters who all leveraged the mass of weaknesses they either failed to protect against or in some cases created and obscured themselves on systems that don’t define or enforce even the most common core primitives, currencies or identities. A great deal of loss has been due to obviously poor cross-chain “bridge” design, with the most common problem being bugs in complex smart contract workflow, followed by stolen or compromised private keys of contract owners / controllers, and in some cases, outright theft by contract controllers.</p><p>The lack of agreement on basic primitives and how to represent them in a globally resolvable way has held back general, robust solutions to the fundamental problem of interoperability between blockchains and other financial networks today. To complicate our collective challenges, adding full primitive support in the protocols is hard work, especially in an industry where just a year of development is considered a massive investment that must be rewarded by timely exit liquidity. Consequently, an abundance of shortcuts and heavily marketed yet hastily built solutions still dominate the popular narrative, as hacks, rugpulls, and losses continue to pile&nbsp;up.</p> The solution <p>Verus was founded by technology veterans and others who believe humanity can do better than being exploited by the technology these same veterans had been building for corporations over decades. The Verus PBaaS protocol was designed, built, and tested over more than 5 years by a self-selected and often volunteer group of technology, finance, legal, operations, or just life veterans and newbies alike. Early Verusians shared a common vision and made it reality, achieving a fairly launched, community driven project without VCs or ICO participants who may want to exit and a truly decentralized unlimited scale network that all humanity can use and build upon without paying rent to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>It has taken exactly as long as it has to realize the vision laid out 5 years ago, which is more clearly relevant today than ever. Along the way, that vision has grown and evolved as new community members contributed their own vision to help us improve, making the Verus PBaaS protocol, of which VIP is a small part, a major milestone for the crypto industry and a move back to the original intent of decentralized networks that was pioneered, if not fully realized by Satoshi Nakamoto in Bitcoin. Verus has taken Nakamoto consensus to the next level with consensus driven functional protocols for network primitives that are needed in any network hoping to securely enable financial applications.</p><p>To ensure maximum decentralization, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) takes a maximally decentralized, validator driven approach to its multi-network bridging by incorporating and accounting for currencies, identities, namespaces, and the concept of connected networks themselves in the L0 and L1 consensus protocols. The Verus Internet Protocol provides just enough structure to interoperate with any system that can control funds based on logic and exposes a provable representation of currencies and/or identities.</p><p>By grounding interoperability in a cryptographically provable, hierarchical namespace of self-sovereign, worldwide resolvable identities, VIP enables the first high-throughput, unlimited scale, decentralized, multi-protocol, non-custodial, auditable and transparent, currency and identity aware cross-blockchain communications protocol.</p> A cross-chain protocol with same chain properties <p>VIP can be seen as a cross-chain protocol that operates on proof of proof of consensus (PoPoC). VIP has the following properties:</p>  Transactions that include cross-chain operations, cross-system currency transfers, or new currency and identity definitions, are standardized in the protocol, as are the semantics of their cross-chain use, fee models, cross-system, name-centric provable routing, and MEV-resistant bundling and rollup properties. These characteristics can be and have been implemented on UTXO, VM-based, and transparently centralized networks.  VIP supports direct or indirect system&lt;-&gt;system communication, including cross-system export and import of currency and identity definitions, as well as revocation, recovery, and controlling keys. All cross-chain or DeFi functions in the protocol are accessible to full or lite node clients and applications by simply creating standard transaction inputs and outputs that specify the operations. Available APIs on every node or FOSS API server simplify the creation of transactions with cross-chain outputs in response to command requests or JSON RPC&nbsp;calls.  Transactions with Identity, DeFi, or cross-chain operations, including all inputs and outputs, even exports and imports of all currencies, are checked for validity by miners and stakers with network consensus, just as single currency inputs and outputs are in today’s single currency blockchain networks.  Cross-chain protocols operate in the same way as on-chain DeFi protocols and are processed on chain by miners and stakers with a bundle-&gt;export-&gt;import workflow, enabling high-throughput DeFi and cross-chain operations.  In PBaaS, exports, imports, and DeFi operations are all solved simultaneously and processed with at per-block or larger granularity in an MEV-resistant manner as part of the core protocol, recognizing and enabling the need for beneficial arbitrage, while eliminating toxic MEV such as front-running and sandwiching once and for&nbsp;all.  All cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:    Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)  Decentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)  Semi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway&nbsp;proofs  <p>Full auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We’ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:</p>  “Earned” and “Accepted” notarizations — VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.    Generally, one side of a connection will create “earned” notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further “confirmation” rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are “auto”, centralized, or “notary confirm”.  Once a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the “notary” system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation, which are typically present. The new, confirmed, earned notarization is entered on the notary chain as an “accepted” notarization, and is entered as “agreeing” with a prior accepted notarization along with proof of the agreement. If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.  <p>2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.</p><p>3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed. Once that happens, the blockchain is considered final up to the point of that confirmation and will resist reorganizations to any point&nbsp;behind.</p><p>The primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is the amount and type of evidence required to enter a potentially confirmed notarization. Most notably, “notary confirm” always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs and disagreements. Fully centralized gateways still operate on cryptographic proofs, but they only need notaries to agree on the cryptographic roots in order to consider them true and do not need cryptographic proof to establish the notarization proof&nbsp;root.</p><p>Once a proof root has been established by notarization, this root is used to cryptographically prove bundles of transactions exported from one chain or system and imported to another. Even Ethereum transactions are proven in both directions using the same workflow, although Ethereum transactions are validated using <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie/">PATRICIA Trie</a> proofs, while PBaaS chains use the Verus <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp">Merkle Mountain Range (MMR)</a> method, both being cryptographically sound. Cross-chain bundles of transactions follow the same bundling protocol when sourced from Verus or PBaaS chains as is followed in DeFi to prevent&nbsp;MEV.</p><p>Transactions are always delivered to the destination network with bundles in the order they were created on the source network and according to the enforceable rules of the source network. Since a relayer may add arbitrage transactions when the destination is a PBaaS chain, but may not affect the provable source contents of a relayed bundle from one network to another, no restriction is placed on who relays a valid bundle of transactions. Since validators who relay and mine or stake transaction bundles into a block may earn a validation fee from the import transaction itself, validators or notaries will generally shuttle transaction bundles between chains and networks out of self interest, while having no ability whatsoever to censor or modify protocol level&nbsp;bundles.</p> What witness / notaries do NOT&nbsp;do <p>Witnesses / notaries have no control over what transactions are or are not included or the order in which they arrive from one system to another, as all of that is dictated by the protocol. By default, notaries cannot create notarizations and can only witness the validity of notarizations already created and agreed to by both proof of work and proof of stake validators.</p><p>Witness notaries’ primary role is to agree or disagree with the network validators’ earned notarizations, which are earned on one blockchain and accepted on another chain or system. As long as validators enter valid notarizations as part of the merge mining or staking process, confirm other notarizations entered by past validators, and a majority of notaries sign and witness their recognition of those events, a proof root that can be used by anyone to prove committed bundles of cross-chain transactions is established on both systems for the other. As the protocol ensures via cryptographic proof validation that the cross-chain bundles are the exact bundles in the order they were packaged on the source system, importing cross-chain transaction bundles is a permissionless operation that anyone, usually a validator, can perform, which relies on the proof established in relation to a confirmed, notarized proof&nbsp;root.</p> Do auto-notarization and notary-confirm notarization options have different security considerations? <p>Yes. Proper planning and selection of options and witness ID structure during the launch of a blockchain network or gateway can ensure that security levels meet network demands. There are security tradeoffs between auto-notarization and notary-confirm options, which basically are a tradeoff between a permissionless model where proof root determination is enhanced, but not dependent upon multisig agreement of notary witnesses, auto-notarization vs. a model where establishing any cross-network cryptographic proof root requires the honest participation of a majority of the notary witnesses, which can be represented by revocable and recoverable IDs, allowing for further decentralization, even while requiring participation of a&nbsp;quorum.</p><p>Determining which option to choose, how many and what notaries to choose, what other safeguards can further enhance security, and then understanding the resulting security profile from each set of choices, is important when launching a blockchain or gateway. The following outlines the current high-level security considerations when configuring a new chain or&nbsp;gateway.</p><p>Currently, Verus VIP supports 2 proof models for interchain communication, the Verus PBaaS Merkle Mountain Range proofs, which also assume the Verus Proof of Power protocol, and Ethereum PATRICIA Trie proofs that enable interfacing with VIP between any PBaaS chain, and any Ethereum VM + PATRICIA Trie compatible network.</p><p>Since Verus PBaaS is the only interface to fully support notarization finalization using full auto-notarization, it is important to understand the differences between PBaaS and Ethereum proof protocols. At present, there is no objective proof protocol implementation for Ethereum that is known and implemented, which can operate without dependence on some set of notary witnesses. At this time, auto-notarization, when applied to Ethereum, is more similar to notary-confirm, with additional revocation safeguards that could address more edge-case threat&nbsp;models.</p><p>As new proof algorithms evolve for Ethereum, enabling trustworthy cross-chain proof models in both directions that are both timely and do not need to be backed by witness signatures, it will be possible to update the protocols to remove dependence on witnesses over time. To ensure maximum decentralization on the Ethereum bridge, the network itself can permissionlessly propose contract upgrades, and if affirmatively voted on by Verus validators, an upgrade and new contracts can eventually change the cross-chain proof conditions.</p><p>Auto-notarization of one PBaaS chain on another (PBAAS_AN) differs from and Ethereum interface or notary-confirm (NC) in that, if there are enough validated blocks, both mined and staked, as well as validator agreed notarizations, PBAAS_AN allows validators to finalize a notarization and submit it to the alternate chain. If there are disagreements about the correct notarization, the process becomes an on-chain proof competition, requiring each party to represent a growing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations, but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.</p> Improvement over common cross-chain protocols <p>Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.</p><p>Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still, what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private&nbsp;keys?</p><p>If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:</p>  Colluding, malicious notaries  Fake validators with more combined hash + stake power than the publicly validated chain making earned notarizations  Developers helping them by creating an alternate protocol for the shadow&nbsp;chain  <p>While you may recognize these requirements as very close to the requirements of attacking any blockchain, the Verus VIP protocol provides a way to even defend against such an unlikely scenario. VIP provides for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, even those that are used for Ethereum protocol bridges. Furthermore, each PBaaS chain, including Verus, has a network agreed multisig chain oracle that can separately pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily, which also can be overridden by network validators.</p><p>To enable yet another layer of safeguards, the Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization that has first been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain, until a second such notarization confirms the first. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is first made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally, if nothing stops it, confirmed.</p><p>Meanwhile, with basic monitoring by witnesses to see if their own identities have signed for anything they do not actually agree with, meaning their keys were stolen, notaries can auto-revoke their own identities and prevent stolen key attacks from being anything more than an inconvenience. Additional monitoring by chain oracle controllers to look for clear discrepancies between soon to be confirmed notarizations and chains that they monitor can also use the oracle notification network to pause cross-chain transactions, providing yet another line of defense for each chain on the&nbsp;network.</p><p>While there are numerous capabilities and safeguards built into the Verus VIP protocol beyond those described in this document, by separating the proof root notarization process and using cryptographic proof as the foundation of a provable, high throughput, cross-chain export/import protocol, VIP enables the most secure, scalable, decentralized and multi-modal cross-chain protocol ever designed for blockchains and the Internet of&nbsp;Value.</p> Try the Verus Protocol Yourself! ✅ <p>Look up <a href="http://docs.verus.io">docs.verus.io</a> to use many API commands (e.g. <a href="https://docs.verus.io/currencies/launch-currency.html">launching currencies, tokens &amp; liquidity pools</a>).</p><p>Or look up the <a href="https://wiki.verus.io/#!faq-cli/clifaq-02_verus_commands.md">complete command list&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Join the community.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Arthur C. Clarke, the famous English science fiction writer, had once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Back in the 1960s, he was probably thinking about space exploration, which was the hottest and most impressive topic of that decade. Since then, however, spacecraft have unfortunately lost a large portion of their glamour, becoming instead reliable workhorses for the industry. A few other revolutionary technologies have met the same fate during the later decades as well – the Internet, mobile communications, electric vehicles, etc. The buzzword du jour, Artificial Intelligence, will become another part of our daily routines pretty soon as well.</p>
<p>Quantum computing, however, is still viewed by the public as something truly magical and simultaneously completely unrealistic. Perhaps, this can be explained by the lack of a “killer app” that would demonstrate immediate usefulness of the technology to average people, like ChatGPT did for generative AI. Or simply because quantum mechanics is something that requires substantial effort to wrap your head around. Sure, most of us still vaguely remember from school that subatomic particles can exhibit properties of both particles and waves, and some might even have heard about quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superposition</a>, but how exactly does it make extremely fast computing possible?</p>
<p>Well, it does not. Quantum computers are not supposed to replace classical ones, which are based on binary logic implemented with semiconductor-based logical gates. They won’t make existing algorithms any faster. They do, however, allow us to design entirely new algorithms that can solve mathematical problems that were previously impossible. Such developments started to emerge back in the 1980s, but remained largely an academic exercise until Peter Shor devised a quantum algorithm for breaking popular encryption methods. Finally, quantum computing caught the interest of businesses. And intelligence agencies, of course.</p>
<p>Sure, there are many other potential applications for this technology – modeling natural processes in physics and chemistry, creating new fuels and batteries, designing more efficient drugs, and so on. Quantum computers are also great for modeling quantum processes, helping us understand the origins of the universe. Businesses are ready to invest, and vendors are busy developing hardware to run all those workloads.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even a single quantum bit (qubit) – a basic element of a quantum computer – is an extremely sophisticated and fragile device that depends on things like liquid helium to operate. The largest currently existing prototypes contain up to 1000 of such elements, and yet, it is projected that future “proper” quantum computers might need millions of them. Quantum computers are also prone to noise caused by insufficient isolation from the environment – noise that reduces the reliability of hardware and introduces errors into calculations. To put it simply, quantum computing nowadays can be compared to the early days of aviation – experts just cannot agree how many more years it will take until we see practical, working, error-proof computers. But it definitely won’t happen tomorrow. <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/error-correction-codes">Or will it</a>?</p>
<p>A more interesting question, however, is how all this is related to cybersecurity. We already know that quantum computing can potentially make existing cryptography obsolete overnight. This would have massive implications on the entire digital economy of the world – everything from secure network connections to public cloud services to distributed ledgers and cryptocurrencies depends on the inability of a malicious actor to break this encryption. Modern cryptography relies to a large degree on the fact that classic computers cannot solve the underlying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization">mathematical challenges</a>. Yet, it has been established that a sufficiently powerful quantum computer can do it easily using Shor’s algorithm. The only open question is when such a computer will become available to malicious actors.</p>
<p>Even though many experts are still quite skeptical about the probability of this happening anytime soon, it is worth noting that the “better safe than sorry” camp is also quite substantial. The entire field of post-quantum cryptography emerged years ago to develop new encryption methods that are resistant against quantum attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading a <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography">standardization program</a> for quantum-resistant encryption methods since 2016 and the publication of new standards is planned for 2024.</p>
<p>However, you don’t have to wait until working quantum computers emerge to start implementing the new standards. In fact, by that time it will definitely be too late. For any business that relies on encryption to safeguard its processes and products (and nowadays, it’s basically any organization, regardless of its size or industry), the notion of cryptographic agility has become a critical part of business continuity.</p>
<p>Cryptographic algorithms become outdated all the time. DES, MD5, SHA1 – they are no longer considered strong enough even against classical brute force attacks and should be replaced everywhere. Sometimes, weaknesses are discovered in specific implementations – remember the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/lessons-learned-from-the-heartbleed-incident">Heartbleed incident</a>? Being able to respond to these challenges quickly and to replace cryptographic primitives across your entire organization without massive impact to your business – that’s what crypto-agility is about. Quantum resistance is just another good argument for selling this idea to the board.</p>
<p>One should also not forget about other applications of quantum mechanics to cybersecurity as well. After all, the field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography">quantum cryptography</a> proper is also quite fascinating. One particular technology relies on the properties of quantum entanglement to implement secure communications between parties that are impossible to eavesdrop on. This can be used to produce a shared secret key that is resistant against any man-in-the-middle attack. Surprisingly, practical implementations of this technology are already available, with record-breaking speeds and <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230615710544/en/Terra-Quantum-Breaks-Records-in-Quantum-Key-Distribution-Paving-Way-to-Offering-Unprecedented-Security-Over-Existing-Fiber-optic-Networks-Globally">distances over 1000 km</a>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, quantum technologies will be a part of the agenda at our upcoming <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference that will take place this November in Frankfurt, Germany. If you are interested in expanding your quantum computing horizons, come and meet the experts there!</p>

<p>In the always-on world of ecommerce, most business owners know that understanding customer behavior is one of the key ingredients to success. But getting to know your customers inside and out can be tricky if their information is stored in more than one location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to establish a central database, or “single source of truth,” where all customer data is managed and stored. This source of truth is known as “a single view of the customer,” and it’s like having an all-access pass to a customer's inner world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of it like this: Each customer data point is like a puzzle piece, and the central database is the box where all of the pieces are kept. However, instead of loose puzzle pieces tossed in a box with no sense of organization, a database categorizes and organizes pieces of customer data into searchable categories and subcategories for precise retrieval and exploration. </p>

<p>The United States faces numerous challenges when it comes to balancing supply v demand in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The intricate nature of the pharmaceutical industry, coupled with the country’s diverse healthcare system, regulatory framework, and evolving market dynamics, contribute to a complex landscape that presents both opportunities and limitations. Here, we will explore some of the key challenges that the US encounters in managing pharmaceutical supply and demand.</p>
<p>One of the primary challenges is ensuring a steady and adequate supply of pharmaceutical products. <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Pharmaceuticals/U.S.-dependence-on-China-for-lifesaving-drugs-grows#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20imported%20%246.95%20billion,the%20annual%20tally%20from%202021">The US relies heavily on imports</a>, with many active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drugs being manufactured overseas, particularly in countries like China and India. This dependence on foreign sources can make <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/the-u-s-needs-to-reimagine-its-pharma-supply-chain">the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions</a>, such as natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, or regulatory issues. A single interruption in the supply chain can lead to shortages of essential medications, potentially compromising patient care and public health.</p>
 Challenges posed to pharmaceutical demand by the US healthcare system 
<p>The complex and fragmented nature of the US healthcare system presents challenges in predicting and meeting pharmaceutical demand. Unlike many other countries with centralized healthcare systems, the US has a diverse array of payers, including private insurance companies, government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, and self-pay patients. Each payer operates differently, with varying formularies, coverage criteria, and reimbursement rates. This diversity makes it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to accurately forecast demand and allocate resources efficiently.</p>
<p>Moreover, the high cost of pharmaceuticals in the US poses a challenge in meeting demand. Prescription drug prices in the US are significantly higher compared to other countries, partly due to the number of intermediaries involved in the supply chain, the absence of government price controls and negotiation mechanisms. The high prices can create barriers to access for patients, particularly those without adequate insurance coverage or with high out-of-pocket costs. This can lead to underutilization of medications, compromising patient outcomes and exacerbating health disparities.</p>
 Falsified and substandard drugs in the US market 
<p>The issue of substandard and falsified drugs also affects the pharmaceutical supply chain in the US. Counterfeit drugs, which can be ineffective or even harmful, pose a serious risk to patient safety. While the US has robust regulatory mechanisms in place, including those managed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), illicit online pharmacies and other illegal channels continue to thrive, making it challenging to ensure a safe and secure supply of medications.</p>
 How technology is reshaping the pharma landscape 
<p>Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological advancements in pharmaceutical research and development introduces challenges in matching supply with evolving demand. The emergence of innovative therapies, such as gene therapies and personalized medicines, necessitates agile and adaptable manufacturing processes. Ensuring that the supply chain can accommodate these novel therapies, including scaling up production and maintaining quality control, is a complex task.</p>
 ARTiFACTS Verify’s role in ensuring the integrity of the US pharmaceutical supply chain 
<p>To address these challenges, various stakeholders in the US healthcare system are taking steps to enhance pharmaceutical supply and meet growing demand. Efforts include diversifying sources of drug manufacturing, encouraging domestic production, strengthening regulatory oversight, promoting price transparency, and fostering collaboration among manufacturers, payers, healthcare providers, and policymakers. In 2013, the US government implemented the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-supply-chain-integrity/drug-supply-chain-security-act-dscsa">Drug Supply Chain Security Act</a> (DSCSA) with the aim of achieving interoperable, electronic tracing of products at the package level to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. Manufacturers were given 10 years to adapt their processes, ample time to meet evolving requirements.&nbsp; Additionally, advancements in digital health technologies and data analytics are being leveraged to optimize supply chain management and improve forecasting accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/verify/">ARTiFACTS Verify</a> supports these latter efforts through our cloud-based platform for monitoring drug quality across the pharmaceutical supply chain. Currently, Verify is capable of the following (with more in development):</p>
 
 Collecting chemical analyses of drugs obtained through destructive testing of samples at any point in the pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 Applying Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain technologies that improve the accuracy, speed, and data-integrity of scientifically generated results. 
 Monitoring and reporting results for a growing set of active pharmaceutical ingredients with the capacity to address nearly all <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MHP-HPS-EML-2023.02">World Health Organization Essential Medicines</a>. 
 
<p>In conclusion, the US faces multifaceted challenges in balancing pharmaceutical supply and demand. These challenges stem from the complex nature of the healthcare system, dependence on foreign sources, high drug prices, counterfeit drugs, and the need to adapt to evolving therapies. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration, innovation, and policy reforms to ensure a reliable and affordable supply of pharmaceutical products that meet the needs of patients across the country.</p>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning is now in public preview!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With today’s announcement, we’re expanding our support for HR-driven provisioning to address the most common customer asks, including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Automatically provisioning cloud-only users and hybrid users (users that require an on-premises Active Directory account) from any trusted source&nbsp; 
 Importing data from sources like CSV files and SQL staging tables using the automation tool of your choice&nbsp; 
 Simplifying the integration by using standard SCIM schema attributes to abstract schema differences across systems and provide a consistent mapping experience 
 Leveraging <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Lifecycle Workflows</a> to automate joiner-mover-leaver workflows for users sourced from any system of record&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one common customer scenario, organizations use a cloud human capital management (HCM) platform for managing employees and extracting nightly flat files/CSVs to manage vendor and contractor data. Both of these sources can send information to Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning using your automation tool of choice. Then, the provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/lifecycle-workflows-is-now-generally-available/ba-p/2466931">Entra ID Governance Lifecycle Workflows</a> will automate the joiner-mover-leaver processes configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning data flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Let’s walk through the steps involved in configuring this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Bring identities into your directory from any source in three easy steps&nbsp; 
<p>Step 1 – Configure API-driven provisioning app&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Microsoft Entra Portal, sign in as a user with Application Administrator and Hybrid Identity Administrator role. You will see two new provisioning applications in the Enterprise App gallery:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 API-driven provisioning to Microsoft Entra ID: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision cloud-only user accounts from your authoritative source. 
 API-driven provisioning to on-premises Active Directory: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-configure-app">Configure this app</a> if you’d like to provision user accounts first to your on-premises Active Directory and then sync them into Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Cloud Sync / Connect Sync.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your provisioning target is an on-premises Active Directory domain, download and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/cloud-sync/how-to-install">configure the Microsoft Entra provisioning agent</a>. Once configured, you can select the Active Directory domain in the provisioning app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Connect to your on-premises Active Directory domain</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>By default, the provisioning app maps attributes from the standard <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.1">SCIM Core User schema</a> and the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643.html#section-4.3">SCIM Enterprise User schema extension</a> to the corresponding Microsoft Entra ID / on-premises Active Directory user attributes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: SCIM schema attributes to on-premises Active Directory attribute mapping</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra provisioning service creates a unique API endpoint for your provisioning app. You can copy this API endpoint from the “Overview” blade. Select “Start provisioning” to accept inbound provisioning requests at this API endpoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4:API endpoint for your provisioning app</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The inbound provisioning API endpoint has the format:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/%7bservicePrincipalId%7d/synchronization/jobs/%7bjobId%7d/bulkUpload">https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipalId}/synchronization/jobs/{jobId}/bulkUpload</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where {servicePrincipalId} is the object ID of your provisioning app and {jobId} is the provisioning job id.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 – Grant permission to your application or service to upload identity data&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this step, you create an entity in Microsoft Entra ID that represents your application or service calling the inbound provisioning API and grant it the necessary permissions. You can use one of the following options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-service-principal">Configure a service principal</a>&nbsp; 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/inbound-provisioning-api-grant-access#configure-a-managed-identity">Configure a managed identity</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grant the following Graph API permissions with admin consent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 SynchronizationData-User.Upload&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 AuditLog.Read.All&nbsp;<br> 
 
<p>Figure 5: Permissions required to perform API-driven provisioning</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Step 3 – Upload identity data using any automation tool of your choice&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now securely upload identity data to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/synchronization-synchronizationjob-post-bulkupload">provisioning /bulkUpload API endpoint</a>. The great thing about API-driven provisioning is that you don’t need to implement custom logic to figure out whether an operation in your system of record requires creating or updating an identity. Just upload the data from your source systems and the Microsoft Entra provisioning service will automatically determine the right operation to perform for each user record based on mapping rules configured by your IAM admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unlock more integration scenarios&nbsp; 
<p>In the set of steps above, we showed you how to provision to Microsoft Entra ID in the cloud, and to Active Directory on-premises. You can apply these steps to implement several enterprise HR integration scenarios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 1: IT teams can import HR data extracts from any source&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flat files, CSV files and SQL staging tables are commonly used in enterprise integration scenarios. Employee, contractor, and vendor information are periodically exported into one of these formats, and an automation tool is used to sync this data with Microsoft Entra ID. With API-driven provisioning, IT teams can use any automation tool of their choice (example: PowerShell scripts or Azure Logic Apps) to modernize and simplify this integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 2: HR ISVs can build direct inbound sync with Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR ISVs can ship native synchronization experiences so that changes in the HR system automatically flow into Microsoft Entra ID and connected on-premises Active Directory domains. For example, an HR app or student information systems app can send data to Microsoft Entra ID as soon as a transaction is complete or as end-of-day bulk update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario 3: System integrators can build more connectors to systems of record&nbsp;</p>
<p>System integrators can build custom HR connectors to meet different integration requirements around identity data flow from systems of record to Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What customers and partners are telling us&nbsp; 
<p>We got some great feedback from customers and partners like you during the previews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning will allow us to achieve our cloud-first vision by provisioning identity directly in the cloud and on-premises, integrating with our HR application. We will be able to remove legacy infrastructure and automate many fragmented workflows and reduce dependency on on-premises Active Directory infrastructure. This will enhance our security, efficiency, and user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sachin Desai, Sr. Director at Avanade Inc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, HR has better control over the identity lifecycle &amp; data in Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. When combined with Lifecycle Workflows, onboarding and offboarding becomes easy and seamless, and with that, no more manual work and always an up-to-date identity!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pim Jacobs, Principal Consultant at InSpark and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra API-driven inbound provisioning is a game changer for customers constrained by existing technologies, opening the possibility for any customer to start the journey for joiner, mover, and leaver automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martyn Gill, Senior Architect and Team Lead at Kocho&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With API-driven provisioning, our customers can link employee information in SmartHR with Microsoft Entra ID. This will reduce the time and effort required to manage accounts as employees join, move, or leave the company. SmartHR is excited to partner with Microsoft in building this integration!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Takumi Kanzaki, Product Engineer at SmartHR&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance by automating payroll, expenses, and benefits in one integrated platform. With Microsoft Entra API-driven provisioning, we can now extend this automation to streamline access to more workforce apps, regardless of whether it’s in the cloud or on-premises. We look forward to enabling this seamless experience for our customers by partnering with Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Gnesin, Product Lead at Rippling&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Give it a try&nbsp; 
<p>With this new capability, you now have even more flexibility on how to keep identity data in sync with your authoritative sources, regardless of whether they are hosted in the cloud or on-premises. Working with your HR/IT teams, you can select from a range of automation tools like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview">Azure Logic Apps</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started">PowerAutomate</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview">Azure Functions</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction">Azure Data Factory</a> to retrieve, transform and merge HR data and simply upload the data to the new provisioning API endpoint.</p>

<p>Passwords are still the most common form of authentication but are more problematic than ever.</p>



 The first big problem with passwords is that most people manage them poorly. 



<p>Most people choose weak (guessable) passwords, don’t store them securely (sticky note, anyone?), regularly forget and have to reset them, and reuse the same one (or even different variations of it) across all accounts (which is <a href="https://tech.co/password-managers/how-many-passwords-average-person">100</a> on average for Americans). In a 2020 study of Microsoft users across only three months, a massive <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/12/06/microsoft-finds-password-security-problem-affecting-44-million-users/#356efc3c67c4">44 million users</a>&nbsp;had used the same password on more than one account.</p>



<p></p>



 The second big problem with passwords is that they are the most attractive target for cybercriminals. 



<p>Verizon’s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/infographics/2023-dbir-infographic.pdf">2023 data breach report</a> reveals 49 per cent of breaches by external actors used stolen credentials. Its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">2020 report</a> noted 80 per cent of hacking-related breaches were linked to passwords. Well-meaning advice to frequently change passwords is just a band-aid on a gaping wound.</p>



<p><a href="https://au.pcmag.com/antivirus/53058/12-simple-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-secure-online">PC Magazine</a>’s recent list of 12 simple things consumers can do to be more secure online had some valuable recommendations for passwords:</p>



 
 Make them unique for every login. 



 Turn off the save password feature in browsers. 
 



<p>But while consumers are increasingly aware of the dangers of these poor practices, few do anything about it. It seems doing the right thing is difficult, and most people don’t know where to start.</p>



<p></p>



 Doing the right thing 







<p>Among the practices that make using passwords infinitely safer, the most recommended are:</p>



 
 Make sure they are complex and hard to guess. The more characters and variety in those characters (letters, numbers, special characters, upper and lower case) the better. 



 Don’t reuse them over and over again. To be safe, every place that requires a password should have its own unique, complex version. The days of simply iterating on an already-used password by increasing the final number by 1 are long gone. 



 Store them securely. Ditch the sticky notes—don’t write them down. 



 Don’t use the save password feature on browsers. Enter it each time it is needed. 
 



<p>No-one can follow that advice without help. And the best way to make those suggestions a reality is by using a password management solution. Unfortunately, very few consumers are inclined to research, acquire, install, configure, and maintain yet another piece of technology on top of what they are already doing. That’s where you can ride in on your white horse and save the day for the customers of your online <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/5-predictions-for-data-privacy-in-2023-and-beyond/">data privacy</a> and security offering.</p>



<p></p>



 Here’s the opportunity to make it easy 







<p>The password manager that you could offer should have these capabilities to deliver maximum value:</p>



 
 Secure, encrypted storage of passwords and other data (such as banking information, driver license, and social security number) 



 The ability to create unique, un-hackable passwords for each login (fun fact: a 12-character password takes <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mathematics-of-hacking-passwords/">62 trillion times</a> longer to crack than one with six-characters) 



 Enforcement of password complexity rules including preventing the reusing or iterating of older logins 



 The ability to securely auto-fill passwords for all logins 



 Functionality on all the devices a customer would need – mobile, desktop, etc. 



 Ability to import and export from other password managers or data sources 



 Ability to share vaults and credentials. 
 



<p>Fortunately, Anonyome Labs is leading the charge for making online privacy and security a no-brainer for regular folks. Anonyome’s <a href="https://sudoplatform.com">Sudo Platform</a> offers you the ability to easily add important password management to your products – branded and packaged the way you want.

Back then, there were no calculators, pencils, or chat GPT— imagine how people got around or knew what coffee to order?! For this, we consider this invention as the first evidence of tallying or recording information.</p><p>2,500 BC Sumerians &amp; Bookkeeping</p><p>Ancient Sumerians, who lived in what is now modern-day Iraq, kept written records of harvests and taxes on clay tablets over 5,000 years ago. The evolution of writing helped shape data collection, as written records became more widespread and sophisticated. Libraries, which first appeared in ancient Egypt around 2,000 BCE, were instrumental in the curation and preservation of written records. The earliest libraries were typically housed in temples and contained religious texts, but over time, libraries began to expand their collections to include works on various subjects.</p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39870485">Image Source</a> History of Data in 1640: The GodFather of Public Health Statistics <p>In 1640, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graunt">John Graunt</a>, a hat maker, started collecting information regarding deaths in London. John noted down statistics such&nbsp;as:</p>  The number of&nbsp;deaths  The mortality rate among age&nbsp;groups  The causes of&nbsp;death  <p>By this seemingly mundane tallying, he revolutionized how we use medical data and human organization records to this day. In fact, Graunt was the first person to use data analysis to understand and solve a&nbsp;problem.</p><p>In 1665, he published his book, <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A41827.0001.001?view=toc">Natural and Political Observations Mentioned in a Following Index</a>, and made upon the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bills_of_mortality#:~:text=Bills%20of%20mortality%20were%20the,Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Parish%20Clerks.">Bills of Mortality</a>, as the collective result of his research. In it, the innovator stored information in tables and even attempted to predict life expectancy.</p><p>As a result of Graunt’s publication, the city started issuing a weekly report called “Bills of Mortality”. Knowing the number of deaths and births better-prepared people for a possible plague outbreak at that&nbsp;time.</p> History of Data in the 1880s: The Era of Data Processing <p>Speeding through centuries into the 1880s, the German-American statistician Herman Hollerith saw a train conductor punching train tickets for passengers. That’s how the idea of using punch cards in writing and processing data was born. Hollerith started working on the design of the <a href="https://www.hnf.de/en/permanent-exhibition/exhibition-areas/hall-of-fame/herman-hollerith-1860-1929.html">tabulation machine</a> that uses punch cards, based on a previous model invented by the silk weaver Joseph Jacquard in the&nbsp;1800s.</p><p>A punch card is normally a type of stiff paper, onto which a machine would create holes in specific locations. The cards are moved between brass rods so that the data is read electronically. With this great breakthrough, Hollerith helped the American government complete the US census within the same year — after it took them nearly a decade of trial and&nbsp;error.</p> Data in 1928: The Concept of&nbsp;Storage  Pfleumer’s Magnetic&nbsp;Tape <p>In 1928, German engineer Fritz Pfleumer patented a <a href="https://historyofinformation.com/image.php?id=6719">magnetic tape</a> that he used to replace wire recording for storing data. Essentially, he coated very thin paper with iron oxide powder and glued it with lacquer. The idea of storing information on magnetic tapes actually inspired the invention of floppy disks and hard disk drives later&nbsp;on.</p> Present-Day: Here comes the Internet&nbsp;Era <p>The rise of the internet consequently came with its counterpart of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-science/#:~:text=Data%20science%20is%20the%20study,analyze%20large%20amounts%20of%20data.">big data</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web">Sir Tim Berners Lee</a>, hypertext and hyperlinks made it easy to share information and connect resources globally.</p><p>The introduction of Google in 1997 took Lee’s work and scaled to the masses. Data became even more widely available to everyone with access to a computer or mobile&nbsp;device.</p><p>For the context of this topic, we can point readers to inquire on <a href="https://caseybotticello.medium.com/life-after-google-f9dcb639b087">Life After Google</a> by George Gilder, highlighting the rise and fall of Big&nbsp;Data.</p><p>Most people believe the internet is here to stay, specifically, those who’ve yet to think about digital ownership, blockchain, or privacy as any concern, nor the rise of AI. Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to have the ability to read and write…creating data points every second we update the screen. Reading and writing are certainly not the final destination on the history of the data timeline graphic shown above. With every innovation in technology, data science, <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-explained">machine learning</a>, &amp; artificial intelligence comes a new way of creating and spreading information, knowledge, or&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Data has altered the way we view and assume the world, and continues to shape our reality in different ways. Industries like Finance, Insurance, Supply Chain, and Natural Sciences benefit from employing data-driven thesis &amp; techniques to improve their operations.</p> Internet Era -&gt; Blockchain Era (2023, 2040, and&nbsp;beyond) <p>As mentioned above, Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 allowed us to read and write. Web 3.0 states the ability to read, write and&nbsp;own.</p><a href="https://elevatex.de/blog/web3/web1-web2-and-web3-explained/">Image Source</a><p>Web3 is positioned to Decentralize the Internet and bootstrap a more multidimensional and immersive environment (ie: the “metaverse”) designed for more participation, reward, engagement, and privacy by/for&nbsp;users.</p><p>The first question to this is how? Shorthand's answer is Blockchain technology. The distributed ledger technology changes how information is shared and stored. Deliverables: provide verifiable, trustless, distributed data on peer-to-peer nodes or servers that can enable the creation of new economic sectors and new forms of commerce.</p><p>Furthermore, decentralized applications (dApps) are the vehicle to transfer much of the power and control back to the public and consumers, marking a shift to a more user-owned web. Remove middlemen, expose bad actors, and streamline business processes to tailor to users and creators, rather than for-profit entities. DApps built inside the Ocean Protocol Ecosystem can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem">here</a>.</p><p>Peer-to-peer buying and selling of assets are just the beginning. The peer-to-peer ownership of data, assets, information, and algorithmic scriptures is executed through the standard of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and ever-expanding mobile eCommerce has effectively cut the middlemen out of parts of the&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Infamously, we will use credit card fees as an example. Consider the transaction fees charged to retailers by credit card companies. The seemingly small 1 to 4% adds up moving through the <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/s/supply-chain">supply chain</a>. The inefficiency of small transactions forces many companies to purchase in bulk and effectively shuts out smaller businesses.</p><p>Advocates of ‘DeFi’ or decentralized finance lobby for more personalized financial models and even a future without banks and centralized stock exchanges.</p><p>Pioneers in the space include OpenSea, the most prominent digital marketplace for crypto collectibles and NFTs, Coinbase for buying, selling, and storing cryptocurrency, and Ocean Protocol, an open-source tool kit to own and deploy web-native applications, algorithms, and assets on the blockchain.</p><p>Ocean Protocol combines the ownership of data and payment rails into one. This takes the digital payment providers (Stripes of the World) and data storage (Snowflake of the World) and wraps ownership into one rail. The cost reduction, efficiency, and scalability of this mesh will be quantified in years to&nbsp;come.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable people to privately &amp; securely publish, exchange, and consume&nbsp;data.</p><p>Follow Ocean on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter</a> or<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> to keep up to date.

<p>Security teams have been focused on protecting their customers and their business for quite a while now, but the job is never finished. Bad actors are always finding new ways to exploit IT infrastructures, and they aren’t interested in slowing down. As digital commerce and operations have shifted online, so have the bad actors. Nobody is holding up banks anymore; all the fraud now happens online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters a bit more complicated, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/solutions/business-priority/privacy-consent.html">customer privacy and consent</a> have also grown in demand, and they often fall on security teams to implement. This adds yet another set of requirements that these teams have to learn, implement, track, and update, often requiring a consent management platform (CMP). And it’s not a simple switch that can be turned on. Privacy and consent requirements vary by region, regulatory standards, customer preferences, and other factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long gone are the days when convenience was the main customer driver. “You’d like access to all of my personal data for one-click access? Sure, why not, what’s the harm?” Do you still wonder what happens to those pictures you upload to social media sites and who ultimately owns them? For the longest time, it seemed like social media companies owned them, but fortunately, this trend is starting to shift as customer concern about privacy and data collection continues to grow. And the main driver of this shift is often companies’&nbsp; bottom line. Customers don’t do business with companies they don’t trust, especially when there are numerous substitutions available just a few clicks away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Authentication security remains a significant vulnerability in most organizations' security posture. Even individuals without technical expertise can easily acquire and employ pre-made hacking tools. Microsoft, for instance, fends off an astonishing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/01/26/2023-identity-security-trends-and-solutions-from-microsoft/">1,000 authentication attacks a second</a>. Furthermore, the dark web is flooded with over 24 billion username and password pairs available for purchase, perpetuating the constant onslaught of these malicious activities.</p>  
<p>Security systems have incorporated measures like <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> to deter attackers. However, several MFA methods, including push notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs), are easy to circumvent. Adaptive authentication is a promising advancement to enhance authentication protocols, leveraging diverse parameters to conduct a risk-based evaluation of authentication requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In this blog, we’ll delve into adaptive authentication, exploring how it is deployed and how it can enhance your authentication security.</p> 
 What Is Adaptive Authentication?  
<p>Adaptive authentication, also knowns as risk-based authentication, is an intelligent system that dynamically determines when to step up authentication and request additional factors to prove identity. The system makes risk-based assessments for determining what level of authentication must be provided, moving towards continuous assessment rather than a user simply authenticating at the start of their session.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>A common example of adaptive authentication is banking applications, where users can freely view their account balance. However, the authentication process may require additional factors if they want to initiate a transfer. Likewise, within an enterprise setting, risk-based assessments can determine what data or apps a user can access with the authentication factors they’ve provided. It is also apparent on a smart device, where a low-risk request, such as checking the time or seeing the subject of an email, can be done without entering a password or using a biometric identifier.</p> 
<p>Adaptive authentication serves two primary objectives. Firstly, it aims to enhance authentication security by eliminating the “break once, run everywhere” scenario, where an attacker gains continuous account access by overcoming a single authentication challenge. Secondly, it strives to strike a balance between security and user experience. Since the strength of authentication is often associated with its duration or complexity, adaptive authentication allows low-risk requests to be granted swiftly without burdening users with excessive time-consuming processes.</p> 
 How Adaptive Authentication Is Deployed  
<p>The driving force of adaptive authentication is risk assessment, with the authentication requirements increasing linearly as the risk to the user or organization increases. The following “rules” govern how adaptive authentication is deployed in real-life applications.&nbsp;</p> 
 Static Rules  
<p>This ruleset has a clear relationship between actions, risks, and authentication requirements. This means, for example, that every time a user seeks to submit changes within an internal app, they must pass an authentication challenge. Standard rule policies cover role-based access, the importance of the data or application, or the action they are looking to take. In these cases, a defined rule will correspond to a defined authentication protocol.</p> 
 Dynamic Rules  
<p>These are where the users’ actions and behavior will set the baseline for system access, and any deviations from that norm trigger authentication challenges. For example, if you log on every day from Southern California but now it says you’re in Brazil, this would cause the system to ask for further identity verification. Similarly, if your account normally interacts with product development but now it’s seeking access to the sales team’s client list, it would be flagged.</p> 
<p>Some adaptive authentication technologies incorporate even more sophisticated dynamic risk signals such as device status, user behavior anomalies and risk data from SIEM tools or other corporate security systems.</p> 
 Hybrid Rules  
<p>This sees the adaptive authentication process use both dynamic and static rules. This might look like increasing authentication requirements for certain apps but lowering them if a user logs on with their recognized device on a company VPN rather than an unknown device on a public network. However, as machine learning improves in capabilities mixing static with AI-driven authentication policies could become very common.</p> 
<p>The stepped-up authentication requests that the system makes can be the same as those of your MFA system, which could include:</p> 
  
  Biometric identifiers (face or retina scans, fingerprints)  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-you-need-to-reconsider-otp-authentication">OTPs sent to SMS/email</a>  
  Security keys  
  Smart cards  
  <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-are-push-notification-attacks">Push notifications</a> sent to a personal device  
  
<p>Depending on the risk level of the user’s request, a system can also require different factors than what they logged in with to improve security. As mentioned, contextual indicators, such as IP, device MAC address, or geolocation, can also play a role in deciding the risk level of the request.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many MFA methods aren’t all that secure so adding in an additional layer may not sufficiently secure against the increased risk level. Ideally, your baseline authentication would already use <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">phishing-resistant mfa,</a> with the step-up requirements either being a re-authentication request or another highly secure factor.</p> 
 Benefits of Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Implementing adaptive authentication provides several key advantages for organizations, including enhanced security and bottom-line savings.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improves Security  
<p>Adaptive authentication protocols should improve the detection of <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">account takeover attacks</a> or at least compartmentalize how far they can spread. Requiring several more layers of authentication factors as the privilege level escalates makes it unlikely that anything bar highly targeted attacks could succeed. In addition, building a behavioral anomaly identifier into the system for dynamic rulesets can identify unauthorized intrusions as they occur.</p> 
 Balances User Experience and Security  
<p>If an authentication system is too demanding, users will get frustrated and try to take shortcuts, such as sharing authentication factors, to save time. If it is a customer, they may abandon their transaction and take their business elsewhere. An advantage of adaptive authentication is that it seeks to find the best for both, with low-risk requests treated with a lighter touch. This way, users understand there’s a reason for heavier security for higher-risk requests.</p> 
 Saves Time and Money  
<p>Not only do demanding, heavy-handed authentication systems frustrate users, but they also take up a lot of their time, both in the actual authentication process and during resets if factors are forgotten, lost or not accessible. Adaptive authentication reduces friction, improves productivity and lowers help desk calls by providing the right level of authentication security.</p>

 The Shyft Perspective: Crypto Regulations — The South American&nbsp;Way <p>South America, home to over 440 million people across twelve nations and three territories, comprises roughly 5.47% of the global population. Yet, when discussions turn to cryptocurrencies, attention predominantly shifts to the Western World and the emerging Asian economies. This oversight is surprising, given that South America is leading the charge in digital currency adoption and pioneering central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><p>Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador notably rank among the top 20 nations for global cryptocurrency adoption. The rise of crypto in South America isn’t just about global rankings — it’s deeply rooted in pressing economic challenges.</p><p>The continent grapples with high inflation, increasing social unrest, waning trust in public institutions, and stagnant job and economic growth. For instance, Venezuela is suffering from hyperinflation that has left its currency worthless, catapulting cryptocurrencies to a favored position in the nation and shedding light on similar trends throughout the&nbsp;region.</p> Crypto Adoption in South&nbsp;America <p>Taking a closer look at South America’s stance on crypto, it’s clear the region is not just active but thriving. The 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis echoes this sentiment: Brazil is positioned at the 7th spot, followed by Argentina at 13th, Colombia at 15th, and Ecuador rounding off at 18th. The figures paint an interesting narrative.</p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)<p>South American nations, in fact, boast higher crypto adoption rates per capita than some of the most developed economies, including the likes of the US and EU. This perspective is further emphasized by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202468/global-cryptocurrency-ownership/">Statista’s findings</a>: Argentina leads with crypto ownership of 21%, trailed by Colombia at 15%, Chile at 14%, and Peru and Brazil both at 13%. In contrast, economic titans such as the US could muster only 10%, Russia 8%, China 7%, Germany 7%, and Japan at a mere&nbsp;4%.</p><p>It’s evident there’s a solid demand for cryptocurrencies in these nations, particularly showcased by the surge in peer-to-peer (P2P)&nbsp;usage.</p><p>To contextualize this momentum, the <a href="https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/PP/2023/English/PPEA2023004.ashx">International Monetary Fund’s February 2023 report</a> highlights several catalysts: the allure of efficient cross-border transactions, the appeal of crypto as a bulwark against hyperinflation, challenges stemming from fiat currency depreciation, and the overarching need to navigate strict capital controls. These elements, in tandem, underline the region’s steady pivot towards crypto&nbsp;assets.</p> Crypto Regulations in South&nbsp;America <p>South America has been at the forefront of crypto adoption, yet it lacks a region-wise comprehensive regulatory structure like the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA). As such, crypto regulation diverges widely across the region, ranging from crypto acceptance to prohibition.</p><p>Looking into the latest major developments in South America’s crypto regulatory landscape, we can easily identify trends emerging in this&nbsp;region.</p> Argentina <p>Amidst an escalating annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/emerging/argentina-inflation-likely-sped-back-up-ahead-primary-vote-analysts-say-2023-08-11/#:~:text=Argentina%20has%20one%20of%20the,dollars%20to%20protect%20the%20peso.">116%</a>, its highest in over three decades, Argentina finds itself at a crossroads. Interestingly, this financial turbulence coincides with the rise of pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate Javier&nbsp;Milei.</p><p>This isn’t surprising, given an interest rate of 118%, unpredictable currency fluctuations, strict capital controls, and a general wariness towards the government. In this climate, approximately 12% of the population is adopting&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>Buenos Aires even facilitates tax payments via&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>However, the nation’s engagement with crypto doesn’t stop at usage. Argentina is also a significant hub for Bitcoin mining. And while the central bank maintains a cautious stance on cryptocurrencies, public regulators are more optimistic. They <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/veriscope-regulatory-recap-19th-june-to-4th-july">have expressed interest</a> in fostering the growth of the crypto sector and building a structured regulatory environment.</p><p>As the landscape evolves, Argentina is all set to roll out new crypto rules, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/argentina-regulate-crypto-firms-fight-145745814.html">aligning with IMF’s strategies</a> to counter money laundering.</p> Bolivia <p>In the case of Bolivia, the country’s central bank has prohibited the use and commercialization of crypto assets, making such means of payment for the purchase and sale of products and services illegal in the&nbsp;country.</p><p>However, recently, Bolivian National Deputy Mariela Baldivieso spearheaded an initiative to legalize cryptocurrencies in Bolivia by introducing a proposal to lift the current ban on crypto assets. The proposal urges the Ministry of Economy and Public Finance to establish regulatory norms and “embrace new technologies as a transformative opportunity to strengthen our economy, promote financial inclusion, and open the doors to technological innovation.”</p> Brazil <p>The 10th largest economy globally with an <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/brazil-inflation-returns-to-target-range-64cd849c#:~:text=The%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20in,the%20national%20statistics%20institute%2C%20IBGE.">inflation of 4.65%</a>, Brazil is the 5th largest crypto market in the world. Approximately 7.8% of its citizens are now crypto&nbsp;owners.</p><p>What’s more, their trading activities have been bustling. Only in 2022 alone, they transacted a staggering $11.4 billion in stablecoins. The primary drivers that have motivated Brazilians to turn to cryptocurrencies are price speculation, their purported role as a reliable store of value, and streamlined international remittances.</p><p>Taking note of this momentum, in June 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva t endorsed a decree, carving out a solid legal foundation for the country’s burgeoning crypto economy. This legislation entrusts the central bank with the mandate to keep a keen eye on virtual asset service providers, known in industry parlance as&nbsp;VASPs.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1669744785182056448?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>And for those tokens that parallel securities? They remain under the oversight of Brazil’s Comissão de Valores Mobiliários, or CVM, akin to the US’s SEC. It doesn’t end&nbsp;there.</p><p>The central bank, in tandem with payment giants like Visa and Mastercard, is gearing up to roll out a pilot for their own digital currency: the digital&nbsp;real.</p> Chile <p>Chile has a small but rapidly growing crypto market, with around <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-chile-2021/">2.6%</a> of the population owning crypto. The country has a thriving P2P trading market and perceives crypto positively, with 36% of Chileans in favor of crypto being recognized as an official kind of currency. There’s also the possibility of a Digital Chilean&nbsp;Peso.</p><p>Currently, there is no formal regulatory framework, but tax guidance is available for those trading digital assets or those doing business in virtual assets. Under Chile’s tax guidelines, crypto assets are classified as virtual assets, which are not considered securities or foreign currencies, which means investors need to pay capital gains&nbsp;taxes.</p><p>The nation has been debating a “Bitcoin Law,” which was presented to Congress in late 2021 and aimed to generate a safe environment and provide protection for involved parties while making the central bank responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies.</p> Colombia <p>This country, home to hundreds of crypto ATMs, is the 4th largest crypto market by volume for P2P trading worldwide. It is estimated that <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-colombia-2021/">6.1%</a> of its citizens own cryptocurrency. This adoption is due to strict taxation policies for crypto within Colombia and a lack of regulatory clarity for exchanges and crypto businesses.</p><p>In Dec. 2021, Colombia’s Financial Information and Analysis Unit mandated cryptocurrency exchanges to report user transactions. Notably, all Bitcoin transactions above $150 were required to be registered after April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The nation has also created a regulatory sandbox, a pilot program that enables exchanges to interoperate with banks. But it hasn’t been the most successful due to the 40% of the population being unbanked.</p> Ecuador <p>Interest in cryptocurrencies is clearly rising in Ecuador, with <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-ecuador-2021/">2.73%</a> of its residents now holding such&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Ecuador, which operates its own electronic money system anchored to its official currency, the US dollar, has set firm rules for the crypto scene. Although the National Assembly once outlawed Bitcoin, it has since revised its position, as it clarified: while cryptos aren’t official payment methods, buying and selling them remains&nbsp;legal.</p> Guyana <p>In Guyana, cryptocurrency regulation is still in its infancy. Even so, the government is actively laying the groundwork for a regulatory framework. As part of this initiative, they have established a task force dedicated to studying the crypto landscape, aiming to both regulate the industry and safeguard investors.</p><p>Building on that, <a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llglrd/2021687419/2021687419.pdf">the Library of Congress pointed out in November 2021</a> that although Guyana places restrictions on certain cryptocurrency activities, there isn’t a complete ban. Furthermore, the sector remains untouched by tax laws and measures against money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT).</p> Paraguay <p>Paraguay is yet another crypto-friendly nation where crypto is widely used in everyday life. However, in Dec. 2022, Paraguay failed to pass a bill that would have regulated crypto and mining. The bill titled “Regulating the industry and marketing of virtual assets — crypto assets” was approved <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/paraguayan-president-vetoes-virtual-assets-regulation-bill-citing-energy-intensive-nature-of-crypto-mining">only to be vetoed later by President Mario Abdo&nbsp;Benítez</a>.</p><p>This comes at a time when some of the world’s largest Bitcoin miners have set up operations in Paraguay, having been attracted by the cheap energy rates it&nbsp;offers.</p> Peru <p>Much like Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia, inflation is the primary driver of crypto and stablecoin adoption in Peru. And although its annual inflation has eased somewhat in July 2023 at <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/peru/inflation-cpi#:~:text=to%20Slow%20Down-,Annual%20inflation%20rate%20in%20the%20capital%20of%20Peru%2C%20Lima%2C%20fell,bank's%201%2D3%25%20target.">5.88%</a>, it is still above the central bank’s target band of 1%-3%. Political turmoil is another factor that has led to Peruvians buying crypto as a hedge against financial crisis.</p><p>The country has been taking a slower approach to adopting a regulatory framework. Only recently, it has begun debating the creation of a public registry of crypto service providers that aims to report what it terms “suspicious operations.” Profits from trading crypto, however, are&nbsp;taxed.</p> Suriname <p>Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the law in Suriname, and there are no mechanisms to regulate their use or tax the income derived from them. However, trading and investing in crypto assets is possible through P2P and crypto exchanges.</p><p>Located in the northern part of South America, Suriname is one of three carbon-negative countries in the world, seeing growing interest in crypto among its citizens with a couple of projects looking to connect its indigenous communities with global markets through&nbsp;crypto.</p> Uruguay <p>In Sept. 2022, Uruguay’s executive branch <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-bill-introduced-in-uruguays-parliament-what-you-should-know">submitted a bill to Congress</a> to give the country’s central bank legal powers to regulate crypto. The bill proposes to treat crypto assets as securities that can only be issued by a registered entity per the laws and regulations. It further aims to create a new category of companies for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) and seeks to amend the organic charter of the Banco Central Del Uruguay or Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) and put VASPs under the supervision of the Financial Services Superintendence.</p><p>The country’s central bank has started working on a plan to lay the foundation for regulating cryptocurrencies and companies that provide related services. For now, however, there is no explicit tax regulation in Uruguay for cryptocurrencies.</p> Venezuela <p>With its national currency, the Bolivar, depreciating more than 100,000% from 2014 to 2022, Venezuela has been pro-crypto for a while now. Over the last few years, Venezuela formed the national crypto department, created a framework for crypto mining, institutionalized the registration of crypto exchanges, and in 2021, launched its own cryptocurrency called The&nbsp;Petro.</p><p>But challenges arose when people accused the country’s crypto regulator of corruption. This controversy led to the arrest of the Superintendent of Cryptoassets, Sunacrip. Subsequently, Anabel Pereira Fernández, a lawyer who served as president of the Fondo de Garantía de Depositos y Protección Bancaria, the Venezuelan version of the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, took the reins and closed multiple crypto exchanges and mining farms. The national crypto group, Asociación Nacional de Criptomonedas (Asonacrip), opposed her decisions, emphasizing that private enterprises shouldn’t bear the brunt of internal regulatory issues.</p><p>José Ángel Álvarez, Asonacrip’s president, conveyed his concerns about the indiscriminate crackdown on mining farms, especially those fully compliant with required permits. And while the organization respects the need for a thorough anti-corruption probe, Asonacrip urged a more nuanced approach that doesn’t hamper the nation’s burgeoning crypto infrastructure.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>A perfect storm of challenges — weak national currencies, climbing inflation, political upheavals, capital restrictions, large unbanked populations, and a surge in remote work — has set the stage for crypto’s broad acceptance in South American&nbsp;nations.</p><p>While some countries have not yet specified any laws regarding crypto, most economies are contemplating regulation as the adoption of crypto assets continues to rise. A few countries have made significant advances toward establishing a regulatory framework, particularly those with the highest crypto adoption.</p><p>Across South America, legislation to oversee crypto has entered the discussion phase, each at varying progression levels. Yet, a unified and all-encompassing set of standards remains elusive, making it challenging to both harness crypto’s advantages and mitigate its associated risks.</p><p>Numerous countries in this region are taking strides to bring crypto under the rule of law, but the journey stretches far ahead.

				  In a previous article we discussed <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-does-the-ledger-do-anyway/">what exactly a ledger does.</a> In this article we will seek to understand why you would want to use one, and what your options are.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>For a brief recap, the ledger offers four important elements when building a decentralized ecosystem, these being:</p>
<p>1) Immutability: The data cannot be changed — by anyone.<br>2) Tamper resistance: A distributed ledger makes it very difficult for a malicious actor to break in and change material.<br>3) High availability: If one node on the network goes down for any reason, there are plenty of others to receive data from.<br>4) Geopolitical and infrastructure diversity: By hosting the ledger on servers located in multiple geographic areas and by diverse organizations, network resilience to technical problems is maximized — and this contributes to high availability.</p>
<p>While there are other options available, ledgers provide all these aspects in one convenient place; oftentimes, efforts to provide all the necessary features end up resembling a ledger anyway.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep in mind that while other options such as web infrastructure (did:web or similar) can provide some of the combination of immutability, tamper resistance, and high availability, they often fall short in one of them. For example, did:web doesn’t provide features universally, leading to a deficit in the high availability / diversity category.</p>
<p>When creating a decentralized network, using a ledger is often both the easiest and most effective choice. Once you have decided on using a ledger there are several different types that you can employ, all with slightly different specialties.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Work Networks</p>
<p>The most well-known proof-of-work network is Bitcoin, which was also the first widely-known application of blockchain technology. Beginning as a protocol for peer-to-peer financial transaction, Bitcoin evolved to become a store of value, known generically as a cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Without a central authority to authorize and record transactions, a decentralized financial network needs to establish a way to ensure that everyone agrees on what is written to the ledger, not least to prevent money being spent twice.</p>
<p>Bitcoin solves this with “proof of work.” It turns the verification of a new block of transaction records into a numeric challenge, the solution of which writes the block to the chain and earns the winner Bitcoin (which expands the amount of currency in circulation). Those that compete to solve the problem are called “miners,” and the complexity of the problem increases the more miners there are and decreases the fewer there are. The first miner to complete a proof of work for a new block, broadcasts the block to the rest of the network, where it is <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/get-started/what-is-bitcoin-mining/">verified</a> as following the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.</p>
<p>This process ensures that a new block is written to the ledger roughly every ten minutes and that the effort expended to solve the problem is evenly balanced to the Bitcoin earned. The easiest way to think of all this is that the effort required to verify transactions serves as a deterrent against fraud. This proof-of-work methodology, however, is not without controversy, as the effort is measured in computing power and hence energy to do the work. This excess usage of energy is frequently criticized as being wasteful.</p>
<p>If you want to use a proof-of-work network — such as Bitcoin — you will need to have your transactions verified by a miner, typically for a small fee. This fee can fluctuate and be unpredictable, but generally the more you are willing to pay, the quicker your transaction record will be verified.</p>
<p>Proof-of-Stake Networks</p>
<p>Some networks are controlled through proof of stake networks, often referred to as smart contracts, which are digital programs that mirror the functions of a traditional contract in the form of “if this, then that” rules. Once the terms of the contract are met, the program automatically executes the predetermined outcome. A popular analogy is that of a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/">digital vending machine.</a> As a smart contract program cannot be altered and automatically executes the terms of the contract, it can be trusted to continually execute the code it was created with.</p>
<p>While smart contract networks can do a lot more than finance-oriented, proof-of-work networks, this greater flexibility creates complexity. When a smart contract is not read and understood correctly by the user, or the contract parameters are defined poorly, the code may do things you were not expecting or don’t want to happen. And once the code executes it can’t be undone.</p>
<p>The transaction fees on this type of network pay for the execution of contracts (Ethereum calls this fee “gas”) and keeps the contracts to be kept active and running on the network. The fees required are subject to market forces, and makes this fee unpredictable.</p>
<p>Public-Permissioned Networks</p>
<p>A public permissioned network allows anyone to read the data written to it but requires authorization by the network to write to it. This is because the ledger is a permanent record and writing personal data to the ledger would breach data privacy law, such as the right to be forgotten.</p>
<p>Anyone wishing to write to this type of ledger (typically called a “Transaction Author”) must go through a “Transaction Endorser,” an organization that has a signed legal agreement with the network for approving writes to the ledger. Endorsers may charge a transaction fee for approving writes and pay a fee to the network for writing to the ledger. These fees can change, but are far less volatile than the fluctuating fees charged by other ledger technologies.</p>
<p>A good example of this type of network would be <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy-based identity networks.</a> These networks are ideal for decentralized identity as they are compliant by default with many rules and regulations put into place by governments that have run into issues with blockchains in the past. These ledgers do not require proof of work to establish consensus. They are not set up to create tokens or currencies and can’t handle complex smart contracts, focusing instead on the fundamental needs of decentralized identity.</p>
<p>No Network?</p>
<p>Some of the goals of decentralized identity may be accomplished without using a ledger at all. There is, for example, some support for hosting the assets necessary for an identity ecosystem on web infrastructure, a well-understood technology stack which avoids all the complexities of a ledger.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, web technology does not meet the requirements necessary for a stable decentralized ecosystem. While immutability and tamper resistance can be achieved with the proper application of digital signatures, and high availability in web infrastructure can be gained by using clusters of servers for redundancy (often by the use of a content delivery network, or a large, distributed collection of servers for delivering web content), these must be provided on a per-identifier basis. Some web infrastructure will have high availability, and some will not. This creates an uncertain environment when it comes to accessing the assets required for data verification.</p>
<p>Infrastructure diversity is partially solved using the same methods as high availability, but the need to continue hosting assets when a company or organization ceases to exist remains unmet. This also adds uncertainty when retrieving assets using web infrastructure.</p>
<p>The decision to use web infrastructure must be made with these deficiencies in mind and a plan to address them.</p>
<p>So how do I choose?</p>
<p>When choosing a network to host your solution the answer comes down to functionality and seeing if your goals align with what the network is good at. As we have outlined above, despite all falling under the umbrella of “blockchain,” these networks have very different ways of establishing consensus, creating blocks, and executing code.</p>
<p>A brief recap and slight oversimplification may be helpful here:</p>
<p>If you are looking for token or financial exchanges, and can handle heavy computation costs, a proof-of-work network is probably best suited for you.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a trustworthy way to broker deals and execute code when certain conditions are met — “if this, then that” — then a smart contract network is your best bet.</p>
<p>If you are looking to create a solution that needs to be highly visible to anyone, but exclusive about who can write to the network — such as anyone being able to check an ID but very few being able to create one — then a public-permissioned network will meet your needs nicely.</p>
<p>Need something free that meets credential holder needs and you don’t care about issuing capabilities? Did:peer could be an option for you.</p>
<p>Lastly, if high availability and infrastructure diversity are not major concerns, you might be able to use did:web.</p>
<p>This technology is new and highly nuanced. If you aren’t completely sure which network will be best for you, figuring it out before you start building can help you avoid costly mistakes.</p>

<p>The CA/Browser Forum released <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/05/24/ballot-csc-18-update-revocation-requirements/">Ballot CSC-18 to update the code signing certificate revocation requirements</a> in the Code Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBRs). The purpose of the ballot is to align the revocation reasons with the TLS BRs and to provide stricter requirements for revocation due to private key compromise and use in suspect code.</p>
<p>Revocation reason consistency will allow the CAs to have the same response and processes for most revocations regardless of certificate type. The revocation reasons are also similar to those with the S/MIME BRs. CAs issuing code signing certificates also need to address where a certificate has an associated private key that has been compromised or where the private key has signed suspect code. Suspect code may contain malicious functionality or serious vulnerabilities, such as spyware or malware. Suspect code may install without the user’s consent or may resist removal. The code may compromise user security or could be exploited in ways not intended by its designers.</p>
<p>The CSBRs will require certificates associated with compromised private keys or suspect code to be revoked within 24 hours. This will stop any future use of a compromised key or signing of more suspect code. The requirements also allow the CA to change the revocation date to a time earlier than when the revocation occurred. The purpose of backdating the revocation date is to choose a time before the key was compromised or suspect code was signed. With the earlier date, any timestamped signature by the compromised key or on suspect code performed after the date would no longer be trusted.</p>
<p>There is an exception to the certificate revocation requirements. This may apply when an application software supplier, such as Microsoft, requests a delay where immediate revocation has a potentially large negative impact to the code signing ecosystem. An instance may occur where revocation of the certificate will also impact good signatures, which will prevent the associated good code from being installed. A delay would allow the good code to be re-signed with a new private key.</p>
<p>The ballot includes reasons for a root CA to revoke a subordinate CA. These reasons are the same as those specified in the TLS BRs.</p>
<p>Entrust will update its practices to reflect the new ballot, which is effective April 15, 2024.</p>

<p>Keith Uber, VP of Sales Engineering at Ubisecure, recently joined Riley Hughes on <a href="https://trinsic.id/podcast/">The Future of Identity Podcast by Trinsic</a>. Keith discusses the role of verifiable credentials in organisational identity and vLEIs (Verifiable Legal Entity Identifiers), emphasising how verifiable credentials have implications for both consumer identity and organisational identity, whilst presenting new business opportunities and operational efficiencies. Keith highlights the European Identity Wallet (EUDI) initiative as a pivotal development for consumers, enabling streamlined authentication to government and third-party services. He also covers how Ubisecure’s RapidLEI service issues Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs), which have the potential to enhance business transactions, document signing, and verification processes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Keith and Riley discuss various key topics around organisational identities and vLEIs, including:</p>
 Verifiable Credentials and the Identity Landscape 
<p>Keith delves into verifiable credentials and their multifaceted impact on consumer and organisational identity. These credentials not only present an avenue for streamlined authentication, but also pave the way for new business opportunities and enhanced operational efficiency.</p>
 European Identity Wallet and the Consumer Identity Revolution 
<p>Keith highlights the European identity wallet initiative as a landmark development that has the potential to revolutionise consumer identity. This initiative is set to provide consumers with a unified approach to authentication across government and third-party services.</p>
 Navigating the Identity Ecosystem 
<p>Ubisecure closely monitors initiatives like eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI and has a proactive approach to related developments. Keith highlights Ubisecure’s commitment to staying at the forefront of identity technology trends and understanding how these trends might impact its services and offerings.</p>
 The Power of Organisational Identity 
<p>Delving deeper into organisational identity, Keith highlights the role of vLEIs in transforming business transactions, document signing, and verification processes. These credentials provide a unique opportunity for businesses to enhance their operations by creating a seamless and secure environment for transactions and interactions.</p>
 A Vision for the Future of Identity 
<p>Keith explains how he envisions a future where verifiable credentials play a pivotal role in shaping the identity ecosystem. He emphasises the need for a governing actor to ensure the widespread adoption and standardisation of these credentials.</p>
<p>The podcast episode provides a fascinating glimpse into the potential of verifiable credentials, particularly vLEIs, in transforming the identity landscape. The evolving consumer identity landscape, combined with the opportunities presented by organisational identity, showcases the far-reaching impact of this innovative technology.

 Interview with interested.fyi Team: Implementing Veramo in Buildathon at EthDenver 2023 EthDenver2023<p>We had the pleasure of interviewing the interested.fyi team after their participation in the last Buildl hackathon at EthDenver 2023. The team integrated Veramo into their project, and we were excited to learn more about their experience.</p><p>The Buildl hackathon is a renowned blockchain hackathon that brings together developers, entrepreneurs, and blockchain enthusiasts to collaborate and build innovative blockchain solutions. The Buildl hackathon was held recently at EthDenver 2023. The hackathon saw the participation of several teams, including interested.fyi.</p><p>The team consists of eleven (11)&nbsp;members:</p><p>Product: Alec.eth Gutman (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple DAO / Ex ConsenSys Mesh &amp; Matt Mulford (Engineer)</p><p>With contributions from Kate Yeh (Product)—Scroll/ Ex Arbitrum + DoorDash, Chester, LaCroix (Design)—Free agent / Ex Sushi + Component.fi&nbsp;, Charles Walsh (Design)—Free agent / Ex, John McClure (Engineer)—Inuition/ Ex Ethereal Ventures + DRW and Alexis Bednarick (Venture Contributooor) — Peeple&nbsp;DAO</p><p>Day2Day Venture Contributooors:</p><p>Alec.eth Gutman, Alexis Bednarick — Peeple DAO, Alexis Perez — Peeple DAO, and Manny Narang — Peeple DAO + Developer DAO</p><p>We wanted to know more about interested.fyi’s experience using Veramo and how it helped them in their project. Let’s dive into their journey and see how they #builtwithveramo!</p><blockquote>Veramo is an open-source modular framework that simplifies the process of building decentralized identity solutions.</blockquote> Q1. <p>Can we meet you? (Tell us about the team and your roles within the project.)</p><p>At our recruiting Service DAO, we are developing Interested.fyi, a product that enables us to contribute to the products we are most passionate about getting to market. Our goal is to improve the process of venture contribution and support the growth of innovative products.</p> Q2. <p>Tell us a bit about your solution. How did you come up with the idea for your project, and why did you build it? (Read: What problem were you trying to&nbsp;solve?)</p><p>As curators of conversations, we’ve often found that interests drive the best discussions. We are making it simple to express interest in working with and/or learning more about a specific&nbsp;team.</p> Q3. <p>How did you come across Veramo, and why did you choose it for your&nbsp;project?</p><p>I came across Veramo after struggling with another SDK that couples all of its features tightly to its storage layer. Googling DID solutions led me to Veramo. The Veramo tools existing independently of any other technology is what makes it appealing. We are free to set up a web resolver and then add on chain elements to enhance the experience as it makes sense, rather than going all in on a beta, decentralized storage solution. Also, the documentation was spot&nbsp;on.</p> Q4. <p>How did our framework help you achieve your project&nbsp;goals?</p><p>By only focusing on the DID/VC layer and allowing us to implement our own storage, we were able to ideate and test implementations more efficiently.</p> Q7. <p>How do you see this project going&nbsp;forward?</p><p>We will likely seek funding to build&nbsp;more</p> Q8. <p>If people are interested in collaborating, how can they reach&nbsp;you?</p><p>In the weeks to come, you’ll be able to attest to your interest in learning more about People DAO with ease. Until then, you can get in touch with us at @chipagosfinest on Twitter or Telegram.</p><p>___________________________________________________________</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about Veramo and connecting with others in the community, we invite you to <a href="http://discord.gg/sYBUXpACh4">join our community</a>.

Completion of the transaction will require all necessary corporate, shareholder and any regulatory approvals.&nbsp; Additional information will be provided on this potential transaction upon definitive agreements being executed. During this period, the Company will remain focused on completing this opportunity as it does not have the resources to finalize its outstanding financial statements in order to seek a revocation of the existing cease trade order.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands Metaverse may continue to pursue its own, non-dilutive financing efforts in the short term.&nbsp; As announced in April 2023, Aftermath Islands received an executed share purchase agreement from a Family Office in the UK and EU but has yet to receive any funding.&nbsp; As a result of these unfulfilled obligations on the part of the Family Office, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited is in the process of terminating that agreement and may seek other financing opportunities.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing marketing and business efforts, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited has achieved almost $3 Million USD in gross retail and commercial sales since the start of the program in November 2021, which have been recorded as Deferred Revenue in accordance with IFRS, with approximately 8,000 purchases made through the Shopify store, and the Company is continuing to execute its business plan to the best of its abilities under the current circumstances, including meeting a number of key technology milestones.&nbsp; Lost Kingdom of T’Sara users have generated, since late October 2022, almost 8 million Resource Pack NFTs for use inside of Aftermath Islands.</p>



<p>Aftermath Islands is currently developing an Artificial Intelligence powered creator program, allowing users to perform Karaoke songs through their Avatars.&nbsp; Users can sing into a phone or web cam and the platform will take their facial gestures and head movement and using AI, map that to their Avatar, which can sing any one of over 10,000 licensed Karaoke songs.&nbsp; This program is expected to debut later this year and has already received interest from a number of major platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Company continues to expand its program opportunities with the Liquid Avatar Mobile App and is pursuing additional opportunities outside of Aftermath Islands to integrate its technology for Proof of Humanity into other platforms.</p>



<p>“This has been a difficult time for many micro-cap public companies, including our own.&nbsp; Management and the team members continue to work diligently to create long term value.&nbsp; We are excited by this opportunity to consolidate our programs and believe that this will potentially provide the best solution for shareholders given the current economic environment,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</p>

<p>Ten years ago, if you had said ‘Individuals should have control over their data’, it might have seemed controversial. Nowadays it’s commonly accepted. But as one door opens, another door closes. We need to be&nbsp;aware.</p><p>What people understand and mean by the word ‘control’ differs, and the consequences of these differences are far-reaching. One interpretation of ‘control’ could unleash a once-in-a-lifetime social and economic breakthrough. But there is another, very common understanding of what it means, and if pursued it could make our lives a lot worse. We need to look beyond glib slogans to understand their real&nbsp;content.</p> Two meanings of ‘control’ <p>Most people, when they think about issues relating to personal data, focus on how the world currently works. Quite understandably. But these workings are the product of a particular history that has resulted in today’s status quo. This history revolved around the organisation-centric database.</p><p>‘Organisation-centric database’ sounds like a bit of a mouthful but actually it’s very simple. Organisations collect and generate data about individuals and use this data to provide services. To do this they need a place to keep this data — in their systems: the organisation-centric database.</p><p>In this context, when people talk about individuals exerting more control over their data, they mean individuals having more control over what organisations can do with their personal data: what data they can collect, what they can use it for, who it is shared with, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>That’s great. But it is also very limited. It doesn’t, for example, actually allow individuals to collect and store their own data in their own databases and to use it for their own purposes. It’s like creating a personal mobility system where people can order taxis to take them places, but where they are not allowed to own their own&nbsp;cars.</p><p>It also creates a rather specific agenda. If people want to control the data that organisations have about them, they need to understand what this data is and what it is being used for. They also need to understand how to exert control via each different organisation’s own systems. For this agenda to work, people need to be ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ (for example, about the meaning and content of long and detailed terms of service and privacy policies). They need to invest the time and effort needed to get informed and to act on the conclusions of their investigations.</p><p>The net effect of this agenda is that it imposes new burdens on individuals, the implication being that if they are too ‘lazy’ to get themselves informed and to act on what they discover, then they deserve everything they get. People, we then get told, <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/do-people-really-want-to-manage-their-data-bac784b98be1">don’t actually want to manage their&nbsp;data</a>.</p><p>In short, this organisation-centric form of control actually reaffirms the primacy of organisations in their role as the effective rulers of the data&nbsp;economy.</p> The person-centric view of the&nbsp;world <p>Under the person-centric view of the world, individuals are empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes, independently of any organisations that may be collecting data about them e.g. in their own personal data store. This personal data store holds their data safely, under the individuals’ complete control, outside of and beyond the systems of the organisations they have data relationships with.</p>Person-centred is a different design creating different outcomes<p>As the figure shows they can use this data however they wish (not just the purposes that the organisation wants to put it to). And they can share this data with whoever they wish (including other organisations wanting to use it to provide them with services).</p><p>Previously, we’ve talked in great detail about the immense economic benefits this approach to personal data creates. You can see what we said about this in our <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">White Paper</a> and in our special blog series on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/economics-of-personal-data/home">The Economics of Personal Data</a>. But for now, let’s just note that this approach creates a completely different action&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>Instead of demanding that individuals get themselves ‘educated’ and ‘informed’ it operates on the basis of safe by default (the data sharing agreements referred to in the illustration). When you share data with an organisation why shouldn’t you ‘just know’, because the necessary safeguards have already been built in to how things work, that the organisation will only collect the data it needs to provide the service in question, that it will only use this data to provide the agreed service, and that it won’t share this data with anybody not involved in delivering this&nbsp;service?</p><p>Requiring people to inspect privacy policies and terms and conditions before doing business with an organisation is akin to expecting them to do their own safety checks on a plane before embarking on it (after which it’s their own fault if anything goes&nbsp;wrong).</p><p>Also, instead of focusing on the mechanisms of how individuals should assert control within each organisation’s different systems, it focuses on providing them with the tools and infrastructure they need for independent control of their data, including a single dashboard by which they can change settings and permissions for every organisation they deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>In other words, the two different interpretations of control lead in entirely different directions. One interpretation reaffirms the primacy of the organisation as the power-holder in data relationships and places new burdens on individuals; the other empowers individuals via the provision of new personal data store infrastructure and makes their lives&nbsp;easier.</p> Two meanings of ‘individual as point of integration of their&nbsp;data’ <p>This chalk and cheese contrast between the two different interpretations of the word ‘control’ has other implications, potentially with even more damaging consequences.</p><p>There is now a growing movement of people and organisations (such as <a href="https://www.mydata.org/">MyData Global</a>) that seek to give individuals more control over their data. One much discussed aspect of this is making individuals the point of integration of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s a great idea. Currently, data about us is dispersed across dozens — probably hundreds — of different organisations, each collecting a different set of details about us: about our money, our health, our activities online, what we buy, and so on. Just imagine what could be done with this data if it was all put into one place, to create a rounded picture of our lives! The potential benefits are enormous. But so are the potential dangers.</p><p>Under the first, organisation-centric interpretation of the word ‘control’, individuals are confined to exercising control over the data that organisations collect about them. The more data the organisation has, the more things it can do with this data, the more value it can add — or so the argument&nbsp;goes.</p><p>But on the other hand, the more data it has about you (that is, the more information about you that has been ‘integrated’ into one organisation’s database) the more intrusive it can become, and the more power it can exercise over&nbsp;you.</p><p>Currently, in Government and other circles, there is much discussion about the potential efficiency and other benefits of ‘more data sharing’ whereby more information about individuals can be ‘integrated’ into different organisations’ databases from multiple different sources.</p><p>These initiatives have an initial veneer of citizen ‘empowerment’ and ‘control’ because individuals have to ‘consent’ to these new agglomerations of data being created. But what they add up to is the further centralisation of data power in a few large organisations’ hands along with the risk of turbocharged invasions of privacy and abuses of data power. Current attempts to create Super MyAccount systems that aggregate data from many sources are an example of this. They are doing the exact opposite of what they pretend to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The alternative interpretation of individuals being the point of integration of their own data is where individuals are able to access all the data that is currently held about them in different organisations’ databases and to place this data in their own personal data store. This includes certified copies of data held by the organisation, copies that are kept up to date or just delivered and updated when&nbsp;changed.</p><p>This data is kept beyond the sight of or control of any organisation that collects data about them; where only the individual can see what the full personal database contains; and where individuals are in complete control of what they use this data for and who they share this data with. This is the approach which we at Mydex are operating and extending, initially the UK: a secure personal data exchange network that is safe, secure, consensual, distributed and resilient.</p><p>As our work on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this approach to making individuals the point of integration of their own data puts them in charge of, and in control of, the most valuable personal data asset in the world: a complete, rounded picture of the individual’s life — one that is independent of the organisations the individual deals with and that genuinely empowers that individual.</p><p>In doing so, it fundamentally alters the balance of power in the personal data economy, as individuals, rather than organisations, exercise distributed control of the economy’s most powerful data&nbsp;asset.</p><p>Once again, the two different interpretations of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘portability’ <p>The differences continue. It is now almost universally recognised that the unique characteristics of data — the fact that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when used, and that many different users can therefore use the same bits of data for different uses — means that, to realise its full potential, it has to be shared. Improved data sharing is now a big and growing policy theme across all Governments.</p><p>But here again, the same fundamental differences in meaning and implication arise. Under the organisation-centric assumption — the assumption that data about individuals will always and only be held by organisations — ‘data sharing’ means data sharing between organisations, with data being passed from one organisation to another but never back to the individual. This is how Open Banking currently works, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>Such data sharing is supposed to be fine, because it only happens with the individual’s consent, so they are deemed to be ‘in control’. But what this approach actually does is a) disperse individuals’ data even further across even more organisations, making it even more difficult for individuals to exercise real control over this data and b) create the new points of data integration that increase the power of these organisations, as just discussed.</p><p>The second, person-centric interpretation of data portability / sharing takes us in exactly the opposite direction. Here, data sharing means organisations that have collected data about individuals sharesi this data with the individuals that this data relates to. By doing this it puts the individual at the heart of the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This sort of data sharing genuinely empowers individuals, making them the point at which data about them is integrated. But the implications reach much further than this, because in doing so, it transforms the structure of the data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Currently, our data economy is organised around a long series of separate parallel data silos, each of them collecting data about the individual, each of them doing their own thing. Genuinely empowering, person-centric data sharing transforms this structure by adding individuals to its workings, making each individual an independent data sharing node within a broader data sharing&nbsp;network.</p><p>Imagine the existing data ecosystem as a redwood forest full of giant trees soaring separately and in parallel into the sky, each of them doing its own separate thing. With citizen-empowering data sharing, individuals are made into a sort of mycelial network within the soil that supports these trees, feeding nutrients and information to each other and with other trees to create a new vibrant, interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>Once again, the two meanings of the same words couldn’t be more different.</p> Two meanings of ‘interoperability’ <p>But we haven’t finished yet because the differences continue. For data sharing / data portability to work, different parties’ data systems (their software, formats, standards etc) need to be able to ‘talk’ to each other. They need to be interoperable.</p><p>Here’s a simple example: In the UK we do dates with the day first, the month second, and the year third. So 02.09.2023 means the second of September 2023. But the Americans do the day and the month the other way round, so that 02.09.2023 means the ninth of February 2023. If there isn’t a way to ‘translate’ from one format to the other chaos will&nbsp;ensue.</p><p>But here’s the thing. Under the organisation-centric interpretation of control, of individual as the point of control of data portability, the more individuals’ data is dispersed across many different organisations the more barriers to interoperability rise.</p><p>In fact, direct organisation-to-organisation data sharing generates a complexity catastrophe as it scales, as each organisation has to find ways to interoperate with the systems, formats and standards of every other organisation. The diagram below explains the simple maths behind this: if every node in a network is going to connect to every other node, each time you add a new node, the number of connections that are needed multiplied exponentially. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">This blog</a> provides chapter and&nbsp;verse.</p>Why organisation-to-organisation data sharing creates a complexity catastrophe<p>This complexity catastrophe is avoided if, aided by their personal data stores, individuals become the hubs by which data about themselves is shared. Now the only entity that organisations have to deal with in terms of data sharing is their own existing customers, via their&nbsp;PDS.</p><p>In this person-centric approach to data sharing, it is not the job of existing data holding controllers to deliver interoperability. It is the job of the personal data store operator to manage the interoperability challenges that arise from different organisations sharing their data with individuals. Far from imposing huge, added risks and costs on organisations, it greatly simplifies their lives while adding immense benefits to the individuals receiving this&nbsp;data.</p><p>Personal data stores can undertake this interoperability challenge very efficiently because once they have solved the problem of translating one format or software system to another, this solution can be applied — automated — every time such a translation needs to be made. This make-once-use-many times approach to interoperability is order-of-magnitude times more efficient than the immense duplication of effort that is required for direct organisation-to-organisation data&nbsp;sharing.</p> Conclusion <p>If you are old enough, you may remember the early days of social media when, it was commonly claimed, peer-to-peer information sharing would change the world. News would flow instantaneously across borders empowering people with ideas and knowledge and that would spread democracy and bring down hierarchies, tyrannies, the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>Then came Cambridge Analytica-style manipulation of information feeds, fake news, hate speech and trolling. The new utopia was gamed out of existence by those who saw an opportunity to turn it into its opposite.</p><p>Today, there is near universal agreement that individuals should have ‘control’ over their personal data and many well-meaning people are working hard to make this happen. That’s great. But it needs to be done in the right way. We need to think through the how and the why, and be wary of unintended consequences.

<p></p> 
<p>The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council recently updated their Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) for protecting payment card data. The latest version, <a href="https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v4_0.pdf">PCI DSS 4.0</a>, introduces more than 60 new or updated requirements, with new directives around passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) among the most consequential.</p> 
 What is PCI DSS 4.0?  
<p>First introduced in 2004, the PCI DSS guidelines apply to any organization that stores, processes or transmits cardholder data. To demonstrate PCI DSS compliance, organizations undergo assessment on all systems that interact with the cardholder environment.</p> 
<p>In March 2022, the Council announced PCI DSS version 4.0, providing guidelines that aim to better secure account holder and payment card data within today’s evolving cyberthreat landscape. The current reigning version, PCI DSS 3.2.1, will be officially deprecated in March 2024, and organizations will be required to implement the PCI DSS 4.0 guidelines in a phased manner over twelve months.</p> 
<p>While version 4.0 contains updates across the board, some of the most significant relate to strong authentication requirements, specifically password usage and multi-factor authentication (MFA). Weak forms of authentication leave organizations and data vulnerable to brute force attacks, credential phishing and multiple other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/overview-different-types-of-password-attacks">password-related attacks</a>. Understanding these new requirements is key for PCI DSS compliance. We look at five critical areas as well as their potential impact for your business.</p> 
 1. PCI DSS 4.0 Password Requirements  
<p>One of the biggest changes in PCI DSS version 4 is the very strict specifications regarding passwords. PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements (sections 8.3.4-8.3.9) include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Passwords must be long and complex: Under PCI DSS 4.0 requirements, passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters&nbsp;  
  Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused: An exception is made if continuous, risk-based authentication is used, where the security posture of accounts is dynamically analyzed, and real-time access automatically determined accordingly.  
  Login attempts should be limited: According to PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements, after a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users should be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means.  
  
 Potential impact of the PCI DSS 4.0 password requirements  
<p>Longer passwords are more onerous for users and are more likely to be written down or insecurely saved in files on a device. Forced updates also tend to trigger unsafe user behaviors as people often make only minor changes that hackers are likely to guess. Moreover, all these requirements are likely to result in higher help desk calls. <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-forrester-tei-of-hypr">Recent research from Forrester and HYPR</a> shows that the average help desk call costs organizations $42.50/call.</p> 
 2. MFA Required for All Access to the CDE  
<p>Under PCI DSS 3.2.1 guidelines, MFA was required only for administrators accessing the cardholder data environment (CDE). Under the new PCI DSS MFA rules (8.4.2), all access to the CDE must be gated by <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication</a>. The MFA requirements apply for all types of system components, including cloud, hosted systems, and on-premises applications, network security devices, workstations, servers and endpoints.</p> 
<p>Multi-factor authentication is defined as using two independent factors from the categories:</p> 
  
  Something you know, such as a password or passphrase.&nbsp;  
  Something you have, such as a token device or smart card.&nbsp;  
  &nbsp;Something you are, such as a biometric element&nbsp;  
  
<p>In its guidance on authentication factors, Version 4.0 specifically says to look at <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/benefits-of-fido-authentication">FIDO (Fast IDentity Online)</a> for the use of&nbsp; tokens, smart cards, or biometrics as authentication factors. While it stops short of requiring FIDO-based factors, some of its other guidance, as you will see below, points to a clear preference.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>The new regulations make clear that multi-factor authentication must be used every time the CDE is accessed, even if a user already used MFA to authenticate into the network under the remote access requirements (see below). This will add significant friction for workers, with potential consequences for both productivity and employee satisfaction. Moreover, most organizations, even if they already use some form of MFA, do not have the correct technology or systems to address the requirement for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/why-passwordless-desktop-mfa-is-critical">MFA for desktops</a>, workstations and servers.</p> 
 3. PCI DSS Now Requires MFA for All Remote Access  
<p>Previously, MFA was required for remote access to the cardholder data environment. With this updated PCI DSS MFA guidance, anyone logging in from outside your secured network perimeter, even if they are not actually accessing the CDE, must use multi-factor authentication. This includes all employees, both users and administrators, and all third parties and vendors. This also means that any web-based access must use MFA, even if used by employees on site.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>Effectively this means that all of your workforce that are remote, hybrid or have supporting roles outside the organization must use MFA at all times. It also means that any employee using a web-based application to access your networks and systems must use MFA, even if they are on site. In addition to the cost and IT burden of implementing MFA, cumbersome MFA procedures can negatively impact both employee productivity and satisfaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 4. PCI DSS MFA Configuration Requirements  
<p>The new standard doesn’t just cover who must use MFA and when, it also introduces guidelines on how MFA systems must be configured to prevent misuse. Many traditional MFA solutions are susceptible to <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, push bombing and other attacks that bypass MFA controls. Requirement 8.5 specifies weaknesses and misconfigurations to assess for PCI compliance. These include:&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Your MFA system must not be susceptible to replay (aka man-in-the-middle) attacks.  
  MFA must not be able to be bypassed unless a specific exception is documented and authorized by management  
  Your MFA solution must use two different and independent factors for authentication  
  Access cannot be granted until all authentication factors are successful  
  
<p>As discussed earlier, the PCI DSS guidance on types of authentication factors makes reference to FIDO-based authentication. FIDO authentication is phishing-resistant, eliminates replay attacks and, depending on the FIDO solution, is inherently multi-factor.</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your MFA solution uses SMS, OTPs or other insecure methods, it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 5. Strong Cryptographic Protocols  
<p>While earlier versions of PCI DSS required the use of strong cryptographic protocols to protect transactions and cardholder data, PCI DSS 4.0 extends the cryptographic requirement. With the new rules, any stored sensitive authentication data (SAD) must be encrypted using strong cryptography.&nbsp;</p> 
 Potential impact  
<p>If your authentication system doesn’t properly encrypt and securely store authentication data, then it may not meet PCI compliance requirements.</p> 
 Meet PCI DSS 4.0 Compliance With HYPR  
<p>The new PCI DSS framework now aligns much more closely with the NIST SP 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines, guidance from CISA and the OMB, and other regulatory agencies that urge the adoption of FIDO-based phishing-resistant MFA and a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> approach.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-pci-dss-compliance">HYPR helps organizations comply with PCI DSS</a> MFA requirements as well as multiple other provisions included in the standard. HYPR replaces the traditional password-based approach with secure passwordless authentication that is certified by FIDO and based on passkeys. Core elements of the solution, such as the incorporation of biometric authentication, possession of a trusted device, and cryptographic tokens securely stored on the device TPM or secure enclave, ensure strong, phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication that meets PCI DSS requirements.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;At the same time, HYPR greatly improves the user experience, eliminating the need for long, complex passwords and streamlining multi-factor authentication to a single user gesture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there’s never been doubt about the importance of digital security, over the last few years it seems to have garnered a lot more attention – specifically by governments across the globe. That’s no surprise given some of the issues being looked at such as the growth of connected devices and services in the IoT space, for example. But one area that is seeing an increase in calls to action these days is mitigating the threat quantum computers will pose to traditional public key cryptography in use today.</p>
<p>Late last year, we saw an abundance of specific direction coming out of the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/how-government-action-is-providing-a-blueprint-for-post-quantum-preparedness/">United States</a>. This direction came in the form of the NSA releasing the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/the-nsa-releases-a-post-quantum-preparedness-timeline-that-begins-immediately/">CNSA 2.0 Timeline</a>, which outlined the timeline for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The timeline spans several years and acknowledges the need to plan and budget for the transition, but it also states that – at least for software and firmware signing – the transition needs to begin immediately. Further, the White House issued not one, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/M-23-02-M-Memo-on-Migrating-to-Post-Quantum-Cryptography.pdf">but two</a> clear calls to action for government agencies to begin preparing for the quantum threat by designating a lead for collecting cryptographic information systems by December 2022, and then they must have also performed a cryptographic inventory by May 4, 2023.</p>
<p>But attention around the quantum threat and the need to migrate to post-quantum cryptography isn’t limited to the United States. This is a global issue, and as such, has garnered global attention. Here are a few examples:</p>
 
 The General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands very recently <a href="https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook">released a handbook</a> that advises all organization to start preparing for the quantum threat now, and it also provides some clear steps to begin on that journey. 
 The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) produced a <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-cryptography-current-state-and-quantum-mitigation">report</a> that outlines what organizations can implement now to ensure their data remains secure, including the strategy of choosing a hybrid implementation, which would mix traditional cryptography with quantum-safe cryptography. 
 The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany published its own <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Brochure/quantum-safe-cryptography.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=4">guide</a> with the intent of outlining the threat, demystifying PQC, and making recommendations on how to prepare. 
 The National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI) in France has a <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2022/01/anssi-technical_position_papers-post_quantum_cryptography_transition.pdf">position paper</a>. The paper expresses France’s views on the quantum threat – including that the threat should be considered today to address the current threat of “harvest now, decrypt later,” where sensitive data is being collected by bad actors today, with the intent of decrypting it once a quantum computer is capable. 
 
<p>One thing all the above countries and more (such as Canada, the UK, and Australia) have in common is everyone is awaiting the results of the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) competition and the subsequent standards. NIST kicked off a post-quantum cryptography competition, announced the first set of winners in the summer of 2022, and is expected to release draft standards any day now. Although a few European countries have been looking at other algorithms, that’s merely to have options on top of what NIST recommends. A recent <a href="https://www.epc.eu/content/PDF/2023/Cybersecurity_DP.pdf">discussion paper</a> out of the European Policy Centre drives home the importance of a coordinated European action plan, but really this needs to be a global coordination to avoid fractured standards. NIST is seen as the gold standard for independent, open, and transparent competitions, so ideally once NIST comes out with its final recommendations, that will result in international standards and adoption.</p>

<p>Creating a strong and trusted organisational identity is fundamental to secure and efficient business. A highly assured organisational identity can help to differentiate an organisation from its competitors by presenting a verified, recognisable touchpoint that builds trust in your interactions. This blog explores the value of a highly assured organisational identity, as discussed by Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, when he joined Michael Becker of Identity Praxis and Randy Warshaw of Provenant at the recent Mobile Ecosystem Forum (MEF) event in London:</p>
<p></p>
 Organisation Identity builds trust and opens up efficiencies 
<p>In a previous blog, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/corporate-identities-trustworthy/" title="Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy">Corporate identities are public, we help to make them trustworthy</a>, we considered how a lack of trust can impact an organisation, and also the true cost of organisational misrepresentation. There are many examples of the negative impact caused by bad actors faking an organisation identity. For example, the infamous case involving a fake Eli Lilly Twitter account declaring free insulin, which caused a $15b fall in the company’s market cap.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Utilising strong organisation identity helps avoid these kinds of misrepresentations.</p>
<p>Embracing organisation identity also has a positive impact on an organisation’s bottom line. This is highlighted in the case of the Finnish Government where Ubisecure provided the Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) solution that connected the Finnish business registry (containing the organisation identities) with verified individual identities. The solution allowed individuals to assert their legitimate representation of their organisation, or delegate digital representation onwards to other organisations or individuals, such as external accountants or payroll providers. Tax filing transactions could then be automated, resulting in 99% cost reductions over the traditional in-person approach. <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/delegated-id-success-story-finnish-government.pdf" title="See the case study">See the case study</a>.</p>
 <p>Delegation Tree Example</p> 
 The Legal Entity Identifier is the most compelling Organisation Identity 
<p>There are a number of Organisation Identifiers available today (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/legal-entity-identifier-lei/comparing-organisation-identifiers/" title="read more about the comparisons">read more about the comparisons</a>). Some are regional, some vertical, some closed to the public… but only one is truly global, standardised and trustworthy to be the one Organisation Identity on which we base all future identity services – and that is the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).</p>
<p>There is considerable value in combining Organisation Identity (via the LEI), verified Individual Identities (via BankID, eIDs and other initiatives), and delegation capabilities (via IAM services). The combination enables businesses to express:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who you are, who you represent and the rights that you have to represent them.</p></blockquote>

It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>DF51 is live today, Aug 17. It concludes on Aug 25. 150K OCEAN is budgeted for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF51   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Challenge DF. Predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Active DF&nbsp;: Challenge DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF51 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN rewards total. That OCEAN is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Volume DF. All except what Challenge DF gets = 70,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 5,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: additional substreams, tuning substreams, and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The DI (or self-sovereign identity) industry is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">predicted</a> to explode in value from USD 0.65 billion in 2022 to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/decentralized-identity-market-worth-102-130000466.html">USD 102.0 billion</a> by 2030, and Forbes recently listed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2023/02/07/forbes-blockchain-50-2023/?sh=60880ea6319d">50 smart companies</a> investing in blockchain (beyond crypto) to make their businesses operate better, faster or cheaper. Blockchain is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">“anchor of trust”</a> for DI.</p>



<p>The leading DI solution anchored in blockchain is a fully user-controlled <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">digital identity wallet</a>, in which the user accepts, securely stores, and shares <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">digital identity and other verified documents</a> to prove their identity or credentials with services.</p>



<p>Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_14zTBLJ_Y">short video</a> about the new European digital identity wallet as an example.</p>



<p>Digital wallets and other DI applications can deliver immediate business value from:</p>



 
 new revenue opportunities (e.g. a customer wallet offering) 



 cost saving opportunities (e.g. replacing inefficient processes) 



 solving common business problems (e.g. easing the regulatory compliance burden). 
 



<p>Read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.</p>



 DI has the potential to benefit all industries and sectors. Here are 17 industries that can leverage Decentralized identity technology right now: 



<p></p>



  
 1. Banking and finance:  



<p>DI has massive application in this industry, including for customer-controlled onboarding, consent and data management; streamlined AML and KYC processes; secure and tamper-proof authentication, including for cross-border transactions; and fraud prevention. The <a href="https://www.itsme-id.com/en-BE">itsme</a> app in Europe, built by Belgium Mobile ID, a large consortium of Belgium’s leading banks and mobile network operators, is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 2. Healthcare:  



<p>COVID-19 accelerated the already real need for secure and private interoperable e-health. Scope for DI applications includes in secure patient identity management; secure and standardized health information exchange, data privacy and consent management; better clinical trial recruitment and data integrity and transparency; simpler medical credentialing and licensing; and more efficient health insurance processes, including claims processing. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9907408/">US</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-standard-reports/nhs-digital-staff-passport">UK</a>, and other jurisdictions are well ahead this work.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 3. Farming and mining:  



<p>Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. These two industries generate significant greenhouse gas, and must therefore regularly submit greenhouse gas emission reports to government agencies. Cost of compliance to regulation can be significant, especially when dealing with multiple government agencies. DI-based <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are a very promising solution for compliance regulation, and are already used in a number of regulatory environments including <a href="https://trustalliance.co.nz/">Trust Alliance New Zealand</a> and the <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">Energy Mines and Digital Trust project</a> in British Columbia.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 4. Government and public administration:  



<p>Governments are one of the pioneers of secure and portable digital identities for identity verification and KYC processes for functions such as issuing official documents, accessing public services, or conducting financial transactions. DI is also applicable for border control and travel processes using digital passports and travel credentials; managing public health initiatives and crises including vaccinations; more efficient financial inclusion and aid distribution; and secure and interoperable data sharing. This <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">article</a> lists many examples of government digital ID at various stages of implementation, including the United Nations (UN) and World Bank&nbsp;<a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/">ID4D</a>&nbsp;initiative which aims to provide everyone on the planet with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/inspired/legal-identity">legal identity</a>&nbsp;by 2030.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 5. Education:  



<p>Another of the most common early use cases for DI is education. DI offers a secure and tamper-proof way to issue and manage digital credentials and certificates and to authenticate identities for online learning in the education sector. Institutions can issue diplomas, degrees, or certificates as <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, which students and alumni can easily share with employers, other educational institutions, or credential verification services. DI also simplifies the hiring process, promotes trust, boosts cross-institutional research, reduces administrative burdens, simplifies consent management, and limits fraud risk. Read this <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2022/4/self-sovereign-identity-user-scenarios-in-the-educational-domain">deep dive</a> on developments and benefits to date.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 6. Travel and hospitality:  



<p>This is a booming use case thanks partly to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re already seeing applications of DI to streamline traveller verification processes, such as airport security checks and immigration procedures as well as hotel check-ins, to bolster security, free up resources and ease congestion. Travelers store data and biometrics as a digital travel credential on a device or in the cloud. The idea is to create a single sign-on experience for travellers for a seamless journey across all different aspects of travel. There are already around <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/digital-identity-services/trends">1.2 billion ePassports</a> in use worldwide and smart borders are progressing rapidly. And check out the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">Aruba Happy One Pass (Aruba HOP) app</a> which allows an air traveler to create a digital travel credential (DTC) from their passport, and is a collab between Indicio, SITA and Aruba.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 7. Identity and access management (IAM):  



<p>This is a foundational area for DI and you can read our whitepaper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2022/10/innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">Innovating Identity and Access Management with Decentralized Identity</a>. DI transforms IAM systems by providing people with their digital IDs and credentials, to improve authentication processes, and simplify user access across different platforms and services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 8. Supply chain and logistics:  



<p>DI can deliver reliable product authentication, verification, transparency and traceability throughout the supply chain; streamline the process of verifying supplier identities and credentials; enable secure data sharing and collaboration; limit counterfeiting; streamline customs and border control processes to reduce paperwork and fraud and speed up customs clearance procedures; aid compliance; and support financing, insurance, and recall processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 9. Non-profit and humanitarian organizations:  



<p>DI can help securely identify beneficiaries, streamline aid distribution processes, and enhance transparency and accountability in humanitarian initiatives. The <a href="https://www.evernym.com/identityforgood/">Identity for Good</a> initiative is a great example.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 10. IoT and connected devices:  



<p>In a <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HL_LFEdge_WhitePaper_021121_3.pdf">whitepaper</a> from Hyperledger Indy, as leader in the DI space, it says that “… by 2025, connected devices will generate more than 73.1 zettabytes of data every year—where each zettabyte is a billion terabytes. How can telecom service providers secure all these devices, manage the integrity of each device, and provide the transparency that consumers and enterprises want about how their data is used?” It proposes using DI to create a trusted platform for a telecom ecosystem that can support IoT devices throughout their entire lifecycle and guarantee a flawless customer experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 11. Notary and legal services:  



<p>DI allows a more secure and efficient method for verifying identities, reducing the risk of identity fraud; streamlines document verification and timestamping based on digital fingerprinting or document hashes; enables use of digital signatures; and facilitates secure data sharing and cross-border services.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 12. Social media and online platforms:  



<p>The greatest use case for DI here is significantly better user control and privacy over personal information. With <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>, users can authenticate their identity and gain trust in the network, which leads to greater authenticity of user profiles, less misinformation, and better user interactions.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 13. E-commerce and retail:  



<p>This sector can drastically improve customer trust and experience, by allowing seamless account creation across e-commerce platforms. It can also secure payments, reduce fraud, increase transparency of supply chains, and build secure peer-to-peer marketplaces.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 14. Insurance:  



<p>DI can streamline KYC processes; improve accuracy of risk assessment and underwriting; increase the efficiency and transparency of claims processing; give customers greater control over their personal data and consent management; enable use of parametric insurance and smart contracts; and facilitate risk pooling and reinsurance processes.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 15. Energy and utilities:  



<p>DI can enable secure and verifiable identities for energy consumers, facilitate peer-to-peer energy trading, and enhance energy grid management.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 16. Real estate:  



<p>In real estate and property, DI can improve property ownership verification and title management; expedite the tenancy agreement process; and enable smart contracts and escrow services to automate the execution of agreements, improve compliance with predefined conditions before funds or property are released, and limit reliance on intermediaries.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
  



  
 17. Gaming and virtual worlds:  



<p>Blockchain is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/blockchain-gaming-how-revolutionizing-industry#:~:text=With%20blockchain%2C%20players'%20identities%20are,fair%20system%20for%20all%20players.">revolutionizing gaming</a>, with more secure transactions, identity verification, and in-game economies some of the benefits.</p>
  



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The bottom line for any industry is that DI gives greater privacy, security, transparency, efficiency, and user experience. The game changer is that customers control their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>, which drastically improves their privacy and security, reduces fraud and other risks, and builds brand loyalty and trust.</p>



<p>DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-5-how-anonyome-labs-is-actively-contributing-to-decentralized-identity/">standards</a>&nbsp;are rapidly evolving to drive the interoperability of DI solutions across the internet, and Anonyome Labs is proud to contribute to the standards.</p>

<p>In a world where “Sign in with Google” rules, it feels almost unbelievable that we used to have to remember usernames and passwords for every account or application we touched online. That reality was even more cumbersome for HR and IT administrators, who had to keep a whole company’s worth of usernames, license numbers, passwords, and the like up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The introduction of SSO changed all of that. But times have changed again, and beneath the promise of seamless identity and access management lies a complicated reality many startups and small businesses aren’t ready for. In this blog post, I’ll talk you through how SSO has changed over the years to now encompass much more than many businesses need and why it’s time for an alternative.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO historically: a lifesaver 
<p>The value of SSO is undeniable and it was met with open arms: Employers could reduce help desk requests about forgotten passwords, saving everyone time. SSO created a strong access point that reduced vulnerabilities by consolidating login credentials and improving overall security. Password fatigue became a thing of the past, ostensibly boosting productivity.</p>
<p>Various SSO providers, like Okta, used a bookmark-like system to locally save passwords for easier logins. This approach, while user-friendly, had terrible inherent security risks. Over time, as technology evolved, application vendors started configuring SSO instances using Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization information between different systems. You can think of SAML as basically an additional layer of authentication on top of SSO.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Google Workspace and OAuth came along and changed all of that. OAuth, short for Open Authorization, is a standard for access delegation adopted by companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook — anywhere you can “Sign in with ___.” For example, when you use “Sign in with Google,” you are giving Google permission to handle credentials for you without you needing to enter additional credentials or passwords.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO today: more than you need 
<p>Because it’s so easy to implement, more modern application vendors have adopted “Sign in with Google,” and they don’t charge for it. This has made the need for SAML-based SSO nearly obsolete — especially for startups and SMBs, 70% of which operate on Google Workspace to begin with.</p>
<p>So IAM providers have bucketed functionality like provisioning/deprovisioning and lifecycle workflow into the SSO definition. There’s SAML support, but then you also need Life Cycle Management, API Access Management, Workflows, etc. And the more features, the higher the price tag.</p>
<p>The problem is that these protocols are often intertwined, forcing you to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users That’s fine for enterprise-level operations where there are resources to implement and manage all of this (and maybe other reasons for using those standards) but when it comes to startups and SMBs, it’s simply overkill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the issues is that IAM providers currently focus on providing a blanket of capability across everything you could do, instead of focusing on everything you need to do now. And, of course, you have to build it all yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for a new approach to SSO: There has to be an option that sits between either tracking permissions and credentials in a spreadsheet or going all in with an expensive enterprise-level solution.&nbsp;</p>
 SSO tomorrow: a task-centric approach 
<p>YeshID is a new identity and access management tool built specifically for startups and SMBs working in Google Workspace. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, we focus on the real tasks that startups and SMBs face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure.</p>
<p>We believe in starting with the task in mind and tailoring solutions to meet those specific needs while using foundational best practices that pave the way for scalable and secure operations management as you grow.</p>
 
 A single dashboard allows you to monitor access requests and IT licenses, and the management of onboard and offboard tasks across all your apps. 
 Access levels you can configure by department or function make onboarding and offboarding a breeze. 
 Passkeys, based on FIDO standards, offer a secure and streamlined sign-in alternative to passwords. They’re phishing-resistant, simplify account registration, and are compatible across multiple devices, including those in close proximity. 
 Transparent pricing means no hidden costs or surprise upsells.&nbsp; 
 
<p>We provide smart defaults that ensure you don’t have to start from scratch or spend valuable resources on re-engineering the digital identity processes. This not only saves time but also ensures companies adopt best practices early, without having to be experts in digital identity.</p>
 SSO and you: join us 
<p>The SSO landscape isn’t keeping up with the needs of startups and SMBs today. It’s time to move away from complex and costly solutions and embrace simplicity and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this vision of streamlined, low-overhead identity and access management, we invite you to join our Beta. You get early access to YeshID and your experience will help us shape the future of SSO for small businesses. <a href="https://yeshid.com/beta/">Get more info</a>, and join us today.</p>

 Introduction 
<p>Businesses today are at a crossroads of limitless prospects and invisible obstacles like fraud and money laundering as they navigate the exciting but treacherous seas of digital innovation and global development. Step into the protective embrace of Know Your Business (KYB), a pivotal rudder for the ship of contemporary business. We invite you to join us in this illuminating investigation of know-your-customer (KYC) checks as we reveal their critical function, regulatory insight, and the promising future of this important field.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
<blockquote><p>Risk Management: Implementing rigorous KYB checks can help businesses identify potential risks and avoid financial crimes, legal issues, and damaged reputations. It’s an essential step, not an option.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Tailoring to Regulatory Landscape: KYB requirements vary across regions and industries. Therefore, businesses must tailor their KYB strategies to unique legal and compliance needs, especially when planning global expansion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Leverage Technology for Efficiency: AI, blockchain, and big data analytics can automate and streamline KYB checks, making them more efficient, accurate, and comprehensive. Businesses should explore these technologies to stay ahead in the competitive market.
</p></blockquote>
 What is Know Your Business? 
<p>Know Your Business (KYB) is a compliance and risk management process that businesses undertake to verify the identity of beneficial owners and assess the risk profile of their business partners. This process includes checks on business registration, licenses, physical address, source of funds, and other vital components. KYB helps businesses mitigate financial and legal risks, comply with international regulations, and foster stronger business relationships.</p>
 Benefits and Outcomes of Rigorous KYB Checks 
<p>Implementing robust KYB checks can lead to numerous benefits:</p>
 
 Risk Mitigation: KYB checks help identify and avoid potential risks related to fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. They safeguard the company’s reputation and profits from potential financial losses and legal consequences. 
 Regulatory Compliance and Penalty Avoidance: KYB checks ensure businesses comply with relevant legal requirements, thereby avoiding non-compliance penalties. 
 Strengthened Business Relationships: Thorough KYB checks build transparency in our business relationship relationships, which fosters trust and supports these relationships. 
 Protection of Business Reputation: By avoiding associations with fraudulent or corrupt businesses and financial institutions, companies can protect their reputation, an invaluable asset in today’s competitive business landscape. 
 
 Understanding the Regulatory Landscape for KYB Checks  
<p>Compliance with KYB checks by shell companies and financial institutions isn’t just a strategic business decision but is necessitated by numerous regulations worldwide. Several anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing measures, such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the European Union’s 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, clearly mandate rigorous KYB checks. Businesses that fail to comply with these legal requirements may face significant consequences, including monetary fines, revocation of business licenses, and even imprisonment of involved officials.</p>
<p>However, the regulatory landscape for KYB needs to be more monolithic. It varies across regions, unregulated industries, and jurisdictions, each with specific rules and nuances. This variability necessitates businesses to understand and effectively tailor their KYB strategies to each region’s unique legal and compliance requirements. This becomes increasingly crucial for multinational corporations and those seeking global expansion.</p>
 The History of Know Your Business Regulation 
<p>The concept of KYB originated from the broader regulatory landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) regulations, which began to gain prominence in the late 20th century.</p>
<p>This came as a response to growing concerns about the misuse of the global financial system for illicit activities. Over time, these regulations evolved, and the need for businesses to ‘know’ their customers and other companies became clear. This resulted in the Know Your Customer (KYC) and, subsequently, the KYB regulations aimed to verify the identity of individuals and businesses involved in financial transactions.</p>
 Detailed Breakdown of KYB Check Components 
<p>A thorough KYB check comprises a detailed investigation into several key components, which form the bedrock of comprehensive customer due diligence:</p>
 
 Business registration or license verification is a fundamental step in a KYB check. It involves validating the legality and legitimacy of business activities of a business entity by examining its business registration status or other licensing documentation. This step helps confirm that you are dealing with a legitimate, legally recognized business and not a fraudulent entity. 
 Physical address verification: Verifying a business’ beneficial owner’s declared physical address adds security. It ensures that the business exists beyond mere paperwork and isn’t a shell company. Thus the bank secrecy acts minimize the risk of fraudulent partnerships. 
 Phone number verification involves validating the official phone numbers registered under a business’ beneficial owner’s name. While it may appear as a straightforward check, it is crucial to affirm the business’ beneficial ownership and the legitimacy of the owner and business relationship. 
 Source of funds investigation: To ensure that the ultimate beneficial owners of a business aren’t involved in any illegal financial activities such as money laundering or financing terrorism, it’s vital to investigate its sources of funds. It provides insights into a company’s financial integrity, beneficial owner’s reputation, business partner, or financial institution. 
 Business risk analysis based on location: Geographical location can significantly impact a business’s risk profile and due diligence further. A company operating in a region known for high corruption levels or financial crime rates may pose a higher risk, and additional due diligence requirements may be required. 
 
 Know Your Business Checks During Onboarding 
<p>During the onboarding business, KYB checks serve as a critical first line of defense against fraudulent associations. After initial business registration and verification, detailed KYB checks are performed. These checks include verifying the onboarding business customers’ physical addresses, official phone numbers, and sources of funds.</p>
<p>The collected information is then cross-referenced for validation. Based on this verified data, a risk assessment is conducted to gauge the potential risk associated with the prospective business partner. The entire business onboarding process becomes a crucial phase where rigorous KYB checks are pivotal.</p>
 The KYB Process: A Technical Walkthrough 
<p>Successfully conducting KYB checks involves following a strategic, step-by-step process:</p>
 
 Initial research and data gathering: This first stage involves the meticulous collection of detailed information about the business. This includes legal name, physical address, contact information, and information about corrupt business owners and key management personnel. 
 Verification of provided business information: The second stage involves validating the collected information. This is typically achieved by cross-referencing the data with reliable sources, such as government databases, financial institutions, or trusted third-party data providers. 
 Risk assessment: Once the data has been verified, models are applied. These models consider various factors, including the business or customer’s identity, location, industry, financial health, and management. The resulting risk profile can guide subsequent decision-making regarding potential partnerships or collaborations. 
 
<p>Ongoing monitoring and periodic reassessment: KYB isn’t a one-off process. Businesses must establish procedures for regularly and continuously monitoring and reassessing business compliance with their partners. This ongoing scrutiny ensures timely identification and management of changes in a business relationship’s status or risk profile.</p>
 Automating Your KYB Checks 
<p>Technological advancements have introduced novel approaches to KYB checks, enhancing their efficacy and scope:</p>
 
 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: These technologies can automate data collection, the verification process, and risk assessment, making KYB checks more efficient and accurate. They can also learn from patterns and improve their predictive accuracy over time. 
 Blockchain Technology: Blockchain provides a decentralized, transparent, and immutable ledger, offering a trustworthy platform for data validation and electronic identity verification. It aids in enhancing the security and reliability of verification processes. 
 Big Data Analytics: Leveraging big data can help businesses perform more comprehensive KYB checks. It allows for analyzing massive data sets, helping to identify patterns and insights that more straightforward checks might overlook. 
 
 Best Practices and Industry Standards in KYB Checks 
<p>To derive maximum benefits from KYB checks, it’s essential to adhere to industry best practices:</p>
 
 Reliable and vetted resources for data verification: Businesses should ensure that the data they use for KYB checks maintain compliance and is sourced from reliable and vetted resources. 
 Automation and digital tools: Automation can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of KYB checks for business entities. Businesses should leverage digital tools for data collection, verification, and risk assessment. 
 Regular updates and reassessments: Since businesses continually evolve, KYB checks should not be a one-time activity. Regular updates and reassessments are necessary to maintain an accurate understanding of the legal status of business partners. 
 Consulting with legal or regulatory experts: Considering the complexity of foreign transactions, other regulations, and the regulatory landscape, it can be helpful to consult with legal or regulatory experts when designing and implementing KYB checks for cash transactions. 
 
 Conclusion 
<p>Wrapping up, KYB checks are vital, providing defense against financial misconduct and fostering transparent business relationships. As the world embraces digital transformation and global expansion, KYB checks are becoming central to operations. The horizon for KYB checks looks promising, with technologies like AI, blockchain, and big data analytics paving the way for efficient, insightful screenings.</p>

   Learn about three AM initiatives topping IT project lists 
	<p>Access management is the front door to your organization, network, and applications and services. "Must have" initiatives that rely on access management (AM) are now on nearly every organization's IT priority list. But to get the most from these initiatives, it is essential to have the right AM solution and components in place. (Read how <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-overall-leader-access-management">KuppingerCole</a> rated ForgeRock Access Management in its 2023 Leadership Compass report.)</p>
	
	<p>In this post, we'll cover the three areas where access management is set to transform and grow in influence for users both inside and outside your organization.</p>
	
	
	 1. Passwordless Authentication is Making the Password History 
	
	<p>For years — for generations! — the user-selected password has held sway over the login experience. Alternative solutions have come along, like multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware tokens and biometrics, but they often proved clunky, expensive, and less-than user-friendly. Market acceptance of these purpose-built devices never reached more than 30% of internal users, and consumers were often left with only weak two-factor authentication using passcodes sent via SMS (text messages).</p>
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> — the act of logging in without a password — is based on industry standards, including FIDO2, WebAuthn, and SAML, so you're not staking your career on an unproven protocol. From a high-level perspective, passwordless moves us away from a world where it's necessary to store and protect a huge centralized password database, a magnet for malicious actors. In the passwordless world, an individual generates asymmetric cryptography key pairs and stores the private keys on a mobile device or browser. The attack surface is reduced and user satisfaction skyrockets as people can use familiar devices and the convenience of biometrics to log in to their applications.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Here's where it is essential to get access management right. There are two audiences for passwordless authentication: your consumers and your internal users. For consumers, replicating the experience they have with their mobile devices or browsers is a no-brainer — you can just use FIDO2. Where things get challenging is doing the same thing for your internal users on desktops, workstations, VPNs, mainframes, VDIs…and so on. Your access management solution needs to be able to handle all of it. Approaching your passwordless project with consumer and workforce users in mind will help ensure that you've got it right.</p>
	
	
	 2. Orchestration, Maestro! 
	
	<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-identity-orchestration">Identity orchestration</a> is the creation of dynamic login journeys for users — those that minimize friction while maintaining high security. In other words, journeys get people where they need to go, quickly and securely. In the past, all users had essentially the same login experience. These login pathways were hard-coded by developers over weeks and months and were rarely changed.</p>
	
	<p>But times have changed and now a single login pathway no longer works for everyone. Users need different enrollment options, anti-fraud checks, identity-proofing for new users, MFA enrollment, and more. Scenarios vary by whether it is an end-user customer logging in or an internal employee. Some large enterprises have hundreds of journeys designed to support their various applications and use cases they run.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>A strong AM solution includes a graphical orchestration engine that has a drag-and-drop interface so the components listed above — the identity-proofing, anti-fraud, MFA, etc. — can be dropped in, moved around, and adjusted as needed.</p>
	
	<p>One user journey can be copied, tweaked, and set up as another journey to support a different set of users. Risk assessment can be made dynamically and in real time as signals from a user's device or location are shared with the orchestration engine, enabling access decisions that allow/block the request or require supplemental authentication. When the threat environment changes, even non-technical, non-IT people, like application owners, can be authorized to make changes to their user journeys, taking the burden off IT.</p>
	
	 3. Decentralized Identity and the Digital Wallet 
	
	<p>While they are two technically separate concepts, decentralized identity and the digital wallet (DI/DW) are inextricably joined in both usage and technology (the mobile phone), where they reside.</p>
	
	<p>The concept of decentralized identity is this: since the beginning of time, if you wanted to gain access to a website or application, you had to provide information about who you are, usually in a cumbersome form-fill, to the identity provider (IdP). The IdP represents the organization (bank, corporation, healthcare entity, government entity) that owns the digital asset you want to access. This identity information usually includes your email, mobile phone number, name, address, password, but can also include myriad other items such as preferences and personalizations. The IdP acts as the central repository for this information, abiding by applicable regional privacy laws — some do this better than others.</p>
	
	<p>With decentralized identity, individual users take back control and can decide how much or how little identity-related information to share from the safety of their mobile phone's secure vault. The digital wallet concept follows the same contours with the user being able to authorize payment directly from their mobile device.</p>
	
	<p>Why AM is Key:</p>
	
	<p>Organizations are looking for ways to accommodate digital users with DI/DW to help them facilitate lightning-fast transactions and reduce abandoned shopping carts that result from burdensome account signups. At first glance, it would appear that DI/DW solutions would have less need for access management than traditional "centralized" identity approaches, but that's not so.</p>
	
	<p>The traditional functions of access (who gets in) and authorization (what they get to do) are every bit in play with DI/DW, and may be more important than ever. They help ensure that enough identity information is received to be able to enact a transaction, that enough know-you-customer (KYC) data is shared, that the user is still logging in with appropriate passwordless MFA, and that authentication is still logged for audit purposes. AM even plays a role in ensuring that user access and authorizations are revoked in a timely manner.</p>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management">ForgeRock Access Management</a> solution — part of the ForgeRock Identity Platform — helps organizations achieve passwordless authentication, create and drive seamless user journeys through orchestration, and supports organizations accommodating decentralized identity and digital wallet users.</p>

<p>It's been just over either months since OpenAI released ChatGPT, and already the new platform has become a household name. With artificial intelligence (AI) being one of the hottest topics in the world today, everyone from techies to the layperson is taking notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/ai-statistics/">Forbes</a>, “Over 75% of consumers are concerned about misinformation from AI.” While this new technology doubtlessly has exciting potential, it also poses new cybersecurity risks. For reasons such as this, the US Senate is getting started on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/tech/senate-ai-plan/index.html">new legislation</a> that specifically regulates the use of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapting to the challenges posed by AI in identity and access management is crucial. As security professionals, we know that we can’t protect against everything. Long ago, Ping Identity learned that as soon as we detect what bad actors are doing, they find a novel way to circumvent detection methods. Today, we are just beginning to see how advanced machine learning is being used to penetrate established authentication methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there will be challenges ahead, it’s evident that Identity Threat Detection &amp; Response (ITDR) and Decentralized Identity (DCI) can be used in conjunction with one another to combat security threats in the age of AI.</p>

 What is Fund Ring? <p>Fund Ring is a Web3 funding primitive that seeks to help Filecoin and IPFS-connected open source projects get long-term support for maintenance, security, and feature updates with monthly or annual funding. </p><blockquote>When you join Fund Ring as a supporter or a maintainer, you join a broad community of FLOSS projects. It’s like a good ol’ fashioned web ring for funding projects you rely on.</blockquote><p>Supporters can contribute to Fund Ring projects by selecting <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">"Fund the Ring" in the app</a> and connecting any EVM-compatible wallet that allows users to add the custom FEVM network, such as MetaMask. Whenever a supporter decides to "Fund the Ring," the contributed FIL (less the gas fees) is deposited into the verified project wallet. </p><p>Open source maintainers join the ring by visiting the Fund Ring app, verifying the ownership of their Git repo with a funding proof, and deploying their own contract. We created a Fund Ring widget that the user can embed on their app's page to solicit contributions for their specific project. Only the contract owner, who has also verified that they have commit access to the Git repo, can withdraw the funds.</p><p>As a maintainer, let the ecosystem know what you need on a monthly or annual basis so you can dedicate the time to keep code maintained and secure. Run one-off campaigns to support new features.</p><p>Watch Fund Ring creator and Fission engineer Andy take us through the Fund Ring demo:</p> Why Build Fund Ring? <p>While we love <a href="https://opencollective.com/fission">Open Collective</a> and are an active fiscal sponsor and contributor on their platform, we wanted to create a solution designed with Web3 audiences in mind. One where a contributor can switch between FIL, ETH, Matic, and more to fund their favorite projects and get their own projects funded as well.</p><p>We wanted to create a self-sustaining and distributed option that empowers developers to get recurring funding on a monthly or annual basis that helps with long-term maintenance.</p><p>As well, much like Open Collective enables projects to send funds to other projects, we see a ring of projects promoting and funding each other. </p> Test the Ring <p><a href="https://fundring.fission.app/">Fund Ring</a> is available on Filecoin Calibration Testnet. As we gather more feedback and onboard various projects, we will transition to Filecoin Mainnet.</p>  As a project owner, register your project, sign and commit your funding proof to Git, and ask supporters to fund with sweet sweet testnet tFIL.  As an ecosystem supporter, get some <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/get-test-tokens/">testnet tokens from the faucet</a>, and fund some projects. You can try this by <a href="https://fundring.fission.app/fund/">funding the Fund Ring itself</a>.   Future Plans <p>Some of the upcoming features and ideas include:</p>  Support for native FIL accounts: Use <a href="https://filsnap.fission.app/">Filsnap</a>, Brave, or other native Filecoin wallets to fund (🗓 planned)  Filecoin vesting support: Use the built-in vesting features to send FIL over a month or year (💡 idea)  Filecoin multisig: Use the built-in Filecoin multisig (💡 idea)  Split support for dependencies: Show other projects in your funding widget, and allocate sending a percentage of funds to a ring of projects (💡 idea)  <p>There are many other ideas to layer on top of these basic contracts and on-chain events. For example, you could aggregate projects and allocate funds across them, present a UI for stack ranking or voting, or as an individual, create a project where you curate projects in a ring and help gather funds that go to all of them directly! </p><p>Explore the <a href="https://github.com/FundRing/fundring">GitHub repo</a> to get involved with Fund Ring, or drop by the <a href="https://filecoin.io/slack">#shared-fission channel in the Filecoin Slack</a>. We'd love to hear your questions or comments! </p>

<p>As digital transformation continues to change the way we do business and interact with various entities and organizations, cyberattacks continue to intensify and compromise user accounts and identities. Identities are the largest attack vector with weak/compromised credentials and phishing attacks being two of the most successful type of attacks.</p>
<p>Organizations are taking notice, and many have implemented various security controls such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), single sign-on, and training employees to identify a phishing attack. Additionally, many run ad-hoc simulated phishing attacks to evaluate employees and retrain them to identify phishing attacks on an ongoing basis. While these trainings have been found to be effective in educating employees on what a phishing attack is, how phishing emails look, and what to look for when trying to evaluate the authenticity of an email, quite often employees are engrossed in their daily tasks and activities and will at some point get tripped up and click on a phishing link, whether simulated or real.</p>
<p>At the same time, threat actors are getting better at disguising phishing attacks, with entire criminal organizations dedicated to building services like phishing-as-a-service for other cyber criminals to use in their targeted phishing campaigns. In addition, AI technologies are also being adopted by bad actors to aid in the development of cyberattack campaigns, with services like <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/wormgpt-new-ai-tool-allows.html">WormGPT</a> (a generative AI tool for bad actors similar to ChatGPT) that allow adversaries to launch sophisticated phishing and business email compromise attacks with relative ease. These malicious AI tools use the latest marketing and branding from your websites and learn from previously successful phishing campaigns to create highly accurate phishing campaigns that can evade even the most trained eye from identifying the phishing email.</p>
<p>How can organizations protect against phishing attacks?</p>
<p>Organizations need to stop relying on employees to identify phishing emails and move to implement security solutions and controls that can prevent phishing attacks from compromising an individual’s identity. They can start by moving to a completely passwordless solution, eliminating one of the largest attack vectors – namely weak or compromised credentials. In addition, not all MFA is the same and offers varying levels of protection against MFA bypass attacks. Moving to phishing-resistant, passwordless MFA along with single sign-on (SSO) capabilities will help prevent phishing campaigns from successfully compromising a user’s account.</p>
<p>What is phishing-resistant passwordless MFA is and how does it prevent phishing and other MFA bypass attacks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Phishing-resistant MFA</a> involves high assurance authentication with the use of cryptographic keys and digital certificates, as well as requiring the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/should-physical-proximity-be-a-required-mfa-factor/">physical proximity</a> of the user to the device from which they are requesting access to a resource. There are a few passwordless MFA options that offer phishing-resistance, namely FIDO2 keys, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/02/goodbye-passwords-hello-passkeys/">passkeys</a>, and certificate-based authentication with Bluetooth proximity detection.</p>
<p>Certificate-based authentication (CBA) is considered the highest assurance of these options. It involves the use of verified digital certificates assigned to a user and devices from which a user authenticates themselves, along with a Bluetooth proximity requirement. This ensures the user is in close physical proximity to the device from which they are accessing a resource and that the device itself is also a trusted device with a known valid digital certificate assigned to it by a certificate authority.</p>
<p>How to protect against common <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2022/10/is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-good-enough/">MFA bypass attacks</a> with CBA</p>
<p>SIM Swap Attack – This type of attack involves taking over a user’s mobile number by having it transferred to a SIM card owned by the attacker. However, with CBA, the certificates tied to the user and device reside on the original device owned by the user and protected with biometrics, ensuring that attackers will not be successful in compromising the user’s identity.</p>
<p>MFA Prompt Bombing – In this scenario, an attacker will trigger MFA push authentication notification on a victim’s mobile device in the hopes of a user accepting one of the many prompts and granting access. With CBA, an attacker will not have access to the digital certificate on the user’s mobile device and in addition will not satisfy the physical proximity factor requirement as they initiate such attacks remotely.</p>
<p>Adversary in The Middle (AiTM) – In this type of attack, cyber criminals set up a reverse web proxy with a phishing site in between the victim and the legitimate application, or webpage. With CBA, attackers cannot successfully compromise a user’s identity as they will not have access to the certificate assigned to the user, as well as the certificate issued to the user’s device to make it a trusted device, thereby protecting against an AiTM attack.</p>
<p>Holistic and layered defense with Zero Trust</p>
<p>Given identity is one of the largest attack vectors, protecting against most common identity-led attacks with phishing-resistant authentication is a critical part of a Zero Trust framework, which provides organizations with a comprehensive set of controls to implement a strong proactive defense to protect against and reduce the impact of a breach when one occurs.</p>

<p>Microsoft’s recent introduction of a new system for LinkedIn members marks a significant step towards strengthening workplace verification. By leveraging Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn now offers a credential issuance system that provides members and organizations with greater confidence in the authenticity of their work connections and profile information. This expansion of Microsoft’s digital identity technology to LinkedIn introduces a new feature that empowers businesses to enable their employees to validate their employment details publicly. The implications of this feature extend beyond individual profiles, as it fosters trusted interactions and informed hiring decisions. Verifiable work histories on LinkedIn make it easier for employers to verify candidates’ qualifications and experience, leading to more efficient hiring processes. According to LinkedIn, this feature is currently operational with over 4,000 companies on their platform, and they have further plans to expand its availability to additional companies in the future. Through the utilization of verifiable credentials, LinkedIn members can establish their credibility and authenticate their work affiliations, thereby providing additional assurance to their professional connections.</p><blockquote>In this blog, we will explore the concept of verifiable credentials, their numerous benefits and the transformative impact they can have on the overall LinkedIn ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Image Credits:&nbsp;LinkedIn</p><p>Verifiable Credentials: A Game-Changer for Digital Identity:</p><p>Verifiable credentials represent a groundbreaking development in the realm of digital identification. These tamper-evident digital records contain key information about an individual, such as their name, date of birth, and contact details. Unlike traditional digital records, verifiable credentials offer a unique advantage: they can be trusted by third parties without relying on a central authority for verification. This groundbreaking feature ensures greater privacy and security for&nbsp;users.</p><p>Here is a typical process for creating and verifying a verifiable credential:</p><p>Issuer: The issuance of verifiable credentials is a straightforward process. Any entity, such as a government agency or financial institution, can create a digital record containing relevant information about an individual. The issuer then signs and encrypts this record using their private key, creating a tamper-evident credential that can be verified by&nbsp;others.</p><p>Holder: The holder of the credential, whether an individual or an organization, has full control over its management. This includes deciding who can access it and when it can be shared or&nbsp;revoked.</p><p>Verifier: The verifier, on the other hand, can check the digital signature on the credential using the issuer’s publicly available public key. If the digital signature is valid, the verifier can trust the information contained in the credential without relying on a centralized authority, thereby ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering or falsification.</p><p>Revolutionizing Efficiency with Verifiable Credentials:</p><p><a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> represent a remarkable innovation in the realm of digital identification. By granting individuals more control over their personal data while enhancing security and privacy, verifiable credentials have the potential to revolutionize how we manage digital identity. Verifiable credentials not only enhance security and privacy but also redefine operational efficiency. This transformative technology has the potential to reshape resource-intensive processes, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. The implementation of verifiable credentials empowers businesses to accomplish tasks that would typically take several days in a matter of mere minutes. This streamlined process stands to yield substantial time and monetary savings for these organizations.</p><p>Platforms like LinkedIn benefit greatly from the implementation of Verifiable Credentials. In traditional hiring processes, recruiters invest considerable time in verifying candidates’ claims. Verifiable Credentials streamline this process by granting instant access to verified data, reducing administrative burdens, and expediting decision-making.</p><p>For businesses, the onboarding of new hires becomes simplified through Verifiable Credentials. Swift authentication of qualifications, training achievements, and credentials ensures the presence of necessary skills and endorsements.</p><p>Elevating Security and&nbsp;Trust</p><p>Built on a foundation of robust security and privacy principles, Verifiable Credentials uphold data integrity and prevent tampering and unauthorized access. This cryptographic security layer ensures data reliability, minimizing identity fraud risks and misinformation.</p><p>The decentralization of Verifiable Credentials eliminates the need for a single central authority. This empowers individuals to selectively share their credentials, addressing privacy concerns and fostering unwavering trust in digital interactions.</p><p>Conclusion: LinkedIn’s Stride Towards Trust and Transparency</p><p>The introduction of verifiable credentials on LinkedIn marks a significant stride towards enhancing trust and identity verification in the professional realm. By utilizing Microsoft Entra Verified ID, LinkedIn members now have the opportunity to validate their employment details, ensuring greater transparency and credibility. <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/services/decentralized-digital-identity-and-verifiable-credentials">Verifiable credentials</a> revolutionize the way we manage digital identity, providing individuals with control over their personal data while maintaining security and privacy. This innovative technology has the potential to transform digital wallets and reshape the entire landscape of verifiable data. As we embrace the digital era, <a href="https://www.ayanworks.com/">AyanWorks</a> stands ready to support organizations and individuals in leveraging the power of verifiable credentials.

  <p>In today's digital landscape, businesses face an increasing threat of fraud that can lead to significant financial losses and damage to their reputation. To effectively combat fraud, businesses need Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms (FRIPs). These advanced technologies leverage multiple data sources, data analytics, and ML detection models to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. FRIPs empower organizations to stay ahead of fraudsters by uncovering hidden patterns, identifying anomalies, and generating alerts. By implementing FRIPs, businesses can mitigate risks, reduce false positives, and safeguard their financial well-being and brand image. Stay one step ahead of fraud with FRIPs and ensure a secure future for your business.<br><br>John Tolbert, Director of Cybersecurity Research at KuppingerCole, will give an overview of fraud trends and the tools businesses and other organizations can use to detect and prevent fraud. This webinar will highlight our research methodology, evaluation criteria, and some findings from the recently released Leadership Compass on FRIP. We will also show how you can view and drill down into the results of our FRIP research in our new <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/open-select/">KC Open Select tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/fraud-reduction-intelligence-platforms"></a>

   New capabilities fix security issues with MFA push notifications 

<p>Zero Trust security models call for the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to ensure that only authorized users may access protected IT resources. Many organizations are adopting MFA to add a layer of security for remote workers. Customer-facing organizations are also implementing MFA to mitigate identity-based attacks, such as phishing, and to help quash the rise in <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/what-is-account-takeover">account takeover</a> fraud.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords. MFA renders the use of stolen credentials futile, as attackers are highly unlikely to have access to a user's other authentication factors, such as a mobile phone.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks">Microsoft</a> has stated that using MFA may stop 99% of password-related attacks within an enterprise, so an increasing number of enterprises have begun to require MFA before granting account access. That's the good news. The bad news is that attackers are now trying to undermine the effectiveness of MFA with some success.</p>

 MFA is under attack 

<p>While MFA is a vast improvement over a simple username and password combination, there are ways that MFA can be compromised, including:</p>

<p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks: Fraudsters position themselves between organizations (such as financial institutions) and users to intercept, edit, send, and receive communications without being noticed.</p>

<p>SIM-card swapping attacks: A cybercriminal uses social engineering tactics to transfer a user's mobile phone number to a new SIM card owned by the criminal. If such an attack is successful, the victim's apps, including banking apps, can be activated on the impersonator's phone.</p>

<p>Pass-the-cookie attacks: A session or authentication cookie can be stolen and injected into a new web session to trick the browser into thinking the authenticated user is present and does not need to prove their identity.</p>

<p>MFA fatigue attacks (aka MFA spamming or MFA prompt bombing): The MFA fatigue attack relies on people to be distracted, careless, or frustrated by frequent requests to authenticate. As a new form of social engineering, MFA fatigue raises considerable security concerns.</p>

 What is MFA fatigue? 

<p>Sometimes, as a means to an end, people will engage in behavior that they know is borderline unsafe. Who amongst us hasn't disabled a smoke alarm to make the low-battery alert stop its intermittent screeching? MFA fatigue attacks rely on similar human impulses, which ultimately make users vulnerable to schemes such as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a>.</p>

<p>With MFA prompt bombing, attackers attempt to get access to an account or device by flooding a user's authentication app with push notifications. Some attackers send a few push notifications a day thinking they will fly under the radar, while others bombard the user with continuous messages, but the intended outcome in either approach is the same: to get users to authorize access in order to make the notifications stop, thereby granting access to the attacker.</p>

 Preventing MFA attacks 

<p>Push authentication is one of the most secure, simple, and convenient user authentication methods and a popular MFA choice. To avoid attacks on push notifications, ForgeRock has developed two features: MFA push authentication with context and push authentication with number matching.</p>

 Push notification with additional context 

<p>The push notification with context feature lets you keep your users safe from MFA attacks by sending them additional context. When users are presented with a push notification request, they are provided contextual information about the request, such as where the request came from, information about the device, the user agent, or other signals.</p>

<p>When the push notification is received, the user can review the contextual authentication information, decide whether it is legitimate, and accept it or reject it.</p>

    
MFA push notification with additional context Push notification with number matching 

<p>With number matching in a push request, the user is presented with a number on the login screen and must select that same number in the authenticator app.</p>

<p>For more secure logins in the near term, we advise enabling push notifications with number matching. This method prevents an attacker from gaining access to an account if the user accidentally hits "Approve" on an MFA notice.</p>

<p>This technique also minimizes friction for users. When compared to other MFA techniques, such as entering a six-digit number from a software token or SMS message, matching a two-digit code doesn't significantly add to the login process.</p>

    
MFA push notification with number matching Why enterprises should use these MFA approaches 

<p>If you've implemented MFA using an authenticator app for your workforce users or your customers, you want to be sure it isn't vulnerable to MFA fatigue. With the ForgeRock Authenticator's additional context or number matching, you will no longer have to worry about users who unintentionally approve MFA requests.</p>

<p>For over 45 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>



<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>



 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 



<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>



<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>



 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 



<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Mastercard Open Banking (some services provided by Finicity, a Mastercard company), an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoints can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>







 99% Data Coverage&nbsp; 



 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering most student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Aidvantage, Navient, Nelnet, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 



 Quality of Data 



 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp;&nbsp;API calls to the Finicity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more.&nbsp;Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 



 Transaction lookback period&nbsp;has been extended to one year in order to accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered for an extended view of account history. 



 Complementary data insight solutions&nbsp;with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 



 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 



 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 



<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help over 45 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>



 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 



 
 Create&nbsp;frictionless onboarding&nbsp;and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 



 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 



 Finicity data powers leading&nbsp;personal finance management&nbsp;(PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 



 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are taking advantage of the SECURE 2.0 Act, creating benefits like&nbsp;401k accounts that match student loan payments&nbsp;and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 



 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits.&nbsp;Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs&nbsp;can be built specifically for current students. 



 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely&nbsp;apply for federal programs&nbsp;like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No&nbsp;wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers.&nbsp;Quick and secure. 
 



 Step Into the Future 



<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>



<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

  Crypto regulations vary globally: Japan embraces it, China resists, the EU introduces MiCA for uniformity, and the US grapples with overlapping jurisdictions.  Countries like Switzerland, Singapore, and Bermuda are pioneering progressive crypto approaches, blending innovation with robust oversight.  Despite the global patchwork of regulations, a cohesive international framework remains elusive, though it’s a prominent G20 discussion topic.  <p>Crypto is changing how the world thinks about money. But when we look at the rules for crypto, every country is different.</p><p>While Japan likes crypto and has initiated several initiatives to position itself as a crypto-friendly destination, China has not been so accommodating. And just south of China, India has decided to adopt a wait-and-watch approach, although the country’s Central Bank is strongly against giving any legal recognition to virtual currencies.</p><p>Europe, on the other hand, has already started implementing provisions from its comprehensive regulatory framework called Markets in Crypto Assets, known as MiCA. In comparison, the world’s largest economy, the United States, is yet to reach a clear consensus over who will control what, as there are frequent overlaps and clashes of jurisdictional capacity between agencies like the CFTC and&nbsp;SEC.</p><p>(<a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Image Source</a>)</p><p>Here, we delve deeper to understand where the world currently stands regarding regulating crypto. This is crucial because the industry can only thrive if regulatory differences are at their minimum. And only then could we see the seamless exchange of resources and capital — mandatory for a global crypto economy to stand on its own&nbsp;feet.</p> Europe  The EU <p>When it comes to crypto rules in the EU, MICA or Markets in Crypto Assets often take center stage. The public first got a glimpse of this proposal on 24th September 2020. Fast forward to 16th May 2023, and the EU has officially given the go-ahead to these&nbsp;rules.</p><p>The core objective of MiCA is to safeguard investor interests and enhance transparency by setting out a comprehensive framework for issuers and service providers. Specifically, utility token issuers, stablecoins (also termed asset-referenced tokens), trading platforms, and wallet service providers will all fall under MiCA’s oversight.</p><p>Recognizing this, the EU views the adoption of MiCA not merely as an isolated regulation but as a strategic move. It’s their way of progressing toward a cohesive global crypto regulatory standard, a significant improvement over the varied national laws previously in place across member&nbsp;states.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">For more details on the MiCA: MiCA Paving the Way — From Liability to Transparency</a></p> Switzerland <p>The Alpine nation treats cryptocurrencies as assets, fostering tax clarity and pioneering early adoption.</p><p>Zurich introduced Bitcoin ATMs in 2014, and by 2016, Zug was accepting Bitcoin for services. Their forward-thinking approach is further evidenced by Lugano’s ambitious plan to use cryptocurrencies as legal tender and Zug’s facilitation of tax payments in crypto. Switzerland’s stance exemplifies the diverse approaches to crypto regulation in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Asia <p>Unlike Europe’s MiCA, Asia does not have a single continent-wise regulatory structure. However, there are several crypto-friendly countries in Asia, such as Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with their own set of rules and regulations.</p> Hong Kong <p>The vertical city-state took a more conservative approach, aligning with China’s 2021 ban on crypto services earlier. But that changed recently, as Hong Kong decided to open its doors to crypto exchanges, paving the way for organized crypto retail trading, albeit with a few conditions.</p> Japan <p>The country, often called the “Land of the Rising Sun,” has crafted a detailed crypto framework, with its Financial Services Agency (FSA) collaborating with the JVCEA and JSTOA, ensuring robust oversight for crypto exchanges and token offerings. With the Payment Services Act and stringent anti-money laundering measures in place, Japan’s intent is clear: to foster a transparent and safeguarded crypto environment.</p> South Korea <p>On the Korean peninsula, South Korea’s crypto regulations are defined by the Electronic Financial Transactions Act and the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Information. These laws categorize cryptocurrencies as “electronic assets” and set the rules for their utilization. As South Korea seeks to refine its stance on digital currencies, the National Assembly is actively deliberating on a range of crypto-related regulatory proposals.</p> Singapore <p>Shifting our lens southeast, Singapore stands as a beacon of balanced crypto regulation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) championed the Payment Services Act (PSA) in January 2020, which enveloped both traditional and crypto exchanges under a unified framework.</p><p>Within the PSA, digital currencies earn the designation of “digital payment tokens,” elevating approved cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether to legal asset status. Coupled with rigorous Anti-Money Laundering (AML) measures and the imposition of licensing requirements for crypto activities, the city-state’s approach underscores a commitment to both innovation and security in the digital asset&nbsp;sphere.</p><p>Overall, Asia’s approach to crypto regulation demonstrates a trend toward a more structured and promising future.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>Navigating to the Middle East, the UAE offers a mosaic of crypto regulations that reflects its unique federal structure. With seven distinct emirates, each potentially wielding its own rules, the central narrative began in 2017 when the UAE emphasized authorized exchanges and anti-money laundering protocols.</p><p>Fast forward to 2022, and Dubai, a pivotal emirate, spotlighted its commitment by introducing the Virtual Assets Law. This legislation not only defines the scope of virtual assets but also ensures traders operate transparently, aiming to prevent financial malpractices.</p><p>To anchor this initiative, the Dubai Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) was established, marking Dubai’s ambition to be a global hub for digital assets. Through these measures, the UAE seamlessly interweaves tradition with innovation, creating a balanced crypto landscape.</p> North America  The United&nbsp;States <p>As the most representative economy of the region, the United States boasts a multifaceted and evolving regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) holds jurisdiction over crypto exchanges trading Bitcoin and Ethereum, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for overseeing Initial Coin Offerings or&nbsp;ICOs.</p><p>Supplementing these agencies, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has a primary role in monitoring digital assets, especially concerning Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p>Given the multifarious classifications of digital assets, determining the correct regulatory agency can be intricate, sometimes involving multiple bodies. Each state, further adding to the complexity, possesses the autonomy to design its individual regulations on digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In line with this dynamic regulatory backdrop, it’s notable that the US Congress is actively considering legislation to further define and shape the crypto landscape.</p> Crypto-focused Bills in the&nbsp;US <p>Two crypto-focused bills have recently been reintroduced. The first, known as the Lummis-Gillibrand Bill, is spearheaded by U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand. This revised legislation aims to demystify decentralized finance regulations, bolster the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (CFTC) authority over crypto entities, and specify the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>Within its provisions, the bill underscores definitions for “crypto asset” and “crypto asset exchange,” ensuring these terms are categorized under commodities law, thereby strengthening the CFTC’s jurisdiction. A significant highlight of the bill is the introduction of a de minimus tax exemption, which seeks to alleviate the tax burdens from minute transactions, challenging the current tax mandate that treats all crypto transactions equally, irrespective of their&nbsp;value.</p><p>The second bill reintroduced in the US Congress comes from Senators Elizabeth Warren and Roger Marshall, titled the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2023. Should it pass, all crypto stakeholders would be mandated to report transactions that eclipse the USD 10,000 threshold. Initially put forth in December 2022, the bill’s objective is to have US cryptocurrency operations adhere to the same know-your-customer standards as traditional banks, a move aimed at curtailing money laundering.</p><p>With these factors in play, entities in the US must be vigilant and continuously update their operational strategies to stay compliant. It’s also crucial for crypto exchanges to align with AML/CFT regulations, and users should be cognizant of potential tax implications. As federal directives lay out the broader guidelines, understanding the nuances of state-specific regulations becomes paramount.</p> Canada <p>Shifting attention northwards to Canada, the country’s approach to cryptocurrencies differs significantly. Digital assets, primarily treated as securities, are regulated provincially and territorially under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA). This classification is due to the unique “Crypto Contract” concept, wherein a user’s contractual right to a crypto asset can be placed under securities regulations, even if it isn’t a traditional security.</p><p>Hence, platforms such as cryptocurrency exchanges facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets need to be registered with the corresponding securities regulator. These businesses must continuously disclose vital information, from third-party dependencies and associated risks to measures against theft or&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>Every cryptocurrency offering undergoes an “Investment Contract Test” to determine its classification as a security. Non-compliance can result in punitive actions, from financial penalties to bans on operations.</p><p>However, some gray areas persist in Canada’s crypto regulations. Notably, assets like stablecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) don’t have a clear regulatory framework, leading authorities to evaluate them on a case-by-case basis. Despite these nuances, Canada’s mature approach has garnered praise from crypto entities worldwide, marking it as a notably crypto-friendly nation.</p> Bermuda <p>Bermuda is a leader in the cryptocurrency landscape and is a likely beneficiary of the much-reported US crackdown against crypto firms, with firms like Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/04/20/crypto-exchange-coinbase-receives-license-to-operate-in-bermuda/">obtaining a license</a> to operate in the country recently.</p><p>With laws like the Digital Asset Business Act (DABA) and the Digital Asset Issuance Act (DAIA), they’ve built a comprehensive regulatory framework treating all forms of digital assets uniformly. But their commitment doesn’t stop there. They’ve also paved the way for banks serving the digital asset sector and have launched innovative projects, like a blockchain-based stimulus&nbsp;token.</p><p>Guided by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, the island balances innovation with globally recognized regulatory standards, creating an environment ripe for growth and security.</p> A Regulatory Comparison <p>As far as the comparison of the US with other parts of the globe is concerned, the lack of regulatory clarity in the US is leading crypto traders to take their bets on Asia. This is despite China and India — two of the most populous nations globally — maintaining a cautious stance on&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>In Europe’s case, it is evidently far ahead of the US when it comes to providing regulatory clarity to the crypto landscape. However, as per Albert Isola, the minister for Digital and Financial Services at HM Government of Gibraltar, the effects of MiCA “will not come into play overnight. To create effective frameworks, transitional testing will be required.” What MiCA, introduced to the EU, aims to achieve is enhanced transparency and better protection for retail investors in the short term and significantly improved security and stability in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>According to Isola, many global crypto players are also expressing interest in the EU because it has made sure that regulatory frameworks do not overregulate the space and thwart innovation.</p> What to&nbsp;Expect <p>Crypto regulations will definitely go through a lot of ups and downs, proposals and rejections, and trials and errors in the days to come. Countries that are not particularly encouraging the private crypto industry to thrive might change their opinion after introducing Central Bank Digital Currencies or&nbsp;CBDCs.</p><p>However, the emergence of a global regulatory framework from all these churnings still seems a distant possibility, for now, despite crypto regulations becoming a key point of discussion in the G20 under India’s presidency.</p><p>___________________________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>Indicio recently had a breakthrough in work to scale the mediator we have been using for issuing and verifying credentials. This new mediator greatly reduces a huge problem decentralized identity faces — accommodating all the people that want to use the technology.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Alexandra N. Walker</p>
<p>A mediator is a critical part of any decentralized interaction between the holders of decentralized identifiers. This technology is the “middle man” that facilitates messages between decentralized entities using mobile devices (which don’t have fixed IP addresses for easy connection). You can almost think of a mediator as a mailbox; it provides an endpoint for parties that cannot otherwise connect with each other to send and receive messages. Importantly, these “messages” can include issuing and verifying credentials.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the amount of messages your mediator can process in a given period of time has a significant impact on performance, limiting how many people can use your services concurrently which, in turn, will limit adoption. People today expect technology to “just work;” if they perceive the interaction to be slow, the likelihood of them trying again is very low. To put this into perspective, <a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/#:~:text=following%20key%20findings%3A-,47%20percent%20of%20consumers%20expect%20a%20web%20page%20to%20load,render%20before%20abandoning%20the%20site.">47 percent of consumers</a> expect a web page to load in two seconds or less, and 40 percent will wait no more than three seconds for a web page to render before abandoning the site.</p>
<p>This obviously puts some pressure on your development team to make sure everything works quickly, and the mediator represents a key part of the process where people can get stuck. The option to pay for more, or bigger, mediations is always a viable solution, but it can be costly. This is the context for Indicio’s breakthrough.</p>
<p>The first thing we had to know were baseline numbers: using mediation, how many credentials could ACA-Py sustainably issue to new users in a minute? What about existing users? How about verification?</p>
<p>(Non-Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>issue 258 credentials per minute to new connections<br>issue 540 credentials per minute to existing connections<br>verify 282 credentials per minute to existing connection</p>
<p>These numbers represent our baseline numbers in a non-clustered environment; however, taking this architecture into a clustered environment—where we have the same architecture as before, but now everything (user agents and ACA-Py agents) is abstracted away behind load balancers and managed instance groups—we get much better numbers.</p>
<p>(Clustered)</p>
<p>Current Traditional ACA-Py Mediator (2 vCPUs, 8GB of RAM):</p>
<p>The traditional mediator from before can sustainably</p>
<p>issue 300 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>issue 900 credentials per minute to existing connections, mediator, and<br>verify 600 credentials per minute to existing connections,</p>
<p>using the same mediator (with 2 vCPUs and 8GB of RAM) as before but now with 10 ACA-Py agents (1 vCPU and 4GB of RAM, each).</p>
<p>Using some new techniques and new technologies, such as the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-socketdock">SocketDock</a>, our team was able to greatly improve these numbers.</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator:</p>
<p>Indicio’s Mediator can</p>
<p>sustainably issue 1,200 credentials per minute to new connections,<br>sustainably issue 1,680 credentials per minute to existing connections, sustainably verify 3,000 credentials per minute to existing connections.</p>
<p>Our team is hugely excited about this progress, given that high-volume verification will drive many seamless processes. For example, with Indicio’s Mediator, airport security will be able to verify 3,000 passengers per minute per mediator, shortening lines while saving airports expense.</p>
<p>While the Indicio Mediator is not quite ready for public use yet, our team wanted to share the news that ACA-Py (Aries Cloud Agent-Python) is able to scale to meet the growing interest in the technology. Once the Indicio team has fine tuned the codebase, we expect to open source and contribute it to the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org">Hyperledger Foundation</a> so organizations can build their own solutions.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the new mediator or building your own verifiable credential solutions our team is always happy to help. You can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us here.</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p><p>In recent years, the question of a state's territorial sovereignty in cyberspace has been a major topic of discussion. The emergence of cyberspace has introduced new spatial dimensions and challenged our understanding of international law. When it comes to cyberspace, the solid and defined notion of territory does not necessarily apply there. Sovereignty has been unbundled in cyberspace, both in practice and in legality.</p>
<p>At its core, the notion of sovereignty in cyberspace encompasses a state's authority and control over the digital activities that take place within its borders. While all states would claim some degree of sovereignty over the internet, countries such as Russia and China have embraced a broader interpretation of cyber sovereignty. Both states define cyber sovereignty in ways that are consistent with their respective political and security objectives.</p>
<p>Technology, geopolitics, and cyber sovereignty </p>
<p>According to the Chinese cyber sovereignty principle, cyber sovereignty is the idea that each country has the right to exercise control over the Internet within its territory and the right to choose its own digital development path. The Chinese Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2016 has further promoted this idea and defined the security obligations that Internet providers and services must follow. As a result, the concept of cyber sovereignty has become China's guiding principle in its domestic digital policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Russia's interpretation of cyber sovereignty, mirroring that of China, is characterized by the regulation of information and information flows and the ability to regulate, surveil, and influence digital activities occurring within its borders. For example, in 2018, Russia proposed a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly, which some argue legitimizes state surveillance and censorship through its emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of countries.</p>
<p>Although liberal democracies have also intervened in the digital realm to counter the threats of disinformation, terrorism, and cybercriminal activity, their approach tends to balance the protection of citizens' rights and privacy with the need to maintain a secure online environment. Consequently, their interventions in the digital sphere often come with checks and balances and public discourse to ensure that security measures do not impede upon the democratic values they seek to protect.</p>
<p>Semiconductors and national security </p>
<p>In addition to the principle of cyber sovereignty, the concept of supply chain sovereignty has recently gained traction in economic and political circles. Since the spring of 2018, the trade conflict between the United States and China has been in full swing. Dependence on imports and foreign producers is now considered a national security risk in many states. Global supply chains can be more efficient in delivering goods and services at lower costs while fostering international competition at the same time. However, states are wary of gaining economic advantage at the expense of national security.</p>
<p>Some countries have identified and subsidized key technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors; while the former is important in the long term, the latter has more immediate implications in the global supply chain. The semiconductor industry is a vital part of today's information age and a key component of today's global economy. As a result, new restrictions limiting China's access to chipmaking software and equipment continue to be imposed by the United States as part of its national security agenda.</p>
<p>There is more to this story than trade tensions between China and the United States. Many countries are claiming sovereignty over the shared digital technology space. For example, the European Union has been trying to reduce its dependence on the United States for years. Through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has achieved some measure of internet sovereignty via regulation. Nevertheless, the EU is likely to continue to seek greater convergence with the United States and to build digital alliances with like-minded countries.</p>
<p>Addressing challenges through cooperation </p>
<p>While technology continues to develop integrating forces, geopolitics is moving toward greater fragmentation, posing a serious dilemma for business leaders and policymakers. Despite different interpretations of cyber sovereignty or supply chain sovereignty, countries will need to cooperate at the international level and work together to address global challenges.</p>
<p>Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and cyberattacks are just a few examples of the global challenges we face. Governance of cyberspace requires both shared values and trust to work, but this will ultimately depend more on consistent and enforceable legal understandings than on technology. It is therefore clear that cyberspace will continue to play a critical role in international law and geopolitics in the years to come.</p>

 Interested in entering one of the largest and most lucrative gambling markets in the world? You’ll first need a UK gambling license. Here’s everything you need to know about the application process, compliance requirements, UK gambling regulations, and much more. 



 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">UK Gambling Commission</a> (UKGC) operates as the UK’s gambling regulator, and is an independent regulatory body established under the UK Gambling Act of 2005. To operate legally in the UK, all gambling platforms are required to hold a license issued by the UKGC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The UKGC is also responsible for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ukgc-plans-uk-gambling-sector/">implementing changes t</a>o national gambling regulations, such as the recent proposals contained in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK’s gambling white paper</a>. Proposals target various aspects of the gambling industry, such as VIP customers, slot limits, and financial risk checks (formerly known as affordability checks).</p>



 Understanding UK gambling regulations. 



<p>The UKGC takes failure to comply with licensing requirements and social responsibility codes very seriously. Operators, therefore, must have robust systems and controls in place to prevent money laundering as well as a whole host of other nefarious crimes. They must also safeguard customers, take measures to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underage gambling</a>, ensure fair play, and encourage responsible gambling to guarantee <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">gambling compliance.</a></p>



<p>There are essentially three main types of operating licenses:&nbsp;</p>



  Remote: This license allows licensees to provide casino games and gambling products to customers through an online site, TV, mobile phone, or any other type of online service.<br>  Non-remote: A non-remote gambling license allows the licensee to facilitate betting activities at betting shops, tracks, and/or courses.<br>  Ancillary: Ancillary licenses are for operators offering email and telephone betting.&nbsp;  



<p>Operators may need one or a combination of these licenses.</p>



<p>Licensing is mandatory, even if an operator’s online gambling platform is located in another region of the world. Essentially, if the services are being offered in the UK, operators must hold a license. (If you are interested in learning about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/do-i-need-an-online-gaming-license/">the need for an online gaming license</a> in general, click on the underlined copy).</p>



 Eligibility criteria for a UK gambling license. 



<p>The Commission <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/operating-licences">evaluates</a> applicants based on the following criteria:&nbsp;</p>



  The identity of the applicant and people associated with them. For example, if the applicant’s gambling platform is part of a bigger corporation, then the owner of that corporation also needs to be evaluated.<br>  The applicant’s honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness<br>  Financial statements that display the business is financially capable of operating successfully after obtaining a license<br>  The applicant’s expertise, experience, qualifications, history, and those of the people relevant to the application<br>  The applicant’s criminal record and those relevant to the application.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission also looks at the applicants’ policies to ensure that:&nbsp;</p>



  They incorporate and understand the legislation<br>  They follow the established licensing objectives<br>  They hold evidence that their arrangements will adhere to social responsibility requirements  



 Application process for a UK gambling license. 



<p>Applicants apply for an operating license from the UKGC via the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">“Apply for an operating license” service</a>. It takes around 16 weeks for the Commission to process a license application, considering all the required information is submitted at the point of application. Applying for a UKGC license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/how-much-it-costs#:~:text=It%20costs%20%C2%A3370%20to,withdraw%20from%20the%20application%20process.">costs</a> £370, which must be paid via credit or debit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators are required to provide an extensive array of documents, some of which depend on the type of business applying for the license. For instance, a sole trader may only be required to submit identity documents, whereas a limited company would be required to submit the following:</p>



  Ownership structure diagram<br>  Articles of association<br>  Management structures<br>  Certificate of incorporation<br>  Memorandum of association&nbsp;  



<p>Overseas entities must submit a credit report and, if they have licenses elsewhere, copies of licenses issued by the other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a remote license, an operator must provide the following:&nbsp;</p>



  Documents regarding remote policies and procedures<br>  Operational model map<br>  Gambling software supply method and details<br>  System diagram displaying the end-to-end process&nbsp;  



<p>Some requirements are considered core documentation and are mandatory in all cases. Such requirements include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  General policies and procedures–these must adhere to the standards outlined in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/license-conditions-codes-of-practice-lccp/">LCCP (Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice)</a><br>  Rules of play<br>  Customer terms and conditions<br>  Bank statements for the past six months for all accounts<br>  Business plan<br>  Proof of funding<br>  Profit and loss projections for the next three years&nbsp;  



<p>Those responsible for managing the business must also submit a PML (Personal Management Licence) or an Annex A personal declaration form based on the circumstances.</p>



 Key considerations for license applicants. 



<p>Those applying for a license from the UKGC must have a comprehensive business plan for their application to be approved. A sound business plan shows that the operator understands their objectives and the steps required to achieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also focus on responsible gambling and protection practices. This includes offering tools like deposit limits, self-exclusion, and helpful resources for customers who may struggle with or be on the verge of developing a gambling addiction. Moreover, the operator’s platform must also be secure, employing technologies such as SSL encryption to secure their customers’ personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Implementing robust anti-money laundering and fraud protection strategies, such as KYC and AML solutions, is also essential. Operators can help identify and mitigate gambling fraud and crime by conducting due diligence and transaction monitoring. Keeping updated with industry regulations and best practices is also among the key considerations for license applicants.</p>

 Compliance and reporting obligations. 



<p>All UKGC license holders must adhere to regulatory obligations that must be observed at all times. Such obligations include upholding integrity in all aspects of their operations, maintaining accurate records, reporting crucial information promptly, and ensuring they offer fair, safe, and transparent services to customers while taking active measures to prevent problem gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Failure to comply with such obligations can lead to dire consequences, including heavy fines, license revocation, and strict legal action.</p>



 Licensing fees and taxation. 



<p>For licensing purposes, operators are divided into a total of nine categories according to their GGY (Gross Gambling Yield). For example, a gambling operator with a GGY under £550k will be required to pay an application fee of £4,224 and an annual fee of £4,199. On the other hand, operators with a GGY worth £1 billion must pay an application fee of £91,686 and a yearly fee worth £793,729.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/point-of-consumption-tax-rate-of-15-proposed-for-remote-gambling">Point of Consumption Tax</a> (POCT) introduced in 2014, the Commission requires all licensees to adhere to tax requirements to operate legally. This includes taxes on all profits from gambling activities, regardless of where the operator is based, and abiding by regulations regarding the collection and reporting of taxes. The POCT has profoundly impacted the UK’s gambling industry, urging operators to adapt and comply with the evolving tax requirements to remain compliant.</p>



 License renewal and revocation. 



<p>The procedure for license <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/guidance/guidance-to-licensing-authorities/part-24-renewal">renewal</a> is like applying for an initial application. You need to submit a renewal application within six months before the license expires but no later than two months prior to its expiration. The Commission may refuse to renew a permit on the following grounds:</p>



  If the renewal is inconsistent with the licensing requirements. In this instance, the authority may consult the chief officer of the police. The authority will, therefore, be wary of any concerns regarding the use of the premises during the life of the license.<br>  If an authorized local government officer has been denied access to the premises without a reasonable excuse.&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission may also <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/revocation-of-operating-licence-bet-butler-limited">revoke</a> a license holder’s permit under the following circumstances:&nbsp;</p>



  The license holder is unable to carry out licensed activities consistent with the licensing requirements.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s financial standing.<br>  The Commission is dissatisfied with the licensee’s competence.<br>  The Commission believes that one or more license terms have been breached&nbsp;  



<p>The Commission usually informs the license holder if it reaches a decision about their permit. The licensee is allowed to appeal against a decision if:&nbsp;</p>



  They receive a fine or warning.<br>  Their license application has been turned down.<br>  Their license has been revoked or suspended.<br>  There are changes in their license terms  



 What is the UK’s new Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees? 



<p>In August, following a year-long consultation period, the UKGC issued a revised version of its Customer Interaction Guidance for Remote Gambling Licensees.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remote gambling operators in the UK have until October 31 to implement measures contained in the guidance. The chief aim of the new guidance is to minimize the risk of customers experiencing harms associated with gambling through the implementation of “effective customer interaction systems and processes”. It suggests doing so through the use of a three-step system:&nbsp;</p>



  Identify&nbsp;<br>Through an ongoing process of monitoring, licensees should utilize indicators of harm to flag signs that a customer may be at risk.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Act&nbsp;<br>Review indicators to tailor the action to the type of harm. This may require automated action, or manual intervention. Activities and interactions should be recorded. Ongoing monitoring may be required, alongside further, more intensive intervention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  Evaluate&nbsp;<br>Consider actions taken, and whether further intervention is required. These evaluation processes and systems should be baked in from the beginning, and “not an afterthought.”&nbsp;  



<p>The new guidance is incredibly important for any operator that wishes to hold a gambling license in the UK. From October 31, all licensees are required to build processes that can identify risk, take appropriate action, and evaluate the effectiveness of said action. This three-step approach is now considered essential throughout the customer’s relationship with the operator.</p>



 Marketing and advertising guidelines. 



<p>Licensed operators must be wary of the advertising standards and restrictions established by the Commission. Such standards exist to protect minors and the vulnerable from being unfairly targeted by gambling ads and ensure that all advertising is fair and transparent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding responsible marketing practices, operators must be mindful of the guidelines and undertake advertising in a socially responsible manner, including the stipulations on the use of certain messaging and imagery. This is to say that all licensees’ marketing communications must not <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/page/open-and-transparent-marketing">mislead</a> customers. Operators must adhere to the UK Advertising <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/licensees-and-businesses/guide/advertising-marketing-rules-and-regulations">codes</a> published by CAP (the Committees of Advertising Practice) and governed by the ASA (Advertising Standards Authority).&nbsp;</p>



 International expansion and cross-border licensing. 



<p>Many operators explore other markets to increase their customer base and diversify their revenue streams. However, various legal stipulations are linked with cross-border licensing, including ones based on licensing, taxation, and regulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As previously noted, operators based abroad must provide a credit report. If they carry a license from other jurisdictions, they must provide a copy of the licenses issued by other jurisdictions.</p>

				 <p>Continuum Loop has always been at the forefront of decentralized solutions, and our three latest Cardano Project Catalyst proposals further cement our commitment to innovating within this sphere. As <a href="https://iohk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/900005679386-Catalyst-registration-and-voting-guide">voting</a> begins on August 31 and runs until September 14, 2023, we urge you to have your voice heard and contribute to the future of decentralized solutions. You can <a href="https://docs.projectcatalyst.io/catalyst-basics/how-to-register-as-a-voter">register to vote</a> until August 18, 2023. We’re excited to introduce you to the visions behind these ambitious endeavours:</p>
 Āhau: Decolonising Financial Compliance 
 Objective: Empowering Indigenous Tribes with Nation-building Technologies 
<p>The financial world often erects barriers that hinder indigenous tribes, such as the Māori, from accessing vital economic development tools. With <a href="https://ahau.io/">Āhau</a>, we’re striving to change this narrative.</p>
<p>Our solution involves creating ecosystem governance frameworks and technologies tailored explicitly for Āhau. Using the TribalDIDs methodologies, we aim to interconnect with existing financial and compliance systems. This seamless integration is our ticket to dismantling the systemic obstacles that indigenous tribes face in places like Aotearoa/New Zealand.&nbsp;</p>

				  Blockchain Advocacy Coalition (BAC): Setting the Stage for DeFi’s Success in California 
 Objective: Paving the Way for Compliant Decentralized Financial Tools 
<p>The rapid rise of DeFi tools has been staggering, yet they face a significant hurdle: the need for KYC compliance. This gap poses a potential limitation to the growth and broader adoption of DeFi.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.blockadvocacy.org/">BAC</a>, our focus is threefold. Firstly, we will formulate a bill tailor-made for the California legislature to integrate dApps into the traditional compliance framework. Secondly, we’re working on crafting a governance framework for developers, enabling them to build with clarity and confidence. Lastly, we’re committed to open-sourcing our entire framework. This ensures that states beyond California can harness our insights and replicate our success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After more than 10 years, short-lived TLS certificates are finally permitted by the browsers based on <a href="https://cabforum.org/2023/07/14/ballot-sc-063-v4make-ocsp-optional-require-crls-and-incentivize-automation/">CA/Browser Forum ballot SC-063</a>. Gerv Markham started a <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/mozilla.dev.security.policy/c/T11up58JkFc/m/Nph-8cFiuEMJ">short-lived certs discussion in 2014</a>, where he advised he was reviewing the 2012 CA/Browser Forum discussion on the topic. He advised that short-lived certificates was a plank of the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Revocation_Checking_in_Firefox#Short-Lived_Certificates">Mozilla revocation strategy</a>. There was also a paper prepared in 2012 called <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/W2SP/2012/papers/w2sp12-final9.pdf">Towards Short-Lived Certificates</a>. The paper stated OCSP is as good as dead, so the CAs should issue certificates with a very short lifetime. I suppose no one thought it would take so much time.</p>
<p>Short-lived certificates are designed to help address a certificate revocation issue. Back in 2012, <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html">Adam Langley discussed the seat-belt issue</a>, where it works fine, but snaps when you crash. This was based on the fact the browser implements soft-fail revocation checks where the CRL or OCSP response is ignored.</p>
<p>Even when the CA certificate status is trusted, there may be other issues. A CRL may be valid for up to 10 days, so even if a certificate is revoked, an attacker may be able to provide a valid CRL for many days after the revocation.</p>
<p>There are also privacy concerns where <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/180T6cDSWPy54Rb5d6R4zN7MuLEMShaZ4IRLQgdPqE98/edit">OCSP requests reveal details of individuals’ browsing history to the operator of the OCSP responder</a>. As such, many browsers do not perform online OCSP checks by default.</p>
<p>Effective after ballot SC-063 completes intellectual property review, the CAs can issue short-lived TLS certificates, where the validity is less than or equal to 10 days. Effective March 15, 2026, the short-lived certificate validity period will drop to a maximum of 7 days. Since the validity period would be less than the effective period of a CRL or an OCSP response, the CA does not have to provide status of short-lived certificates. This means you may not find any CRL or OCSP information in a short-lived TLS certificate. In addition, the CA does not have to revoke a short-lived certificate.</p>
<p>To address the OCSP privacy issue, effective March 15, 2024, the CA does not have to provide an OCSP response. Note that most CAs will continue to support OCSP for all TLS certificates based on the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/31633.microsoft-trusted-root-program-requirements.aspx">Microsoft Trusted Root Program Requirements</a>. We do expect Microsoft will address this policy issue in the future.</p>
<p>To ensure status continues to be provided to non-short-lived certificates, effective March 15, 2024, the CAs must provide a CRL for all non-short-lived TLS certificates. The ballot also addresses partitioned CRLs or sharded CRLs, which allows a CRL download to be smaller, so there is less delay for the browser user.</p>
<p>The ballot should not provide any impact to the services from your CA. If you do not get CRL support, it will be available in 2024. OCSP responses will stay available from all CAs that are trusted by Windows.</p>
<p>Entrust continues to support both CRL and OCSP for TLS certificates.</p>

<p>Symmetric <a>encryption</a> (or “private key” encryption) is the process of using a single key to both encrypt and decrypt data. It’s called “private key” because the use of a single encryption key necessitates that the key is always kept private.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is a widely-used form of cryptography that provides organizations and users with a faster, more readily deployable form of security for large data sets.</p>
<p>Symmetric encryption is often used for high-volume data processing where speed, efficiency, and complexity are important. However, due to its nature as a single-key solution, it presents several security challenges when it comes to actually sharing encrypted data. For this reason, symmetric encryption is often combined with asymmetric encryption (which uses different keys for encryption and decryption) in many modern secure communication protocols.</p>
 
How Does Symmetric Encryption Work? 
<p>Generally, encryption works by translating plain text into encoded (cipher) text using an algorithm and a secret key that is, theoretically, computationally infeasible to crack.</p>
<p>The general process of encryption works as follows:</p>
 
 Key Generation: A secret key is generated using advanced mathematical equations that is used to encode data. This key is shared between sender and receiver to maintain the obfuscation of the data. 
 Encryption: The encoding process uses complex algorithms and random environmental data (called “entropy”) to transform the original data is usually complex and involves multiple rounds of transformation to ensure the ciphertext is not easily decipherable without the key. 
 Decryption: Upon receiving the data, the recipient uses the same key to decode the data–essentially, reversing the process with the key serving as the information needed to “unlock” that data. 
 
<p>Additionally, symmetric encryption algorithms will usually come in one of two forms:</p>
 
 Stream Ciphers: Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext messages one bit at a time. They create an arbitrarily long keystream of bits, which is then combined with the plaintext bits one by one to produce the ciphertext. 
 Block Ciphers: Block ciphers take a chunk, or block, of data and transform it. It then works through the data set block by block. Some block ciphers will repeatedly encrypt blocks for added security. 
 
 How Does Symmetric Encryption Compare to Asymmetric Encryption? 
<p>As the name implies, symmetric encryption works through a sense of symmetry between both ends (encryption and decryption) of the process. <a>Asymmetric encryption</a> is the opposite–it uses a different key for each process..</p>
<p>Accordingly, the biggest challenge in symmetric encryption is the secure distribution of the key. Since the same key is used by all parties involved, it must be shared… which presents its own problems in terms of securing keys.</p>
<p>Conversely, asymmetric encryption doesn’t require this kind of sharing. Only one key (the public key) is shared, and it is only used for encoding data and cannot be used to compromise encrypted data.</p>
 What Are the Benefits of Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>This article has touched on the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, differences that provide context for how symmetric methods benefit users and enterprises.</p>
<p>Some of the key bonuses of symmetric encryption include:</p>
 
 Speed: Symmetric algorithms are generally less computationally intensive as compared to their asymmetric counterparts. That makes them faster and less computationally intensive than asymmetric ones–perfect for encrypting large amounts of data. 
 Simplicity: Symmetric encryption involves only one key for both encryption and decryption, which can simplify key management, especially for contexts where key sharing isn’t a major concern. 
 Bandwidth: Data encoded with symmetric algorithms are generally smaller in size, which can help with bandwidth concerns if that is an issue. 
 
<p>It isn’t an “all-or-nothing” approach, however. Many systems or algorithms will combine both symmetric and asymmetric methods in a single process to leverage the strengths of both. combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption.</p>
 What Are Use Cases for Symmetric Key Encryption? 
<p>Generally speaking, there are a few cases where symmetric encryption is suitable. Namely, when a system needs to perform fast encryption, where there are large amounts of data to encrypt, and/or where key sharing isn’t a concern.</p>
<p>Within those criteria are several different use cases where symmetric encryption shines:</p>
 
 File and Disk Encryption: For encrypting files, databases, or entire drives, symmetric methods are the gold standard. 
 Bulk Data Encryption: In situations where large amounts of data need to be encrypted, symmetric encryption is typically the most practical method due to its speed and efficiency compared to asymmetric encryption. 
 Hybrid Algorithms: While asymmetric solutions solve some critical security issues, they are grossly inefficient when it comes to encrypting data efficiently. Thus hybrid systems will use asymmetric approaches to secure keys and verify user identities while using symmetric algorithms to actually encrypt data. 
 
<p>The most well-known application of a hybrid approach is Secure Socket Layers (SSL), currently renamed and refined as Transport Layer Security (TLS). These technologies are used as a “tunneling” method to create secure and persistent connection between machines. To accomplish this, SSL and TLS protocols actually use combinations of symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to strengthen security.</p>
 What Are Different Types of Symmetric Encryption? 
<p>There isn’t a limit on how many encryption algorithms exist. Some of the more popular, or at least well-known, symmetric algorithms around include:</p>
 
 <a>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>: This is currently one of the most widely used symmetric encryption algorithms, supported for national security (by NIST) and industrial applications. There are several different complexities of AES (with 128-bit and 256-bit being the most common) that represent increasing levels of security. 
 Data Encryption Standard (DES): Primarily used decades ago, this symmetric algorithm has effectively been cracked and is no longer considered secure. It has been deprecated in favor of Triple DES or, in cases of federal or industrial encryption standards, AES. 
 Triple DES (3DES): This is an extension of the now-defunct DES algorithm that processes plaintext blocks three times for additional security, with a significant tradeoff with performance. 
 Blowfish and Twofish: These are block ciphers designed as alternatives to DES. Blowfish has a block size of 64 bits, while Twofish has a block size of 128 bits. Twofish was one of the finalists in the competition that selected AES. 
 
<p>Remember, no matter which algorithm or cipher type you use, the security of symmetric encryption relies heavily on keeping the encryption key secret and using a secure method to distribute the key when necessary.</p>
 1Kosmos BlockID and Encrypted Identity Management 
<p>Encryption is a critical part of identity management and authentication. With our private and permissioned blockchain, we leverage symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods to ensure that identity and authentication credentials (including <a>biometrics</a>) remain secure, that users are properly verified, and that decentralized devices can safely access the system.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you get the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API and SDK. 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID verifies identity anywhere, anytime and on any device with over 99% accuracy. 
 Privacy by Design: Embedding privacy into the design of our ecosystem is a core principle of 1Kosmos. We protect personally identifiable information in a distributed identity architecture and the encrypted data is only accessible by the user. 
 Private and Permissioned Blockchain: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private and permissioned blockchain and encrypts digital identities and is only accessible by the user. The distributed properties ensure that there are no databases to breach or honeypots for hackers to target. 
 Interoperability: BlockID can readily integrate with existing infrastructure through its 50+ out of the box integrations or via API/SDK. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone.

<p>When you hear business and crypto, chances are you might think of two totally different subjects.</p><p>The history of crypto has been a rocky one: much trial, error, and bad actors beating to the pulse to grab a share of a digital future. This paper outlines the future of business being crypto. Further, how cash flow, seamless transactions, and protocols as a service are catalysts for a global economy without borders, bank fees, or&nbsp;silos.</p><p>There persists a widespread misunderstanding that crypto assets hold 0 intrinsic value due to their absence of cash flows. This fallacy arises from a public tendency to equate crypto solely with Bitcoin, and Bitcoin with digital gold — “Since gold does not produce cash flow, crypto can’t either” type of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Below we look at the top 25 ‘crypto’ projects by revenue in the past year. In this graph, you can see layer 1 Blockchains &amp; DeFi Protocols. The latter includes Layer 2 solutions, NFT marketplaces, Liquid staking derivatives, and more. By this chart you will see traditional business “cash flow” is now replaced by&nbsp;fees.</p>Link to <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal">Token&nbsp;Terminal</a><p>Fees</p><p>The name of the game is now access to services and products, and contributing to sustainable practice by micro fees. No, this is not the bank sneaking surcharges into your account so they can make a quick $. This is clear as day, operating, and action-oriented production fees allow a certain mechanism to stay standing. You’ll see fees can be paid to end users and protocols alike. Below will grid different examples of fees, revenue, and cash flow mechanisms in Decentralized Finance&nbsp;today:</p><p>Interested in seeing where all these different cash flows go and exist in crypto? Websites like <a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a> offer leaderboards on who has the most action going&nbsp;on.</p><a href="https://cryptofees.info/">https://cryptofees.info/</a><p>Revenue Models</p><p>Now that it is confirmed and shown that revenue does, can, and will exist on a blockchain — let’s jump into different revenue models shown from the examples&nbsp;above.</p>  Ethereum (ETH)  <p>Think of Ethereum as the world’s first mega, decentralized supercomputer. Applications can run on top of the network and facilitate a value exchange between two or more parties. This requires two key&nbsp;steps:</p>  Adding up who owes what to whom (i.e. compute) then&nbsp;⬇️  Validating / Verifying that a transaction has occurred -&gt; updating the new account balance of both interactors (i.e. consensus)  <p>Ethereum is the protocol of selling computation and consensus as two functions to settle transactions between&nbsp;parties.</p> How does this make money? It’s time to get&nbsp;gas. <p>Ethereum earns revenue through transaction fees, known as “gas fees”. Gas fees are paid by users of DApps to have their transactions computed and stored on the Ethereum&nbsp;ledger.</p><p>In the current state of the web, businesses bear the costs of computing and storage provided by cloud computing services like Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the blockchain world, users themselves shoulder these expenses, which are essentially Ethereum’s revenues.</p><p>Just as revenues are determined by Quantity sold * Unit price, Ethereum’s transaction fees are calculated by Gas used * Price per unit of gas,&nbsp;where:</p><p>- Gas is the measure of how much computational resource is required to process a transaction. Simple operations, like a user sending some ETH to another, have low gas intensity. Complex operations, like pricing derivatives with the Black-Scholes formula for an options protocol, are more computationally intensive and require higher&nbsp;gas.</p><p>- Price per unit of gas is denominated in Ethereum’s native currency ETH, specifically in gwei (a subunit of ETH). 1 billion gwei is equal to 1 ETH. The price per unit of gas consists of two components: the base fee, dynamically set by the network based on demand (higher during network congestion), and the priority fee, set by the user as a tip to the validator. Validators have the authority to prioritize transactions based on the gas prices offered (see diagram below). This means gas prices are determined through a competitive bidding mechanism where users compete to have their transactions included in&nbsp;blocks.</p>GIF <a href="https://tenor.com/view/ethereum-ether-favor-exchange-favorex-bitcoin-meme-gif-21793117">link&nbsp;source</a><p>Wrapping the above text together, Ethereum’s transaction fee paid by users is Gas * (base fee + priority&nbsp;fee).</p><p>For example, let’s say Alice wants to send Bob 1 ETH. The transaction’s computational work is 21,000 gas, the base fee is 10 gwei and Alice includes a tip of 2 gwei. Then Alice’s total gas fee would be 21,000 x (10 + 2) = 252,000 gwei or 0.000252&nbsp;ETH.</p><p>Transaction fees and analytics on gas prices are a leading indicator to understand demand and network congestion on Ethereum. The primary driver of this demand and congestion comes from Decentralized Finance. For this, we will next look at the Unicorn of DeFi,&nbsp;<a href="https://uniswap.org/">Uniswap</a>.</p> 2. Uniswap&nbsp;(UNI) <p>Uni who swap? An Explanation:</p><p>Uniswap solved one simple problem in decentralized finance and has pioneered: Swapping ERC 20 tokens. Uniswap by profile is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and in 2023, has rolled out expansion products such as a <a href="https://wallet.uniswap.org/">mobile wallet</a> and <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol">UniswapX</a>.</p>Dex Metrics <a href="https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics">Image&nbsp;source</a><p>As you can see, Uniswap dominates trading on chain (DEX). Uniswap enables trading in a new-age fashion, as opposed to traditional centralized exchanges, with Coinbase as an example. Traditional exchanges utilize an order book, which lists the buy and sell orders of traders, then matches them based on compatible prices.</p><p>Uniswap, in opposition, relies on liquidity pools Liquidity pools are reserves of token pairs (e.g. ETH &amp; USDC) that are contributed by Liquidity Providers (LPs). Anyone can become an LP by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token. Traders then trade against these liquidity pools, rather than directly against each other. This design called an Automated Market Maker (AMM), has gained popularity in the DeFi ecosystem as an alternative to order book-based trading systems. Advantages of AMMs include no counterparty risk and lower barriers to becoming a market maker. A disadvantage however is that there could be a lack of price efficiency. AMMs operate based on a predefined<a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf"> mathematical formula</a> to determine prices. As a result, prices offered may not always reflect the true asset value (although in reality, much of the price differences get arbitraged away by traders). This can lead to slippage and potentially unfavorable trading prices, particularly for larger&nbsp;trades.</p><p>So, what about cash&nbsp;flow?</p><p>Uniswap fees are a function of trading volume and take&nbsp;rate.</p>  Trading Volume: Uniswap, since launching in 2018, has facilitated ~$1.5 trillion in trading volumes. Trading volumes, which are positively correlated with crypto prices, have been negatively affected by the crypto market downturn.  Take Rate: Uniswap’s take rate has changed with version upgrades. V1 and V2 had a model of fixed 30 basis point (bps) fees, while V3, released in May 2021, introduced a tiered system consisting of 5 bps, 30 bps and 100 bps for different pools. This mix shift has compressed the average take rate from 30 bps to approximately 15 bps. UNI token holders can propose and vote on additional fee&nbsp;levels.  <p>Currently, Uniswap directs all trading fees to LPs without allocating any portion to the Uniswap DAO/token holders. This strategy aims to strengthen its network effect and maintain a competitive edge over rivals, perhaps similar to traditional tech platforms’ reinvestment model of sacrificing short-term profitability to build a moat. The optimal allocation of protocol fees between providers of work (in this case LPs) and providers of capital (i.e. token holders) is a recurring debate in crypto communities.</p><p>The Uniswap DAO has also previously discussed implementing a “fee switch” to redirect some fees to UNI token holders, but the proposal was not passed due to concerns about timing and the resultant liquidity levels. An added concern, particularly in the US, is whether sharing fees with the UNI holders would classify Uniswap as an unregistered security. As Uniswap solidifies its network effect and regulatory clarity improves, the fee allocation strategy may&nbsp;evolve.</p> Conclusion, Ocean Protocol, and the&nbsp;Future <p>Ocean Protocol is an open-source toolkit to enable the next generation of value flow on a blockchain and surcharge a New Data Economy. Leveraging web3 and AI: new business models and sustainable practices are now available to experiment with.</p><p>Tokens, like stocks and bonds, can have cash flows supporting their intrinsic value. Crypto, previously the domain of speculators and retail gamblers, is arguably entering a phase of maturation that enables analysts, entrepreneurs, and data scientists to evaluate the fundamental value of new businesses.</p><p>Blockchains are a foundational infrastructure facilitating frictionless value transfer over the internet. DApps built on blockchains (ie Ethereum using Ocean Protocol) are akin to internet-native businesses with unique revenue models, cost structures, competitive advantages, capital allocation strategies, and valuations.</p><p>As blockchain-based economies progress, we anticipate the value to align with project fundamentals in a valuation-conscious manner.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

 Radicle Civics — Building Proofs of Possibilities for a Civic Economy and&nbsp;Society <blockquote>“Like an operating system, the medium of infrastructure space makes certain things possible and other things impossible. It is not the declared content but rather the content manager dictating the rules of the game.” — Keller Easterling, Extrastatecraft (2014).</blockquote><p>Our infrastructures are vital to enabling the complexity of modern life. Yet the role they have in creating technological, institutional, and behavioural path dependencies is often underestimated. Once they’re built, they continue to drive how we organise society for decades or even centuries through habituation, vested interests, and economies of scale and scope. This happens in often intangible, counterintuitive, and destructive ways. In other words, we shape our infrastructures and thereafter they shape us, and so&nbsp;on…</p><p>André Gorz describes this cyclical logic in his essay ‘<a href="https://unevenearth.org/2018/08/the-social-ideology-of-the-motorcar/">The Social Ideology of the Motorcar</a>’: “The car has made the big city uninhabitable. It has made it stinking, noisy, suffocating, dusty, so congested that nobody wants to go out in the evening anymore. Thus, since cars have killed the city, we need faster cars to escape on superhighways to suburbs that are even farther away…Give us more cars so that we can escape the destruction caused by&nbsp;cars.”</p><p>Economic infrastructures are no different from our roads and concrete jungles. They too have locked us into extractive and harmful pathways. Capital, markets, (intellectual) property regimes, land registries, GDP and other performance metrics, make up seemingly axiomatic cornerstones of our societies, yet they’re based on deliberately narrow, centralised definitions of value that encourage myopic, extractive behaviour. Looking through Eric Beinhocker’s lens of the “<a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/gp/article-abstract/1/1/17578/112212/Toward-a-New-Ontological-Framework-for-the?redirectedFrom=fulltext">ontology stack</a>”, GDP unfolds itself as not just a metric, but the tip of the iceberg of a layered economic infrastructure with an embedded worldview: one that perceives and positions humans as rational, profit-maximising, disembedded beings.</p> Infrastructural and imaginative lock-ins <p>These structural constraints in our economies and societies are now locking us in. We are facing multiple, interconnected crises of the climate, ecosystem, economic inequality, and democracy. These crises are not a crisis of the world, but of our relationship with the world, and how we understand ourselves. We are facing a deep code&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Our current code was written by Enlightenment thinkers, who developed the narrative of autonomous beings, endowed with individual rights and liberty, abstracted from the world around us. To be human, is to think. Nature is a mere backdrop against which humans live out history (<a href="https://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/article/the-lifeworlds-of-law-on-revitalizing-indigenous-legal-orders-today/">Mills, 2016</a>), or even worse, an infinite resource to be mined and consumed. Industrialisation, capitalism, and consumerism have further abstracted humans from being human and remade us into “bad robots” through our alienated labour and that of others. As Edmund Burke cautioned the Enlightenment-inspired revolutionaries, “liberty, too, must be limited in order to be possessed.” And the erosion of these limits, whether these limits are our responsibility to our social or ecological bonds, are in turn, eroding our ability to enjoy liberty&nbsp;itself.</p><p>This centuries-long ontological division between human-nature and production-reproduction has been hardwired into our regulatory, financial, and built infrastructures. It has not only allowed us to dominate, exploit, discard, and waste, but structurally locked us into this reality. We are reaping the consequences in the form of a self-terminating crisis where the things we dismissed as externalities are now threatening our very existence. Whilst many propose patches and quick fixes to the symptoms, we hypothesise that the only way out is to recode ourselves and our being-in-the-world. To build on Easterling, when the “rules of the game” are broken, it’s time to change&nbsp;them.</p><p>What we need is to reconceptualise ourselves as inalienably interconnected and relational beings, as a knot of flows. We need a relational worldview that sees our lives, our cities, our societies, as complex organisms comprising socio-ecological systems and webs of relationships (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003199816/sacred-civics-jayne-engle-julian-agyeman-tanya-chung-tiam-fook">Engle 2022</a>). We need to redesign our infrastructures so that they centre this complex entanglement and enable all beings — be they humans, future humans, and more-than-humans — to individually and collectively thrive.</p><p>What does it mean to see the world through the lens of ‘knots of flows’? Let’s explore this through a seemingly simple dining table. This table starts from soil to trees, from trees to lumber, from lumber through multiple stages of processing and transportation, to becoming a table, which then will be used for eating, playing, drawing, and working, providing numerous flows of social, economic, cultural, and emotional value. Over time, the table will be resold and recycled, enter into different homes with different flows of value, or be turned into materials for new tables, chairs, or paper, which will in turn be composted, returned to the soil, and transformed into new flows of&nbsp;value.</p> Germinating new civic futures with proofs of possibilities <p>Bruno Latour said, “Change the instruments, and you will change the entire social theory that goes with them.” Over the last six months, Dark Matter Labs has been trying to do precisely this with our Radicle Civics portfolio: changing instruments and civic infrastructures to enable a new social theory that recognises our entanglement and centres interdependence, care, and deep democracy.</p><p>The focus on civics is a fundamental one, because to address this deep code problem we must even preempt assumptions of a social contract with a state or a government. Civics for us extends far beyond conventional representative democracies, bordered places, and central jurisdictions. Civics starts instead with the most elemental of our social relationships: our mutual interdependencies from which forms of social organisation emerge. In this sense, reimagining civics is about both process and outcome. It requires us to expand our understanding of citizens who partake in these interdependencies to include humans and more-than-humans, and to reconfigure the ways in which we collectively relate and interact with one another, towards non-coercive, empathic, caring, and peer-to-peer systems. It is through this reimagining of civics that we can cultivate renewed civic capital and resilience that can serve to act as bulwark against any over-concentration of power, intentional or otherwise, while enabling collective thriving.</p><p>With the financial and strategic support of <a href="https://p4ne.org/">Partners for A New Economy,</a> <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">Scottish Land Commission</a>, and <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a>, Radicle Civics has been building a vibrant ecosystem of diverse partners including the River Dôn Project, Law and Political Economy Europe, and the Design Museum London (and more to be announced). Together, we have sowed the seeds for new civic infrastructures through a number of ‘proofs of possibilities’: visceral experiences and situated experiments that embody a new logic for how we can relate to each other and our environment, how we can recognize value beyond markets and money, and how we can nurture a deeper democratic agency. They are akin to what Erik Olin Wright has called “<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/products/2143-envisioning-real-utopias">real utopias</a>” or what Giorgos Kallis refers to as “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24537850">incubators of counter-hegemony</a>”: not distant fantasies but concrete and contextual manifestations of alternative futures that help render new paradigms part of our ‘everyday’. They do this not just by updating our shared civic protocols, but also through ‘common sense’ in Isabelle Stenger’s meaning of “making sense in common”, with communities in their contexts.</p><p>Our vision for a new ‘everyday’ focuses on our relationships with our homes, land, and rivers. These natural and built infrastructures are so foundational to our everyday lives that they provide the ideal leverage points in which we can explore, reshape, and practise different ways of being and relating in the world together. In particular, they aim to demonstrate how reshaping the dark matter of our systems reshape possible futures. It is in our everyday experiences that we can uncover, in the words of David Graeber, “the ultimate, hidden truth of the world, […] that it is something that we make, and could just as easily make differently.”</p><p>So what would it look like to liberate our homes, land, and rivers from the logic of objectification, dominion, and extraction coded into our current economy? What would it mean to transcend alienation from our planetary entanglement and acknowledge that no-body and no-thing can be owned or dominated by another? How could our shared infrastructures be free, and in their freedom, generate freedom for us and the world around us? These provocations for emancipated civic infrastructures are embodied in four proofs of possibilities:</p>  FreeHouse (in collaboration with <a href="https://moos.space/about/">Moos Space</a> in&nbsp;Berlin)  FreeLand (in collaboration with <a href="https://www.landcommission.gov.scot/">the Scottish Land Commission</a> and <a href="https://halifax.citynews.ca/2023/06/27/funding-for-new-mikmaw-friendship-centre-in-halifax-close-to-50-million/">the new Mi’kmaw Native Friendship Centre</a>)  FreeRiver (<a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">The River Dôn&nbsp;Project</a>)  FreeSpace (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4?source=user_profile---------0----------------------------">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;city</a>)  <p>We will highlight our work on FreeHouse, FreeRiver, and FreeSpace in more detail below, while we will publish a separate piece on FreeLand in the coming&nbsp;months.</p><p>We’ve attempted to distil our collective exploration and experimentation into three critical shifts in worldview. We believe these form the embryonic shoots for a new social theory and its corresponding civic infrastructures: a shift from objects to agents, from externalities to entanglements, and from public-private to commoning. Each of our proofs of possibilities sits at the intersection of these foundational shifts as manifestations of this worldview.</p> Worldview shift 1: From objects to&nbsp;agents <p>Western law allows us to become property owners and through that gain exclusive control to exploit and extract economic value from things framed as ‘property’ such as homes and land. In <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Contract+and+Domination-p-9780745636214">Contract and Domination,</a> Carole Pateman shows how property rights were used to justify the colonisation of land, the monopolisation of scarce resources, and the privatisation of value extraction while commoning its consequences. Rather than simply tinkering at the edges of property ownership and circumscribing its social and ecological impacts, Radicle Civics is exploring a shift in the very roots of this system. Instead of seeing humans as subjects and the Earth as objects and commodities, can we recognise ‘selfhood’ and agency of everything, from flora and fauna, to rivers, the land, and the homes we build there? Instead of ownership, can we reimagine ties with the land and the Earth as part of a network of relationships built on care, mutuality, and reciprocity in a community of humans and more-than-humans?</p><p>Ownership is one theory of control and can only ever optimise for one output: the exclusive interests of the owners. It is structurally not designed to optimise for multiple entangled stakeholders, interests, and benefits. Instead, these are only considered when different owners’ rights are in conflict, or through regulations that limit the exercise of these rights in narrow contexts. These are blunt mechanisms for the complexity of our systemic crises. When we see the world from an entangled value proposition, we recognise a fundamental need to move beyond ownership to a relational model. The self-ownership of land, rivers, and houses allows us to subvert the existing system of ownership by ruling out the possibility of an owner. Without the owner’s dominating control, these beings can exercise agency for their own needs, in relation to one another. Rather than property contracts that would transfer exclusive rights, we would enter into care and stewardship relationships that would balance rights and responsibilities between the needs of equal&nbsp;beings.</p><p>So what could this self-ownership of land or rivers look like? How might we imagine their enfranchisement? For this, we are building on the wisdom of different Indigenous peoples that have traditionally granted great stature to nature and future generations and found ways to speak on their behalf, as well as the growing Rights of Nature movement. Radicle Civics is exploring how we can harness assistive technologies and alternative governance design to effectively realise the agency of more-than-human actors and usher in a cultural shift beyond Anthropocentrism.</p><p>Our current technologies of bureaucracy are still extensions of analogue models — ‘paperwork’ still has a literal meaning, even if the pages are digital. And the way we currently use these bureaucratic technologies to manage the world as objects has reductionist tendencies. With the availability of abundant data and our capability to process it orders of magnitude greater, this is no longer a constraint, but in fact an enabler of an agent-based worldview. With tools like digital twins, we now can dynamically and non-exclusively identify, organise, and interact with this information while ensuring it is constantly verified with reality. When applied to governance, computational bureaucracy can support plurality and coherence, as demonstrated by machine learning tools like <a href="https://pol.is/home">Polis</a>, and at planetary and hyperlocal scales simultaneously. Distributed protocols, such as blockchain, of verifying, transacting, making sense and decisions can be done with integrity without relying on central authorities. By treating these as assistive technologies that allow us to interact with an agent-based worldview, it serves an ennobling function, allowing humans, more-than-humans and machines to interact in a peer-to-peer way, and operationalise this new vision of&nbsp;civics.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeRiver — River Dôn Project and Interface for&nbsp;Care</p><p>Together with <a href="https://weareopus.org/">Opus Independents</a> and a group of partners, including Lawyers for Nature, Sheffield Hallam University, Urban Flows Observatory: The University of Sheffield, Sheffield Data for Good, Urban Flows Observatory, South Yorkshire Sustainability Centre, and Don Catchment Rivers Trust, we are working on the <a href="https://www.theriverdon.org/">River Dôn Project</a>. The project aims to create an alternative model for relating to the River Don through recognising its personhood and hopes to unlock new ways of seeing, understanding, valuing, empathising with and caring for the River as an&nbsp;agent.</p><p>Building on our <a href="https://civic-ai.org/connectedurbanforest/">CivicAI work</a>, Dark Matter Labs is working on designing an Interface for Care to engender new caring relationships and stewardship action for the river. Our Interface for Care will use a mix of interfaces, from chatbots to augmented reality, to feedback ecosystem data tangibly and meaningfully. This will grow our collective intelligence and cultivate deep empathy and a sense of belonging with the river ecosystem. Through different expressive media, we will explore how the river can best communicate its needs and values. Can a river write a poem to express its hurt over being polluted? Would a heart-to-heart conversation empower communities to take proactive action to care for the river? We will explore how an evolving empathic relationship built through the Interface can be leveraged for citizens entering into new types of stewardship agreements with the river around specific individual and collective actions of care. The Interface will capture input from citizens on their care actions, and complete the feedback loop by expressing the positive impact of their agency as part of an iterative process of learning to deepen and evolve care. The Interface also explores how a care economy around the river can be built, such as by guiding human behaviour towards better stewardship via social (rather than financial) incentives, such as thank you letters and&nbsp;art.</p> Worldview shift 2: From externalities to entanglements <p>The <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~jfarley/EEseminar/readings/energy%20myths.pdf">original sin of modern economics</a> according to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is the illusion that our economies do not depend on resources, energy, and waste sinks, and can thus continue to expand exponentially. Companies have been allowed to maximise profits by commandeering ‘nature’s gifts’ as cheaply as possible, while absolving them of any obligation to repair, restore, or replenish what they take. A <a href="https://grist.org/business-technology/none-of-the-worlds-top-industries-would-be-profitable-if-they-paid-for-the-natural-capital-they-use/">study by Trucost</a> found that none of the world’s top industries would be profitable if they paid for the natural capital they use. The total unpriced natural capital consumed cost our planet $7.3 trillion a year — 13 percent of global GDP in 2009. This damage is simply treated by our economic system as ‘externalities’, external to the interests and liabilities ascribed to the owner, with these true costs falling on everyone and everything else. In other words, externalities are convenient fiction enabled by property, the arbitrary premise that property and its value can be enclosed from the world around&nbsp;it.</p><blockquote>“Categories such as ‘away’ have evaporated: one doesn’t throw a candy wrapper away, one drops it on Mount Everest” — Timothy Morton, Humankind.</blockquote><p>Externalities are not just an accounting glitch: they are a denial of our complex entanglement (as Barry Commoner stated in one of his laws of ecology, “Everything Is Connected To Everything Else” ) and a structural flaw in our economic theory of value. In realising we live in a resource-scarce world, we should also recognise that value should not be enclosable and alienated from the world around it, but that value is relational and entangled with the world. In a worldview that sees agents, not objects, value comes from relationships between agents (for example, the value of a tree as a habitat to an insect). But value can also be an emergent property of this complex system of relationships (for example, from individual relationships of habitation between flora, fauna, and geography emerges the biodiversity value of the ecosystem). Once we accept the complexity of entanglement, our theory of value also becomes necessarily complex. We are starting to sketch out loose taxonomies to help us transition our worldview and economy from an extractive to entangled understanding of value, starting with the&nbsp;house:</p><p>This entangled theory of value will in turn shape our decision-making: what should our civic infrastructures be designed to value, prioritise, and encourage? In turn, how might our <a href="https://www.civic.capital/">civic financial models </a>(across regulation, investment, accounting, taxation, insurance and procurement) evolve to account for this multi-dimensional, entangled and longitudinal forms of value, and leverage the institutional and private capital needed to solve the complex social and environmental challenges created by the legacy of externalities? For example, compare an uncomfortable, energy-inefficient, rent-seeking house built unsustainably to a house that is designed in harmony with the environment, its inhabitants, and society: does our current economic system truly account for the full difference in value between the two? If not, what would a new economy and housing model for the latter look like? We hope to explore these questions through our proof of possibility.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeHouse</p><p>The house is a widely familiar and relatable space; it also sits at the intersection of economic, social and environmental systems, making it an ideal site for experimentation for this entangled theory of value. What if the house is no longer a property to be bought and sold like any other commodity? Instead, the house is self-owning entity that embodies a knot of value flows: the value of materials into and out of the house when it is constructed and deconstructed; the value of flood risk reduction from sustainable urban drainage approach; the value of the energy the house generates, uses, and contributes back to the grid; the value of its role in the ecosystem of organisms that live in and around it; the value of its sustainable construction as a carbon store; the value of ‘home’ for belonging and mental well-being; and the value of being a constituent part of a wider community.</p><p>When the house is recognised as a knot of value flows, and that these flows have multiple beneficiaries and multiple liability holders, how can we reimagine and invest in the house, not as a vehicle for speculation and extraction but as a generator of common benefits? To realise this theory of value, we are testing these critical components:</p><p>1. Generative financing and decision-making driven by entangled common&nbsp;value</p><p>The house embodies the creation of multiple value through energy generation, food production, social interactions, ecosystem services, etc. Instead of extracting rent, this entangled theory of value is an opportunity to design a generative business model that maximises the house’s creation of this common value, while allowing the house to sustain itself in the long term, such as maintenance and servicing its own loans. We will be designing the frameworks needed to make these value flows and relationships legible, such as entangled value mapping. We will also be scoping the infrastructure needed to make this value operationalisable, both tradeable systems (such as outcome buying and multi-valent currencies) to non-tradeable systems (such as that of care and gratitude).</p><p>The theory of entangled value will influence our decision-making process. Short of the house being fully autonomous in exercising its agency, we will be designing the kind of governance and decision-making structures needed to help it achieve its generative mission, rather than serving the private interests of owners. These structures will also accommodate the participation of the house’s both human and more-than-human neighbours and interdependent stakeholders.</p><p>2. Commons governance for cohabitation</p><p>From an agent-to-agent perspective, use value is generated through the relationship between houses and their inhabitants. Currently, we are exploring the design of stewardship agreements, drawing inspiration from Michel Serres’ concept of <a href="https://www.press.umich.edu/9725/natural_contract">The Natural Contract</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/traditional-ecological-knowledge">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> in order to actualise our entangled relationships with the systems that sustain us. These agreements would balance the right to live in the FreeHouse with the responsibility to care for it and the relationships it has with the world around it. In other words, this stewardship relationship is multilateral: in return for an affordable comfortable home, inhabitants may undertake responsibilities that involve maintaining the house, promoting the flourishing of wildlife, and also being a responsible member of the local community.</p><p>Housing inequality emerges from systemic misallocation: wealth accumulation enabled by property often leads to excluding others from fulfilling their fundamental housing needs and addressing broader societal and environmental concerns, including climate transition and mental wellbeing. In other words, property has a social function and the right of exclusion also comes at a societal opportunity cost. A self-owning house already exempts it from a market-based approach to resource allocation. But we are exploring alternative approaches to decide who gets to live in a FreeHouse, by moving beyond a mere reallocation of use rights to fostering a culture of cohabitation. We are starting a new civic conversation with potential residents over what is a fair balance between needs for ‘homeliness’ and opportunity costs for the wider community of agents, including those who may not reside in the house or immediate neighbourhood.</p><p>3. Materials on loan from the&nbsp;commons</p><p>Material value encompasses both the advantages of agents possessing materials for their function, the responsibility to avoid wastefulness, and the opportunity cost of those materials serving other functions. The choice of materials used in constructing a house can profoundly influence the environment and the well-being of its occupants.</p><p>What if the materials used in the construction of the house are leased instead of owned? A fully circular economy that avoids resource depletion has indisputably greater value than our current model of unsustainably extracting new resources without considering their subsequent reuse. How this full circularity emerges will require a system-level infrastructure for enforcing the long-term responsibilities of possessing materials. Currently, we are exploring the idea of a Carbon Storage Lease, which involves testing whether a long-term or perpetual instrument like a lease agreement can be utilised to ensure that carbon remains stored throughout the lifecycle of materials such as&nbsp;timber.</p> Worldview shift 3: From public-private to commoning <p>We’re continuing to use approaches designed for another era to tackle challenges of today, opting for one-size-fits-all or centralised responses that were limited by the quality and quantity of information and technology available. In the age of increased uncertainty with complex, interconnected challenges, these approaches are increasingly showing their age. These challenges transcend our constructs of boundaries, departments, and disciplines: global problems such as pandemics, climate change, or growing inequality can not simply be solved by one government, or even a coalition of governments. Simultaneously, the growing abundance of mass sensing and data has the potential to provide public benefits, but also bring with them the risks of power and information asymmetries, vulnerabilities, and abuse of privacy from the centralisation of such data. We have reached the edge of our theory of control: we need to reconsider the ways in which we make decisions over shared resources, beyond carving out domains of exclusive control.</p><p>Radicle Civics explores how commoning (or <a href="https://thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.927">“becoming in common</a>” as Andrea Nightingale describes it) can usher in a new age of planetary collaboration and unbounded fluidity in the way we use our resources, materials, and spaces and solution for our shared risks. This shift will simultaneously require and cultivate a major reorientation around new collective intelligence models and social and civic capital. We are already seeing the potential of these multi-capital systems manifested: <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/12/31/trees-planted-councils-die-rush-job-show-green-credentials/">a tree planted by some local authorities has a chance for survival as low as 10%, while a tree cared for properly by a community should have over a 90% chance of survival</a>, an illustration of the difference between centralised management and distributed care. We are exploring how we can leverage technology to activate pre-existing economies of care and build new ones. Technologies such as distributed computing, ledgers, and smart contracts, can be used to both build new sense-making and learning capabilities, helping align actions among multiple stakeholders, reducing associated costs, and advancing the generative, plus-sum value of collaboration.</p><p>Our Proof of Possibility: FreeSpace and Permissioning the&nbsp;City</p><p>Most of us are familiar with seeing rivers or land as commons: but how about commoning applied to vacant buildings? Our cities are full of under-utilised spaces as a result of the pandemic, the evolution of work, and demographic and economic restructuring. However, we currently do not have any fiscal incentives or regulatory frameworks in place to leverage these assets for our collective benefit, even though the ongoing underutilisation of these assets incurs a societal cost. With FreeSpace, we are exploring how we can unlock a city’s public and private spatial assets for civic use through new types of commoning, such as using micro-stewardship smart contracts and peer-to-peer deliberation with other agents. It asks how we can encourage a practice of commoning and culture of stewardship towards shared urban assets that goes beyond traditional rental or ownership models. For instance, can we transform a vacant office space into a partial commons by overlaying common ways of governing of a specific space — for instance a shared kitchen — or for a specific duration — such as monthly Tuesday evenings, and do so while measuring and ensuring the impact is net-positive on its interdependent stakeholders? Our Korea team recently published how they are building this experiment of new civic allocation in the context of Daegu city with <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/re-permissioning-the-city-unlocking-cities-growing-underutilised-spatial-assets-for-an-emergent-1550997714a4">Re:permissioning the&nbsp;City.</a></p> Three shifts towards a new&nbsp;economy <p>As Denise Hearn describes, “how we construct monetary, financial, and economic systems is not an exercise of cold calculation. Our systems, more accurately, are an expression of our cultural, philosophical, and even religious views about who we are as a species and how to best organise society.” We have identified three shifts in our worldviews that we believe to be critical in how we should relate to each other and the world as a reimagining of civics from its very roots. By recognising the world as interdependent agents, from which distributed and dynamic ways of organising and commoning can emerge, we hope this redefinition of civics can not only have implications for how we coexist, but also brings with it a new thesis of economics.</p><p>When we move beyond treating beings as economic objects for extraction (assets) to recognise the the subjecthood inherent in every being, when we unlock these beings’ capability to partake in decentralised monetary production to structure their own value flows, when we account for plus-sum behaviours such as care, trust, gifting, and collective knowing, these shifts in the axioms of our economic system open up new pathways of progress, and allow us escape out of the deepening rut caused by our previous system. And we believe the proofs of possibility we have chosen to work on, the self-owning economic agent (FreeHouse), interfaces for caring for agents (FreeRiver), and methods for agent-to-agent deliberation (FreeSpace), will be components critical for this agent-based economic system to become a&nbsp;reality.</p> What’s Next? <p>We hope that the framing of the ontological shifts and proof of possibilities provide a tangible sense of possible futures. In the upcoming months and years, we are continuing to collaborate with diverse partners in various locations, contexts, and lead markets to develop further proofs of possibilities. Through these initiatives, we seek to identify and demonstrate other strategic interventions that open up pathways towards recognising in our cultures and infrastructures the world as a complex relational system.</p><p>There are a few more projects we are cooking at the&nbsp;moment:</p>  FreeHouse Berlin: Creating opportunities for embodied experiences and meaningful civic conversations that foster societal-level imagination and drive profound structural and systemic transformations. This journey begins with the exploration of stewardship agreements, allocation systems, and innovative financial mechanisms, all of which lay the groundwork for the necessary and impactful shifts&nbsp;ahead.  FreeSense: Self-owning surveillance cameras to explore the public value created by sensors, and how they can be governed without centralised control, addressing security and privacy dilemmas.  Civic News City Sheffield: Nurturing deep listening capabilities in Sheffield using the interplay of media and events for deliberation, and creating a new hybrid civic space for ongoing citizen assemblies and collective sensemaking.  Neighbourhood as Commons/ Shared Street Sheffield: Centring neighbourhoods as the foundational unit of change to unlock system-level outcomes (i.e. trust, resilience, well-being, flows of information) and build new capabilities for collective sensemaking and&nbsp;action.  Our ongoing learning circles with diverse experts in citizen science, art and cultural organising, constitutional and contract law, token economics, blockchain and distributed organising and deep dives into our strategic design questions (with deep gratitude to Law and Political Economy Europe, Holochain, da0 civic tech community).

  <p>The global <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1048705/worldwide-biometrics-market-revenue/">biometrics market</a> is expected to grow to a staggering $82.9 billion by 2027 and organizations have taken notice of its many capabilities. In particular, as cyberattackers and their tools become more sophisticated, it's become increasingly challenging to protect digital assets. Biometrics are known to have been a boon to digital security and data protection, but there are a variety of other use cases across industries.</p>
	
 What are biometrics? 
	
<p>Biometrics are automated methods used to identify an individual or verify/authenticate an individual's identity based on physiological characteristics and behavioral traits. Government and law enforcement agencies often use biometrics to "identify" people (capturing a fingerprint, for example, and comparing it to a database of fingerprints to see if there's a match). Enterprises typically use the "verify/authenticate" type of biometrics, which automates recognition using biological identifiers, such as a facial scan or even one's keystrokes or gait.</p>
	
<p>Some of the most <a href="https://optimalidm.com/resources/blog/types-of-biometrics-sensors">commonly used biometrics</a> include measurable features of:</p>

  Faces 
   Fingerprints 
   Irises 
   Voices 
   Gait 
   Gestures 
   Keystrokes 
   Palm or finger veins 
  How are biometrics used today? 

<p>Some of the practical <a href="https://www.nec.co.nz/market-leadership/publications-media/the-top-9-common-uses-of-biometrics-in-everyday-life/">applications of biometrics</a> in the enterprise and everyday life, include:</p>

  Access to mobile devices 
   <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">Passwordless authentication</a> for apps 
   Banking, such as ATMs 
   Blood donation tracking 
   Physical access to secure buildings, campuses, and secure areas in hospitals 
   Medication dispensers 
   Healthcare applications, such as medical alerts 
   Public transportation access and tracking 
   Virtual assistants, such as Alexa 
   Employee <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">access management</a> 
  How do biometrics work? 
<p><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-biometrics-how-do-they-work/">Biometrics systems work</a> by comparing data. Systems capture biometric data, convert that data into a digital template, store the template, and analyze the presented biometric — comparing it against the stored template to determine if there is a match.</p>

<p>Because identifiable features, like fingerprint patterns, rarely change, they are ideal for verification purposes. A sensor – such as a fingerprint scanner or camera – can detect and recognize a user's unique characteristics. On some devices, such as an iPhone, the fingerprint is stored on the device itself and is never shared. In other cases, biometrics systems have a database of stored metrics that are used to analyze the recorded metrics against others.</p>
	
 How biometrics applications benefit enterprises 
	
<p>The use of biometrics is clearly revolutionizing the way organizations handle security – and though security is the most common application, there are many others. In the healthcare industry, smart wearable devices use biometrics for health monitoring. Some applications add artificial intelligence (AI) to speed decisioning and detect attempts at unauthorized activities. And others use biometrics to improve operational efficiencies. Here are seven ways biometrics is supporting digital organizations.</p>
	
	 1. Increased accuracy for automated systems 
	
<p>An automated biometric identification system (<a href="https://www.aware.com/automated-biometric-identification-system">ABIS</a>) is a large-scale system that compares recorded biometrics to a massive database of other biometrics. ABIS can be used by enterprises to perform identity checks for new hires or customers, comparing their IDs to those in an existing applicant or criminal database.</p>

<p>In healthcare, providers are starting to use ABIS to identify patients before delivering care to ensure that the right patients are receiving the right treatments. These <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity">digital identities</a> can also help reduce identity fraud in any sector. It's harder, for example, to replicate or fake biometrics than it is to steal a password, forge a signature, or use credit card or Social Security numbers. However, generative AI is making it easier to impersonate others, so identity systems that use voice recognition and video will have to evolve to stay ahead of the attackers using AI to create new methods of attack.</p>
	
	 2. Faster and more secure transactions 
	
<p>The use of biometric authentication makes digital transactions more secure by removing the leading cause of breaches: compromised credentials. It also reduces "friction" for legitimate users by eliminating the need to remember a password or enter a code sent to a mobile device. And it reduces the chance that employees and customers will experience security fatigue.</p>

<p>Security fatigue occurs when users become frustrated with repeated, arduous security tasks. It can lead to risky online behavior, such as accepting a push notification to authenticate a login that the user didn't initiate. Attackers are taking advantage of this fatigue by launching <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/mfa-prompt-bombing-why-cookie-cutter-mfa-solution-doesnt-cut-it-anymore">MFA prompt bombing</a> attacks.</p>

<p>To reduce friction, avoid security fatigue, and eliminate the threat of identity-based attacks that rely on the use of stolen credentials (including passwords), organizations are adopting <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">passwordless authentication</a>. Passwordless authentication offers a variety of ways to verify a user's identity without passwords and include biometric methods, such as facial recognition or a fingerprint scan.</p>
	
	 3. Integration with other technologies 
	
<p>The internet of things (IoT) relates to any internet-connected device that communicates information, often across platforms. Many industries, including manufacturing and healthcare, use IoT devices to share information securely and quickly to employees and customers. In a healthcare setting, this may include a glucose monitor or pacemaker that shares a patient's readings with the patient's doctor. In manufacturing, it may include sensors that relay information from the factory floor to inventory systems or suppliers. All these systems can improve efficiency and information-sharing, but they need to be secure, too, and that's where biometrics comes in.</p>

<p>Biometrics is beginning to integrate into the IoT ecosystem to improve security and the user experience. Not only are biometrics a quicker way to gain access to platforms and apps to receive pertinent information, but they're also a safer way to do so.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance</a> is crucial to managing authorized access to sensitive information, and biometrics are being used to improve the accuracy of this authorized access. For example, the biometric templates of former business partners could be entered into a list that prevents them from accessing sensitive company information and digital assets after the partnership's dissolution.</p>
	
	 4. Sustained authentication processes 
	
<p>Authentication processes that use biometrics are more sustainable long-term because biometrics is known as an "inherence" factor — in other words, something we are – which rarely changes and is difficult for malicious actors to steal or mimic. Passwords are a knowledge factor – something we know – which means they can be compromised (stolen), shared, intercepted, or cracked, which is getting easier thanks to AI.</p>

<p>Instead of passwords, also known as static shared secrets, organizations are turning to biometrics for verification. It not only streamlines the authentication process but makes it more secure and less subject to compromise for a longer period.</p>
	
	 5. Automated time and attendance tracking 
	
<p>Since organizations are using biometrics to allow access into buildings and digital platforms, they have the ability to automatically track employee and customer attendance. This data can be useful for leadership to analyze the cause of dips in engagement and attendance.</p>

<p>Biometric technology also eliminates the risk of employees logging in on behalf of other employees or sharing passwords. Time tracking is another part of employee behavior that can be prone to user error. To avoid errors in time tracking or time theft, organizations are using biometrics to more accurately manage time logs. This can include camera-based sensors that detect a user, or keystroke recognition software that tells employers how long employees are actually working. This is also easier and less tedious for employees than tracking their time manually.</p>
	
	 6. Streamlined payments and transactions 
	
<p>Payment processing is a crucial function of many digital businesses. Now, all retailers that conduct payment transactions can use biometrics. Shoppers can register for a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/biometric-payment">biometric payment</a> program if they sign up with proper identification and input their biometrics to a secure database provided by the company.</p>

<p>Then, whenever customers want to check out, they can scan their fingerprint instead of reaching for a credit card. This is quicker and safer in many ways, largely because it no longer requires the customer to use a plastic card or account number that someone could potentially steal and use.</p>
	
	 7. Increased employee productivity 
	
<p>The absence of security fatigue can enhance employee productivity. Companies that allow their employees access to resources quickly – without lengthy authentication processes – will likely see a rise in productivity and employee satisfaction. Employees can spend more time on important work tasks and less time remembering complex passwords or submitting help desk tickets when they are locked out of their accounts.</p>

<p>From faster, more secure transactions to automated attendance and time tracking, the growing biometrics market is poised to affect organizations across sectors – and this is only the beginning. Biometrics will continue to advance, streamlining and securing the digital identity experience for employees, partners, and customers – whether they're patients, constituents, students, members, or others. Stay abreast of current technological advancements – the right solutions will propel your organization onward and upward; it's up to you to find and implement them.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>The global digital ecosystem finds itself facing a new breed of cyber threat actors: loosely organized groups with a penchant for extortion, chaos, and the desire to gain notoriety. The US Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) recently released a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/CSRB_Lapsus%24_508c.pdf">comprehensive report</a> detailing a series of cyberattacks carried out by a threat group known as Lapsus$. These attacks, which hit a zenith in 2022, targeted a range of high-profile companies and government agencies. They offer a textbook, real-world scenario highlighting systemic weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our interconnected digital infrastructure. Let’s delve into the key findings of the CSRB report and the implications they hold for organizations and individuals alike.</p>  
 The Lapsus$ Watershed Moment  
<p>Lapsus$ was arguably a watershed moment because the group orchestrated a series of attacks that shook the cybersecurity community. These attacks were remarkable not because of their sophistication, but rather their effectiveness against even the most well-resourced and well-defended entities. The CSRB's investigation revealed that Lapsus$ thrived on exploiting systemic weaknesses in the digital ecosystem, targeting vulnerabilities in downstream vendors, telecommunications providers, and even employees through social engineering tactics.</p> 
 Lessons in Vulnerability  
<p>One of the most alarming findings from the report is the inadequate nature of current multi-factor authentication (MFA) implementations. Lapsus$ and similar groups were able to penetrate organizations by exploiting <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/mfa-prompt-bombing">weaknesses in SMS and voice-based MFA methods</a>. The attackers utilized <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/sim-swapping">SIM swapping</a> attacks to intercept one-time passcodes and push notifications sent via SMS, rendering traditional MFA measures ineffective. The CSRB strongly advocates for a transition to more robust and secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/how-passwordless-authentication-works">passwordless authentication methods</a>, specifically Fast IDentity Online (FIDO)2-compliant solutions, to mitigate these risks effectively. Robust FIDO2 solutions include synced passkeys for consumers and device-bound passkeys for workforce authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Fraudulent SIM Swap  
<p></p> 
<p>Source: Review of the Attacks Associated With Lapsus$ and Related Threat Groups, Cyber Safety Review Board, July 24, 2023</p> 
 Access Controls &amp; Third Party Connections  
<p>The report underlines the efficacy of initial access brokers (IABs) and information stealing malware, which allow cybercriminals to purchase valid login credentials for targeted organizations through the dark web. Lapsus$ leveraged these underground markets to gain entry not only to organizations themselves but also to their third-party servicers and business process outsourcers (BPOs). This highlights the importance of considering <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-passwordless-mfa-for-the-supply-chain">third-party risks</a> in an organization's risk management program, because attackers often exploit these relationships to infiltrate their ultimate targets.</p> 
 Securing the Future  
<p>The CSRB report serves as a wake up call to organizations to bolster their cybersecurity defenses and prepare for the continued evolution of new and dynamic attacks which target authentication and identity-related attack vectors. Resilience against threat actor groups like Lapsus$ requires a multifaceted approach. This includes identity verification, continuous <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a>, authentication that eliminates passwords and shared secrets, and well-established incident response procedures that can leverage and share insights from the extended security ecosystem.</p> 
 Rounding Out The Response  
<p>The report acknowledges the crucial role of law enforcement in combating cyber threats but underscores chronic underreporting issues that hinder effective cybersecurity efforts. Furthermore, local law enforcement must have the funding, training and escalation procedures in place to investigate and react in a timely and appropriate manner in order to thwart attack attempts and minimize damage when attacks occur.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>The lessons learned from Lapsus$ are invaluable: the need for stronger authentication methods, comprehensive access controls, a <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/the-power-of-risk-based-authentication-with-hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> approach and collaborative efforts involving both the public and private sectors. As we move forward, the report's recommendations should serve as a roadmap to a safer and more resilient digital future.</p> 
<p>The CSRB report on the Lapsus$ cyber threat actor group serves as a timely reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist within our interconnected digital infrastructure. While the attacks were not carried out by nation-state actors, their impact reverberated globally, highlighting the fragility of our cybersecurity defenses and the need for us all to “do better.”&nbsp;</p>

 Release of official counter fraud guidelines signals another step in the right direction toward fraud prevention in the UK. 



 



<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">May’s fraud strategy paper,</a> the UK government has released official counter fraud guidelines to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, which currently amounts to around £3 billion in losses per year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170631/3270_GCFP_Prevention_Standard_V.5.pdf">paper i</a>s billed as a resource for counter fraud specialists to refresh their knowledge and plug any gaps in their capability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Writing on LinkedIn, Mark Cheeseman, Chief Executive of the Public Sector Fraud Authority said:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is the latest milestone in over a year’s work with experts from across sectors and countries to codify the knowledge, skills and experience for fraud prevention professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those who commit fraud are continually evolving and developing their capability to be successful. If we want to have a bigger impact, we need to systematically build our own capability – building from the hard-won experiences of those who have, and are, taking action on fraud.”</p>



 What is in the ‘Government Counter Fraud Profession – Fraud Prevention Standard for Counter Fraud Professionals’ paper? 



<p>The 80-page document features comprehensive information on the Competency Framework (outlining the knowledge, skills and experience required by those undertaking fraud prevention), and guidance for professionals. Whether in the public or private sector, having a counter fraud culture is imperative to protect the business and its customers.</p>



<blockquote><p>The impact of fraud cannot be overstated. Although many may think of the monetary or organizational disruption of fraud, financial crime like money laundering can also lead to or facilitate numerous societal ills, such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking or the financing of terrorism</a>. It can also have a significant impact to the victim’s mental health.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 What are the benefits of an anti-fraud strategy? 



<p>The benefits of having fully trained counter fraud professionals in the private and public sector are numerous:</p>



<p>Reassures the public: Having a strategy and adequate tools and controls in place, alongside trained counter fraud professionals reassures the public that the services they use are safe and secure, and that the government or specific company is serious about protecting users.</p>



<p>Protects vulnerable members of the public: As fraud often has a disproportionate effect on the vulnerable (the old, the sick, the poor), it is this section of society that are either most dependent on government services like welfare or would feel the most acute impact from a loss of money. </p>



<p>Improves effectiveness of services: With a well thought out approach to safeguard against fraud, and a rigorous and robust identity verification service, you can ensure your users access the services or payments that only they are entitled to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Optimize operations, increase speed of transactions: Taking a proactive, preventative approach to fraud by implementing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML and KYC measures</a> saves money in the long run. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/">Automated identity verification</a> can increase the speed and security of transactions, while creating a safer environment.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a counter fraud professional? 



<p>A <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/730050/Annex_B_-_GCFP_Brochure.pdf">Counter Fraud Professional (CFP) </a>is someone who focuses on fraud prevention, and who will work to implement proactive and preventative controls within their organization. A CFP will need a good working understanding of the different types of fraud, including <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/synthetic-identity-fraud/">synthetic identity fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/embezzlement/">embezzlement</a>, as well as the causes and motivators of fraud. A chief part of the CFP role is also to collaborate with other invested stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



 What are the 8 key steps for counter fraud professionals to follow? 



<p>The Competency Framework is comprised of eight key components, featuring the requisite knowledge, skills and experience required for CFPs to comply with. There are three different levels to attain: Trainee (developing introductory knowledge); Foundation (having the knowledge), and Practitioner (demonstrating the knowledge).<br></p>


 
 
 
 1. Counter fraud management: 
 

<p>Display understanding of why fraud is committed and the impact of fraud, alongside the correct reporting procedure.</p>

 
 
 
 2. Legislation: 
 

<p>Demonstrate knowledge of relevant legislation, including data protection.</p>

 
 
 
 3. Risk management: 
 

<p>Proficient in a range of risk management techniques, including determining priorities, using business process mapping and controls to mitigate fraud, and influence policy plans.</p>

 
 
 
 4. Business analysis: 
 

<p>Identify and use data in fraud prevention. For example, using analytical techniques and datasets.</p>

 
 
 
 5. Prevention methodologies: 
 

<p>Utilize a process specifically created to calculate prevented fraud figures, thereby encouraging innovation before controls are implemented.</p>

 
 
 
 6. Stakeholder engagement: 
 

<p>Engage with stakeholders to implement fraud prevention controls and foster collaborative processes and relationships.</p>

 
 
 
 7. Communications and deterrence: 
 

<p>Develop communications plan to convey deterrence messages.</p>

 
 
 
 8. Measurement, evaluation and review: 
 

<p>Conduct ongoing reviews of materials and methods to ensure effectiveness.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p></p>



 The value of technology and training in fraud prevention. 



<p>“At IDnow, we recognize the necessity of keeping up to date with the latest developments and techniques in fraud. We run regular training sessions and courses for our clients, and are proud to have helped forensic document examiners and fraud experts from police departments around the world, including the Republic of North Macedonia and Abu Dhabi.”</p>



<blockquote><p>We have valued and trusted relationships with various international police and counter fraud organizations, including INTERPOL, and the French Scientific Police (the forensics arm of the police) with whom we exchange knowledge and share best practices. Our market-leading identity verification services enable our clients from a variety of sectors to benefit from our proprietary fraud prevention technology, and regulatory expertise.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Fraudsters have become smart, it’s time to get smarter.&nbsp; 



<p>A successful counter fraud strategy is dependant on close collaboration between industry and government. Alignment between innovation and regulation will ensure a watertight approach to combating fraud, spanning services across the public and private sector.</p>



<p>IDnow’s layered, strategic approach to fraud prevention and KYC combines cutting edge biometrics and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a> with comprehensive document and data checks to arm you with all the tools you need to fight fraud.</p>



<p>We put the power of identity back into the hands of businesses; helping to reduce friction for trusted users, preventing fraud, and detecting high-risk or anomalous behavior.</p>

			 Tokenization Standardization Has Arrived With the ERC3643 Association 
<p>The advent of blockchain technology is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative developments of this century. Its unparalleled ability to transfer infinite value instantaneously across borders has started to redefine our financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>It’s no secret to anyone who’s watched this space that tokenization and blockchain integrations into our financial system is the inevitable future, the question is how and when will this reach critical mass?</p>
<p>At Tokeny we believe that&nbsp;bringing compliance on-chain at the smart contract level will permit mass adoption, because it enables mass tokenization.</p>
<p>We made this possible with the ERC3643 token protocol. This open-source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management, and transfer of permissioned tokens. This allows token issuers to&nbsp;tokenize any real world asset or financial product, enforce compliance and control their tokens, on any EVM blockchain, even on public blockchains.</p>
 Open Sourcing the Code to Ensure Access 
<p>Although Tokeny was the architect behind the ERC3643 standard, we understood that retaining the ‘keys’ wouldn’t align with our broader mission of making a&nbsp;universally recognized compliant token standard,&nbsp;so we elected to make it open-source.</p>
<p>From a traditional business perspective, making proprietary solutions open-source might seem counterintuitive. However, our vision transcends short-term gains; the more entities that leverage this standard, the sooner we can revolutionize the industry.</p>
<p>This philosophy echoes one of the more profound business decisions of our time by Elon Musk of Tesla. Musk made Tesla’s EV technology patents open-source, recognizing that his real competition was not other electric vehicle producers but gasoline-powered cars. Tesla’s mission was to accelerate sustainable transport, not merely to outcompete other electric vehicle manufacturers.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tokeny’s true competition isn’t other tokenization platforms; it’s the incumbent legacy systems that govern our financial world today.</p>
 Creating an Industry-wide Association to Accelerate Adoption 
<p>A few weeks ago, we formally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/industry-leaders-form-erc3643-association-to-propel-standardization-of-tokenization?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_nVqJRQbXk1O9GThOVD5HvofciVHANTud7uY2SNc6PvtxD8HEY7kxyWLxD7pCpFbU15O0q">launched</a>&nbsp;the ERC3643 association alongside industry leaders and incumbents including the following:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The association is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the blockchain token standard ERC3643 and, more globally, fostering the development of best practices and a comprehensive&nbsp;toolbox for financial institutions interested in tokenizing assets on the&nbsp;blockchain in a compliant manner.</p>
<p>Together with the members, we embark on a journey that holds tremendous potential for transforming the world of finance and revolutionizing the way assets are managed and traded.</p>
<p>By establishing a set of&nbsp;concrete technical, legal and operational guidelines and specifications, we will provide financial institutions with the tools they need to navigate this emerging landscape in a responsible and efficient manner.</p>
<p>In addition to the standardization efforts, our association will serve as a&nbsp;hub of knowledge and expertise, cultivating an environment of continuous learning and development.</p>
<p>The tokenized future is here, and the ERC3643 association is working to make that a reality for all to benefit from.</p>

<p></p><p>In today’s age of social media dominance, our online identities have become integral to both our personal lives and professional endeavors. From connecting with friends and family to building brands and businesses, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have given us the power to create digital personas that resonate with others where your user handle serves as a unique identifier in the digital world. </p><p>However, recent incidents have shed light on a fundamental question: Do we truly own our user handles on these platforms? Events, such as Twitter's rebranding and the subsequent takeover of the @X handle from a longtime user, shed light on the intricate web of ownership, accountability that revolves around these usernames, and how account models across the web work today.</p><p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/29/1190891082/twitter-x-account-owner-gene-hwang-elon-musk"></a></p> Borrowing vs. Owning<a title="Direct link to Borrowing vs. Owning">​</a> <p>User handles, also known as usernames, are a string of characters that represent your digital presence on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok. While users assume that the handles they create are tied to their accounts, the reality is more complex, often dictated by the terms of service set by the platform. These terms outline the rights and limitations users have over their usernames/accounts, establishing a virtual "landlord and tenant" relationship between you and the platform provider. </p><p>This relationship was exemplified when Twitter rebranded as "X," causing collateral damage as the company took repossession of user handles like @X, without notice or monetary compensation. This was echoed in cases like @Music, which was created by a user who curated their digital presence with this handle for more than 16 years. </p><p></p><p>The notice from Twitter to this account holder reads:</p><blockquote><p>The user handle associated with account @Music will be affiliated with X Corp. Accordingly, your user handle will be changed to a new user handle. </p></blockquote><p>While this is certainly alarming, it’s not illegal. Most people don’t read the fine print of the Terms of Service agreements when joining these applications, and therefore don’t realize how much control these centralized organizations have over our data and digital identity.  </p> The Problem &amp; The Solution<a title="Direct link to The Problem &amp; The Solution">​</a> <p>The way the web stands today, each time we engage with online platforms that require accounts, we borrow an identity from them and then proceed to build a reputation and possibly brand associated with this borrowed identity. The recent turmoil experienced by Twitter has thrust the very nature of the web into the spotlight for those who previously might not have contemplated its issues. This is precisely why Decentralized Identifiers (<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers#what-is-it">DIDs</a>) bear immense significance.</p><p>At the core of Web5's paradigm lie DIDs, which serve as identities that users own and control. DIDs provide individuals with distinctive, universally resolvable identifiers that persist through time and consistently remain under their control. Unlike conventional usernames, DIDs can't be confiscated by platforms, thus empowering users to truly possess their digital identities. This transformative shift adds an identity layer to the web eradicating platform-mediated handles.</p><p>Fortunately, Twitter automatically gave the user who created @X a new (albeit way less cool) handle. However, what if the company simply closed that account instead? The user would have  lost not just their username, but potentially their entire digital existence on that platform if their profile had been wiped out.  </p><p>While Twitter's actions towards these users might not have violated any legal boundaries, is this the way we truly want the web to be? Social media has transcended its original purpose of mere social interaction; it now intertwines with our livelihoods. When signing up for a new platform many of us adopt the same usernames. These usernames serve as both personal and professional branding tools, encapsulating not just our individual identities but also the essence of our businesses.</p><p>Web5 will revolutionize identity management by restoring it to us, the users, while allowing applications to focus solely on enhancing our user experience. </p> Twitter Space with Industry Leaders<a title="Direct link to Twitter Space with Industry Leaders">​</a> <p>Industry leaders Angie Jones, Kelsey Hightower, and Daniel Buchner discussed this very topic on a recent Twitter Space. Tune in to hear their thoughts on how Decentralized Identity solves this problem.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, check out our previous update here:</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-developer-update-33/">  Spruce Developer Update #33  At Spruce, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts across our libraries.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p>Last month we <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">announced SpruceKit</a>, a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase<br>   SSX <p>SSX (Self-Sovereign Anything) is the easiest way to integrate Sign-In with Ethereum, enable DAO logins, resolve ENS names, and more. It is the go-to library for developers in Web3 to get started with decentralized identity.</p>  Upgraded documentation: With the release of SpruceKit, our documentation has been updated to include all SpruceKit libraries and can now be found at: <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://www.sprucekit.dev/</a>. The previous version of our documentation can be found at: <a href="https://v1.ssx.id/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">https://v1.ssx.id/</a>.  Reworked architecture and released SSX 2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/146?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#146</a>): This month, we reworked the library architecture of SSX. The previous functions of SSX have been moved into a new module named UserAuthorization that is responsible for end-user signing-related operations. A new storage module was added, which provides functionality to store and retrieve data in Kepler. Check out the <a href="https://www.sprucekit.dev/ssx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SSX v2.x Docs</a>.  Enabled customizability: @spruceid/ssx-react no longer depends on wagmi. Instead, function hooks must be defined and used as arguments to the component.<br> ✓ onChangeAccount is replaced by watchProvider property, allowing for    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; more customizability<br> ✓ web3Provider.providerLoaded property was removed<br> ✓ useSSX now returns the ssx instance and the provider<br> ✓ Now watchProvider is the new interface for listening to provider changes.  You must set up this function to be called whenever an interaction with the  user happens. An example of how to do it can be found <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/blob/main/examples/ssx-test-react/src/index.tsx?ref=blog.spruceid.com#L25">here</a>  Credential modules (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssx/pull/150?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#150</a>): We’ve added Credential Modules, which allow you to fetch credentials issued on <a href="https://issuer.sprucekit.dev/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">SpruceKit Credential Issuer</a>. Our Credential Issuer, Quest, can now be used as a faucet for credentials.  Sprouts Example Apps: Last month we released the Sprouts, SpruceKit example apps. These apps recreate popular consumer experiences with decentralized identity baked into the user experience. Check out SpruceKit open-source libraries in action with our three demo apps:  <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-the-sprouts/">  Introducing the Sprouts: SpruceKit Example Apps  We’re excited to release three new reference apps, the Sprouts, that demonstrate how you can leverage the SpruceKit open source libraries to introduce decentralized identity in the next app you build.

<div class='wrap'>

 What Is Identity Orchestration? 
<p>Identity Orchestration is an <a>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> approach that automates managing and securing digital identities across diverse platforms, primarily multi-cloud environments. It involves coordinating various identity-related tasks such as authentication, authorization, provisioning, de-provisioning, password management, and more across multiple systems and applications.</p>
<p>For instance, when new employees join a company, they often need access to many systems. Manually provisioning access for each system is time-consuming and prone to error. If the employee leaves, de-provisioning access is also essential to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<p>By automating these processes through identity orchestration, companies can streamline their identity and access management, reduce the risk of security breaches, ensure compliance with regulations, and enhance the user experience by providing seamless access to the required resources.</p>
 Identity Management Problems Solved by Orchestration 
<p>The challenge of <a>identity management</a> across multi-cloud (or simply diverse platforms) is that such diversity introduces a host of problems that aren’t present (or aren’t as present) in centralized identity systems.</p>
<p>Accordingly, identity orchestration addresses several critical problems associated with identity management, including:</p>
 
 Scalability: As organizations grow and add more systems and applications, managing identities can become complex and time-consuming. Identity orchestration automates and streamlines this process, making it easier to scale. 
 Security: Manual management of identities can lead to errors, like forgetting to de-provision a former employee’s access, which could lead to security vulnerabilities. Automated provisioning and de-provisioning help mitigate such risks. 
 Consistency: Ensuring consistent access rights across multiple systems and applications can be challenging. Identity orchestration helps maintain this consistency by centralizing and automating the process. 
 Compliance: Many industries have strict regulations around who can access specific data types. Identity orchestration provides robust auditing capabilities, which can assist in demonstrating compliance with these regulations. 
 User Experience: Users often need to remember multiple credentials for different systems, leading to password fatigue and decreased productivity. With features like single sign-on (SSO), identity orchestration can provide a seamless user experience. 
 Efficiency: Manual identity management tasks can consume significant IT resources. By automating these tasks, identity orchestration can free IT teams to focus on other critical areas. 
 Visibility: With traditional IAM approaches, having a clear overview of who has access to what can be challenging. Identity orchestration platforms usually provide a unified dashboard that gives a comprehensive view of access rights across the organization, aiding in resource optimization and security management. 
 
 How Does Identity Orchestration Work? 
<p>Identity orchestration works through an orchestrating system that coordinates critical tasks related to IAM across various systems and applications. This orchestration is typically accomplished using a dedicated platform.</p>
<p>There are standard technologies and processes of almost any orchestration system. These include:</p>
 
 Integration: First, the identity orchestration platform is integrated with all the systems and applications for which it will manage access. This could be anything from email systems and databases to cloud platforms and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. 
 Policy Setting: Policies are established within the platform to control system access based on user role, behavior, or attributes of the system or authentication session (time, date, location, etc.). 
 Automation: Policies programmed into an orchestration system can be automated quickly, managing the priorities of that system (provisioning, onboarding, security, etc.). This reduces the manual workload for IT teams and decreases the chances of errors or inconsistencies. 
 Authentication and Authorization: As a baseline, an orchestration solution should be able to handle some of the most important functions of an identity management system–specifically, authenticating users, verifying user identities, and controlling access to system resources based on policies. 
 Audit and Compliance: Finally, the platform also keeps detailed logs of all identity and access management activities. This is crucial for audit purposes and to demonstrate compliance with regulations that mandate certain control over systems and data access. 
 
<p>The specifics of how identity orchestration works can vary depending on the specific technologies and solutions used and the unique requirements of the organization implementing it.</p>
 What Should an Organization Look for in an Orchestration Solution? 
<p>When choosing an identity orchestration solution, it’s essential to consider several key features and aspects to ensure it will meet your organization’s needs. Here are some factors to consider:</p>
 
 Integration with Existing Solutions: The solution should integrate seamlessly with your existing systems, applications, and platforms. This includes both on-premises systems and cloud-based applications. 
 Scalability: Your identity management needs will also grow as your organization grows. Choose a solution that can scale to accommodate increasing users and systems. 
 Automation: One of the main benefits of identity orchestration is automating tasks such as provisioning, de-provisioning, and password resets. Ensure the solution offers a high degree of automation to reduce manual efforts. 
 Security: Features like MFA, SSO, and risk-based access controls can help improve security. Look for a system that offers the best security measures for specific, necessary functions like authentication, authorization, or management. 
 Compliance and Auditing: The solution should provide robust auditing capabilities to track and log all identity and access activities. This is crucial for demonstrating compliance with regulations. 
 User Experience: Features like self-service password resets and single sign-on can enhance the user experience, reducing frustration and help-desk calls. 
 Vendor Support: Consider the vendor’s reputation, their track record in providing support, and the availability of resources such as documentation and training. 
 Cost: Finally, consider the cost of the solution, not only in terms of the purchase price or subscription fees but also the costs related to implementation, training, and ongoing maintenance. 
 
 The Fabric of Identity Orchestration 
<p>As identity and authentication technologies evolve, the methods through which providers and other users can orchestrate identity management. Following that, robust infrastructure and security integration into these systems becomes crucial.</p>
<p>Thus, there are a couple of related security and technical systems that touch on identity orchestration–namely, identity fabrics and zero-trust architecture:</p>
 
 Identity Fabrics: This relatively newer concept in IAM represents a holistic approach to identity services across an organization. It’s a design principle that calls for a single, consistent layer of identity services, which can be used by all parts of an organization, regardless of where they are or what underlying technology they use. Identity Orchestration and identity fabrics work together to provide seamless and unified management of identities across an organization. Identity orchestration is the operational aspect, automating and managing identity tasks, while Identity Fabrics provide the architectural framework that allows this orchestration to occur across the entire organization. 
 
 
 Zero-Trust Architecture: This is a security concept centered on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything inside or outside its perimeters and instead must verify anything and everything trying to connect to its systems before granting access. This can be implemented in part through robust identity verification processes. <a>Zero-trust identity</a> ties into this by adding a layer of security. The automation provided by Identity Orchestration, combined with the architectural structure of identity fabrics, can help implement the zero trust model by ensuring every access request is thoroughly verified, no matter where it comes from or what it’s accessing. This is done by continuously validating the user’s identity and the request context to minimize the risk of a security breach.

<p>When Anonyome Labs’ CTO and co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley spoke to Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> about the hottest topic in privacy right now, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a>, he left the audience with 5 aha! moments.</p>



<p>If you haven’t heard, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/inside-the-massive-projected-growth-in-the-decentralized-identity-market/">decentralized identity</a> is a new fully digital, universally accepted way of identifying ourselves online (e.g. to a web site or app) and in real life (e.g. at a bar or border crossing). </p>



<p>Catch up on the decentralized identity story on our <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">blog</a> and in our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/whitepaper-blog/">whitepapers</a>.</p>



<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is the most important privacy innovation of the decade and it’s here now—and that was the first aha moment from Dr Ashley:</p>



<p></p>



 Aha 1: DI technology is ready for your business application. 



<p>On the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">podcast</a>, Dr Ashley told co-hosts Rich and Sarah that hundreds of applications of the groundbreaking DI technology are already springing up around the world and across many industries, particularly travel, health, banking, licensing and certification.</p>



<p>“It’s really been the last 12 months where we’ve seen it take off. We’re at the crest of the wave,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>And it’s easy to get started, Dr Ashley said: “DI is quite simple for organizations to set up. Anonyome Labs has verifier and issuer providers, and we can run [applications] in the cloud because we’re a SaaS provider. We also provide a DI Wallet for users.</p>



<p>“Organizations just do a little application work around what [information] to ask the user for, but it’s not a big load for an organization to become an issuer or a verifier. You’ve just got to be able to control the issuer or verifier software. It’s not a big burden for the user either, they just need to get a wallet.”</p>

<p></p>



 Aha 2: Verifiable credentials will drive DI’s applications across the internet. 



<p>DI’s superpower is it allows a user to selectively disclose their personal information to an organization that is requesting proof of their identity.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a> are making this selective disclosure of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally</a> identifiable information (PII) possible and will make DI ubiquitous across the internet within the next decade. He pointed out the rise of verifiable credentials has led to the widespread need for an <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>, a massive growth area in privacy and identity management.</p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/identity-wallet/">Explore the Identity Wallet SDKs on Sudo Platform</a><br></p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Rich and Sarah a verifiable credential is really a digital copy of a paper or plastic identity document (e.g. license). It can’t be faked because it’s cryptographically protected. The issuer, holder and verifier can confirm who created the verifiable credential, and it can’t be changed. The verifier can also tell whether the verifiable credential has been revoked. The user holds the verifiable credential in their digital identity wallet.</p>



<p>It works like this:</p>







<p></p>



<p>“The verifier, such as a bar, knows it’s real data; the user is confident they’ve only shown the information they’re comfortable or need to show.</p>



<p>“Standards define the wallet and also what the issuer will do and what the verifier will do. The verifier should just be able to connect to the standard tech to accept the digital identity (verifiable credential),” Dr Ashley explained.</p>

 Aha 3: The technology is extremely well designed for security and privacy. 



<p>Dr Ashley, who’s spent 25-plus years in the privacy and security space, says: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view,” Dr Ashley says.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley points out that data brokers won’t want DI to take off and that includes the Googles and Metas of the world, as well as the smaller data brokers: “That industry will push back [because] DI will swing back the privacy pendulum more towards the user,” he said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley also explained on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decentralized-identity-and-data-privacy/id1661635487?i=1000609765426">Privacy Files podcast</a> that Anonyome Labs, a leader in DI technology, got into the nascent space from the privacy perspective: “DI is about digital identities that the user can manage and control rather than somebody else,” he says.</p>



<p>He said the technology fits perfectly with the work we’ve done for years around <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/how-sudos-are-making-decentralized-identity-usable-for-most-people/">Sudo digital identities</a>, as seen in our exemplar app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/01/how-do-blockchains-provide-the-trust-foundation-for-decentralized-identity-based-apps/">Blockchain</a> is the anchor of trust for decentralized identity, and “DI is the ultimate blockchain technology,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>DI will mean a passwordless future, connecting from a digital wallet to a system to access that system.</p>



<p>“With DI, there’s no one place you can go where all the data is sitting and can be accessed, so there are a lot of security and privacy aspects to the DI approach that you just don’t get with the centralized approach,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>“Centralized databases are the classic honeypot for a hacker. DI makes hacking a much more difficult proposition. DI is much less attractive for hackers and also for data brokers wanting to exploit your data,” Dr Ashley says.</p>

<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 4: DI presents many opportunities for making money. 



<p>Dr Ashley said there are at least three models for monetizing opportunities in DI:</p>



 
 Verifier paying the issuer model (e.g. employment agency pays a university to get proof of a job applicant’s credential.) 



 User paying the issuer model (e.g. The student pays the university to get their credential proving their degree completion.) 



 Verifier paying the user model for access to their data (e.g. a shopping site pays the user for identity verification information such as age verification). 
 



<p>Dr Ashley said projects in DI are about getting better data or getting it in a low-cost way and enterprises could use DI to move trusted data between a network of parties (e.g. banks or farms etc.). “There are a lot of cost savings from this reduced process,” he said.</p>



<p>Read: <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a></p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



 Aha 5: Use cases for DI technology are virtually endless, across all industries. 



<p>Dr Ashley told <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">Rich and Sarah</a> that the number one decentralized identity scenario is travel: “Digital passports, visas, vaccine certificates, all in a wallet as verifiable credentials the traveller can take from country to country. With decentralized identity, you’re now taking trusted information across borders,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Some other big use cases we’re already seeing for DI, according to Dr Ashley, are digital driver licenses, event ticketing, certifications in the building or farming industry—”anywhere you need verifiable data to pass between one entity to you to another entity.”</p>



<p>“It’s a very good way of getting high integrity data,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>When podcast co-host Rich raised the question of whether DI still gives off some kind of digital exhaust, Dr Ashley agreed, but gave an example to ease concerns.</p>



<p>“Yes, but take the government example. I think the government’s place in this is as an issuer or verifier of a credential. There’s nothing wrong with a DMV issuing you a digital driver license. Government has a place in it but they don’t own the digital identity. The user owns the credential [digital identity]. Government is just a player like everyone else,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Government is just a player like everyone else.”</p>
Dr. Paul Ashley</blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>As for what a digital wallet will look and feel like? “It will be an app just like MySudo is an app,” Dr Ashley said. As such, it’ll be important to backup a digital wallet app, just like any other app.</p>



<p>And what about when decentralized identity technology will be widely available?</p>



<p>“It’s not in the public domain yet, because it’s mainly networks of systems (e.g. travel or farm or health) that are exploring it and implementing it. It hasn’t got general use yet. Groups of organizations are putting systems in place and if you’re part of that, you’ll get a wallet and get underway,” Dr Ashley said. Noting it’s “not too far away” for the public.</p>



<p>“It will take time to roll out but there’s a great lot of opportunity and benefits for users and organizations as well,” Dr Ashley said.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley closed out the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5fd4MZWoLCKolVYpGrJWY4">podcast episode</a> by repeating his earlier assertion: “Decentralized identity is a key technology for privacy for the next decade.”</p>

<p>Big Tech has taken control over your data privacy to help them addict you to their apps. But Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai are building the industry’s next best data tooling to solve data privacy problems while keeping your apps epic&nbsp;too.</p><p>The ‘Ocean’ of&nbsp;Data</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> is an ecosystem of open-source tools for data exchange on the blockchain. The protocol enables software applications to consume user data in a secure and privacy-preserving fashion using Web3 technology. Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts include permissioned datatokens and data NFTs that enable IP rights management in data wallets. Ocean Protocol tools are built to extract value from data by improving its algorithmic accessibility &amp; security.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> is the primary use case of Ocean Protocol’s smart contracts. Data and algorithms can be bought and sold on Ocean Market with token-gated accessibility to computation. Ocean Protocol’s data market is becoming an industry best practice architecture for sharing private data securely — MoveID consortium and GAIA-X (where Datarella is also a partner) use Ocean Market code to exchange data! Indeed, spinoffs of the Ocean Market are already being used in the wild (see<a href="https://portal.pontus-x.eu/"> Pontus-X</a> for a GDPR compliant example).</p> That’s So&nbsp;Fetch! <p><a href="https://fetch.ai/">Fetch.ai</a> offers powerful open-source software tools that leverage AI and automation algorithms on-chain to carry out complex tasks in the Web3 digital economy. Fetch’s Autonomous Economic Agents (<a href="https://docs.fetch.ai/aea-framework-documentation/">AEAs</a>) and Microagents gather resources and execute smart contracts using their own private keys to transact business logic autonomously. AEAs delegate on-chain tasks and record their completion, providing auditable traces of transaction history. A popular use case of Fetch’s protocol is its <a href="https://botswap.fi/">stop loss agents</a> that allow traders to autonomously provision liquidity on DeFi protocols and avoid manual transactions.</p> Getting Smart Recommendations Without Forking Over Your Data&nbsp;Privacy <p>Nowadays, smart recommendations in software apps are standard practice to improve these applications’ usability and retention. For example, Amazon curates and recommends relevant products to our feeds based on our recent search history. However, to gain such smart recommendations, we sacrifice our data privacy. Such applications leverage data lakes full of our historical user data to provide these smart recommendations. Not only does this strategy compromise individuals’ data privacy, but it increases the security risk for hacking such valuable data aggregated in one place. What if there was an elegant solution to both get excellent smart recommendations in apps and protect user privacy concerns?</p><p>From this idea, the integration of Fetch.ai’s Autonomous Economic Agents with Ocean Protocol’s Compute-to-Data (C2D) workflow was&nbsp;born.</p><p>In this software release, Ocean Protocol smart contracts for Compute-to-Data interface with AEAs to exchange their data on-chain while protecting user data&nbsp;privacy!</p><p>Let’s describe an excellent use case for the Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai integration: In the realm of IoT devices, this tech integration now makes it possible for IoT devices to determine based on their location and other algorithmic conditions when and how to publish their data on-chain for sale. Data consumers on-chain can query and purchase the data that they need from these IoT outputs. Together, this approach provides the basis for autonomous adaptive machine learning without having to scrape data&nbsp;online.</p> Ocean Protocol x Fetch.ai x Datarella <p>TL;DR: By enabling Fetch Agents to post data to Ocean Marketplace Compute-to-Data recommendation engines can be driven without violating privacy.</p><p>Ocean Protocol has joined forces with Fetch.ai and <a href="https://datarella.com/">Datarella</a> over the last few months to build an <a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/ocean_protocol/ocean_connection/0.1.5">Ocean Connection Agent</a> to take private data available to itself, store it confidentially, and then spin up a fixed-rate exchange on the Ocean Market or with C2D enabled as shown in the previous figure. You can imagine that in the near future, this might be your current location data or data about your preferences or searches performed locally within an app (the MOBIX app for example). This data never leaves the sovereign control of the user and the user doesn’t have to worry about handling or organizing or authorizing the data because the AEA does that on behalf of the user well, autonomously! The same applies to companies running AEAs on IoT devices too. You might be asking now why this is even beneficial. It’s useful because it solves the problems associated with those vast data lakes that are driving the recommendation engines behind all sorts of “smart” services.</p><p>Protecting User Privacy and Developing Business Intelligence On-Chain</p><p>Ocean Protocol’s <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> offers data and algorithms for sale on-chain, without any centralized control. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data smart contracts enable dApps and AEAs to publish data and algorithms privately while only selling the computational output of these datasets. The computed insights of the data that are sold, rather than the data&nbsp;itself!</p><p>In the primary use case for the Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol integration, smart apps are then able to use this architecture to produce context-aware recommendations, without accessing users’ data directly. This architecture obfuscates user data to only permit the app to see data insights using C2D. Such decentralized tooling enables compliance with strict privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>The world of data-sharing is changing quickly — and we’re setting the industry best standards of keeping your data private from algorithms while still gaining new context-aware smart recommendations to improve in-app user experiences. Coupling the Ocean Market with Fetch.ai AEAs means for the everyday person that it’s increasingly going to be possible that you can have your (data) cake and eat it too. You won’t have to choose between amazing functionality and privacy — you’ll be able to have&nbsp;both.</p> Developer Resources <p><a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/fetch">Dive into the code</a> for Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol on Github — it’s open-source! Similarly, the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">docs</a> for Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai provide valuable explanations on how to use this integration. If you’re already an AEA developer, then check out the package in the<a href="https://aea-registry.fetch.ai/details/connection/ocean_protocol/ocean_connection/0.1.5"> AEA registry</a>.

<p>Just imagine an academic/tech conference…</p><p>Participants dress professionally. Some may wear suits or dress shirts with trousers, while others may opt for blouses with skirts or pants, or that kind of professional attire. There is a sense of importance or urgency regarding the topics being discussed or the work they are involved in. It creates an atmosphere where individuals appear deeply invested in their contributions and the outcomes of the meeting. In some of these meetings, some participants may exhibit an overconfidence and present themselves in a sophisticated manner when they are under the spotlights of the stage, forgetting that the true value of a meeting lies in collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and the pursuit of mutual understanding rather than personal grandeur.</p> DWeb Camp <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Camp</a> 2023 is not one of these self-styled “important” meetings.</p><p>Imagine a stunning forest characterized by majestic redwood trees towering hundreds of meters in height, with a nearby river beautifully meandering through the landscape. Everywhere is a stage: Under the tree, across the field, alongside the river… There is no feeling of urgency, the titles of the participants are not important, and the joy of missing out is encouraged. This is the spirit of DWeb Camp.</p>DWeb Camp Participants take a moment to discuss quietly. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>.c<p>At DWeb Camp, you observe that the participants are dressed in a casual manner, wearing pajamas, shorts, or any attire of their choice during their talks. Some even have their children with them, clinging to their parents during their presentations. However, amidst this diverse crowd, everyone remains engaged in exploring the frontiers of science, technology, and collective human intelligence, with the shared goal of empowering individuals and communities. It shows you that no matter what clothes you wear, no matter the color of your skin, no matter what your anything else is, you are welcomed.</p><p>The only thing needed is to treat others with kindness and respect, and to have a passion about the decentralized web, even if you have no technical knowledge. DWeb Camp serves as a platform for researchers, developers, activists, and all people who wish to come together and discuss the challenges, concerns, and opportunities related to decentralization, privacy, security, and open protocols on the web. There is a true sense of community and it encourages the exchange of perspectives among participants from diverse backgrounds.</p> My Perspective on Holochain <p>I was amazed by Holochain from the very first day I encountered it in the spring of 2018. This feeling grew stronger over time, and at times, I wondered if my enthusiasm for Holochain might be an exaggeration due to my deep involvement. As a non-technical person, I was concerned that I might have missed something important about it. That is why I wanted to see how others, especially technical experts and policy makers, perceived Holochain when they were learning about its “whys, hows, and whats” at the camp.</p><p>It proved to be a bit challenging for them to grasp Holochain because it has a completely different paradigm compared to blockchain. While blockchain is data-centric, Holochain is agent-centric. This means that the users, which include ourselves and our devices, play a central role in a Holochain network. This perspective shift is difficult because it requires adapting to a more distributed and truly peer-to-peer way of managing data and interactions between autonomous agents. Additionally, understanding other aspects of Holo and Holochain such as the mechanism behind HoloFuel, a mutual-credit system backed by hosting power which is a significantly different approach from fiat or Ethereum for example, added another layer of complexity. However, as they started to understand it, I clearly observed the excitement in their eyes.</p><p>They became excited because they could envision how this tool/framework enables us to address and solve problems effectively. Therefore, this excitement among technical persons and policy makers was not merely a result of theoretical fascination, but rather a recognition of the practical possibilities and potential solutions that Holochain brings to the table. It sparked a genuine excitement about the transformative impact it could have on our digital sphere and the abilities it offers to individuals and communities in shaping their own destinies.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun, and other DWeb participants in a pre-camp warm up exercise. Photo courtesy of <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>. One Last Thing About Holochain... <p>I closely observed the Holochain team members and the Holochain community during the camp. The most notable aspect that stood out to me was their genuine lack of greed. Despite creating or being involved in an exceptional and potentially disruptive technology framework, the team members and the community exhibited true modesty. This humility was not artificial or some sort of facade; it is an inherent part of their nature, and it likely contributed to their ability to develop Holochain. Inspired by nature, they clearly combine their intelligence with the virtue of humility. They are not driven by a desire to save the world; instead, they passionately work towards building a meaningful tool that can assist people in their daily lives. And quite possibly, their dedicated efforts will ultimately lead to world-changing improvements.</p><p>Allow me to conclude with a profound quote from Arthur Brock that encapsulates the essence of Holochain concisely:</p><p>“Holochain is not built to attack national currencies, blockchain currencies, or surveillance corporations. Instead, we are simply focused on building viable, functional alternatives.”</p>DWeb Camp participants roast marshmallows over the nightly fire.

Bazıları takım elbise veya pantolon-gömlek giyerken, diğerleri şık birer bluze ek olarak etek-pantolon veya benzerî profesyonel kıyafetleri tercih eder. Tartışılan konulara veya dâhil oldukları faaliyetlere ilişkin yüksek bir önem ve aciliyet duygusu hissedilir. Bu durum, bireylerin kendi katkılarına ve toplantıdan elde edecekleri şeylere derinden yatırım yapmış oldukları bir atmosfer oluşturur. Bu toplantıların bazılarında, bazı katılımcılar aşırı özgüven sergiler ve bu kişiler sahnede spot ışıkları altındayken kendilerini sofistike bir şekilde sunar. Bir toplantının gerçek değerinin kişinin kendisini öne çıkarmaya çalışmasından ziyade işbirliği yapmakta, fikir alışverişinde bulunmakta ve karşılıklı ortak anlayışa ulaşma çabasında yattığını unutabilirler.</p> DWeb Kampı <p><a href="https://dwebcamp.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DWeb Kamp</a>ı 2023 (Decentralized Web Camp / Merkeziyetsiz İnternet Kampı) kerameti kendinden menkul bir şekilde "mühimlik" iddiasında olan o tür toplantılardan biri değil.</p><p>Yüzlerce metre yüksekliğinde görkemli sekoya ağaçlarıyla kaplı, etkileyici bir orman hayal edin; hemen yakınındaki nehir, manzara boyunca usul usul kıvrılıyor. Her yer, katılımcılar için birer sahne hüviyetinde: Ağaçların altı, çim alan, nehrin kenarı... Aciliyet hissi yok, katılımcıların unvanları önemli değil ve bir şeyleri kaçırabilmenin keyfini yaşamak teşvik ediliyor. DWeb Kampı'nın ruhu işte tam da bu.</p>DWeb Kampı katılımcıları sakince görüş alışverişinde bulunmak için kendilerine zaman ayırıyor. Fotoğraf, <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=27165&amp;Akey=9A789DKQ&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>'nın izniyle.<p>DWeb Kampı'nda katılımcıların yaptıkları konuşmalarda bile pijama ve şort gibi rahat kıyafetler giyebildiklerini, istedikleri herhangi bir kıyafeti seçebildiklerini gözlemliyorsunuz. Hatta bazılarının çocukları da yanlarında, sunumları sırasında sahneye gidip ebeveynlerine sarılıyorlar. Ancak, bu çeşitli kalabalığın arasında her bir fert, bireyleri ve toplulukları güçlendirmeye yönelik ortak bir hedef doğrultusunda bilimin, teknolojinin ve kolektif insan zekâsının sınırlarını keşfetmekle meşgul. Hangi kıyafeti giyerseniz giyin, teninizin rengi ne olursa olsun, başka herhangi bir özelliğiniz ne olursa olsun, hoş karşılanıyorsunuz.</p><p>Gerekli olan tek şey, başkalarına nezaketli ve saygılı davranmak ve teknik/yazılım bilginiz olmasa bile merkeziyetsiz web’e yönelik bir tutkuya sahip olmak. DWeb Kampı, bilimsel araştırmacılar, yazılım geliştiriciler, aktivistler için ve hatta bir araya gelerek merkeziyetsizleşme, gizlilik, güvenlik ve web üzerindeki açık protokollerle ilgili zorlukları, endişeleri ve fırsatları tartışmak isteyen herkes için bir platform görevi görüyor. Gerçek bir topluluk duygusu var ve çok çeşitli alanlardan bilgi birikimine sahip katılımcılar arasında bakış açılarının değiş tokuşu teşvik ediliyor.</p> Holochain Hakkındaki Kişisel Bakış Açım <p>Holochain ile 2018 baharında karşılaştığım ilk günden itibaren ona hayran kaldım. Bu his zamanla daha da güçlendi ve zaman zaman, Holochain'e duyduğum coşkunun derin ilgimden kaynaklanan bir abartı olup olmadığını hep merak ettim. Teknik/Yazılım bilgisi olmayan biri olarak, bu konuda önemli bir ayrıntıyı gözden kaçırmış olabileceğimden endişe ettim. Bu nedenle kampta Holochain'in "nedenlerini, nasıllarını ve ne olduğunu" öğrenirken başkalarının, özellikle de teknik uzmanların ve politika yapıcıların Holochain'i nasıl algıladıklarını görmek istedim.</p><p>Holochain'i kavramak onlar için biraz zor oldu çünkü Holochain blokzinciri teknolojisine kıyasla tamamen farklı bir paradigmaya sahip. Blokzinciri veri merkezliyken, Holochain katılımcı (agent) merkezlidir. Bu, bir Holochain ağında bizlerden ve bizim cihazlarımızdan oluşan kullanıcıların merkezî bir rol oynadığı anlamına gelir. Veri merkezli bakış açısından bu bakış açısına geçmek zordur çünkü kendi iradeleriyle hareket eden katılımcılar arasındaki veri ve etkileşimleri yönetmenin daha dağıtık ve gerçek anlamda eşler arasında (P2P) işleyen bir yöntemine uyum sağlamayı gerektirir. Ayrıca, Holo ve Holochain'in, örneğin fiat paralardan ve Ethereum'dan önemli ölçüde farklı bir yaklaşıma sahip olması, barındırma gücüyle desteklenen bir karşılıklı kredi (mutual-credit) sistemi olan HoloFuel'in arkasındaki mekanizma gibi diğer yönlerini anlamak, başka bir karmaşıklık katmanı ekler. Ancak günün sonunda, anlamaya başladıklarında gözlerinde beliren heyecanı net bir şekilde gözlemledim.</p><p>Heyecan duydular çünkü bu aracın/teknolojinin sorunlarımızı etkili bir şekilde ele almamızı ve çözmemizi nasıl sağlayabildiğini hayal edebiliyorlardı. Dolayısıyla, teknik/yazılım arka planı olan kişilerdeki ve politika yapıcı insanlardaki bu heyecan sadece teorik bir hayranlığın sonucu değildi, daha ziyade Holochain'in bize sunduğu pratik fayda ihtimallerinin ve potansiyel çözümlerin farkına varmalarından kaynaklanıyordu. Holochain’in dijital hayatımızda yaratabileceği dönüştürücü etki ve kendi kaderlerini şekillendirmede bireylere ve topluluklara sunduğu imkânlar konusunda hakikî bir heyecan oluşmuştu.</p>Arthur Brock, Eric Harris-Braun ve diğer DWeb katılımcıları kamp öncesi ısınma egzersizinde. Fotoğraf, <a href="https://shiragraphy.com/Artist.asp?ArtistID=27165&amp;Akey=9A789DKQ&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">Brad Shirakawa</a>'nın izniyle. Holochain Hakkında Son Bir Şey Daha... <p>Kamp sırasında Holochain ekip üyelerini ve Holochain topluluğunu yakından gözlemledim. Gözüme çarpan en önemli husus, açgözlülükten gerçek anlamda yoksun olmalarıydı. Olağanüstü ve potansiyel olarak yıkıcı bir teknolojiyi oluşturmalarına ya da bu teknolojinin oluşmasına katkıda bulunmalarına rağmen, ekip üyeleri ve topluluk gerçek bir alçakgönüllülük sergiledi. Bu alçakgönüllülük yapay değildi ve bir sahtelik içermiyordu; kendi doğalarının olağan bir parçasıydı ve muhtemelen Holochain'i geliştirmelerinde de büyük katkısı vardı. Doğadan aldıkları ilham doğrultusunda, zekâlarını alçakgönüllülük erdemiyle harmanlamış görünüyorlardı. Gördüğüm kadarıyla, dünyayı kurtarma arzusuyla hareket etmiyorlar; bunun yerine, insanlara günlük yaşamlarında yardımcı olabilecek anlamlı bir araç oluşturmak için tutkuyla çalışıyorlar. Ve büyük olasılıkla, bu özverili çabaları nihayetinde dünyayı değiştirecek gelişmelere yol açacak.</p><p>Arthur Brock'un, Holochain'in ruhunu kısaca anlatan özlü bir ifadesiyle yazıyı bitirmeme izin verin:</p><p>"Holochain ne ulusal para birimlerine, ne blokzinciri para birimlerine ne de bizleri gözetleyip duran büyük şirketlere saldırmak için inşa edildi. Bunun yerine odaklandığımız şey sadece şu; kendi ayakları üzerinde durabilen, işlevsel alternatifler oluşturmak."</p>DWeb Kampı katılımcıları gece yakılan ateşin üzerinde marshmallow kızartıyor.

<p>When it comes to digital transformation initiatives, cloud computing is frequently a key part of the conversation. The cloud is meant to be cost-effective, flexible, and scalable – a way to optimize operations, improve efficiency, and address a long list of use cases. And yet, technology professionals will be quick to caution that cloud services are not a panacea for every business challenge, and cloud transformation may look very different across different types of companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, while some industries embraced cloud migration early on, financial institutions have always moved at their own pace. The financial services sector has some of the most complex legacy application ecosystems and must comply with strict regulations, which has resulted in hesitance when it comes to embracing public cloud. On-premise systems were the norm, and initial exploration of the cloud was largely limited to private cloud deployments as financial institutions took a more conservative approach. However, the promise of offering better services with less effort has driven banks, credit unions, and other financial organizations to explore other types of cloud environments. In recent years, financial organizations have been investing much more in hybrid deployment models and public cloud, with 90% using at least two cloud deployment types and 88% using more than one public cloud. 64% of enterprises that have adopted public or internal private cloud even consider public cloud as their primary cloud platform.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, the cloud has become integral to the way modern financial institutions do business. However, the cloud journey still presents financial institutions with unique challenges around security and privacy which must be addressed. Finding the right cloud deployment model is critical to long-term business success – and identity tools can help financial institutions get the most out of their cloud investments.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Organizations globally face unprecedented challenges in safeguarding their sensitive data, critical assets, and reputation from cyber threats. Legacy authentication methods are not sufficient to thwart sophisticated attacks and evolving risks. This is where adaptive authentication, also referred to as risk-based authentication, shines; offering businesses a proactive and dynamic approach to security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Benefits of Risk-Based, Adaptive Authentication  
<p>Why is <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">risk-based authentication</a> an essential strategy that businesses should adopt as part of a comprehensive security strategy?</p> 
 Adaptive Protection  
<p>“Snapshot” authentication methods, which authenticate at a single point in time, fail to address the dynamic threat landscape. Risk-based authentication utilizes advanced risk analytics and real-time threat intelligence to dynamically adjust security measures based on contextual information and user behavior. This adaptability provides a crucial layer of protection against ever-changing threats.</p> 
 Frictionless User Experience That Is Also Secure  
<p>Customer satisfaction (CSAT) is a critical aspect of any business. Legacy authentication methods often create friction that impacts user satisfaction. Risk-based authentication solves this by tailoring the level of authentication based on individual risk profiles. This personalized approach strikes a balance between security and convenience, fostering a positive user experience while ensuring strong protection against threats.</p> 
 Stop Fraud and Unauthorized Access  
<p>Legacy authentication cannot detect suspicious logins, thereby leaving organizations vulnerable to fraud. Risk-based authentication addresses this challenge by analyzing various risk signals, such as geolocation, device information, and user behavior, to identify anomalies and potential threats. By continuously monitoring these risk factors, RBA can detect and mitigate identity based fraud in real-time.</p> 
 Aligning With Regulatory Requirements  
<p>Compliance regulations and <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/brief-mitre-attack-framework">security frameworks</a> mandate businesses to implement robust security measures to safeguard customer information and sensitive data. Risk-based authentication supports these efforts by providing a dynamic and adaptive security framework. By continuously assessing risk and responding to threats in real-time, businesses can proactively meet <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/intro-to-psd2-sca-requirements">regulatory requirements</a> with confidence.</p>

 A rapidly changing digital landscape 



<p>While speed and convenience are crucial in today’s financial innovations, they have to be paired with security. As financial apps and services become more digital, so do the fraudsters who are hard at work trying to pose as legitimate consumers. The spike in identity fraud has become an expensive problem, costing consumers, merchants and financial institutions billions of dollars. In 2021, nearly 42 million Americans fell victim to identity fraud. In that one year, fraudsters made off with some <a href="https://javelinstrategy.com/2022-Identity-fraud-scams-report">$52 billion</a> through identity scams. &nbsp;</p>







<p>As the exponential growth of digital banking and services has moved more transactions online, fraudsters’ methods have evolved to take advantage. A recent report published by Aite Novarica, Key Trends Driving Fraud Transformation in 2021 and Beyond, showed that 64% of financial institutions were experiencing higher rates of account takeover (ATO) fraud since the onset of the COVID pandemic. According to a 2021 survey of 110 fraud and loss prevention decision makers at fintech firms, 46% of fintechs report that ATO is their most prevalent problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fraud risk can increase when consumers are opening accounts and documenting identities digitally. According to research from <a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/application-fraud-how-do-you-solve-problem-identity">Aite-Novarica</a>, almost a quarter of checking account applications filed online in the first three quarters of 2022 were fraudulent, as were nearly one in five online credit card applications. &nbsp;</p>



 Open banking and identity networks work in unison to cut down on fraud&nbsp; 



<p>In response, financial service innovators are loading up on new tools capable of spotting and preventing fraud in real time, like the integration of identity and open banking solutions. <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Mastercard Open Banking</a> allows consumers to safely share their financial data to verify account ownership and facilitate transactions, and now we have integrated open banking with our identity network to make sure participants in transactions are who they say they are. &nbsp;</p>







<p>Mastercard can deliver instant identity verification, spotting compromised identities that manual verification may miss. Mastercard’s Identity and Open Banking networks deliver deep insights into the customer’s identity by analyzing relationships between and among the individual pieces of account owner data. For instance, identity network analysis keeps track of how often a name is linked to a phone number or email address.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking also helps providers create low-friction customer experiences. The technology enables them to:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Reduce manual paperwork&nbsp; 



 Shorten turnaround times 



 Grant instant access to new accounts 
 



 Innovations to secure the future of financial services&nbsp; 



<p>For all the promise that the emerging world of consumer-permissioned data holds, none of it will work without trust. Consumers must know that their money and data are safe. Consumers, banks and fintechs must trust that the system is secure and reliable enough to warrant continued investment and innovation. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.finicity.com/secure-account-opening/">Open Banking for Account Opening</a> provides a solution from Mastercard to specifically create and protect the ecosystem and minimize identity fraud. By doing so, we’re setting the trusted foundation needed to help our partners create financial services that deliver speed, convenience and security for today’s digital commerce.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m delighted to announce the general availability of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/protected-actions-overview">Conditional Access for Protected Actions</a>! This powerful feature empowers organizations to safeguard critical administrative operations with Conditional Access policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected actions refer to high-stakes operations that carry significant risk, such as altering conditional access policies, adding credentials to an application, or changing federation trust settings. These actions, if executed by a malicious actor, can severely compromise your organization's security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've asked Swetha Rai, a Senior Product Manager on the Identity team, to tell you more. Let us know what you think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitika Gupta&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group Product Manager, Identity Security</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Swetha, and I’m a product manager on the Identity team focused on Conditional Access (CA). Today, I’m excited to share more about the Conditional Access for protected actions feature that is now generally available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Conditional Access for protected actions, organizations can now add an extra layer of protection to these sensitive operations by defining granular policies that specify the conditions under which users can perform protected actions. For example, organizations can require administrators to complete phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA), use a compliant device, or be in a trusted location before modifying a conditional access policy. This way, even if an attacker gains access to an admin account, they won't be able to perform high-risk actions without meeting the additional security criteria. Here are some examples of policies for protected actions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 ​Admins require a privileged access workstation and a FIDO2 key to delete Conditional Access policies. 
 Admins need phishing-resistant MFA to define or modify custom rules that define network locations.<br> 
 
<p>Figure 1 Protected Actions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re continuing to add support for more protected actions based on customer feedback. Today, you can protect the following areas:\</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Conditional Access policy management 
 Custom rules that define network locations 
 Protected action management&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protected Actions on the roadmap:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Microsoft Entra Connect management 
 Cross-tenant access settings management 
 Credential and permission management on app and service principal registrations&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage you to explore this powerful feature and let us know what you think! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Distributed systems are networks comprised of nodes that interact directly with each other - no central server required. These nodes can store and edit files offline and in geographically diverse locations, and each node accessing the file has a copy. When it's time to bring the changes together and synchronize the file copies, there needs to be a mechanism in place that handles this efficiently and accurately. Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are an excellent solution. </p> Understanding CRDTs  <p>CRDTs were first introduced in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a> by Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marc Shapiro. The authors define a CRDT as an abstract data type that can modify any replica without coordinating with another replica. When two replicas have received the same set of updates, they reach the same state deterministically by adopting mathematically sound rules to guarantee state convergence. </p><p>There are two types of CRDTs: operation-based and state-based. Operation-based CRDTs, or commutative replicated data types (CmRDTs), change state by transmitting only the update operation. State-based CRDTs, or convergent replicated data types (CvRDTs), send their full local state to the other replicas, and a function merges the state. Operation-based CRDTs are not necessarily idempotent, but state-based CRDTs are.</p><p>CRDTs ensure eventual consistency without centralized coordination by linking back to previous versions of the file. As state changes occur, more branches are created and merged in the data structure. </p><p>But what if two valid writes on the same item must be consolidated? How do we determine which is the "correct one"? This depends on how each application developer chooses to handle merges. Some may employ LWW (Last Writer Wins) and use timestamps to determine which user was the last to submit changes and use that user's edits. Others may use a vector clock to look at causal relationships between the edits and algorithmically choose the accepted edit.</p> Real-World Applications  <p>There are many exciting use cases for CRDTs. Collaborative text editing and collaborative design tools use CRDTs to handle merge conflicts and work offline without tieing themselves to the server-client model, which can increase latency and costs. Fission built <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">Webnative File System</a> (WNFS) as a local-first file system for decentralized apps and uses CRDTs to enable <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipfs-thing-2023-wnfs/">concurrent writes</a> with version control.</p><p>Another example is distributed databases. Fission's <a href="https://github.com/RhizomeDB">RhizomeDB</a> is a local-first edge database for querying decentralized data, and it uses CRDTs as its framework. The CRDTs can make the database idempotent, depending on what the user needs to do. For example, if a user updates their address, the system will register that change. If an admin also attempts to update the user's address, no change will occur, and a duplicate entry won't be created. However, if the user wants to submit a form or ticket, ideally, a new one will be created each time because it may be for different reasons. CRDTs enable both options without a central server.</p> Benefits and Limitations  <p>There are several advantages of CRDTs over traditional synchronization methods. As we've already touched on, CRDTs don't require centralized control and can work offline and asynchronously. This helps improve scalability.</p><p>CRDTs are designed to be fault-tolerant. They can continue to function correctly even when nodes are temporarily disconnected from each other, and they can automatically converge to a consistent state once the network is restored.</p><p>CRDTs also provide eventual consistency, ensuring that all replicas will eventually converge to the same state. This allows for flexibility and responsiveness while maintaining data integrity.</p><p>But it's important to note that CRDTs can also have some limitations. CRDTs may require additional metadata or information to track the causality of updates and resolve conflicts. This can lead to increased storage overhead compared to traditional synchronization methods, especially for large datasets. </p><p>There is also a steeper learning curve for developers using more traditional synchronization methods. That, combined with the expectation of implementing strong encryption, can be a big project to undertake.</p> <p>CRDTs are a game-changer for distributed systems and local-first applications and databases. </p><p>If you'd like to learn more about CRDTs, we encourage you to check out the following papers:</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a></p><p><a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/papers/bft-crdt-papoc22.pdf">Making CRDTs Byzantine Fault Tolerant</a></p><p><a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p856-power.pdf">Keep Calm and CRDT On</a></p><p></p>

<p>e-government (e-gov) solutions are at the forefront of digital transformation, revolutionizing the way governments interact with their citizens. Why do governments need e-gov service delivery solutions, and how do credential issuance and verification systems enhance e-government effectiveness?</p>
<p>Why governments need e-gov service delivery solutions</p>
<p>Governments strive to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services, but not all citizens have equal access, particularly those residing in remote areas or facing socioeconomic challenges. e-gov service delivery solutions bridge this gap, ensuring that all citizens, regardless of location or circumstances, can access government services digitally and/or physically.</p>
<p>How you enable citizens to access government services securely and seamlessly, whether they’re crossing borders, applying for benefits, renewing their driver’s license, or paying taxes, impacts their engagement and trust in government. These solutions enable governments to provide real-time updates and share information, while maintaining the integrity of citizen data and protecting privacy.</p>
<p>A citizen-centric approach focuses on enhancing the overall user experience to boost citizen satisfaction, promoting transparency, and strengthening public trust.</p>
<p>Moving to e-government solutions presents specific challenges: How can you verify citizen identity in a digital interaction? How can governments ensure that the right citizens are getting the right services, and prevent fraud? Governments need to ensure they can issue digital and physical credentials, positively verify identities online and in a service center, and authenticate citizen access to services. Credential issuance, credential verification, digital signing, and identity management systems accelerate the potential of eGov service delivery solutions.</p>
<p>How credential issuance and verification help governments achieve their e-gov goals</p>
<p>Credential issuance and verification systems serve as accelerators in maximizing the potential of e-gov solutions. These systems enable governments to issue and verify digital credentials, such as identification documents, licenses, permits, and certifications by eliminating the need for manual verification each step of the way. This expedites service delivery, reduces the administrative burden, and safeguards against fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>These systems also facilitate interoperability and portability of credentials across sectors and jurisdictions. Governments can collaborate with educational institutions, private sector entities, and other government agencies to establish a trusted network for exchanging and verifying credentials. This interoperability enables smooth processes such as licensing, educational certifications, immigration, and cross-border services.</p>
<p>Governments need to provide citizens with convenient and accessible services. E-government solutions enable citizens to submit applications, make payments, and track progress from anywhere at any time. This citizen-centric approach enhances the overall user experience and boosts citizen satisfaction with government services.</p>
<p>Best-in-class e-government solution services should encompass:</p>
 
<p>a. CITIZEN ENROLLMENT AND ONBOARDING</p>
<p>Improve government-to-citizen (G2C) interactions with easy-to-adopt, convenient, and secure digital channels including a web portal and mobile app. Provide strong, vetted identity and document verification.</p>
<p>b. CITIZEN CREDENTIAL ISSUANCE</p>
<p>Issue standard-compliant citizen identities with support for multiple form factors – digital and physical. Realize one unified organizational workflow, one citizen record, and one citizen journey.</p>
<p>c. E-GOV SERVICE DELIVERY</p>
<p>Deliver a secure seamless omnichannel citizen experience. Collect digital signatures from anyone, anywhere and expedite certification processes while increasing overall productivity. Maintain service delivery integrity and mitigate fraud risk with knowledge, possession, and/or biometric factors.</p>
 
<p>Entrust’s new survey <a href="https://www.entrust.com/-/media/documentation/infographics/secure-citizen-interactions-infographic.pdf">infographic</a> reveals citizens are demanding more digital G2C interactions. E-government secures citizen identities, expedites verification processes, and fosters trust and security. Governments embracing e-gov service delivery solutions along with robust credential issuance and verification systems will revolutionize G2C interactions, making them more efficient, inclusive, and responsive to citizen needs.</p>

<p>We are excited to announce the winners of the first-ever invite-only data challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol! We received great feedback when tasked our data science community with the original <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/awarding-winners-of-the-ocean-token-sentiment-analysis-challenge-4011c9354335">sentiment analysis</a> of the OCEAN token challenge, and now are able to share results from the second leg of this frontier.</p><p>To extend the initial excitement, we invited the top 6 submissions to return for an invite-only data challenge to delve deeper into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. This blog will detail findings from the 6-person, invite-only data challenge.</p><p>The goals of this challenge were to dive into data to understand the correlation and causation of the price movement of a particular token based on social media sentiment, engagement, and investor behavior.</p><p>The winners are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>First Place — Mohammad Jamal&nbsp;($2500)</p>  Mohammed pulled statistics from major social media platforms and ran them through correlation calculations and tables to find the best-performing posts, profiles, and users that contribute to media engagement regarding the protocol. One suggestion that stood out through Mohammed’s report was stated that in order to achieve a minimum 10 percent impact on the OCEAN price through social media content, creators should focus on generating content that attracts a larger number of comments.  For the transaction side, Mohammed took 100,000 transactions from 25,000 different token holders and conducted analysis on transaction times, volume, unique wallets, and relation to the length of the given trend at that moment (bearish or bullish). By this, Mohammed was able to conclude there is a lag in the market reaction to users' sentiments and proceeded to build a machine-learning model that reflected the outcomes of each of the mentioned parameters.  <p>Second Place — Matin Nahvi&nbsp;($1500)</p>  Matin broke down public data from Twitter, Github, On chain activity, and Medium blog posts to gather data to be used for this second part analysis. Their data was neatly bundled into daily aggregates, then compared against the daily OCEAN token price shifts. Their choice of navigation tool was The Bayesian Rule List — a model with rule-based predictions for a clear understanding of our path. Matin split the journey, dedicating the initial 80% to training (2019–12–30 to 2022–03–28) and the final 20% to evaluation (2022–03–30 to 2022–10–21).  Matin found more power leveraging Google Trends results to find a correlation between the OCEAN token price and Google trends. This was something that hadn’t been considered in the specifics of this challenge, that we found to be very valuable.  <p>Third Place — Luca Ordronneau ($1000)</p>  Luca took a fundamental approach to sourcing the data by breaking it down into key factors: volume, sentiment, and user influence. The machine learning model made in Luca’s report took these key factors and features into account and ran them through a <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/tabular-learning-gradient-boosting-vs-deep-learning-critical-review-4871c99ee9a2">Tabular Gradient Boosting Model</a> (XGBoost). This deployed hyperparameters tuning and cross-validation to ensure an effective and generalizable model. Through data regression, analysis, and machine learning execution, Luca was able to formulate an Impact Sentiment Score, touching on recommendations for investment behavior, market trend forecasting, risk evaluation, and strategic planning.  <p>We were very pleased to see how invitees identified relevant factors, sourced the appropriate data, conducted a thorough analysis, and presented their findings in a comprehensive report. Their exceptional skills and expertise were tested and compensated for in this exclusive data challenge.</p> Using Data for&nbsp;Insights <p>In this competition, the task was to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. By exploring additional factors and leveraging machine learning techniques, uncovered valuable insights into the complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market.</p><p>A tool to quantify and predict volatility in capital markets based on social media sentiment is a long-term outcome of this initiative. Starting with the OCEAN token, for example, this forefront of sentiment analysis is set to move to a broader spectrum of crypto assets, tokens, and commodities.</p><p>Both live and expired Ocean Data Challenges can be found here: <a href="https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a">https://desights.ai/o/0x8264CE39F7532871868053198fCDC2E2C81d074a</a></p> What was the&nbsp;task? <p>Participants invited to the second leg of the OCEAN token sentiment challenge competed for a $5000 prize pool, and were tasked with the following:</p>  Identifying three key factors that could potentially influence the price of the OCEAN token, considering social media engagement.  Provide a detailed description of the data sources you would consider for each identified factor. Be specific about the datasets, APIs, or platforms you would utilize to obtain the necessary data for your analysis.  Design a methodology to measure and analyze the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN token. Explain how you would collect and preprocess data to conduct sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter or any other relevant social media platform.  In addition to social media sentiment, outline their approach for exploring the impact of the external factors you identified in question 1. Describe necessary data transformations, calculations, or statistical techniques you would employ to analyze the relationships between these factors and the OCEAN token&nbsp;price.  Develop a machine learning model that can provide insights into the relationship between social media engagement and the price of the OCEAN&nbsp;token.  Describe the ML model you chose and explain why it suited this task. Outline the steps involved in training, evaluating, and interpreting the model’s predictions. Include details such as the choice of algorithms, feature engineering techniques, model training methodology, and any considerations for handling potential challenges, such as data imbalance or overfitting. Explain how the ML model contributed to your analysis and supported your findings in the&nbsp;report.  <p>This was the first token sentiment analysis and invitation-only challenge hosted by Ocean Protocol. Future data-driven social media data challenges can be expected for other prominent Crypto and DeFi Protocols.</p><p>Do you think your project could benefit from social media sentiment analysis?
