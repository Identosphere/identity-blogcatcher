Photo by Shikoh Gitau/&nbsp;Qhala How Jumia and Facebook are competing, even though they’re playing different games <p>Jezabel sells makeup, and is evaluating a new display shelf where her product would be at eye level with passing shoppers. That visibility could lead to new customers, but she’s not convinced it’s worth the trouble, because almost all of her customers currently find her on Instagram. And actually, that shelf isn’t even in her store — it’s in the front of a retail locker space where she rents a container in the back to hold her inventory. Jezabel keeps some of her most popular products on hand here so that customers can easily drop by and see the merchandise, but otherwise she runs a completely virtual, just-in-time business. And paying for a physical footprint, even if it’s only a few square feet of shelf space, might not give her the return she needs on scarce&nbsp;capital.</p><p>Jezabel is among millions of entrepreneurs in sub-Saharan Africa taking advantage of popular digital tools to transform their business. Formal marketplaces such as Jumia or Takealot have successfully established a traditional model of e-commerce, while new platforms from Paystack, Flutterwave, and others provide the underlying tools for independent sellers. Despite these formal offerings, the vast majority of digitally connected small businesses are using Facebook, WhatsApp, and other consumer platforms to fulfill an increasing number of commercial use cases. This “social commerce” is often heralded as a leveler of the playing field, as even the smallest businesses can typically use social platforms for a low&nbsp;cost.</p><p>To help make sense of this mix of formal and informal, of purpose-built and appropriated, I developed a framework for comparing the range of digital solutions available to today’s entrepreneurs. For those with a commercial interest in this sector, the framework offers a lens for understanding how different solutions solve distinct parts of the value chain, and what this means for the likely addressable market of each solution. For policymakers and those interested in inclusive economic growth, the analysis highlights the implications of fundamentally different operational structures between formal ecommerce and social platforms, and why we should worry about how previously informal economic activity becomes formalized.</p> From analog to&nbsp;digital <p>Small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa looking to sell online have multiple options to consider; which I’ve simplified here into four categories.[<a>1</a>] These are by no means mutually exclusive, but for clarity I have separated them in the analysis.</p><p>Social commerce<br>The most accessible and likely approach for most small businesses is to use those consumer products that are already familiar and ubiquitous, especially Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and Instagram. Entrepreneurs can create a page on Facebook and/or Instagram, post photos or videos of products, communicate with prospective customers, respond to customer reviews, and use built-in advertising tools to boost her page or specific product&nbsp;posts.</p><p>E-commerce marketplaces<br>Businesses may also sell on formal marketplaces such as <a href="https://group.jumia.com/">Jumia</a>, <a href="https://www.kilimall.co.ke/new/">Kilimall</a>, or <a href="https://www.konga.com/">Konga</a>. These online marketplaces aggregate supply and demand into a single platform, providing sellers with immediate access to a large audience — for a price. Like Amazon, they offer sales support with payment processing, fulfillment, and delivery, as well as back office business tools such as inventory management and analytics; typically they charge a commission on&nbsp;sales.</p><p>Standalone domains<br>More digitally savvy businesses might go a step further and publish their own standalone website using one of a growing number of e-commerce tools, such as <a href="https://paystack.com/commerce">Paystack Commerce</a> or <a href="https://flutterwave.com/us/store">Flutterwave Store</a>, two new solutions from Nigerian fintechs that combine payment processing and back office functions with a website builder into a single platform (essentially, Shopify for&nbsp;Africa).</p><p>B2B sourcing<br>And another option for FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) retailers are B2B platforms that connect businesses with suppliers and financing, such as <a href="https://www.tradedepot.co/">Trade Depot</a> in Nigeria or <a href="https://sokowatch.com/">Sokowatch</a> in East Africa, both of which aggregate demand from retailers to provide discounted wholesale pricing and deliver consumer products to the retailer.</p> The retail value&nbsp;chain <p>To understand how these digital solutions are reshaping retail in sub-Saharan Africa, it’s helpful to examine the business functions that each solves for. Retail businesses like Jezabel’s have a relatively straightforward value chain: retailers buy goods from upstream suppliers (inbound logistics), manage inventory and resources (operations), engage with customers (marketing), and, when they’re lucky, make sales and deliver product (sales/outbound logistics). Looking at each category of the value chain in turn, we can summarize the benefits different digital solutions provide to offline businesses looking to digitize.</p><p>Figure 1. Where different digitization solutions impact the retail value&nbsp;chain</p><p>Inbound logistics<br>The B2B marketplaces or supply chain solutions that service this part of the value chain are primarily trying to secure better pricing for retailers by aggregating demand. For example, Sokowatch in East Africa promises not only lower pricing but also financing and complete last-mile delivery to its retailers. These solutions are currently limited to FMCG, where high sales volume and commodity products make it easier to aggregate orders.</p><p>Operations<br>All of the e-commerce marketplaces provide warehousing services to eliminate the need for physical storage facilities. This is especially convenient if the retailer also pays the platform to handle fulfillment and delivery, but these services eat into margins, and many smaller businesses prefer to handle warehousing and fulfillment themselves. Businesses that sell on a marketplace are often also selling directly to customers via physical shops or social media, so the platform’s inventory tracking systems will only cover a portion of their business, reducing its&nbsp;utility.</p><p>Marketing<br>This is where digital options far outperform anything offline. A small retailer with no online presence can only market to those prospects who pass in physical proximity of the shop. Although advertising costs are low, the maximum size of the funnel is limited. But once the business starts marketing online, they can easily increase the reach of their advertising by many orders of magnitude. This is especially true of social media, where the smallest entrepreneur can put up a Facebook page and start bootstrapping eyeballs via their personal networks before transitioning to paid ad spend to “boost” their page or&nbsp;posts.</p><p>Marketplace platforms also offer substantial reach given the installed base of customers who use the site, and sellers pay to promote their products higher in the search or browsing results. One could argue that advertising dollars spent on an e-commerce platform should outperform those on social media, as customers on the former are more likely to be closer to a purchase decision, i.e. deeper in the sales funnel. But marketplace platforms can be brutally competitive for many product categories, and the structure of the market doesn’t allow for much retailer branding or other differentiation. You live and die by the transaction, with little opportunity to build a brand and a following — which is exactly what social media excel&nbsp;at.</p><p>Because standalone domains exist on the open web, they rely on driving traffic from other sources — search and social — to the domain, and therefore don’t benefit from any installed base of&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>Sales/ Outbound logistics<br>One of the bigger service offerings from both the marketplace platforms and the independent domain platforms, like Paystack Commerce, is the ability to process different kinds of payments. For some product categories and businesses this is important, but the majority of e-commerce payments in sub-Saharan Africa are still COD (cash-on-delivery).<a>[2]</a> And in markets where mobile money is popular, buyers can make non-cash payments (pre- or post-delivery) directly into mobile money wallets. So the payment processing function is most valuable only for customers who are willing to pay upfront and want to pay with a card or bank transfer.</p><p>Last-mile delivery to the customer is infamously challenging in most markets, and one of the key services that marketplace platforms offer to their sellers. But typically the delivery price is passed on to the buyer, not built into the product price. Many businesses work with local couriers or contract with new logistics platforms like Sendy in East Africa; many retailers let the customer choose a preferred logistics provider. Because most small retailers have less expensive options for delivery, paying the marketplace to handle delivery only makes sense if the retailer has sufficient volume such that the overhead of managing independent deliveries outweighs the cost&nbsp;savings.</p> Follow me for top-line&nbsp;growth <p>One helpful way to think about how each solution solves a different business function is to categorize it as impacting either (a) top-line growth or (b) bottom-line profitability. The latter category includes solutions that streamline procurement; process payments; digitize inventory management; or provide warehousing, fulfillment, and delivery services. Efficiencies in any of these can lower a retailer’s operational costs, but these will be incremental gains, especially for the smallest retailers.</p><p>On the other hand, digital advertising channels enable entrepreneurs to grow their business by reaching many more customers than they would otherwise. Social media platforms in particular allow businesses to substantially and cost-effectively increase their potential customer base, thereby scaling top-line growth and&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>In the language of unit economics, this is about very large reductions in CAC (customer acquisition costs) vs. incremental improvements to COGS (cost of goods sold). Obviously both are crucial metrics to a business, but have different implications at different stages of business maturity. For any business, reducing COGS and thereby improving margins, by say 10% can easily be the difference between break-even and profitability. But for the smallest businesses, where sales numbers are low, improving margins by 10% may not actually translate into anything meaningful in terms of absolute value.<a>[3]</a> On the other hand, if a small business can double or triple sales at a lower CAC, that revenue opens up all kinds of opportunities for staffing up or expanding the business in different ways.</p><p>Using the framing of the value chain analysis above, here’s a simple 2x2 illustrating which types of businesses are most likely to benefit from each type of digital solution. In addition to the maturity or size dimension, which as described above is a primary factor in determining the relative value of increasing reach and top-line sales vs. operational efficiencies, it plots average sales price on the other axis to serve as a proxy for the types of products and income level of the customers buying&nbsp;them.</p><p>Figure 2. The sweet spot for each type of&nbsp;solution</p><p>Social commerce occupies the lower left because it’s essentially free to use (minus paid advertising) and provides the best opportunity for growing the customer base with a lower CAC, the two most important factors for the smallest businesses. Social commerce likely has a ceiling in terms of average sale price, partly because of trust (i.e., consumers tend to place more trust in retailers on formal marketplace platforms, which may have buyer protection programs), but also as a function of how prospective buyers are most likely to search for and purchase products: Higher-income consumers are more likely to use a laptop and web-based search engines to find products, making them more likely to shop from marketplaces and standalone website domains. Lower-income consumers are more likely to only have a mobile device and spend more time within the confines of social media feeds, where social commerce&nbsp;reigns.</p><p>Ecommerce platforms like Jumia and Konga are used as sales channels by all kinds of businesses, but are most helpful to those that have grown to have multiple employees and higher sales volumes, where the operational and logistics services the platforms offer will have a greater impact on efficiency and overall profitability. Because of the additional formality and high transaction fees — Jumia sellers pay a sales commission of 10%-20% depending on the product category — vendors are less likely to focus on really low-value items, keeping the average sales prices higher than what you see with social media businesses.</p><p>Standalone domains supported by e-commerce platforms like Paystack Commerce are most appropriate for the largest businesses with the highest average sales price. Such firms already have established customer bases and are looking to control more of their brand without giving up margin to a marketplace. Because they exist on the open web, they have to drive traffic from search and social, which typically means a higher CAC and thus requires higher average sales&nbsp;prices.</p><p>Finally, B2B sourcing platforms have a hard ceiling on average sale price given that (at least in current incarnations) they are limited to FMCG and other high-volume, commodity products. The economics of bulk ordering and delivery costs mean that smaller shops with lower turnover are less likely to enroll given the expected cost benefits.</p> The future will be formalized <p>A natural question to ask is to what extent online commercial activity will migrate away from the social commerce model and toward the more formal paradigms of e-commerce marketplaces and standalone domains that are dominant in the West. I would argue that while the business logic that has the vast majority of African businesses choosing informal activity on social platforms won’t change anytime soon, those social platforms will increasingly push that economic activity into more structured and legible&nbsp;forms.</p><p>For the most part, social commerce businesses are appropriating tools designed for personal communication to use for business purposes; as such, the platforms don’t have good ways of knowing about these transactions being coordinated through their ecosystem. WhatsApp Pay and the new Facebook Shops are obvious steps toward improving the platforms’ visibility into commercial activity, and much more will come. The goal isn’t necessarily to compete head-to-head with e-commerce platforms with a fully integrated offering, but to capture enough of the activity to develop a completely new purchase behavior dataset that can be monetized via their ad engines.<a>[4]</a> Imagine advertisers being able to target their ads on Facebook to those users who have “purchased a health and wellness product for $10-$20 within the last 30 days from a seller with 5,000–25,000 followers.”</p><p>The result will be an asymmetric, top-down vs. bottom-up competition between the formal marketplaces and social media: Formal marketplaces will try to broaden their value proposition to reach lower to the smallest-scale businesses and spin the network effects flywheel, while social media will attempt to formalize its offerings, not to compete directly as a solution provider, but to develop one of the most comprehensive and valuable datasets on consumer economic activity.</p><p>The competition is asymmetric in that the two platform types have fundamentally different business models. Social media platforms, and for all intents and purposes this means Facebook, are ad-based; they make activity free in order to accumulate eyeball-hours. The marketplaces rely on the transactional revenue of the commissions they charge sellers on each sale. Put another way, the marketplaces have to make the unit economics work for each transaction on the platform, which Jumia has estimated to require something like a 10%-20% margin, a significant cost that is prohibitive to many smaller retailers.[<a>5</a>] Facebook, on the other hand, can afford to offer (a more limited set of) services for free because the resulting activity will substantially increase the value of its ad inventory. That data and resulting value may take a while to accumulate, but as <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-land-where-facebook-loses-money-d850c6593f70">I’ve argued previously</a>, Facebook can use its tremendous cash reserves from its high-ARPU user base in the West to cross-subsidize unprofitable initiatives in the Global South for as long as it needs. In any war of attrition, Facebook doesn’t&nbsp;lose.</p><p>This disconnect between Facebook’s revenue model and its consumer-facing services presents challenges not only for regulation (e.g., antitrust policy based on consumer welfare in the form of pricing), but also assessments of its net benefit to the resource-constrained populations who rely on it. As with Free Basics, its subsidized internet access initiative, Facebook’s commerce offerings provide very real value to millions of individuals with few truly affordable alternatives. Yet the long-term implications of allowing it to continue to envelop and become the de facto provider of adjacent sectors of the digital economy are&nbsp;immense.</p><p>In the context of social commerce, that risk may be under-appreciated, given that most of the commercial activity moving onto the platform was informal and unreported to begin with. The sheer size of the informal sector — an estimated <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_627189/lang--en/index.htm">86% of employment in Africa</a> — makes it a key focus for governments grappling with economic growth policies. And digitized network technology is key in state efforts to make legible the invisible, as large-scale identification and currency initiatives have shown. Yet as more informal trade moves onto and is structured by social media, we may face a future in which the most complete and accurate source of informal economic activity is held not in Abuja, Nairobi, or Pretoria, but in Menlo Park. The future of trade may indeed be formalized, but by a platform logic with a distinctly private&nbsp;agenda.</p><p>The unique market conditions of sub-Saharan Afrian mean the dominant model of digital commerce that emerges won’t look like digital commerce in Southeast Asia, China, or the West. Savvy and ambitious entrepreneurs like Jezabel will continue to cobble together the services they need to grow their businesses digitally, but widespread adoption will require solutions that are accessible and affordable to a broader base of sellers. For the vast majority of these micro businesses and solo entrepreneurs, the driver of value is the ability to cost-effectively increase their reach to a wider market of customers. And if this is indeed the race, it is Facebook’s to&nbsp;lose.</p><p>Thanks for input and suggestions from Sammy Muraya (<a href="https://smkollectionz.com/">SM Kollectionz</a>), Winnie Makena (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nairobiluggagecentre/">EGD Luggage Center</a>), Sabina Naamwinbong (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/glammy_accessories/?igshid=9tca1b9naxgk">Glammy Accessories</a>), Bode Oyelami (<a href="https://www.konga.com/merchant/hekmore-systems-ventures">Hekmore Systems</a>), Mavis Dzedu (<a href="https://www.jumia.com.gh/hotfro/">Hotfro</a>), Annabel Schiff, Grace Natabaalo, Stephen Deng, and Jonathan&nbsp;Donner.</p> Notes <p>[1] A note on scope: Many other models of digitally-enabled commerce exist, especially in China and Southeast Asia, where platforms like Pinduoduo and Go-Jek have successfully proven different operational models. While there are <a href="https://theflip.africa/newsletter/pinduoduo-social-commerce/">arguments</a> for why group purchasing, influencer-based revenue models, and other “social” practices may gain traction in sub-Saharan Africa, these are currently not widespread and thus not covered here. For simplicity, I also exclude classifieds marketplaces (e.g., <a href="https://jiji.co.ke/">Jiji/OLX</a>), which are lower-cost for the retailer but don’t offer the same range of services as formal e-commerce marketplaces.</p><p>[2] Jumia reports 65% to 95% of orders are COD; social commerce orders are even more likely to be cash <a href="https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/">https://newsroom.mastercard.com/mea/press-releases/delivering-cashless-e-commerce-in-africa/</a>.</p><p>[3] This is especially true for solo entrepreneurs, where the nature of the hustle makes it difficult to accurately account for time/labor costs. Yes, opportunity costs are real, but for the smallest shops an inefficient process that takes 50% longer but is free will win out over paid services that automate or streamline the task. The cost calculations change once the business is large enough for paid&nbsp;labor.</p><p>[4] Facebook already buys purchase behavior data (including offline) from external data aggregators in order to inform its user profiling, but this would be first-party data of transactions on its platform and concretely tied to the individual’s account, so infinitely more valuable.</p><p>[5] For reference, Amazon says it averages 8%-15%; <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees">https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html#referral-fees</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-race-to-digitize-commerce-in-sub-saharan-africa-252b2f977c86">The race to digitize commerce in sub-Saharan Africa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at SDK 2.0.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 1: Unlock Intelligent Access 

<p><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access</a> combines Intelligent Authentication (or authentication trees) capabilities that our customers appreciate with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/self-service">Intelligent Self-Service</a> (self-service trees). Intelligent Access includes new journeys for user registration, password reset, and progressive profiling – to name just a few advanced features. With this new release, our SDKs now support Intelligent Access, effectively doubling the number of supported use cases. Now, developers using SDKs can save time and integrate authentication, registration, and self-service journeys into their apps faster than ever before.</p>

 Reason 2: Access Device Context 

  <p>ForgeRock SDKs can collect contextual information from devices (or browsers) and seamlessly integrate with the new <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/authentication-guide/auth-node-configuration-hints.html#auth-node-device-profile-collector">Device Profile Nodes</a> of the ForgeRock IAM Platform. Device context can be used to build sophisticated authentication journeys and detect anomalies such as deviations in previously trusted devices, geo-fence breaches, access from tampered devices, and more. By using the SDKs, you can start building better authentication journeys with device context in no time.</p>

 Reason 3: Exceptional User Experiences With Usernameless and Passwordless Authentication 

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Say goodbye to usernames and passwords with <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/passwordless-authentication">ForgeRock Go</a> while providing great user experiences without compromising security. Our JavaScript SDK now supports FIDO2-based strong authentication with WebAuthn. This enables you to build this secure and seamless login experience into your single-page apps (SPAs) with ease. Our SDK can help you go passwordless faster.</p>

 Reason 4: Improve Application Security 

<p>Our SDKs do more than just simplify the integration with the ForgeRock IAM Platform. They have native capabilities to improve application security by implementing industry best practices and adopting the latest technologies in the iOS and Android ecosystem. Starting with this release, the ForgeRock iOS SDK uses Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web">Secure Enclave</a> for hardware-backed encryption and storage of tokens. When you use our SDKs, you can be sure that credentials are in good hands.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 5: Simplify the User Experience With In-App Authenticator 

<p>Using one time passwords generated by soft tokens or push notification based approvals are great ways to improve security by introducing a second factor in the authentication flow. Traditionally however this approach comes at the cost of user experience. End users are forced to download and use a dedicated Authenticator app which introduces a lot of friction in the user experience. With the latest version of the SDK, you can now <a href="https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/SDKS/Authenticator+SDK+-+Design+Document">embed these capabilities</a> into your own mobile apps and provide your users a superior, branded and seamless authentication experience.&nbsp;</p>

 Reason 6: Secure High-Value Transactions 

<p>Great experiences and proper security during login are paramount, but your customers have come to expect, and are also looking for, that same level of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security </a>during each and every transaction. That’s why they need a Zero Trust model or Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment (CARTA). With ForgeRock SDKs you can improve security by requiring the user to perform additional verifications when engaging in a high-risk transaction or while performing an action that deviates from their normal behavior. For example, they must reauthenticate by using a second factor or respond to a push notification on their mobile device.</p>

<p>Too many companies think of privacy as a feature that can be added later. And while, yes, it is true these features can always be enhanced and evolve, when it isn’t baked into your product, it will never be the default. Privacy by Design is an approach to make sure that it is.<br></p>



<p>Originally developed by <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/pbdce/about/ann-cavoukian/">Dr. Ann Cavoukian</a>, Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, the concept of Privacy by Design was formalized in a report on privacy-enhancing technologies in 1995. Having privacy incorporated by design, and by default, means that the product or solution is designed with privacy as a priority—not an afterthought—and that becomes integral to organizational priorities, development objectives, and design processes.<br></p>



<p>Dr. Cavoukian’s main thesis was that the future of security can not and could not be assured with compliance to regulatory frameworks, but that “privacy assurance must ideally become an organization’s default mode of operation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



 The 7 Foundational Principles&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy by Design (PbD)</a> has seven key principles. This is not a pick or choose, each element is as important as the next.<br></p>



 1. Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial 



<p>When building any product, service, or tool, companies should anticipate any and all of the ways that privacy breaches could happen before they happen. That means that PbD focuses on prevention rather than resolution. It comes before the fact, not after. This significantly reduces the potential exposure to risk associated with data breaches and also that less data is exposed in the case of a breach.<br></p>



 2. Privacy as the Default Setting 



<p>The burden never falls to the customer or user. That means that no additional steps need to be taken for them to protect their own personal data, the protection is built into the system by default. They don’t need to worry about taking extra steps because they are automatically protected.<br></p>



 3. Privacy Embedded into Design 



<p>It becomes an essential component of the core functionality being delivered. That means the privacy embedded in your product, tool, or service is integral to the system without diminishing functionality.<br></p>



 4. Full Functionality – Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum 



<p>There are no trade-offs in PbD. That means it is never privacy or security as if it’s not possible to have both. It also means that having both doesn’t mean that it comes at a cost to the overall functionality.&nbsp;<br></p>



 5. End-to-End Security – Full Lifecycle Protection&nbsp; 



<p>PbD means security, security, security. From start to finish, all data is securely collected, safely stored, and properly destroyed.&nbsp;</p>



 6. Visibility and Transparency in Privacy – Keep it Open&nbsp; 



<p>Accountability, openness, and compliance are required for an effective and secure system. Adding transparency to the where, how, and why of data collection and processing actually improves the overall system. This breeds confidence amongst all stakeholders that the company is following all promised procedures and keeps companies accountable.&nbsp;<br></p>



 7. Respect for User Privacy – Keep it User-Centric 



<p>Above all, the individual’s data-security should be the number one concern. People are rightly worried about their data ending up in the wrong hands. It should always be clear to them what personal information is being collected, for what purpose, and how long it will be stored. Keep their needs top of mind.</p>



<blockquote><p>Did you know?&nbsp;</p>The EU GDPR incorporates Privacy by Design. Companies who follow these principles have a far lower risk of exposure to GDPR violations and associated fines.&nbsp;</blockquote>

   Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;

<p>Have you ever had a notification about a suspicious login attempt from a digital destination you’ve never been to? Hopefully it came with the option to say it wasn’t you, allowing you to deny access to that specific place and rebuff the user trying to sneak into your account or information. If so, you probably have token revocation to thank for the security measure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Token revocation means a token is no longer able to be used for access to a protected digital place, and it’s often behind the scenes in the denying process. It’s similar to session revocation in that you’re blocking access at some level, but there’s a key difference. With session revocation, you can deny one or more sessions and still access protected information. But token revocation is more permanent because it “kills” the token that might otherwise be reused for the duration of the token’s lifetime.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokens play a big role in OAuth 2.0, which is designed to protect resources from wandering or malicious hands by using tokens to securely authorize users. You could build your own method of verifying access tokens and get a decent way there with open source packages, but a ready-made solution—token introspection—is easy to use and gives you the ability to offload the work from the app team to the identity platform’s team. PingOne for Customers handles the messy job of building a token verification system by giving you an API endpoint that does the work for you on our backend. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through how to use token revocation in PingOne for Customers.</p>

<p>These new expectations mean that a balance between traditional leadership traits such as strategic thinking, vision and risk taking (often perceived as “masculine”) and traits such as collaboration, coaching and team building (often perceived as “feminine”) is now highly desirable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Resist the tendency to prove your technical skills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Women should be at an advantage in the new business environment, yet only 11% of CIOs are women. Corporate culture is slow to change, especially in a male-dominated C-suite.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Women CIOs are often the first female C-level executive beyond the chief human resources officer, and they do face unique challenges,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/16733/Deb-Curtis"> Deb Curtis</a>, VP Analyst at Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In addition to wearing the CIO hat, they must be prepared to carry the torch for advancing<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/diversity-and-inclusion-build-high-performance-teams/"> diversity</a> efforts to influence corporate culture, as well as fulfill the long-standing role model vacancy for other women in tech,” she says.</p>

 How women in technology build trust 
<p>Women in technology can prepare for success by demonstrating both traditional leadership skills and high emotional intelligence. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-steps-to-become-an-effective-digital-leader/">Digital CIOs</a> can delegate day-to-day IT operations to their leadership teams and focus instead on building trust and strong business partnerships.</p>
<p>“I’ve had multiple female CIOs as bosses,” says the male successor to the female CIO of a government agency. “They’ve each been inspirational, empowering, approachable and empathetic. They’ve also consistently been tough as nails, with high expectations for me. That balance of traits helped me grow as a leader, especially in terms of my emotional intelligence to establish relationships and network with peers.”</p>
 Remember: Your experience qualified you 
<p>First-time women CIOs often feel pressure to return to school for additional technical training to prove their worth to C-suite peers.</p>
<p>“You’ve been hired for your strategic thinking and business vision, so resist the tendency to prove your technical skills,” Curtis says. “Instead, count on your staff to have the answers.”</p>

 Gain support from a male colleague 
<p>Senior women in technology often view their hiring as a big win for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-steps-sustainable-diversity-inclusion-strategies/">workplace diversity and inclusion</a>. They assume the C-suite wanted a fresh perspective, but the same peers who interviewed them later complain that they’re “pushing changes too hard,” faster than they are ready to accept.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To accelerate your transition to CIO, you may need an ally</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“From our client interactions, we conclude that many senior male executives are unprepared to embrace working with a female CIO as a peer,” says Curtis. “To accelerate your transition to CIO, you may need an ally.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask a male colleague from the hiring committee to play an active role and visibly support your leadership, diverse perspectives and alternative ideas, beyond reinforcing your qualifications and experience, especially in executive meetings and interactions.</p>
<p>Visible and proactive support from a male colleague can help you to chart the interpersonal dynamics of a predominantly male C-suite and ensure long-term cultural fit.</p>

 Guide behavioral change at the top 
<p>Although diversity is embraced in the hiring of a female CIO, the same behavioral traits that contributed to their selection often trigger resistance from C-level male colleagues in day-to-day interactions. Any outspokenness, questioning and risk taking, seen initially as desirable, may be later perceived as offensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When hitting roadblocks in interactions with C-suite peers, it can be helpful to remind your male peers of the reasons you were hired.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, pick your battles</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take time to learn the history, culture, business and C-suite peer personalities in the company and use what you learn to<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-create-a-powerful-organizational-change-management-storyline/"> drive behavioral change</a>, starting in the executive ranks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, pick your battles. Although progress may seem slow, behavior changes at the C-suite level set the tone at the top and will accelerate change down through the organization. Support and encourage male C-suite peers to build on the first step they’ve taken by hiring you.</p>

  <p>Running REST APIs with AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway has recently become a very popular option. Although AWS provides its own mechanisms to add an authentication and authorization layer to these APIs, you may want to use your Okta centralized user database and credentials instead.</p>

<p>Today we’ll talk about how you can use Okta as the authentication and authorization layer of your REST API hosted in AWS Lambda, validating Okta access tokens using a Lambda authorizer function implemented in PHP.</p>

 About Lambda authorizers 

<p>Lambda authorizers are the method provided by AWS API Gateway to manage authorization and authentication features. They are independent AWS Lambda methods that are called by the AWS API Gateway in order to validate the provided credentials and provide information about the authorized access level. Like other AWS Lambda methods, Authorizers can be implemented in any language and are run in a limited, managed environment.</p>

<p>This is the workflow of an API call when using an AWS Lambda authorizer:</p>

 
   The client calls a method on an API Gateway API method, passing a bearer token or request parameters. 
   The API Gateway checks whether a Lambda authorizer is configured for the called method. If it is, API Gateway calls the corresponding authorizer Lambda function. 
   The authorizer Lambda function checks the provided token or parameters and determines if the requested API action will be authorized or not (just by analyzing the provided token, or by calling external services). 
   If the API action must be authorized, the Lambda function grants access by returning an output object containing at least an IAM policy object and a principal identifier. 
   The API Gateway evaluates the returned policy object. If access is denied, the API Gateway returns a suitable HTTP error status code—such as a 403 error. If access is allowed, the API Gateway executes the method. 
 

<p>You can add authentication and authorization to your API methods without using a Lambda authorizer, buta Lambda authorizer will allow you to separate and centralize responsibilities in your code. This way, if you ever introduce a change in your auth methods, you’ll only have to change and re-deploy the Lambda authorizer.</p>

<p>Additionally, using a Lambda authorizer will allow the API Gateway to cache the auth result for an hour. This cache will be used by any subsequent API call from the same user. This could represent significant savings both in time and money, especially if the implemented Lambda authorizer launches external calls.</p>

 Interface of Lambda authorizers 

<p>All Lambda authorizers must be implemented so they receive a defined data structure from the AWS API Gateway. This structure depends on the configured type of Lambda authorizer. There are two possible types: token-based and request-based.</p>

 
   Token-based Lambda authorizers (also known as a <code>TOKEN</code> authorizers) receive the caller’s identity as provided in a bearer token, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT) or an OAuth token. It also receives the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) corresponding to the called API method. 
 

   <code>{
    "type":"TOKEN",
    "authorizationToken":"{caller-supplied-token}",
"methodArn":"arn:aws:execute-api:{regionId}:{accountId}:{apiId}/{stage}/{httpVerb}/[{resource}/[{child-resources}]]"
}
</code>   

 
   Request-parameter-based Lambda authorizers (also known as <code>REQUEST</code> authorizers) receive the caller’s identity through a combination of headers, query string parameters, and stage and context variables. 
 

<p>After deciding the result of an auth request, the Lambda authorizer method must return an object with the following structure:</p>
   <code>{
    "principalId": "{uniqueUserId}",
    "policyDocument": {
   	 "Version": "2012-10-17",
   	 "Statement": [
   		 {
   			 "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
   			 "Effect": "Allow",
   			 "Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:{regionId}:{accountId}:{apiId}/{stage}/{httpVerb}/[{resource}/[{child-resources}]]"
        }
   	 ]
    },
    "context": {
   	 "custom": "1",
   	 "data": ["custom", "example", "data"],
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Where:</p>

 
   principalId will be a unique identifier for the user (as the user ID, a unique user name, or a unique email address). 
   policyDocument is an IAM policy document describing the action that we are allowing or disallowing. It includes:
     
       Version: must be <code>2012-10-17</code>. 
       Statement: an object including:
         
           Action: What we are allowing or disallowing. In our case, it will be <code>execute-api:Invoke</code>. 
           Effect: This field specifies if the user will be authorized or not to carry out the intended action. 
           Resource:  The resource for which we want to allow or deny this action 
         
       
     
   
 

<p>In our example, we’ll focus on building a token-based authorizer that receives a JWT token in order to allow or deny access.</p>

 Generating JWT tokens with client credentials in Okta 

<p>In this example, we’ll use an app with client credentials to keep things simple. You may follow these steps.</p>

 
   If you still don’t have one, create your free developer account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com">developer.okta.com</a>. 
   Create a new application of type Service. 
   Click on API -&gt; Authorization Servers and then click the Scopes tab. 
   Add a new scope called <code>demo</code> 
 

<p>Now, to obtain a JWT token you can call Okta’s token endpoint, giving it the application’s client ID and client secret.</p>

   <code>curl -X POST 'https://&lt;Client-ID&gt;:&lt;Client-secret&gt;@&lt;your-okta-server&gt;/oauth2/default/v1/token' -d grant_type=client_credentials -d scope=demo
</code>   

<p>This will return a JSON structure including a valid access token generated by Okta that we’ll be able to use when accessing our protected API.</p>

   <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJraWQiOiJQTnk1OGR(...)e6z-UOv4pGUnbIAMAHxmVsb2h4PXpblaH4",
  "scope": "demo"
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>access_token</code> field is the one we’ll use as a Bearer token in our requests to the API.</p>

<p>In a production environment, you’ll want to use an OAuth 2.0 flow to retrieve a token. I thoroughly recommend this great <a>Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a> and all the other articles it references.</p>

 Prevent API slowness—Keep things local 

<p>It’s very important that we keep the Lambda authorizer quick, as it will be called in every API request. Because of this, our Lambda authorizer should do only local JWT validation.</p>

<p>If we call out to Okta’s token introspection, we add an additional network request to every authorization call. This is not a good idea, especially when gateway requests need to pass through very quickly, and Lambda limits the amount of time that functions can run.</p>

<p>Local JWT validation should be more than enough, as the generated JWT tokens are signed. We just need the Authorizer function to keep a local updated copy of the public part of the key used to generate the signature.</p>

 How to write a Lambda authorizer function in PHP 

<p>Now that we know the inputs our Lambda authorizer function must process and the outputs it must generate, let’s get it done.</p>

 Prepare PHP runtime environment 

<p>For the first step, we’ll need to circumvent a little problem: at the time I’m writing this article (September 2020), PHP is not one of the languages AWS Lambda supports out of the box. Because of this, we’ll have to prepare the PHP runtime environment, including the PHP binary that will run inside Lambda’s containers, and its related libraries and extensions. The easiest way to do this is to compile it on the same platform as Lambda, so we’ll use EC2 for this.</p>

<p>In the Amazon EC2 console, choose Launch instance.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, when choosing an AMI, you must use the same image that is currently being used by the Lambda Execution Environment (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html</a>).</p>

<p>While writing this article, AWS Lambdas can be configured to use a runtime based on Amazon Linux or a runtime based on Amazon Linux 2. Unfortunately, the Amazon Linux 2 runtime is a custom runtime that is not based on any available AMI image.</p>

<p>In order to avoid problems and build a PHP environment compatible with the Lambda runtime, we need to use the image that is available as an AMI image.  When writing this article, this was the Amazon Linux-based AMI image <code>amzn-ami-hvm-2018.03.0.20181129-x86_64-gp2</code>.</p>

<p>You won’t find this image in the default Quick Start list that appears immediately when launching a new instance. Copy the image name and paste it into the search box. You’ll find it as a community AMI.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Launch the EC2 instance and connect to it.</p>

<p>Now we’ll compile the last version of PHP. In order to do that:</p>

 
   Update packages and install needed compilation dependencies 
 

   <code>sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install autoconf bison gcc gcc-c++ libcurl-devel libxml2-devel git openssl-devel -y
</code>   

 
   Then, we need to download the latest stable version of PHP. At the time of writing, it was 7.4.10. 
 

   <code>mkdir ~/php-7-bin
curl -sL https://www.php.net/distributions/php-7.4.10.tar.bz2 | tar -xvj
cd php-7.4.10
</code>   

 
   Let’s compile PHP with OpenSSL and libcurl support and install to <code>/home/ec2-user/php-7-bin</code> 
 

   <code>./buildconf --force
./configure --prefix=/home/ec2-user/php-7-bin/ --with-openssl --with-curl --with-zlib --without-sqlite3 --without-pdo-sqlite
make install
</code>   

<p>Here, we are disabling SQLite3 extension compilation, as SQLite3 development library is not installed by default in the selected AMI image. Depending on the requirements of your PHP Lambda functions, you may have to customize the <code>./configure</code> line to add extra libraries. <code>./configure --help</code> will give you a full list of parameters.</p>

<p>Once these commands are completed, please run <code>~/php-7-bin/bin/php -v</code> to verify everything has worked correctly. The runtime environment will be ready if you should see a message similar to this one:</p>

   <code>PHP 7.4.10 (cli) (built: Sep 10 2020 23:14:12) ( NTS )
Copyright (c) The PHP Group
Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
</code>   
 Validating Okta JWT access tokens in a Lambda function 

<p>Now, let’s start building our PHP authorizer. We’ll create a working folder to make the needed infrastructure. In order to do this, download the project from GitHub, and copy the generated PHP runtime into it:</p>

   <code>cd ~
git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/php-jwt-okta-lambda-auth-validator.git
cd php-jwt-okta-lambda-auth-validator
cp ~/php-7-bin/bin/php ./bin
</code>   

<p>Now we’ll install composer, and use it to retrieve the PHP libraries that our <code>bootstrap</code> file uses to call the authorizer and other libraries related to the management of JWT tokens.</p>

   <code>curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | ./bin/php
bin/php composer.phar install
</code>   

<p>After this, you should just configure your settings in the <code>classes/Config.php</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

namespace OktaLambdaAuth;

class Config {

    // Define here your Okta server hostname, like 'dev-XXXXX.okta.com' or 
    // 'xxxxx.okta-emea.com'
    const OKTA_SERVER_HOSTNAME = 'dev-XXXXX.okta.com';

}
</code>   

<p>Let’s examine the bootstrap file:</p>

   <code>#!/opt/bin/php
&lt;?php

// This invokes Composer's autoloader so that we'll be able to use Guzzle and any other 3rd party libraries we need.
// Depending on the configured runtime, its location may vary
if ( file_exists(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php' ) ) {
    require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
} else {
    require '/opt/vendor/autoload.php';
}

// Initialize signing-key manager, and retrieve the current JWT signing keys from Okta
$keyManager = OktaLambdaAuth\KeyManager::instance();
if ( ! $keyManager-&gt;updateKeys() ) {
    die();
}

// This is the request processing loop. Barring unrecoverable failure, this loop runs until the environment shuts down.
do {

    // Ask the runtime API for a request to handle.
    $request = getNextRequest();

    require_once $_ENV['LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT'] . '/src/authorizer.php';

    // Execute the desired function and obtain the response.
    $response = authorizer($request['payload']);

    // Submit the response back to the runtime API.
    sendResponse($request['invocationId'], $response);
} while (true);

function getNextRequest()
{
    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $response = $client-&gt;get('http://' . $_ENV['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] . '/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/next');

    return [
   	 'invocationId' =&gt; $response-&gt;getHeader('Lambda-Runtime-Aws-Request-Id')[0],
   	 'payload' =&gt; json_decode((string) $response-&gt;getBody(), true)
    ];
}

function sendResponse($invocationId, $response)
{
    $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();
    $client-&gt;post(
   	 'http://' . $_ENV['AWS_LAMBDA_RUNTIME_API'] . '/2018-06-01/runtime/invocation/' . $invocationId . '/response',
   	 ['body' =&gt; $response]
    );
}
</code>   

<p>As we can see, we retrieve the JWT signing keys from the Okta server. These keys will be the ones used to validate the received JWT tokens.</p>

<p>Then we have an endless loop that will execute until the environment is finished. This loop will launch the authorizer function and any other existing functions corresponding to other methods in the API.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the KeyManager class (<code>classes/KeyManager.php</code>).</p>

   <code>&lt;?php
namespace OktaLambdaAuth;

use CoderCat\JWKToPEM\JWKConverter;

class KeyManager {

    // Static class
    protected static $instance;

    private $base_url;

    /**
     * @return KeyManager
     */
    public static function instance() {
   	 if ( static::$instance === null ) {
   		 static::$instance = new static();
   	 }

   	 return static::$instance;
    }
</code>   

<p>This class is designed as a singleton, as it will contain the currently valid keys that will be used in all the API calls; we’ll want to access it from anywhere.</p>

   <code>    private $keys;
    private $valid_until;

    public function __construct() {
   	 $this-&gt;keys = [];
   	 $this-&gt;valid_until = 0;
    }
</code>   

<p>I’ll keep the keys returned by the server in the <code>$keys</code> object. I’ll keep the Unix timestamp when the keys expire in <code>$valid_until</code>, as returned by the Okta server cache headers.</p>

<p>Let’s go with the <code>updateKeys()</code> method. This method retrieves the current JWT-signing keys provided by the Okta server and saves them, along with their expiration timestamp,  for future use from other functions.</p>

   <code>    public function updateKeys() {

    	// Build the URL from Okta that we'll use to retrieve the current set of signing keys
      $server = Config::OKTA_SERVER_HOSTNAME;
      $url = 'https://' . $server . '/oauth2/default/v1/keys';

      $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();

      $query_response = $client-&gt;get( $url );

      $response = json_decode( (string) $query_response-&gt;getBody() );

      if ( isset( $response-&gt;errorCode ) ) {
       // Error
       fwrite( STDERR, 'Error retrieving JWT-signing key: ' . $response-&gt;errorSummary );
       return false;
      }

      // Let's convert the received keys into PEM format, usable from the key verifier library
      $keys = $response-&gt;keys;
      $pem_keys = [];
      $jwkConverter = new JWKConverter();

      foreach ( $keys as $key) {
       $pem_keys[] = $jwkConverter-&gt;toPEM( (array) $key );
      }

      if ( count( $pem_keys ) ) {
      	// Save both the keys and their expiring moment for future use
       $this-&gt;keys = $pem_keys;
       $this-&gt;valid_until = strtotime( $query_response-&gt;getHeader('expires')[0] );
      }

      return $this-&gt;keys;
    }
</code>   

<p>The method <code>getKeys()</code> returns the current JWT-signing key information. But if the expiration time of the current information is in the past, it will refresh the saved keys. The <code>getValidUntil()</code> method will return the timestamp until which the current keys are valid.</p>

   <code>    public function getKeys() {
   	 if ( count( $this-&gt;keys ) &amp;&amp; $this-&gt;valid_until &gt; time() ) {
   		 return $this-&gt;keys;
   	 }
   	 return $this-&gt;updateKeys();
    }

    public function getValidUntil() {
   	 return date('Y-m-d H:i:s e', $this-&gt;valid_until );
    }
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s examine the <code>authorizer()</code> function code, in <code>src/authorizer.php</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;?php

function authorizer($data) {

    $type = $data['type'];
    $jwt = $data['authorizationToken'];
    $method = $data['methodArn'];

</code>   

<p>The function receives the data from AWS through these three parameters. The authorization token will include the JWT token, possibly with the “Bearer “ prefix. So first, we’ll remove it.</p>

   <code>
    // Remove the "Bearer " prefix from $jwt, if it exists
    if ( strpos( $jwt,'Bearer ' ) === 0 ) {
   	 $jwt = str_replace( 'Bearer ', '', $jwt );
    }
</code>   

<p>Now it examines the correctness of the received JWT token:</p>

   <code>    $key_manager = OktaLambdaAuth\KeyManager::instance();
    $keys = $key_manager-&gt;getKeys();

    $decoded_token = null;
    $jwt_valid = false;

    foreach ( $keys as $key ) {
   	 try {
   		 $decoded_token = JWT::decode( $jwt, $key, array( 'RS256' ) );
   		 unset( $error );
   		 $jwt_valid = true;
   	 } catch ( ExpiredException | BeforeValidException $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token expired, or used before its validity';
   		 break;
   	 } catch ( SignatureInvalidException $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token not valid';
   		 continue;
   	 } catch ( Exception $e ) {
   		 $error = 'Token problem: ' . $e-&gt;getMessage();
   		 continue;
   	 }
    }
</code>   

<p>If the token was valid, it’ll allow access. If not, it’ll deny it.</p>

   <code>    if ( ! $jwt_valid || ! $decoded_token) {
   	 $result = [
   		 'principalId' =&gt; 'unknown',
   		 'policyDocument' =&gt; [
   			 'Version' =&gt; '2012-10-17',
   			 'Statement' =&gt; [
   				 [
   					 'Action' =&gt; 'execute-api:Invoke',
   					 'Effect' =&gt; 'Deny',
   					 'Resource' =&gt; $method,
   				 ]
   			 ],
   		 ]
   	 ];

    } else {

   	 $result = [
   		 'principalId'	=&gt; $decoded_token-&gt;sub,
   		 'policyDocument' =&gt; [
   			 'Version'   =&gt; '2012-10-17',
   			 'Statement' =&gt; [
   				 [
   					 'Action'   =&gt; 'execute-api:Invoke',
   					 'Effect'   =&gt; 'Allow',
   					 'Resource' =&gt; $method,
   				 ]
   			 ],
   		 ]
   	 ];
    }

    return json_encode( $result );
}
</code>   

 Configuring authorizer Lambda function 

<p>So, we have all the code and the environment ready:</p>

 
   We have a PHP binary compiled on the correct supported version of Amazon Linux 
   We have a bootstrap file coded in PHP that will handle the authenticator initialization and will invoke the actual authenticator when receiving requests. 
   We have a vendor directory with all the needed PHP libraries. 
   We have our own src and class directories including the authenticator method itself, and other auxiliary classes. 
 

<p>Instead of uploading our software as a single, monolithic component, we’ll upload it using layers, which will allow us easier and quicker updates if we need them. Let’s build two layers for the code that don’t depend on us—one for the PHP runtime and other for the Composer vendor folder.</p>

<p>After this, we’ll create another ZIP package including our code for the authorizer:</p>

   <code>zip -r runtime.zip bin 
zip -r vendor.zip vendor/
zip -r authorizer.zip bootstrap classes/ src/authorizer.php
</code>   

<p>From the AWS Lambda console, we’ll create the two layers first.</p>

 
   In Additional Resources &gt; Layers menu, select Create Layer. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Create a Layer Runtime, uploading the generated <code>runtime.zip</code> file. Select Custom runtime as the only compatible runtime. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Create another Layer “Vendor”, uploading the generated <code>vendor.zip</code> file. Select Custom runtime as the only compatible runtime. 
 

<p>Once this is done, let’s create the authorizer Lambda function.</p>

 
   Click on the Create function button 
   Select Author from scratch. 
   Assign a name for the function. We’ll call it “phpAuthorizer”. 
   As Runtime, select Custom runtime / Use default bootstrap. 
 

<p>Add the two already created layers to the function,  clicking Layers in the function designer below the name of the function, and then clicking Add a layer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The created layers will be visible after selecting the Custom layers option.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, in the function code frame, click Actions and select Upload a .zip file.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Select the already generated <code>authorizer.zip</code> file. You should be able to see and edit the code of the bootstrap and our other files from the AWS Lambda Console.</p>

<p>After this, the Authorizer Lambda function should be ready. Let’s test it.</p>

 
   Click Test in the header bar. 
   You’ll be able to configure the received test event. You must select a name for it (for example, “idtoken”). Then, use the Event template Amazon API Gateway Authorizer. This will create an event with the following JSON: 
 

   <code>{
  "type": "TOKEN",
  "authorizationToken": "incoming-client-token",
  "methodArn": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-2:123456789012:example/prod/POST/{proxy+}"
}
</code>   

 
   
    <p>Replace the string incoming-client-token in the generated event with the access token you generated earlier, and create the test event.</p>
   
   
    <p>After this, you’ll be able to test the function by selecting the configured idtoken event and clicking Test in the header bar.</p>
   
   
    <p>The test should always be successful, returning Deny for invalid or expired JWT tokens, and Allow for valid, non-expired JWT tokens generated by the Okta server.</p>
   
 

 Configuring API Gateway to pass through only authenticated requests to the backend API 

<p>Once we have our Lambda authorizer, let’s configure an API Gateway to use it.</p>

<p>If you already have an API, you can use it. If not, let’s create a REST example API using the example “PetStore” provided by AWS:</p>

 
   Navigate to the API Gateway AWS service, then click Build under REST API. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Choose the REST protocol, select to use the Example API and the Regional Endpoint Type, and click Import. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Once the API PetStore is created, enter the Authorizers menu, and then click Create New Authorizer. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Select the Lambda type, and use the already configured authorizer Lambda function (phpAuthorizer in our example). 
   Select Token as the Lambda Event Payload. 
   Enter Authorization as the Token Source. 
   Leave the Authorization Caching enabled, with the default TTL of 300 seconds. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Grant all the requested permissions, and the authorizer will be created. Now we just need to configure all the endpoints of the API to use  the new authorizer. Before you’ll be able to choose the authorizer, you need to deploy the API. Deploy the API without authentication first—click on Resources in the API menu, and then select the Deploy API action.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll have to create a new Deployment Stage. Let’s use beta as the Stage name.</p>

<p>Next you’ll need to check all the existing methods you want to protect and set the defined Authorizer as its authorization method. Let’s see how this is done for the /pets GET method:</p>

 
   In the created API Resources menu, select the /pets GET method. Then, click on the Method Request definition. 
 

<p></p>

 
   Then click on the pencil icon in the Authorization setting, select the defined Authorizer as the authorization method, and click the check mark icon to save the selection. 
 

<p></p>

<p>You’ll have to repeat all these steps for all the endpoints you want to protect. For this example, I only left the root GET method unprotected, so we can test the difference between protected and unprotected methods.</p>

<p>After this, deploy a new version of the API. This time, you can reuse the previous stage you created in the last deployment.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Congratulations! All the protected API Methods will now require a valid JWT token.</p>

<p>You can test this by making a request from curl using the access token you generated at the beginning of this blog post. To do this, the URL for every API access point can be retrieved from the API Stages section, selecting the stage you just deployed and clicking on the corresponding endpoint. You’ll see the URL in the Invoke URL frame.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you click on the provided Invoke URL for the / GET method, that we left unprotected, you’ll see the landing page of the Pet Store API which has a short description of the API.</p>

<p>To finish up,, let’s make a request to the Invoke URL for the <code>/pets</code> GET resource, first without an access token, and then with the access token. (You’ll have to retrieve the actual URL from the corresponding endpoint in the last deployed stage.)</p>

   <code>curl -i 'https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/pets'
</code>   

   <code>{"message":"Unauthorized"}
</code>   

   <code>curl -i 'https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/beta/pets' -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiI5VzhZV3Qxc2RqO..."
</code>

<p>Wing, the first credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform built on the Ontology blockchain, has garnered a lot of attention since its launch in early September, laying the groundwork for the development of Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem and for the integration of Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, data, and credit evaluation systems.</p><p>Meanwhile, our team is delighted to have received feedback from the global Ontology community, including suggestions and recommendations for Wing’s future&nbsp;growth.</p><p>Now, as we celebrate one month since the launch of Wing, we can analyze the project’s performance so far and see what we can learn going forward. We hope this letter will also help keep community members updated on the milestones Wing has met to date, as well as what’s to come over the next few&nbsp;months.</p> Off To A Promising Start: High TVL and&nbsp;APY <p>Supported by Ontology’s blockchain infrastructure, Wing got off to a great start, offering lower transaction fees, faster transfer speed, and reduced costs overall. Wing’s TVL (total value locked) rose above 200 million USD on more than one occasion. At present, Wing’s TVL is around 150 million USD a very promising figure.</p><p>In addition to retaining a high TVL and providing higher returns to users in terms of APY (annual percentage yield), Wing also provides users with returns on borrowing and lending mainstream coins including ETH, USDT, DAI, and USDC, at some of the highest rates available on the DeFi&nbsp;market.</p><p>Currency — Wing Interest&nbsp;Rate</p><p>USDT — 11.97%</p><p>DAI — 11.96%</p><p>USDC — 11.97%</p><p>ETH — 11.97%</p><p>WBTC — 29.93%</p><p>TVL（Total Value Locked）/ — 134 Million&nbsp;USD</p><p>*Data Source: Borrow APYs of the above tokens are recorded from respective websites, as of 2:00 a.m. September 28, 2020&nbsp;(UTC)</p><p>Further, Wing is among the very few DeFi lending projects that has completed cross-chain integration with Ethereum assets, which has the potential to provide high yields for Ethereum assets outside of the current Ethereum ecosystem.</p> WING, Returning to a Governance Token <p>A token’s price in the secondary market is often regarded as a major indicator of its value. The day WING went live on Binance, the token instantly hit an all-time high of $300, before gradually cooled to $20. Of course, this resulted in some doubting the token’s&nbsp;future.</p><p>It’s likely that the recent hype in the DeFi market contributed to a $300 peak so quickly. These prices have, indeed, put both the Wing and Ontology teams under some pressure.</p><p>Comparisons can be drawn between WING quickly reaching a high of $300 and COMP’s experience of reaching an almost instantaneous high of $2,000 upon its release. As newly-launched projects are yet to reach proper transaction depths, an all-time high upon release is not a good indicator of its long-term price</p><p>In the long run, the market price of a token should be based on its application value and users enthusiasm around growth potential. In relation to WING as a governance token, the governance power and potential returns are substantiated by the ever-increasing TVL (Total Value Locked) on the Wing platform, as well as the transaction fees derived from interest on borrowing, lending and insuring. The Wing team believes that the value of the WING token will be more visible to community members when WING returns to its original position as a governance token.</p> Improving The Governance Model and Enriching Value <p>The Wing team greatly values feedback from the Wing DAO community..</p><p>In terms of next steps, Wing’s core development team will increase efforts in protocol implementation, product upgrades and improvements to user experience. In addition to further optimizing the Flash Pool UI, the Wing dApp will be released on ONTO, Ontology’s data wallet, at the end of September. In mid-October, a month after Wing’s official dApp launch, Wing.Finance will go through a structural upgrade that will facilitate the community governance framework and expand WING’s value in more dimensions.</p><p>As for product upgrades, in October, Wing’s core development team will submit a proposal to the Wing DAO community for a second lending pool incorporating credit, prompting Wing to venture into credit-based lending.</p> Empowering Wing with a Wing DAO-led Governance Strategy <p>As we have learned from Ontology’s positive growth history, a community-driven strategy is the cornerstone to a sustainable development of blockchain-based products. For this reason, the Wing community will remain our primary commitment in the next phase, and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Upon Wing’s launch, a series of mining activities were initiated by the <a href="http://gov.wing.finance">https://gov.wing.finance/</a> Wing team to ensure the steady growth of the ecosystem. Over the past 15 days, three proposals in the Wing DAO community were initiated with the aim of empowering Wing’s growth with a community governance approach of raising public proposals and seeking a vote from the entire community for execution.</p><p>As the governance policies formed by the three Wing DAO community proposals came to fruition, it has been great to see that the community has grown accustomed to taking governance power into their own hands. As the governance model has made a positive impact, the Wing project will prioritize a community-driven strategy in the next stage of Wing’s development. Meanwhile, we are more than happy to see community forums like <a href="https://gov.wing.fiannce/">https://gov.wing.fiannce/</a>,where members can express their opinions, and the community can gather together to brainstorm ideas. Every bit of feedback from the community is of significance to Wing’s&nbsp;growth.</p><p>A recent proposal suggested transaction fees from borrowing on WING should be bought back and burnt. The Wing team is currently looking into whether the proposal is technically feasible. If this is the case, the Wing team will initiate a fourth proposal for the community to make a final decision.</p><p>Following the Wing DAO-driven strategy, Wing will continue to adhere to an open and transparent governance structure, taking into account the community’s feedback to further improve the governance rules, simplify the process for member governance participation, perfect the governance protocol, and enable the protocol to be applied to more scenarios. We believe that as we progress, WING will be regarded as an increasingly valuable governance token.</p> Wing’s Strategic Significance to the Ontology Ecosystem <p>The success of DeFi projects requires ongoing commitment. Compound, a DeFi project released two years ago, has spent two thirds of its life in stealth mode until the unprecedented yield farming spree which took place inJune 2020. Uniswap provides us with another example of long-term users working together and remaining committed, ultimately cumulating in bountiful returns.</p><p>As the first credit-based cross-chain DeFi platform, Wing also serves as the first key project in Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem. Ontology’s decentralized identity framework (ONT ID) and decentralized data protocol (DDXF) can support users in managing their own identities and data verification, while also integrating with smart contracts to enable automatic verification of credit data and credit evaluation. A technical infrastructure such as this combined with OScore, Ontology’s credit evaluation system, makes it intrinsically possible for Wing to integrate credit data into its products.</p><p>In the next stage, Wing can be be fine-tuned to work as a crucial component of the Ontology DeFi ecosystem. We expect that more premium projects derived from Wing will emerge and enrich the ecosystem, in turn maximizing the project’s significance and value in the DeFi&nbsp;sector.</p><p>While we continuously improve our underlying infrastructure, Ontology will prioritize the development of our communities around the world. We’d like to extend our thanks to every community member who presented us with suggestions for Wing, and those who participated in Wing DAO governance in the last&nbsp;month.</p><p>Ontology is committed to continuing our efforts to optimize the governance framework, product design, and user experience of Wing. We also plan to explore more innovative DeFi products in a bid to build a bridge between DeFi and traditional finance.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/a-letter-to-the-wing-dao-community-from-jun-li-founder-of-ontology-7117c6eb41a5">A Letter to the Wing DAO Community from Jun Li, Founder of Ontology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Session Persistence 

<p>Session Persistence is a technique for sticking a client to a single server, using application layer information—like a cookie, for example. In this tutorial, we will implement session persistence with the help of <a href="http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.3/intro.html#3">HAProxy</a>, a reliable, high performance, TCP/HTTP load balancer.</p>

<p></p>

<p>First, let’s create a web application with Okta authentication and run three nodes with HAProxy load balancing using Docker Compose.</p>

<p>Create a Maven project using the Spring Initializr’s API.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
 -d dependencies=web,okta \
 -d groupId=com.okta.developer \
 -d artifactId=webapp \
 -d name="Web Application" \
 -d description="Demo Web Application" \
 -d packageName=com.okta.developer.webapp \
 -d javaVersion=11 \
 -o web-app.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip web-app.zip -d web-app
cd web-app
</code>   

<p>Run the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-maven-plugin">Okta Maven Plugin</a> to register a new account:</p>

   <code>./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:register
</code>   

<p>If you already have an Okta account registered, use <code>login</code> instead of <code>register</code>.</p>

<p>Then, configure your Spring application for authentication using Okta:</p>

   <code>./mvnw com.okta:okta-maven-plugin:spring-boot
</code>   

<p>It will set up a new OIDC application for you and write your Okta settings to your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file.</p>

<p>Create a <code>GreetingController</code> at <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/webapp/controller</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.webapp.controller;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseBody;
import org.springframework.web.context.request.RequestContextHolder;

import java.net.InetAddress;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

    @GetMapping(value = "/greeting")
    @ResponseBody
    public String getGreeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser) {
        String serverUsed = "unknown";
        try {
            InetAddress host = InetAddress.getLocalHost();
            serverUsed = host.getHostName();
        } catch (Exception e){
            logger.error("Could not get hostname", e);
        }
        String sessionId = RequestContextHolder.currentRequestAttributes().getSessionId();
        logger.info("Request responded by " + serverUsed);
        return "Hello " + oidcUser.getFullName() + ", your server is " + serverUsed + ", with sessionId " + sessionId;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Run the application with:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in an incognito window and you should be redirected to the Okta sign-in page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you sign in, you will get a 404 error when you’re redirected back to your Spring Boot app. This is expected because there’s no controller mapped to the <code>/</code> endpoint. You can fix this if you want by adding a method like the following to your <code>WebApplication.java</code>.</p>

   <code>@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class WebApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebApplication.class, args);
    }

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser user) {
        return "Hello, " + user.getFullName();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s configure three Docker containers, one for each application node, and an HAProxy container. In the project root folder, create a <code>docker/docker-compose.yml</code> file, with the following content:</p>

   <code>version: '3.1'
services:
  webapp1:
    environment:
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp1
    ports:

    depends_on:
      - "webapp1"
      - "webapp2"
      - "webapp3"
</code>   

<p>Create a<code>docker/.env</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={issuer}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={clientId}
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>You can find the issuer, clientId, and clientSecret in the <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>, after running the Okta Maven Plugin. Remove the <code>\</code> in the issuer’s URL after you paste the value. Also, make sure to remove the curly braces around the values.</p>

<p>Create a <code>Dockerfile</code> for the HAProxy container, at <code>docker/Dockerfile-haproxy</code> and add the following:</p>

   <code>FROM haproxy:2.2
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
</code>   

<p>Create the configuration file for the HAProxy instance at <code>docker/haproxy.cfg</code>:</p>

   <code>global
    debug
    daemon
    maxconn 2000

defaults
    mode http
    timeout connect 5000ms
    timeout client 50000ms
    timeout server 50000ms

frontend http-in
    bind *:80
    default_backend servers

backend servers
    balance roundrobin
    cookie SERVERUSED insert indirect nocache
    option httpchk /
    option redispatch
    default-server check
    server webapp1 webapp1:8080 cookie webapp1
    server webapp2 webapp2:8080 cookie webapp2
    server webapp3 webapp3:8080 cookie webapp3
</code>   

<p>I’m not going to dive deep into how to configure HAProxy but take note that,  in the <code>backend servers</code> section, there are the following options:</p>

 
   <code>balance roundrobin</code> sets round-robin as the load balancing strategy. 
   <code>cookie SERVERUSED</code> adds a cookie SERVERUSED to the response, indicating the server responding to the request. The client requests will stick to that server. 
   <code>option redispatch</code> makes the request be re-dispatched to a different server if the current server fails. 
 

<p>Edit the <code>pom.xml</code> to add the <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-maven-plugin">Jib Maven Plugin</a> to the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section to create a <code>webapp</code> Docker image.</p>

   <code>&lt;plugin&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.cloud.tools&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;jib-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.5.2&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;to&gt;
            &lt;image&gt;webapp&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;/to&gt;
    &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</code>   

<p>Build the <code>webapp</code> container image:</p>

   <code>./mvnw compile jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Start all the services with docker-compose:</p>

   <code>cd docker
docker-compose up
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you get a <code>URISyntaxException</code> on startup, remove the <code>\</code> in the issuer in <code>application.properties</code>.</p>

<p>HAProxy will be ready after you see the following lines in the logs:</p>

   <code>haproxy_1  | [WARNING] 253/130140 (6) : Server servers/webapp2 is UP, reason: Layer7 check passed, code: 302, check duration: 5ms. 1 active and 0 backup servers online. 0 sessions requeued, 0 total in queue.
haproxy_1  | [WARNING] 253/130141 (6) : Server servers/webapp3 is UP, reason: Layer7 check passed, code: 302, check duration: 4ms. 2 active and 0 backup servers online. 0 sessions requeued, 0 total in queue.
haproxy_1  | [WARNING] 253/130143 (6) : Server servers/webapp1 is UP, reason: Layer7 check passed, code: 302, check duration: 7ms. 3 active and 0 backup servers online. 0 sessions requeued, 0 total in queue.
</code>   

<p>Before you can sign in to your application, you’ll need to go to your Okta developer console and add a Login redirect URI for <code>http://localhost/login/oauth2/code/okta</code>. Otherwise, you’ll get a 400 error in the next step. While you’re in there, add a Logout redirect URI for <code>http://localhost</code>.</p>

<p>In a browser, go to <code>http://localhost/greeting</code>. After you sign in, inspect the request cookie <code>SERVERUSED</code>. An example value is:</p>

   <code>Cookie: SERVERUSED=webapp3; JSESSIONID=5AF5669EA145CC86BBB08CE09FF6E505
</code>   

<p>Shut down the current node with the following Docker command:</p>

   <code>docker stop docker_webapp3_1
</code>   

<p>Refresh your browser and wait a few seconds. Check the <code>SERVERUSED</code> cookie to verify that HAProxy re-dispatched the request to a different node, and the sessionId has changed, meaning the old session was lost.</p>

<p>You can stop the services with <code>CTRL+C</code>.</p>

 Session Sharing with Spring Session 

<p>Storing sessions in an individual node can affect scalability. When scaling up, active sessions will remain in the original nodes and traffic will not be spread equally among nodes. Also, when a node fails, the session in that node is lost. With session sharing, the user session lives in a shared data storage that all server nodes can access.</p>

<p>Next, for a transparent failover with the <code>redispatch</code> option in HAProxy, let’s add session sharing between nodes with Spring Session. For this tutorial, I’ll show you how to use MySQL for storing the session.</p>

<p>First, add the following dependencies to the <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;mysql&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mysql-connector-java&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;runtime&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.session&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-session-jdbc&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.zaxxer&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;HikariCP&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.2.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.h2database&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;h2&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code>, change your <code>okta.*</code> properties to be in YAML syntax, and add the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {issuer}
    client-secret: {client-secret}
    client-id: {client-id}

spring:
  session:
    jdbc:
      initialize-schema: always
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webapp
    username: root
    password: example
    driverClassName: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    hikari:
      initializationFailTimeout: 0

logging:
  level:
    org.springframework: INFO
    com.zaxxer.hikari: DEBUG
</code>   

<p>In this example, you are using HikariCP for the database connection pooling. The option <code>initializationFailTimeout</code> is set to 0, meaning if a connection cannot be obtained, the pool will start anyways.</p>

<p>You are also instructing Spring Session to always create the schema with the option <code>spring.session.jdbc.initialize-schema=always</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>application.yml</code> file you just created contains the default datasource properties for the MySQL session storage. As the MySQL database is not up when the tests run, set up an in-memory H2 database so the application tests don’t fail.</p>

<p>Create a<code>src/test/resources/application-test.yml</code> file with the following content:</p>

   <code>spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    username: sa
    password: passord
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
</code>   

<p>Modify the <code>WebApplicationTests.java</code> class to add the <code>@ActiveProfiles</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.webapp;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.ActiveProfiles;

@SpringBootTest
@ActiveProfiles("test")
class WebApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Modify <code>docker/docker-compose.yml</code> to add the database container and the admin application to inspect the session tables. The final configuration should look like the following:</p>

   <code>version: '3.1'
services:
  webapp1:
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/webapp
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp1
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    depends_on:
      - "db"

      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/webapp
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER=${OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp2
    ports:
      - 8082:8080

      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID}
      - OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET=${OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET}
    image: webapp
    hostname: webapp3
    ports:
      - 8083:8080
    depends_on:
      - "db"

  db:
    image: mysql
    command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
      MYSQL_DATABASE: webapp
    ports:
      - 3306:3306

  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8090:8080

  haproxy:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile-haproxy
    image: my-haproxy
    ports:
      - 80:80
    depends_on:
      - "webapp1"
      - "webapp2"
      - "webapp3"
</code>   

<p>Delete the previous containers and previous <code>webapp</code> Docker image with the following commands:</p>

   <code>docker-compose down
docker rmi webapp
</code>   

<p>In the root folder of the project, rebuild the webapp docker image with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw compile jib:dockerBuild
</code>   

<p>Start all the services again (<code>docker-compose up</code> from the <code>docker</code> directory), and repeat the re-dispatch test (go to <code>http://localhost/greeting</code> then shutdown the active node with <code>docker stop docker_webapp#_1</code>). You might see a lot of connection errors until the database is up.</p>

<p>Now the session should be the same after changing the node. How cool is that?!</p>

<p>You can inspect the session data in the admin UI at <code>http://localhost:8090</code>. Log in with <code>root</code> and the <code>MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD</code> value that you set in<code>docker-compose.yml</code>.</p>

  <p>ITSM is going well beyond ITIL and IT ticketing these days: It’s becoming the portal and workflow platform</p>
<p>Not that long ago, ITSM (IT Service Management) was what the name means: A technology used within IT to manage IT services and facing to the end user when it comes to IT requests. IT requests led to tickets as the tasks to be performed by workers in IT. And yes, there was and is ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) describing common IT processes, there were and are Service Catalogs, and there were and are CMDBs (Configuration Management Databases).</p>
<p>However, this is changing. ITSM platforms are shifting from IT solutions to business solutions and becoming strategic tools for organizations, for service delivery (and thus service definition, service management, and so on) across a range of business functions. They have become a widely used interface for users to a wide range of services, and they support the workflows and process automation behind these interfaces.</p>
<p>With IAM providing interfaces and with workflows and processes being a vital part of every IAM, it is obvious that there is a logical link between IAM and ITSM (or the other way round).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, in his talk will look at the journey of ITSM and where ITSM is heading. He will look at the overlaps and links between IAM and ITSM. And he will take a high-level perspective on where integration is expected to become deeper and where IAM capabilities might shift to ITSM, specifically in the context of IAM evolving from monolithic platforms to modern, microservice-based architectures that can well make use of existing ITSM services, microservices, and APIs.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger"></a>

  <p>Why have things like cell phones and automobiles become more advanced, intuitive and cost effective over time while managing Identity, particularly Identity Governance, has remained complex and expensive? The time and resources it takes to implement an identity project hinders the business and slows any hope of digital transformation. The frustration is real and ripping and replacing has not proved to be the answer. So what’s it going to take to truly get IGA right? In this thought-provoking session, Jackson Shaw, an experienced thought leader in IGA will discuss the need to rethink the core of identity and why it’s time for an IDENTITY REVOLUTION.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_shaw"></a>

<p><a href="https://www.bioid.com/?utm_source=announcement&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bioid">BioID</a> is a server side biometric platform that uses face, voice and eye modalities and liveness detection. Organisations can self-host or use BioID’s hosted API as a service. BioID publishes client software for iOS, Android and Javascript. User presence is verified through a highly accurate and strongly secured liveness detection algorithm. In the SaaS BioID Platform, users are referenced via an anonymous ID, providing privacy-protecting separation of biometric data and other personally identifying information, satisfying GDPR compliance through strong data protection and pseudonymized data handling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although you probably want to build BioID in a mobile application, it was expedient for the Gluu engineers to use the laptop webcam to build our demo. The interception script implements a two-step authentication workflow where username/password is step one, and BioID’s biometric authentication is step two.&nbsp;It’s also possible to implement a one step biometric authentication. Gluu has also published a <a href="https://casa.gluu.org/plugins/biometric-credentials/?utm_source=announcement&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=bioid">Casa plugin for BioID</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing is believing. CEO Mike Schwartz recorded a one minute video to show how easy it is to enroll and authenticate using facial recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Detailed instructions for how to deploy the Gluu BioID interception script and Casa plugin can be found <a>here</a></p>
<p>You can find more information about how to use BioID from their documentation:</p>
 
 You can find all API reference at&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.bioid.com/bwsreference">https://developer.bioid.com/bwsreference</a>.

They explained how our Containerized Directory Services can help you handle massive&nbsp;transaction&nbsp;volumes and millions of identities at thousands of transactions per second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll be answering questions like:&nbsp;</p>

  What role does&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/directory-services">Directory Services</a>&nbsp;play in identity? 
	 What are the risks of ignoring Directory Services?

<p>Good security starts at the login screen. With the <a href="https://www.wwpass.com/lp/wwpass-sso?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=gluu">WWPass mobile app</a> or token, users can easily log in to all their enabled applications without the need for inherently insecure username/password architectures.</p>
<p>WWPass technology keeps application data and user identity information separate and hidden from all other applications, preserving both user and application privacy — even from WWPass itself.</p>
<p>
Unlike most common identity solutions, WWPass protects user identity with cryptography and zero-knowledge design. WWPass Protected User IDentity (PUID) is a random number created by the Gluu Server, assigned to the user, and stored in the encrypted form in geographically distributed data centers. WWPass does not store or have access to any personal information. User identification and authorization remain under the enterprise’s full control.</p>
<p>To log in, users employ a WWPass Key. The WWPass Key is a cryptographic token available in the form of a mobile app, USB/NFC fob, or a smart card. With an addition of a PIN or biometrics, the WWPass Key serves as a strong two-factor authentication solution. Unlike the others, WWPass uses “something you have” as the user’s primary credential. This eliminates the need for username/password pairs and closes the door to first-order threats ranging from compromised credentials to SQL injections. Users enjoy the convenience of never having to remember username/password details again.</p>
<p>WWPass Key easy self-revoking or replacement procedure has no impact on user accounts in the Gluu Server, resulting in no need for re-enrollment of the user in the event of loss or damage of the WWPass Key.<br>
WWPass provides a glimpse into a possible future for authentication: convenient, secure, flexible and strong — and without usernames!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Gluu integration with WWPass hardware or software based cryptographic multi-factor authentication provides GDPR and NIST compliant strong SSO based on SAML or OAuth2 protocols for business applications, like Zoom and many others. For the source code and installation instructions see <a href="https://github.com/wwpass/gluu">Github project.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wwpass.com/?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=gluu">WWPass</a> is a global cybersecurity company that provides next generation authentication and client-side encryption technology eliminating Usernames and Passwords. We battle data breaches and identity theft day in and day out, using our advanced distributed and secure storage mechanisms.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Whether you are a firm believer in the bright future of Artificial Intelligence or somewhat of a skeptic like me – you simply cannot ignore the great strides AI technologies have made in recent years. Intelligent products powered by machine learning are everywhere: from chatbots to autonomous vehicles, from predicting consumer behavior and detecting financial fraud to cancer diagnostics and crop harvesting. There is however a major factor limiting even further applications of AI and ML in almost any industry: AI algorithms are very computationally intensive and until quite recently, prohibitively expensive to operate “on-premises”.</p>
<p>The rise of cloud computing has given a major boost to AI technologies in recent years, and to this day, it is the cloud that powers the majority of AI applications, both for consumers and for enterprise applications. However, what works perfectly well for business analytics, language translation services or, say, virtual assistants, might be not enough for more mission-critical scenarios.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge of cloud-based AI are potential connectivity issues: if a device is only occasionally connected to the Internet, it won’t be able to utilize cloud-based machine learning services efficiently. For real-time scenarios like self-driving cars, even the additional milliseconds of network latency can be a deal-breaker. Another major problem of cloud-based AI is the sensitivity of the information that has to be sent to the cloud for processing. Companies operating under strict regulations (which nowadays includes anyone dealing with personally identifiable information) simply cannot afford the risks for a security breach or a compliance violation fine.</p>
<p>These problems are nothing new, of course – they’ve been the biggest obstacle to adopting any cloud services for over a decade already. To address this challenge and to expand their customer base to these “not cloud-ready” companies, cloud service providers have been pushing the concept of Edge Computing. At its face value, edge computing simply means bringing computing and storage resources closer to the customer’s geographical location to reduce network latency. This has started over 20 years ago with CDNs (content delivery networks) but expanded to mobile phones, IoT devices and network gateways.</p>
<p>Nowadays, these devices are powerful enough to implement a substantial part of the cloud service stack locally, creating a distributed computing platform between corporate networks and clouds, dramatically improving response rates and reducing the strain on the core cloud infrastructure. It is important to understand that this trend does not by any means undo the achievements of the cloud model. Edge computing isn’t returning to on-prem data centers; it is simply another phase in the evolution of the cloud. Even the name itself implies it: the edge, of course, refers to the cloud, its proverbial “silver lining” …</p>
<p>In a sense, edge computing is an alternative approach towards hybrid architectures, one that tries to blur the massive divide in on-prem and cloud technology stacks and to expand the reach of cloud service providers even deeper into their customers’ networks. Bringing AI capabilities closer to their consumers is just another logical step in that direction.</p>
<p>The Future of the Intelligent Edge</p>
<p>It is well known that preparing data for machine learning and training of ML models is the part of AI that requires the most computing resources. The actual inference (i.e., putting a model to productive use) is much lighter. Optimizing ML models for running on edge devices is one of the primary methods of decoupling them from the cloud. Solutions like AI-powered antiviruses that only require updates every six months are already a reality. Simple image recognition can run directly on your mobile phone, helping you take better pictures of your food.</p>
<p>More sophisticated models require specialized hardware to run. Major semiconductor manufacturers like Intel and Nvidia and even cloud service providers themselves like AWS have specialized AI chips in their portfolios; smaller companies are offering solutions for developers to simplify and optimize the usage of this hardware. In other words, a whole ecosystem is being born, bringing AI/ML closer to customers and enabling usage scenarios previously impossible.</p>
<p>The field is still far from mature, however. Perhaps the best indication of this is a lack of standardization developments and a very fragmented market, where very few vendors can deliver a full technology and service stack to satisfy different use cases. Will we see the emergence of a standardized abstracted architecture similar to VMware or Kubernetes for traditional computing? Perhaps: companies like Run:AI are already working on AI orchestration platforms.</p>
<p>One thing is clear though: cloud AI isn’t going anywhere. For the foreseeable future, we’re going to deal with a multitude of hybrid architectures. History has a tendency to repeat itself, after all.</p>

Recently, the Freddie Mac identity team determined it was time to <a>modernize their legacy web access management (WAM)</a> infrastructure. The system was nearing end of life and presented numerous security vulnerabilities that weren’t easily remedied. But given the number of resources involved and the 400+ applications that had to be migrated, the switch to a modern identity and access management (IAM) platform would be a massive undertaking.<br>

Also, multiple swaps were listed on Wing, including ETH/pETH, DAI/pDAI, and WING/pWING.</p><p>Events</p>  From September 2nd-4th, Ontology co-organized the event ‘Cointelegraph China’s DeFi Marathon’. On September 2nd, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, addressed the audience during “Ontology: Empowering DeFi with Credit” and joined a panel discussion themed “Public Chain’s Choice amid DeFi Pressure”. He stated, “By empowering DeFi with credit, we are poised to build the next ‘Super-Oracle’”. In addition, during the event, Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead, was engaged in a discussion with the lead of Aave, as well as other renowned projects.  On September 4th, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, participated in a live AMA panel hosted by HyperPay on the topic of “Braving the DeFi-spurred Storm: Where Will Public Chains Head”. During the panel discussion, he unveiled Ontology’s blueprint for DeFi, and briefed the community users on the innovative and transformative features of&nbsp;Wing.  On September 18th, Jun LI took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry, while avoiding the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different fees in scenarios of different technical complexities.  On September 3rd, Kendall MAO, Dean of Ontology Institute, discussed the dilemma posed by DeFi to public chains at a SheKnows live panel. The panel was organized by 8BTCnews, along with representatives from Bytom Blockchain. Kendall mentioned, “Wing, Ontology’s latest cross-chain DeFi project, is integrated with the element of credit. We believe that a dynamic integration with the OScore system will create new paradigms for DeFi innovations, thus opening up new opportunities for Ontology.”<br> <br>Recruitments<br>- Solution Architect<br>- Business Sales<br>- Global Development Manager<br>- Global Marketing Manager<br>- Social Media Associate<br>- Product Manager<br>- Product Operations<br> <br>New Team Members<br>- 1 Marketing Intern <br> <br>Contact Us<br>- Contact us: <a href="mailto:contact@ont.io">contact@ont.io</a><br>- Apply now: <a href="mailto:careers@ont.io">careers@ont.io</a>   Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-monthly-report-september-2020-3c9c1af617d7">Ontology Monthly Report — September 2020</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>From taking credit for someone’s idea to pet names, marginalization can take many forms in the workplace. A set of small actions that individually are annoying, but not egregious, can create a “death by 1,000 cuts” phenomenon — they collectively add up to an environment that does not feel inclusive to some members.</p>
<p>Kasey Panetta, Gartner Senior Content Marketing Manager, interviews <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/47591">Christie Struckman</a>, VP Analyst, to talk about confronting behaviors that marginalize <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-to-more-effectively-advance-underrepresented-talent/">underrepresented employees</a>. Christie explains that any employee can marginalize or be the target of marginalization and once these behaviors are recognized, they must be confronted.</p>
 Listen to interview 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length. <br>
[swg_ad]</p>
 What is marginalization, and what does it look like in the workplace? 
<p>Marginalization is when someone feels their contribution is not valued, or their idea or specific recommendation is not valued, or because they as an individual, with a demographic that they cannot change, is being devalued. An example is when women feel that simply because they are female, they are not being valued by their peers or they're being treated differently because of that. I'll give an example of three types of marginalizing behaviors.</p>
 Unequal personality trait assessment 
<p>Let's say that we were in a meeting with three male cohorts, and as a group getting really frustrated because we were struggling to make a decision. It felt like we were caught in this sort of endless debate. And one of our male cohorts slammed his fist on the table and said something like, ‘Come on, we have to get our act together and make a decision. Let's move forward.’</p>
<p>The assessment would be that he is trying to take charge and move forward. But if a woman had done that exact same thing, she would be assessed as exhibiting the behaviors of a “B word.” So think about how uncomfortable it is when you feel that people think that you are a B when you're trying to move the conversation forward, like your other male cohorts have done on occasion.</p>
 Lack of confidence assumption 
<p>This occurs when there is a difference between what we think confidence looks like from men and from women. A woman who chooses to be a little bit more quiet in how she approaches things might come across as somebody who's not as competent. So there's this linkage between how confidence is exhibited and therefore somebody's competence, but confidence can look different.</p>
<p>Confidence can look different between men, of course, as well, but there tends to be some sort of natural differences between men and women. And so that difference in how we exhibit confidence being correlated to our competence can be very frustrating.</p>
 The “taking credit” 
<p>For example, in a meeting someone volunteers an idea that doesn't get a lot of discussion, but then five minutes later, another team member offers up the exact same suggestion, not giving me credit for the first suggestion, but instead takes it as their own and takes credit.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/making-the-case-for-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-during-disruption/">Making the Case for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion During Disruption</a></p>
 Do people see this as an HR problem to solve? Do they distance themselves from it at all? 
<p>Yes, and I think organizational processes encourage that because it then gets tied to their performance assessments. But when you do that, there's this huge separation between when the behavior happens and then the HR processes.</p>
<p>And I want to be really clear: The HR processes are necessary, but there's a lag. I refer to marginalization as a death of 1,000 cuts — no one instance in and of itself is going to inspire someone to reach out to HR and to say, “I feel like I'm being marginalized.” But collectively, they create an environment where people don’t feel supported.</p>
 What is psychological safety? Why is it so important? 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-play-a-key-role-in-improving-psychological-safety/">Psychological safety</a> means creating an environment that encourages, recognizes and rewards individuals for their contributions and their ideas and makes individuals feel safe enough that they'll take interpersonal risks. The biggest contributor to psychological safety is the relationship between employees and their managers.</p>
<p>Those employees who feel they can have an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-leader-checklist-to-foster-trust-on-remote-teams/">open and honest conversation</a> may be more comfortable bringing up work challenges. And it is an important part of the management role to create that environment, which is why I've put together five steps that managers can do when in the moment they see a marginalizing behavior.</p>
 What are the 5 steps to combat marginalization? 
 
 Recognize the behaviors. And here's the hardest part. If you're not being marginalized, you might not recognize it. So part of the research was going through and creating those 12 behaviors. If you can pay attention to these, you will be making a difference. And so I gave an example of taking credit, that unequal personality trait assessment, the lack of confidence assumption, but there's pet names, tokenism, sexist statements and “mansplaining,” or what I call overexplaining. 
 Address those behaviors publicly. You have to do it in the moment. When the situation occurs, quickly call it to attention. It doesn’t need to be a long lecture, but it signals to the marginalized employee that it was noticed. 
 Coach privately. If you're managing the employee it’s easier because you can have a conversation. If not, perhaps approach the employee’s manager to share the situation. Don’t assume why the employee behaved that way — it could have been an oversight. Often, once a manager starts paying attention to the behaviors, they'll realize that it has actually been happening all along, so it’s important to coach the employee privately to change the behavior. 
 Support the employee who was marginalized privately. Managers need to demonstrate empathy and to spend a little time with the employee so that they feel recognized. There is a chance that the employee didn’t feel marginalized, but it’s better to have the conversation so they feel that the manager is looking out for them. 
 Affirm the commitment to inclusion publicly. This doesn't have to be done in the moment, but reaffirm that you care about inclusivity at some point shortly thereafter. This could take the form of reminding people about employee resource groups. 
 
<p>I'm a big proponent of what I call diversity and inclusion norms. These norms are the socially <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-a-sense-of-belonging-in-the-workplace/">accepted ways that we're going to work with each other</a>. The value of norms is letting people know what is expected, by giving a language when we need to call somebody out on whether they're following that. Diversity and inclusion norms can be ones like seek to understand, take turns, listen generously and remember that words matter.</p>

 What other mistakes do you commonly see when it comes to dealing with marginalization? 
<p>I find two big mistakes. One is making an attribution about the person who made the marginalized behavior. Keep it to what you heard. For example, ‘Christie stated that I'm worried that we're not listening to each other, right?’ That's not attribution about why the behavior happened, but that's an observation about the behavior. I find that when you keep the conversation to observe behaviors that really can't be debated, it helps the conversation move forward.</p>
<p>The second mistake is assuming the impact to the woman. That's why the coaching privately is important to understand how that woman is feeling. Did she feel marginalized? Is this a pattern? Maybe this is happening in many more places. That lets you know where you need to spend more time so that you can help to confront and ferret it out. Or maybe the woman doesn't feel marginalized. And so it’s important to keep the conversation open and allow employees to have the freedom and the safety to open up.</p>
 Are there any final thoughts that you would like to share with our audience? 
<p>When I use the language to “‘confront behaviors,” I think that's very uncomfortable for leaders, especially if it's around marginalizing. So I expect that this is an uncomfortable proposal, but I've had many conversations with clients who told me that it was amazing how impactful confronting a behavior once or twice was. And my assumption is that most of these behaviors are a lack of attention versus an intention to hurt somebody's feelings.</p>
<p>The good news is that while it might be uncomfortable, I haven't come across clients who said that they felt like they had to continually confront. And then frankly, what it also does is it narrows down where you might have some issues where you need to get HR involved.</p>

  <p>Last month I came out with a video tutorial on Blazor WebAssembly and I thought it would be good to follow up with a written tutorial as well.</p>

 

 
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1vSk8lPtU">Youtube Link</a></p>

<p>Because of the JS Interop, Blazor WASM has some key differences in the world of OAuth. Instead of thinking of this as a normal .NET back end application, you have to think of what Blazor resolves to in the browser - and that’s Javascript. Therefore, all of the security vulnerabilities that come along with browser-based languages apply here. Many have been handled by the team that built Blazor WebAssembly already, but they cannot code for you and make decisions about how to handle your token. We can help with that!</p>

<p>For this tutorial, we will focus on a Blazor WASM Progressive Web App (PWA) because it can be hooked up to a previously-built back end API that can handle the token validation with Okta - this way, we can learn what is required for the Blazor WASM front end website by itself. The ASP.NET Core Hosted option will be addressed in a future post and you can check out the <a>official Okta .NET Blazor samples</a> to see some samples in the meantime.</p>

<p>Requirements:</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes">Visual Studio 2019</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes">Visual Studio 2019 for Mac</a> (see the comparison <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/#vs_mac_table">here</a>) or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> (we will be using VS Code for the samples in this article since it runs on everything including Linux) 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0">.NET Core 3.0 SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

<p>Ready to go blazing fast through hooking up external authentication? Start your engines and don’t blink - here we go!</p>

 Build a Blazor WASM Progressive Web App Project 

<p>Let’s start from the beginning with a fresh application. You can also use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/">.NET CLI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a> to create your app, but for this tutorial, I will walk you through the IDE and portal steps.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio, select Create a new project. Then, select Blazor App and click Next.</p>

<p>Set the Project name to “Okta Blazor WASM” and click Create.</p>

<p>Select Blazor WebAssembly App and check Progressive Web Application. We are starting with a PWA because this way you can hook it up to your own, previously-built back end API  leaving Configure for HTTPS checked as well.</p>

<p>Under the Authentication section, “No Authentication” will be set as the default option. Click Change.</p>

<p>Select Individual User Accounts to store user accounts in-app. Click OK.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This option will automatically add the configurations your Blazor application needs to handle authentication and cuts down on having to add some files manually.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Click Create.</p>

<p>Build and run your new project to ensure there aren’t any updates to the Visual Studio templates needed. You should see the placeholder Blazor site!</p>

 Set up Okta to Handle Your Blazor WebAssembly App 

<p>You can access your dashboard via the email you received from Okta giving you your org URL. Go there now—unless you need to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">sign up</a> for an Okta developer account.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, click on Applications and then Add Application.</p>

<p>Since this is Blazor WebAssembly (specifically a PWA), and not traditional .NET Core MVC, you are going to select Single-Page App and fill out the form with the following values:</p>

 
   Name: My Blazor WASM App 
   Base URL: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}</code> 
   Grant Type: Authorization Code 
   Login redirect URIs: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}/authentication/login-callback</code> 
   Logout redirect URIs: <code>https://{yourLocalhostPortURL}/authentication/logout-callback</code> 
 

<p>Click Done.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The login-callback and logout-callback parts of the URIs are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/?view=aspnetcore-3.1#authentication-process-with-oidc">Blazor WebAssembly specific routing for OIDC</a> that has been auto-generated for the project when we opted to add authentication to it during the wizard set-up. This is handled specifically inside of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication">WebAssembly.Authentication</a> Nuget package installed with the latest SDK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the bottom of the screen, your newly registered Okta app will get a Client ID and Client Authentication. Notice that the only option you have is to do this flow with <a href="https://oauth.net/2/pkce/">PKCE</a> (instead of a traditional client secret), as this is a more secure way of handling security vulnerabilities in a front end framework like WebAssembly (which resolves to Javascript). You can read more about what Proof-Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is <a href="https://www.loginradius.com/engineering/blog/pkce/">here</a>.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to set-up for Okta right now!</p>

 Add External Authentication to Your Blazor WASM Project 

<p>Now it’s time to return to the Visual Studio Blazor project and make some adjustments to allow an external auth provider to handle the user login.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Program.cs</code> file.</p>

<p>You’ll notice, because Individual User Accounts were selected during the wizard, “Local” is set up here but we are going to use Okta, instead. Replace “Local” with “Okta”. The line should now look like this:</p>

   <code>builder.Configuration.Bind("Okta", options.ProviderOptions);
</code>   

<p>This is going to pull from a configuration file. You can find that under the <code>wwwroot</code> folder, inside of your <code>appsettings.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Replace the JSON in the entire file with the code below:</p>

   <code>{
  "Okta": {
    "Authority": "https://{yourOktaOrg}.okta.com/oauth2/default",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>It’s important to specify in <code>Program.cs</code> that the kind of flow we are using is the authentication code flow with OIDC. The way you do that is by providing a ProviderOptions response type. Add the code below underneath your Okta configuration line:</p>

   <code>options.ProviderOptions.ResponseType = "code";
</code>   

<p>If you are interested in bringing over more information in the token, besides the user’s ID, you need to include some other scopes. I have added a few that come out of the box with your Okta default authorization server, but you can create and configure your own at any time in the portal. To see what scopes are available, look under API &gt; Authorization Servers &gt; default &gt; Scopes.</p>

<p>Add the following underneath the “code” ProviderOptions line to add more information about your user:</p>

   <code>options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("profile");
options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("address");
</code>   

<p>The <code>AddOidcAuthentication</code> method should now look like this altogether:</p>

   <code>builder.Services.AddOidcAuthentication(options =&gt;
{
    // Configure your authentication provider options here.
    // For more information, see https://aka.ms/blazor-standalone-auth
    //builder.Configuration.Bind("Local", options.ProviderOptions);
    builder.Configuration.Bind("Okta", options.ProviderOptions);
    options.ProviderOptions.ResponseType = "code";
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("profile");
    options.ProviderOptions.DefaultScopes.Add("address");
});
</code>   

 Using Razor Components AuthorizeView in Your Blazor WASM App 

<p>A lot of work has been done on Blazor around templatizing the views to handle toggling what can be seen based on the user’s authenticated state. You don’t have to write a bunch of this from scratch; the wizard set-up generated a sample UI for you that is already observing that state. The built-in <code>Authentication.razor</code> page inside of the Pages folder already handles whatever Actions come through the routing with a RemoteAuthenticatorView.</p>

<p>Take a look at <code>App.razor</code> and you will see the entire site UI is wrapped in a CascadingAuthenticationState. You don’t have to write a separate one for each page, as this handles what is displayed to the user globally. However, you can override what the user sees in a logged out or logged in state at the Page-level as well. If you take a look at the Shared folder and open <code>LoginDisplay.razor</code> you can see an example of this inside of an AuthorizeView with Authorized and NotAuthorized HTML views for you to customize.</p>

<p>It’s great that all this works out of the box!</p>

<p>Let’s add a page to see a bit more about our user, which specifically shows the claims that came along with the token—but only if the user is logged in.</p>

<p>Right-click on Pages, add a new Razor Page and name it “Claims.razor”.</p>

<p>Copy the code below into the file:</p>

   <code>@page "/claims"
&lt;AuthorizeView&gt;
    &lt;Authorized&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;
            Hello @context.User.Identity.Name,
            here's the list of your claims:
        &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            @foreach (var claim in context.User.Claims)
            {
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;@claim.Type&lt;/b&gt;: @claim.Value&lt;/li&gt;
            }
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/Authorized&gt;
    &lt;NotAuthorized&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I'm sorry, I can't display anything until you log in&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/NotAuthorized&gt;
&lt;/AuthorizeView&gt;
</code>   

<p>The foreach loop accesses the application context and looks at the OIDC Claims collection. which has been added via token deserialization into the User object, courtesy of the built-in WebAssembly Authentication in Blazor.</p>

<p>Next, we need to add this page to the UI navigation.</p>

<p>Expand the Shared folder and open <code>NavMenu.razor</code>. Go to the NavMenuCssClass div and and another list item below “Fetch data”:</p>

   <code>&lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
    &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="claims"&gt;
        &lt;span class="oi oi-list-rich" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; User OIDC Claims
    &lt;/NavLink&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Save, build, and run the application in a browser. It may take a minute to load whenever you make changes.</p>

<p>You can view three pages in a logged out state, but the new page you added should display this NotAuthorized message.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s log in now!</p>

<p>Click Log In at the top right-hand corner of the page. The user will be redirected to your identity provider, which is your Okta org. If you have a test user already added to your account, go ahead and try out those credentials. However, if you are interested in enabling a user to register themselves (highly recommended), go back to your Okta portal and turn that feature on. You can find it by selecting Users &gt; Registration and filling out the information you want to display to a new user. Once you are done there, a Sign up link should appear at the bottom of your Okta login screen. Click that, and fill it out (real email address required).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you are authenticated, it will redirect you back to your app‚which has grabbed the name of the logged-in user and displays it on the top-right of the screen—with a Log Out URL next to it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now if you navigate to your User OIDC Claims page, you should be authorized to see what was brought along with the token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also log out to play with the visibility of sections of the app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Pretty sweet!</p>

<p>You can check out the official project code in our <a href="https://github.com/okta/samples-blazor/tree/master/web-assembly/hosted/okta-hosted-login">Github repo</a>.</p>

 Recap 

<p>I found the process of plugging in Okta to Blazor WASM to be very quick and easy. The team that worked on WebAssembly for .NET was very thoughtful about the experience of using an external identity provider, and it shows. We’ve got more coming around Blazor, so tell us what you would like to see!</p>

<p>Until next time, fellow Coders.</p>

Stablecoin Regulatory Policy of the United&nbsp;States <p>As early as June, the OCC issued a ‘pre-notification of the proposed rulemaking’, asking the public to weigh how to use cryptocurrency and other financial technology tools in the financial sector before August 3. Several banks have indicated that they may be interested in providing crypto custody and other services to customers. Dominic Venturo, the chief digital officer of the National Association of American banks, said in response that the OCC should distinguish between utility tokens, stablecoins, and Exchange platform&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Last week, the OCC issued regulations on stablecoins, confirming that the Commonwealth Bank can provide custody services for legal-collateralized stablecoins. This is the first time the OCC has issued regulations regarding stablecoins. The OCC is a federal agency responsible for overseeing the implementation of laws related to the National Bank and supervising the Federal Bank and the agencies of foreign banks. Subsequently, the SEC FinHub Staff stated that it could consider adopting a ‘no action’ position on specific digital asset activities under appropriate circumstances.</p> The OCC released regulations on stablecoins for the first&nbsp;time <p>On September 21, the OCC issued a press release and subsequent explanatory letter stating that banks have the right to deposit certain ‘stablecoins’ reserves. The stablecoin mentioned here specifically refers to stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency and does not include other stablecoins backed by commodities, cryptocurrencies, or other assets. The demand for stablecoins is increasing day by day, with multiple applications, such as large-scale transfers, which have great potential. Two technologies for realizing cryptocurrency, encryption technology and distributed ledger technology, are developing rapidly.</p><p>The National Bank has a clear authorization to accept deposits, which is also the core business of the bank. Certain stablecoin issuers may also wish to deposit the cash reserves supporting their issuance of stablecoins in the National Bank. As long as stablecoin issuers can effectively manage risks and comply with relevant laws (including the ‘Bank Secrecy Law’ and anti-money laundering laws), banks can provide services for their legitimate businesses, including cryptocurrency businesses. Therefore, banks may obtain deposits from stablecoin issuers, including stablecoin reserve deposits related to custodian wallets.</p><p>Like other deposits, stablecoin reserves are also subject to laws and regulations related to deposit insurance coverage. The stablecoin reserve account can be the deposit of a stablecoin issuer or the deposit of a single stablecoin holder. Banks and the FSA should provide accurate and appropriate disclosures on deposit insurance coverage to ensure compliance with the BSA and other regulations, including but not limited to the customer due diligence under the BSA, customer identification requirements under the Patriot Act, requirements under the Federal Securities Act, and identification of the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p><p>Reserves related to stablecoins may bring significant liquidity risks. New banking activities should be developed and implemented under sound risk management principles, and banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses. OCC hopes that all banks manage liquidity risks at the same level as the risks they assume. The protocol between the bank and the stablecoin issuer may include restrictions or requirements for holding assets in the reserve account, and the protocol may stipulate the responsibilities of the parties. For example, the bank should sign an appropriate protocol with the issuer to ensure that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers. The agreement should include a mechanism for the bank to periodically check the amount of outstanding stablecoin.</p><p>To summarize, national banks are authorized to deposit stablecoin reserves, subject to the following restrictions:</p><p>Only support stablecoin collateralized 1:1 by the single legal currency.<br>The Bank verifies at least once a day that the balance in the reserve account is more than or equal to the amount of stablecoins outstanding with issuers.<br>Banks should establish appropriate risk management procedures for the development of new businesses.<br>Banks must comply with all applicable laws and regulations.<br>Banks must establish appropriate control measures and conduct adequate due diligence.<br>The bank must confirm the beneficial owners of the accounts&nbsp;enabled.</p> The Statement of&nbsp;SEC <p>After the OCC issued the explanatory letter, the SEC FinHub Staff issued a statement.</p><p>According to the Federal Securities Law, whether a specific digital asset (including stablecoins) should be considered security depends on actual conditions. The nature of the asset needs to be carefully analyzed, including the right to hold the asset and how to provide and sell the&nbsp;asset.</p><p>SEC FinHub believes that as long as it meets the relevant registration, reporting, and other requirements of the Federal Securities Law, market participants may construct and sell digital assets in a way that does not constitute securities. However, the terms used to describe digital assets or financial activities involving digital assets may not be consistent with the definitions of SEC in relevant laws and regulations. FinHub encourages all parties involved in the construction and sale of digital assets to contact FinHub through the official website to help them ensure that such digital assets can comply with the Federal Securities Act. FinHub staff will always be ready to assist participants. If appropriate, a ‘no action’ position will be considered.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

 The GiD Report#128 — What the Apple App Store backlash tells us about this moment in&nbsp;time <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-127-amid-tiktok-deal-ray-dalio-explains-chinas-differences-58c5cab76639">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The era of David v.&nbsp;Goliath  The era of moderation  Stuff happens   1. I’ll just talk about two main things this week — both of which speak to the moment that we are currently in. The first is the Apple App Store backlash. <p>It’s worth noting — it’s still pretty unclear how any of this plays out. Apple is in a strong position in terms of its loyal user base, the quality of its products and ecosystem, and also possibly in the eyes of the law (disclaimer: I am not a lawyer). It’s Apple’s App Store and Apple gets to call the&nbsp;shots.</p><p>Plus, I’ve been an iPhone user since the 5S and I don’t see myself switching anytime soon. (Not that it would make a huge difference since Google — aside from allowing you to access apps outside the Play Store, essentially follows the same type of&nbsp;model.)</p><p>And Apple has taken criticism before from disgruntled developers.</p><p>But what all of this shows is that this time, it’s different.</p>Photo: Fortune Global&nbsp;Forum<p>Whatever you want to call it — the establishment, the status quo, Big Tech monopolies — people have never been more distrustful and/or critical of the large institutions that rule over us. As one of the world’s largest multinational corporations with a market cap of ~$2 trillion, Apple easily falls into that&nbsp;camp.</p><p>That distrust has been brewing for some time, but for the most part, I’m not sure people had a real sense of belief that things could change. It’s Apple. What are you going to do about&nbsp;it?</p><p>That’s what makes this moment different — the growing sense of belief that change is suddenly possible. It’s not just about Apple and the App Store, either. You don’t have to look around very much to see that this moment applies to everything — our platforms, our politics, our society in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney certainly senses the moment. His latest coalition is a call to&nbsp;arms.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/apple-google-coalition-epic-match-spotify.html">NYTimes&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>For months, complaints from tech companies against Apple’s and Google’s power have grown&nbsp;louder.</blockquote><blockquote>Spotify, the music streaming app, criticized Apple for the rules it imposed in the App Store. A founder of the software company Basecamp attacked Apple’s “highway robbery rates” on apps. And last month, Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, sued Apple and Google, claiming they violated antitrust rules.</blockquote><blockquote>Now these app makers are uniting in an unusual show of opposition against Apple and Google and the power they have over their app stores. On Thursday, the smaller companies said they had formed the Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit group that plans to push for changes in the app stores and “protect the app economy.” The 13 initial members include Spotify, Basecamp, Epic and Match Group, which has apps like Tinder and&nbsp;Hinge.</blockquote><blockquote>“They’ve collectively decided, ‘We’re not alone in this, and maybe what we should do is advocate on behalf of everybody,’” said Sarah Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the group. She added that the new nonprofit would be “a voice for&nbsp;many.”</blockquote><p>What the coalition is fighting&nbsp;for:</p><blockquote>At the heart of the new alliance’s effort is opposition to Apple’s and Google’s tight grip on their app stores and the fortunes of the apps in them. The two companies control virtually all of the world’s smartphones through their software and the distribution of apps via their stores. Both also charge a 30 percent fee for payments made inside apps in their&nbsp;systems.</blockquote><blockquote>App makers have increasingly taken issue with the payment rules, arguing that a 30 percent fee is a tax that hobbles their ability to compete. In some cases, they have said, they are competing with Apple’s and Google’s own apps and their unfair advantages.</blockquote><blockquote>On Thursday, the coalition published a list of 10 principles, outlined on its website, for what it said were fairer app practices. They include a more transparent process for getting apps approved and the right to communicate directly with their users. The top principle states that developers should not be forced to exclusively use the payments systems of the app store publishers.</blockquote><p>Reality check: At best, this is simply the beginning of a movement that is fundamentally a story of David v. Goliath. Despite the success of Fortnite, Apple is still 200x the size of Epic Games. And more recently, Apple’s has centered the narrative of the company’s future around “services.” Expect Tim Cook to stand his&nbsp;ground.</p><p>And the Goliaths of the world have been steadfast and reaping the rewards for some&nbsp;time.</p><p>But like I said, this time, it’s different:</p><blockquote>Scrutiny of the largest tech companies has reached a new intensity. The Department of Justice is expected to file an antitrust case against Google as soon as next week, focused on the company’s dominance in internet search. In July, Congress grilled the chief executives of Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook about their practices in a high-profile antitrust hearing. And in Europe, regulators have opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple’s App Store tactics and are preparing to bring antitrust charges against Amazon for abusing its dominance in internet commerce.</blockquote><p>Grab some popcorn. Whatever happens, it’s a bit thrilling that the Davids of the world are starting to believe again,&nbsp;no?</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://appfairness.org/">the coalition’s site here</a>, where they <a href="https://appfairness.org/our-vision/">outline their 10 principles</a>.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-opens-new-fight-with-apple-over-messaging">Facebook Opens New Fight With Apple Over Messaging</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage">Justice Dept.

The second thing we’ll highlight this week is really about the challenges of operating a platform in this current climate. Which is sort of a catch-22 seeing as the nature of our platforms have themselves deeply contributed to where we’ve ended up. Just look at Facebook. <p>And I’m not talking about the Facebook that you and I use. I’m talking about the internal Facebook that Facebook employees use.</p><p>Ina Fried:</p><blockquote>Driving the news: As political arguments on Facebook’s employee discussion boards have grown more heated and divisive, the company ordered new restrictions on the forums earlier this month, which run on Facebook’s Workplace platform.</blockquote><blockquote>Last week, the company banned employees from replacing their profile photos on the system with activist&nbsp;images.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s difficulty managing its own employees using its own social network suggests that the company’s problems might be rooted more in the conception and design of its products than in the fiery state of today’s public discourse.</blockquote><blockquote>Catch up quick: Facebook, like most Silicon Valley companies, has long prided itself on an open culture embracing free debate, epitomized by regular staff meetings where CEO Mark Zuckerberg answers employee questions.</blockquote><p>Mark’s solution has been to create “dedicated spaces&nbsp;… for discussing charged topics, with clear rules and strong moderation.”</p><p>Which makes you wonder — how will that make Facebook think about actual Facebook? The difference, of course, is that divisive engagement internally is bad because it makes the company dysfunctional. But divisive engagement on Facebook proper, despite contributing to a more dysfunctional society, is super aligned with their core ad-based business&nbsp;model.</p><p>Because what we’re learning — and frankly, what people have intuitively known for some time — is that the engagement that these platforms promote is probably not that&nbsp;great:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: What’s bugging so many Facebook workers is the same problem some of Facebook’s 3 billion users identified a long time&nbsp;ago.</blockquote>  By shunting so many different dimensions of our online communications onto the same platform — from school connections to family members and workplace acquaintances to people with shared interests — Facebook makes it impossible to keep different facets of our lives from overlapping.  <blockquote>The scholar Danah Boyd popularized the phrase “context collapse” to describe the tendency of social networks to flatten our&nbsp;lives.</blockquote>  Now that dynamic is pushing Facebook, which has staked out a content moderation policy that treads lightly on limiting political speech in public, to curtail the political speech of its own employees.  <blockquote>The catch: Facebook’s internal moderators will now have to figure out how to draw a clean line between “charged topics” and everything else.</blockquote><blockquote>Everything Facebook touches today has a political dimension, and everything from user interface design to machine-learning code to marketing materials has social and political dimensions that can trigger “charged” exchanges.</blockquote><p>I’m not going to put too much blame on Facebook for this one. They’re figuring things out along with the rest of us. But it certainly raises a bunch of important questions as we look to build the&nbsp;future.</p><p>And in an age when every company is also a messaging company (see: Zoom, below), these are questions that every platform will need to ask itself (and in a way, they’ll be able to come at it from a different perspective since companies like Zoom and Discord aren’t built on ad-based business&nbsp;models.)</p><p>Because how do we want to shape the incentives that define our communities such that we can constructively evolve as a&nbsp;society?</p><p>In any case, the road ahead won’t be easy or straightforward.</p><p>Certainly <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-13a2568e-e823-475a-88b8-eb370237d273.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">not for Facebook</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of high-profile Facebook critics on Friday announced the launch of what they are calling the “Real Facebook Oversight Board.” As Sara Fischer reports, it’s an effort that aims to counter an independent board established by Facebook last year to oversee its decisions on content moderation.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: The opposing effort represents how political the fight between Facebook and its critics has become in the lead-up to the presidential election.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: The group includes leaders from the Stop Hate for Profit boycott, like Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, and Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, as well as prominent Facebook critics like Roger McNamee and some journalists and&nbsp;pundits.</blockquote><p>So yeah, tomorrow’s presidential debate will be interesting.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zoom-invests-in-big-messaging-upgrade-in-challenge-to-slack">Zoom Invests in Big Messaging Upgrade in Challenge to&nbsp;Slack</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/opinion/2020-election-security-tech.html">America’s Tech Billionaires Could Help Protect the Election.

  <p>Suddenly, everybody was home. You became a homeschool teacher and you learned how to host a corporate happy hour over Zoom. Your new puppy started making guest appearances in your team calls. You downloaded a new app to deliver your groceries. Covid-19 impacted the entire world as <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">online apps and services</a> became our primary way to get things done.</p>

<p>Businesses had to figure out how to serve their <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customers</a> and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">employees</a> remotely as much as possible through new channels at unprecedented scale, regardless of age and geography, and quickly realized the importance of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/connect-everyone">digital experiences</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the question is when will things get back to “normal?” What will normal even be? And will our new digital habits stick?</p>

 
 


 The New Normal – Living Life Online 

<p>ForgeRock just completed a global survey that captures how the pandemic is affecting consumer behavior. Here are four key <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112234584/infographic/new-normal-infographic.png">findings</a>:&nbsp;</p>

  Nearly half of all consumers polled say they will use more online services even with things return to normal. 
	 The second point, which should be a warning, is that more than one-third (35%) say a difficult <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">log-in process</a> would cause them to cancel their account, while 32% said they would look for another service. 
	 Third, consumers 65 and older are really embracing the new digital lifestyles, with 31% saying they will only shop online when this is all over. 
	 Finally,&nbsp; this shift isn’t just among retirees.&nbsp;A&nbsp;third of consumers ages 18-24 say they won’t go back to stadiums or theatres, instead they’ll keep watching sports, concerts, and movies online. 
 <p>So, about that new normal, while no one knows exactly what’s next, it’s clear that we have very low tolerance for poor digital experiences and will, without hesitation, switch to apps and services that deliver easy, productive user<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity"> </a>experiences. This provides the greatest opportunity for businesses to thrive through any disruption.</p>

<p>Check out our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/view/112194411/industry-brief/forgerock-consumer-behavior-report-the-new-normal.pdf">report</a> for great insight into what consumers have to say about their online experiences and how their behavior is changing now and in the future.

<p>Then earlier this year the pandemic appeared. Suddenly, everyone was working from home and any customers still physically interacting with brands shifted to 100% digital—or very close to it.

  <p>The events of 2020 have caused many organizations to push digital initiatives forward at unprecedented speed. This acceleration of digital business means making choices about which initiatives move forward or slow down.</p>
<p>Kasey Panetta, Gartner Senior Content Marketing Manager, interviews <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/19321/Hung-LeHong">Hung LeHong</a>, VP and Gartner Fellow, to discuss the framework for <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">digital business acceleration</a> and how to use the five lanes to prioritize your digital initiatives for better results.</p>
 Listen now 
<p>For the full interview, listen to the podcast or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length.<br>
</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 We're going to start with the basics. Can you explain the general concept of accelerating digital and why it's so important now? 
<p>Probably the best way to think about it is what we've actually been through, what a lot of us would call the lockdown. I mean, the speeds at which we moved digital forward were incredible. I've talked with enterprises that have set up e-commerce in two weeks, which is incredible. We've never seen that kind of speed and acceleration before. So we're starting with a base point of incredibly fast acceleration for digital. Gartner recently surveyed boards of directors, and essentially 69% of the board of directors said that they intend to accelerate digital business.</p>
<p>And so the concept of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-digital-business-acceleration-means-to-todays-organizations/">digital business acceleration</a> says that, “Can I keep that momentum going? Can I keep that same level of speed and urgency? Digital helped me during the lockdown, everything from making things virtual, to reducing costs and reaching out to customers. Now customers are used to these things. Can I keep that going?”</p>
 Gartner created a framework to help clients think about this concept of accelerating digital. Can you explain it? 
<p>The framework has two parts. The first one is about setting the organization up for speed to actually accelerate. For example, funding may be very slow, there are a lot of approvals to go through. Or our decision making process is really slow. So how can organizations streamline to diffuse those drags to actually make and act on decisions faster. Can we amplify or what we call apply force multipliers to things? Can we change to more of an agile based of thinking, not just within IT, but in the rest of our business so that we can accelerate.</p>
<p>It’s also imperative to redirect resources, coming to terms with the fact if we want to focus on speed we must focus on certain initiatives because we can't do everything. Organizations have to be willing to take resources, like people or time or partners and so forth, and actually put them toward the areas to accelerate. So for example, taking away resources from upgrading some kind of technology system and putting it toward customer-facing digital interactions. That would be a good example of redirecting resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We surveyed a number of enterprises and some of them answered that 100% of their interactions with customers recently have actually been digital and they've set it up that way</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Preparing for speed is not so much a methodology or a process. It's actually a mindset, and we call it rethinking value. Organizations and leadership teams must consider the way that they deliver value or what value looks like in the eyes of a customer in the future.</p>
<p>The second part of the framework&nbsp; is the immediate direction. If you're going to accelerate, if you're set up for speed, well, what directions should you take? We use a car analogy with different lanes on a highway. So imagine dividing digital investments into five lanes on a highway, each having a specific purpose.</p>
 Let’s discuss the first lane — the fast lane. You mentioned work from home, but what other kinds of initiatives should live in this lane? 
<p>You want to look at everything that you did during lockdown as an enterprise at lightning speed. And the reason we call it the fast lane is because your leadership already granted the funding, right? Your leadership already said it's okay to reach out to all customers using digital. And you want to take advantage of that funding, that acceptance from leadership and of course the investments in the technology, and essentially take them to the finish line.</p>
<p>Stabilize them. As you mentioned, work at home or the hybrid variation of that is a great example: What is that percentage of work from home versus hybrid versus work in the office? A second example is the nature of customer interactions during the lockdown. We surveyed a number of enterprises and some of them answered that 100% of their interactions with customers recently have actually been digital and they've set it up that way.</p>
<p>Again, that was the lockdown version. What is it going to look like in the new normal? It's probably not going to be 100%, but go ahead and figure out what that will be and actually stabilize it. So that's another example of something that's in the actual fast lane.</p>
 The second lane is called the growth lane. So what kind of initiatives should digital leaders be looking for in this area? 
<p>The growth lane is for enterprises that maybe are more aggressive. They want to leapfrog others in the pandemic. They want to take advantage of opportunities that exist out there because of the pandemic, simple examples, as customer needs start to change. The example of curbside pickup, maybe that becomes really important, maybe drive-through becomes really important. Maybe consumers actually don't necessarily want to go into a restaurant as much as they do.</p>
<p>And the concept of what some people call cloud kitchens, which are really shared kitchens where you make the meal, but you don't actually have customers come in and sit, becomes more popular. Or maybe if you're in the public sector, the notion of renewing your driver's license by going into office just no longer exists and we can get a lot more volume, a lot more efficiency by doing it remotely. These are all examples of what we would call the growth lane.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A company that's quite aggressive, that wants to take advantage of digital, can really leapfrog</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so it's not just about customer needs changing. I think that's the more obvious thing. What we've also seen is our regulations start to change. For example, in the U.K., the land registry is now taking e-signatures. So aggressive companies in the real estate market can take advantage of that, “Hey, now we're allowed e-signatures, so we can make the process of buying a home a lot smoother, a lot faster.”</p>
<p>Some of the stock markets all over the world have removed the regulation to have physical stock trading, opening up the door for many different kinds of things. Some of our clients have the okay for their buyer, who happens to be the government, where instead of coming in for the inspection of something that's being built and actually visually looking at it, they've had the okay to do it via video for the first time ever.</p>
<p>These changes of regulations or these roadblocks against digital that existed in the past that have been removed. A company that's quite aggressive, that wants to take advantage of digital, can really leapfrog. So those are examples of what we would classify within that growth lane.</p>
 How do you make a business case for a risky investment in this kind of climate? 
<p>This is why I actually use the word aggressive. It has to do a lot with what your board of directors, your investors, your CFO think about future growth. A lot of companies that are aggressive have those reserves to make those leapfrog actions. So for organizations that have the cash, or reserves, the business case is fairly straightforward. I think that's a very best case scenario.</p>
<p>If you're in a situation where the cash reserves are fairly limited, or you have a lot of problems actually funding it, it actually becomes quite problematic. To continue momentum, we encourage more of a portfolio-style thinking.</p>
<p>For example, maybe 80, 90, 95% of your investment is in the fast lane or the fix-it lane, but you hedge your bets a bit and maybe have a little bit in that growth lane. So that relative thinking of portfolio thinking allows companies that have a hard time finding the funding and the resources to pursue the growth plane to have a foot in that door.</p>
 How do you identify what initiatives would be best for your organization? It seems like there would be a lot of different options and opportunities. 
<p>I'd say the first thing, usually the first thing in all cases, is following the customer, where's the actual customer going? For aggressive companies, that may mean being in places before the customer wants or knows to want to be there.</p>
<p>The second thing, frankly, and, and I know this sounds a little bit loosey goosey for me to say this, but opportunistically, think about mergers and acquisitions. Think about situations where other companies or competitors, or even fintechs, you know, some of these startups, it's a tough climate for everybody. They of course are in a financially bad situation. So the opportunity comes up to be merged, acquired, converged, whatever language you want to use.</p>
<p>Because the opportunities are not defined, because you don't know ahead of time, we recommend reserving some capabilities or capital essentially to do these kinds of things.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-covid-19-downtime-to-upskill-for-digital/">Use COVID-19 Downtime to Upskill for Digital</a></p>
 The third lane is the fix-it lane. It seems like it'd be very relevant to businesses right now. Can you explain a little bit about who should be thinking about these types of investments and initiatives? 
<p>A lot of organizations in various stages of pandemic recovery are thinking as an enterprise, ”We're just not set up correctly for this new world.” For example, the cost structure may be too high and digital tools, such as automation and self-serve tools that help reduce the cost, might not be there. That's where the fix-it lane starts to come in.</p>
<p>But what's also interesting is the mirror image of that, where we have enterprises out there that are actually going through the exact opposite of bigger reductions in operations or sales. They're seeing increases in volumes and growth. So a very simple example of this is maybe the digital commerce business unit, or some parts of healthcare. Their volumes went through the roof and they'll probably continue to go that route. So the fix-it lane goes both ways. Are you too big? Are you not big enough? Can you scale up, can you scale down?</p>
 The fourth lane is the slow lane. What kind of initiatives belong in the slow lane? 
<p>First of all, why is there a slow lane? The slow lane is there because to go fast, often our clients have to slow some things down. The slow lane is about looking at the list of digital initiatives that you were working on even before the pandemic, and of course through the pandemic itself, and determining resources. For those initiatives that shouldn’t be killed, consider treading water with them, meaning keep them going, but at a minimal level so that resources can be redirected toward other things.</p>
<p>So for example, maybe you were looking at something like an ERP upgrade and on top of your ERP upgrade, you had all these bells and whistles that you wanted to pursue. By putting the ERP upgrade in the slow lane, maybe you do the upgrade, but you hold off on the bells and whistles.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that you're going to stop them. What you're going to do is you're going to meter them so that they get implemented over a much longer period of time, because they're not as critical as working on a digital initiative with customers like creating a customer portal, mobile app or customer-facing things.</p>
 You mentioned completely stopping and killing, which is not the idea in the slow lane, but is the idea for the final lane — the exit lane. So what kind of initiatives are you seeing in this area? 
<p>That's exactly the right understanding of the exit lane. You will kill some projects. The first category of projects that you're likely going to kill are those risky bets that you made pre-pandemic. Maybe you were going to move into a new adjacent industry with a new digital product of some kind, but because of the pandemic, you put it on hold.</p>
<p>And then as you're emerging out of the pandemic, you're seeing that the market is just not ready to absorb that new digital product or service. So you actually stop it and take those resources that you've now canceled and move those people, that funding and the time toward other projects.</p>
 Do you find executives really struggle to identify areas that they can put in the exit lane? 
<p>Absolutely. I think all of us, as leaders, get attached to our pet projects and so that becomes very complicated. To be able to do this whole portfolio-type exercise, you must consider the bigger picture. If you go into the weeds and ask middle management, of course they're going to say we can't kill that project. You actually have to bring it up a notch for the better of the company, or even more specifically for the better of the customers or citizens and look at it within that light.</p>
 What about companies that want to embrace digital acceleration, but they might not be able to afford investing in new initiatives at this point? 
<p>For those organizations, there are a couple of alternatives. The first one, of course, is they can do nothing. In other words, go very, very slowly. The danger in that is that they upset their customers. They're not in tune with what the market wants, which in a private sector situation means competition gets a lot harder for them and bad things happen.</p>
<p>The second thing is to look for funding elsewhere. We've had companies that maybe the culture and even the way that they actually fund is not pro digital, but by creating a separate group — and in some cases, literally a separate legal entity — that allows you to do two things:</p>
 
 Contain the risk only to this little separate entity 
 Allow the separate entity to move forward unimpeded by the culture or the ways of funding or whatever it is that was slowing down digital before, and they can move on their own 
 
<p>And then after that, what the organization can do is take a look at that separate entity and say, yeah, here's some things that we can take within our organization. Or you can even fold the entire organization back into that organization to then kick-start the legacy” organization.</p>
<p>So those are rather extreme ways to get digital going for a company that's really not into digital, but frankly it has to be extreme. And I don't have to point any more to lockdown to say that that was an extreme situation that got a lot of companies going.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">Lead Through Volatility With Adaptive Strategy</a></p>
 Is there any final thought that you want to share? 
<p>Remember the acceleration that happened during lockdown. We've had some of our clients even call the lockdown the honeymoon period because for the first time ever, projects and initiatives were pursued in a matter of days, if not a week or two, because the leadership team was aligned. Everybody knew that they had to do it because the funding was there and at no other point in history have we had something that easy for digital. So remember that and try to port some of that into the near-term future so that you can actually accelerate. It's that kind of speed and urgency that you want to capture.</p>

  <p>This month we announced some exciting enhancements to ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">Identity Cloud</a>. All of the updates we make to our platform are done with your realities and requirements in mind. The year 2020 has taken a toll on many businesses all over the world, and this has put increasing pressure on IT teams. Our customers are seeing online traffic like never before.&nbsp;The journey towards <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/digital-transformation">digital transformation</a> has been turbo-charged as we move through the pandemic and prepare for what’s next.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organizations are doing everything they can to go digital while prioritizing the delivery of&nbsp; exceptional user experiences. At the same time, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/security">security</a> and trust remain critical to keep customers, partners, and employees safe online and in person. And while there is a big rush to the cloud, firms may be struggling with how to do it safely, securely, and without disrupting business.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As companies weigh their cloud decisions, they are starting to raise critical questions about commonly held myths regarding cloud migration: Is the cloud really less secure and compliant? Does everything have to go to the cloud? Is it more expensive?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: The answer is absolutely not. We busted these myths last week during <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">Identity Live: Cloud Edition</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To kick off our event, ForgeRock CEO Fran Rosch and retired U.S. General and KKR partner David H. Petraeus discussed the CIA’s journey to the cloud, which began in 2013. At one time, security was one of the main reasons that many organizations elected not to adopt cloud solutions. Today, security is one of the many benefits of the cloud due to the scale of investment in security that cloud service providers have made – investments far beyond the scope of individual organizations. Knowing that the CIA has trusted the cloud for nearly 10 years reinforces this point.</p>

<p>While many companies have cloud-first strategies, we recognize that not all workloads are created equal. We were excited to chat with Amol Kabe, senior director of product management at <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/partner/google-cloud">Google Cloud</a>, about the need for choice and flexibility. We’re here to help our customers embrace the power of the cloud and also work within their own <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/deployments/multicloud-hybrid-cloud-identity-solution">hybrid</a> realities. We polled the Identity Live audience and found that 80% expect to remain in a hybrid cloud world for at least five more years. On premises, your cloud, or our cloud – we will make it work for you.</p>

<p>We will keep working to enable excellent digital experiences. General Petraeus believes the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">login</a> experience will be a differentiator, and we could not agree more. Personalization matters. Ease of use matters. Security matters. The outcome for a great user experience? It’s pretty simple. Do it fast, do it right, and do it now. We understand the need for a superior experience and, at the same time, ensure that this will not diminish security in any way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also had the pleasure of hearing from Daryl Robbins, senior director of global architecture at Calabrio about their journey to the cloud. One of the reasons Calabrio chose ForgeRock to manage their 1.3 million digital identities is because of our full tenant isolation security capability. With ForgeRock, they never have to worry about their data being commingled with other customer data. From the administrator login screen to API endpoints and from the data to the application stack itself, there is no data traversal across those planes. We live, breathe, and sleep security, and we pledge to do that for you and all our customers. While we securely manage their IAM, Calabrio can focus on building incredible experiences for their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock delivers simple truths – with no surprises. Moving to the <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">cloud</a> does not have to be more expensive. Having an unplanned uptick in traffic should not be costly. In times of uncertainty, we’ll provide you with more certainty. If you’re experiencing Black Friday-like numbers every day, we are here to help you <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/whitepaper/ten-iam-capabilities-to-support-remote-work">scale up</a> &nbsp;– at no additional expense to you.</p>

<p>Cloud without compromise. Great experiences. No surprises. That’s what ForgeRock delivers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that you’re facing immense pressure to adapt and respond to a new normal. We are here to help you plan your IAM future along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to all of our customers and partners for attending Identity Live: Cloud Edition!&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to revisit the action from our event? Watch each of the replays <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">here</a>. </p>

  <p>Despite the global impact of COVID-19, 47% of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence (AI) investments</a> were unchanged since the start of the pandemic and 30% of organizations actually planned to increase such investments, according to a Gartner poll. Only 16% had temporarily suspended AI investments, and just 7% had decreased them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI is starting to deliver on its potential and its benefits for businesses are becoming a reality</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the pandemic, for example, AI came to the rescue. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/chatbots-will-appeal-to-modern-workers/">Chatbots</a> helped answer the flood of pandemic-related questions, computer vision helped maintain social distancing and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/understand-3-key-types-of-machine-learning/">machine learning (ML)</a> models were indispensable for modeling the effects of reopening economies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37038"]</p>
<p>“If AI as a general concept was positioned on this year’s Gartner Hype Cycle, it would be rolling off the Peak of Inflated Expectations. By that we mean that AI is starting to deliver on its potential and its benefits for businesses are becoming a reality,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/40906">Svetlana Sicular</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
<p>Five new entrants — small data, generative AI, composite AI, responsible AI and things as customers — make their debut on this year’s AI Hype Cycle, and two megatrends dominate this year’s AI landscape.</p>
<p>Learn more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">About the Gartner Hype Cycle Methodology</a></p>
 Democratization of Artificial Intelligence 
<p>The democratization of AI means that AI is no longer the exclusive subject matter of experts. Now, organizations want to reach the next level by delivering AI value to more people. In the enterprise, the target for democratization of AI may include customers, business partners, business executives, salespeople, assembly line workers, application developers and IT operations professionals.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gartner foresees developers being the major force in AI</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As AI reaches a larger set of employees and partners, it requires new enterprise roles to deliver it to a wider audience. Along with data scientists and data engineers, developers could also form the future AI teams who put together AI solutions. Gartner foresees developers being the major force in AI.</p>
<p>Data science deals with discovery of the unknown, but engineering provides the stability, reliability and security of what science delivers. Engineering complements data science to deliver AI at scale, and AI developer and teaching kits represent the role on the Hype Cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Industrialization of AI platforms 
<p>The industrialization of AI platforms enables the reusability, scalability and safety of AI, which accelerates its adoption and growth. This industrialization aims at getting new adopters of AI on par with early adopters.</p>
<p>According to a recent Gartner survey, the C-suite is steering AI projects, with nearly 30% of projects directed by CEOs. Having the C-suite in the driver’s seat accelerates AI adoption and investment in AI solutions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Responsible AI and AI governance also become a priority for AI on an industrial scale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, decision intelligence indicates that companies want to use AI to make better decisions faster, such as selecting best treatment options for patients or accelerating discovery and prevention of anomalies and vulnerabilities. Moreover, new entrants on this year’s Hype Cycle, such as generative AI, small data and composite AI, indicate that in addition to ML, organizations are considering multiple means of supporting decision making with AI.</p>
<p>Responsible AI and AI governance also become a priority for AI on an industrial scale. They establish and refine processes for handling AI-related business decisions and manage AI risks associated with compliance, privacy and bias. They also address the trustworthiness of AI, which is the top AI challenge today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When AI solutions mature, organizations learn a lot and make fewer mistakes. However, they should keep learning, because new challenges such as deep fakes and AI security will arise as AI adoption progresses.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Have you run across an error message vaguely referencing SameSite in your .NET Apps? Read on, it’s time for a change to your code - and I’ll explain why.</p>

<p>I like cookies, both the custard stuffed and the dry ones (which I use to dunk in my coffee or tea). This post is very much about cookies - only not the delicious, culinary ones. As in many other cases (think of the web, for example), the computer and internet world has re-branded some common language terms to identify new concepts in the IT domain with perceived similarities. Even the term computer was before used to refer human beings whose job was to compute calculations (have you watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures">Hidden Figures</a>?)</p>

<p>In the web (and I mean World-Wide-Web), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">HTTP cookies</a> (simply cookies in the rest of the post) are little pieces of data that you don’t interact directly with.</p>

<p>When you surf with your browser for example, under the hood many internet transactions occur between your computer and one or more other computers located elsewhere. It is a classic client-server scenario, where your computer issues requests to remote ones and (hopefully) gets answers from them.</p>

<p>If we look deeper, though, we discover that the answers can contain more information than the one you see in the browser. Information that is not meant to be rendered or presented, but it’s fundamental for the lower-level handshake between the two endpoints. Among these additional information elements, there are so-called “cookies”.</p>

 Cookies? Why We Need Them 

<p>On the web, computers are known by their addresses, which are basically numbers (32 bits in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a>, or 128 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>). So let’s suppose that you and I are clients of the same bank and that our bank exposes their services on the web with an endpoint having address “1”. I have a computer with address “2” and your computer has address “3”. Then, when I request my bank statement, the bank server receives a request from address “2”, so it knows which statement to respond with. Similarly, if you issue the same request, the server will receive it from address “3”, and you will receive your (not mine), statement. We are good and safe, right?</p>

<p>Well, what if I can access your computer? And what if I can change my computer’s address to “3” and pretend to be you? No, this is not safe enough. Let’s say that the bank server requires that you and I send some secret identity information with the request. So, before clicking on the “Get Statement” button on the page, I have to write my name and a password, which is sent to the server with the statement request. The server will check the identity and respond accordingly. Better, right?</p>

<p>Sort of!</p>

<p>The problem is that with this policy we need to write user name and password every time we make a request in the bank portal. I don’t know about you, but I would get annoyed quickly and hate internet banking.</p>

<p>Ok, let’s allow the server to “remember”. Before having access to your bank account, you perform a login transaction, insert your credentials, and ask the server to remember you. After that, you are no longer required to insert your credentials, the server “remembers” that requests from address “3” are from you. Of course, I could still change my address to “3” and steal your money… still no good.</p>

<p>That’s why, when you log in on your website, what really happens is that the server builds up a piece of data (usually called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_ID">session token</a>) bound to your identity, and sends it back to the browser. This token is not shown by the browser, but safely stored locally in your computer. From this point on, every time your browser issues requests to the bank server, it will embed this information into the request, and the server will know what session that request is coming from. If I want to access your account, I not only need to change my address but also know your session token (which not even you know) and make my browser send it with my requests, which is not easy even for the most astute hacker. The only way would be for me to operate in your computer after you logged in and before you logged out or your session token expires (usually a few minutes). Now, this is finally better (BTW I recommend you always explicitly log out instead of simply close the browser).</p>

<p>That session token that the server generates and your browser stores and resends - that is our little sweet cookie.</p>

 A Usage Example 

<p>Let’s pretend you are developing a web portal with sensible information that must be shielded behind an identity policy. You are willing to delegate the management if the identity policy to a specialized provider, who gives you peace of mind and saves you to develop your own user protection layer. <a href="https://www.okta.com/">Okta</a> is such a provider. Our scenario is made of three entities</p>

 
   Your application (APP), served by the app.com domain 
   The application user (USER) 
   The security provider (OKTA), served by the okta.com domain 
 

<p>Let’s drill down into a simple operation flow</p>

 
   USER browses into a protected page in APP 
   APP receives this first request but it doesn’t know USER yet 
   APP asks identity info to OKTA 
   OKTA displays the login page 
   USER enters her credentials and logs in 
   OKTA verifies the credentials and gives back to APP an identity token with an expiration time of 5 minutes 
   APP is happy and returns to the browser the desired page 
   After 5 minutes the identity token expires 
   APP asks identity info to OKTA 
   Go to step 4 
 

<p>Will USER be happy to repeat the login every 5 minutes? Probably not.</p>

<p>That’s why in step 6 OKTA adds a refresh-token cookie to its answer. So how does this make the flow different?</p>

 
   USER browses into a protected page in APP 
   APP receives this first request but it doesn’t know USER yet 
   APP asks identity info to OKTA 
   OKTA displays the login page 
   USER enters her credentials and logs in 
   OKTA verifies the credentials and gives back to APP an identity token with an expiration time 5 minutes AND a refresh-token cookie 
   APP is happy and returns to the browser the desired page 
   After 5 minutes the identity token expires 
   APP asks identity info to OKTA 
   OKTA receives the refresh-token cookie, and after verifying it, responds directly a new identity token, without login 
   Go to step 7 
 

 The Same Site Policy 

<p>One important feature of cookies is that they are domain-aware. What this means is that the browser adds them to a request only when that request is bound to the same domain which initially sent the cookie back. In other words, the refresh-token will be sent from the browser only in requests to okta.com, not other domains.</p>

<p>In step 3, USER is happily surfing APP (.app.com) and a request is sent to Okta (.okta.com). The refresh-token hasn’t been created yet, so USER is presented with the Okta login page. In step 6 a refresh-token is returned from Okta (.okta.com), so the token is associated with the domain okta.com.</p>

<p>From now up to step 9, all requests are sent to app.com, so the refresh-token is not sent. But in step 9 the request goes to okta.com, so the refresh-token is sent through. Notice, though, that the browser is still showing a page served by APP, from the app.com domain.  This is what is normally called a cross-site-request (CSR).</p>

 Cross-Site Request and the Forgery Danger 

<p>CSRs are an important feature that makes users experience better, but are open to misuse in a kind of cyber attack called cross-site-request-forgery (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a>).</p>

<p>Malicious websites could, in fact, issue a request to a third-party website. As an example:</p>

 
   You browse www.foo.com, which uses a back-end service at api.foo.com. Some cookies get stored locally, associated with the foo.com domain 
   Then you move to www.baz.com, which issues a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>/<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a> (no change of page) request to api.foo.com. The browser takes all the cookies associated to foo.com and sends them through. If api.foo.com relies only on cookies to determine the legitimacy of the request, it will answer as though the request came from www.foo.com, and this is clearly a security breach. Note that the user in front of the computer wouldn’t be aware of this, since it occurs behind the scenes. 
 

 The SameSite Cookie’s Attribute 

<p>For this reason, changes have been introduced on how the browsers manage cookies in CSR scenarios. Long story short, we can today summarize three scenarios</p>

<p>A) Pre 2016. This is the legacy scenario, where browsers always send cookies for a domain whenever a request is made to that domain (as above)</p>

<p>B) After 2016 up to 2019/20. A new feature is introduced for cookies. When issuing a cookie, servers can mark it with a SameSite attribute. SameSite has two possible valid values: Lax and Strict. There are then 3 different possible behaviors for web browsers:</p>


  
    
      SameSite Value
      SameSite Behavior
      Browser sends Cookies
    
  
  
    
      Unspecified or Wrong
      None
      Always (as scenario A)
    
    
      Lax
      Lax
      Last navigation action is to the cookie domain
    
    
      Strict
      Strict
      Current content is from the cookie domain
    
  


<p>With this, foo.com can mark the refresh-token cookie as SameSite=Lax, and no cookie will be sent to api.foo.com for requests from baz.com or other domains different from foo.com.</p>

<p>This is an opt-in non-breaking feature. If websites don’t change anything, they still work as before (SameSite unspecified =&gt; legacy behavior). And this is what most of them chose to do, actually.</p>

<p>C) Latest (Chrome). To push the adoption of the SameSite feature as a new anti-CSRF measure, Google decided to change how Chrome works (from version 80), announcing the Incrementally Better Cookies initiative.</p>

<p>Now a new, valid value has been added to SameSite:</p>

<p>None.</p>

<p>Changes are as follows:</p>


  
    
      SameSite Value
      SameSite Behavior
      Browser sends Cookies
    
  
  
    
      Unspecified or Wrong
      Lax
      Last navigation action is to the cookie domain
    
    
      Lax
      Lax
      Last navigation action is to the cookie domain
    
    
      Strict
      Strict
      Current content is from the cookie domain
    
    
      None
      None
      Always (as scenario A)
    
  


<p>This is an opt-out breaking change. The default behavior is not None (legacy), but Lax. Which means that application relying on cookies being always sent do not work any longer, forcing their owners to establish and implement a SameSite policy.</p>

 The Same Site Issue 

<p>Unfortunately, this is not the only consequence of this choice made by Google. Earlier (but still in use) versions of Safari are affected by a bug (which won’t be fixed). They implement the first specifications for SameSite (B), but in case of wrong value for the SameSite attribute, they fall back to Strict instead of None. And, as in B None is not part of valid values for SameSite, these browser takes it as wrong, falling back to Strict. Do you see the problem? To restore your web site to the pre-SameSite functionality</p>

 
   If the browser is Chrome, you need to set SameSite = None 
   if the browser is in a range of Safari versions, you need to remove the SameSite = None and let it unspecified, otherwise, you get SameSite = Strict 
 

<p>The following table shows how different browsers operate with the SameSite attribute.</p>


  
    
      Browser    /   SameSite Value
      Unspecified

 How to Fix the Same Site Issue 

<p>Fixing the Same Site issue requires additional logic in web servers, where the requesting browser is detected and becomes part of the calculation of the correct value for the cookies’ SameSite attribute.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Detecting the requesting browser type goes under the nomenclature of user-agent-sniffing. Among the wealthy amount of handshake information included in the HTTP protocol, we find a header named User-Agent. This is a string whose format is not standardized, therefore some attention must be paid when interpreting the value. Fortunately, it seems that the community has distilled an accepted pattern. There are three groups of user agents that need SameSite non-specified when the desired behavior is None:</p>

 
   User-Agent contains “CPU iPhone OS 12” or  “iPad; CPU OS 12” =&gt; iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad with iOS 12 
   User-Agent contains “Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14”, “Version/”,  or “Safari” =&gt; Mac OS X Safari 
   User-Agent contains “Chrome/5” or “Chrome/6” =&gt; Chrome 50-69 and pre-Chromium Edge 
 

 Example of ASP.NET Core C# Implementation 

<p>As an example, for an ASP.NET Core (including pre 3.1 versions), the code to be included in your application could be the following.</p>

 
   An extension method for the Service Collection (ConfigureNonBreakingSameSiteCookies in the following snippet)

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
   // Add this before any other middleware that might write cookies
   app.UseCookiePolicy();

   // This will write cookies, so make sure it's after the cookie policy
   app.UseAuthentication();
}

   What is the SameSite cookie’s attribute and why it was introduced 
   How the Same Site feature changed in response to a poor server-side adoption 
   How the Same Site Issue was generated, and why it requires web app owner to implement changes in their codebase 
   A simple workflow to implement in a web server in order to make it healthy regardless of different browsers Same Site behavioral nuances

September 23, 2020, <a href="https://www.fintechaustralia.org.au/fintech-australia-is-proud-to-announce-the-2020-finnies-finalists/">FinTech Australia announced the finalists</a> for this year’s Finnies. The Finnies recognise and reward the Australian FinTech community by honouring innovation, growth and collaboration.




 




For <a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a>, collaboration is at the heart of everything we do. We’re humbled (and a little excited) to be a finalist in the “Excellence in Industry Collaborations &amp; Partnerships” category.




 




Our submission was based on our partnerships in Belgium with <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl.html">KBC Bank</a>, <a href="https://www.kbcbrussels.be/retail/en/information/bank-with-kbc-brussels.html?s_kwcid=AL!10117!3!184845854352!e!!g!!kbc%20brussels&amp;TYPE=ga&amp;CID=pa_crs_AO_na_kbc-brussels_44591477710&amp;PLA=na_na_adw_na_na_brand&amp;CRE=184845854352_na_na_na&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9bLXlteE7AIVD1dgCh3y8gyqEAAYASAAEgLC8PD_BwE">KBC Brussels</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.be/particuliers/fr.html">CBC Bank</a>. As an Australian FinTech, we’re thrilled to have&nbsp;forged this partnership along with expanding our operations into Belgium and establishing a team on the ground.




 




KBC was recently voted the most valuable brand in Belgium for the 5th consecutive time, along with also being voted the best Digital Bank for 2019. Known for digital innovation, KBC has created an eco-system of value added services for customers, all available from within their mobile banking app.<br><br>In December 2019, three of KBC’s retail bank brands added the <a href="https://www.kbc.be/particulieren/nl/product/betalen/zelf-bankieren/met-je-smartphone/mobile/digitale-kluis.html">“Digital Safe powered by Meeco”</a>. A secure data enclave that enables customers to capture, store and share personal data and documents. Available in four languages (Dutch, French, German and English) and leading the way in customer data privacy and personal data mobility.




 




Despite the global challenges of 2020, our engineering teams in Australia and Belgium have been focussed on making Meeco’s technology available to more partners. <a href="https://dev.meeco.me">Our APIs and SDKs</a> will soon be available in Australia, to support the Consumer Data Right, in the same way we have been helping our European partners with GDPR and Open Banking.




 




We would also love to give a shout out to our newest partners developing amazing application powered by Meeco. <br><br>Starting with <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> “The safe multimedia app for kids”. mIKs-it is a protected space for kids to experience play and joy through photos, videos and audio. Enabling kids and their trusted grown-ups to safely connect to daily life always with complete privacy.  mIKs-it is being developed in <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/meeco-announces-kidtech-partnership-with-heder-to-co-develop-safe-media-platform-for-kids/?_thumbnail_id=2975">partnership with Heder VZW</a> in Belgium, and will launch in December 2020.




 




Closer to home, Meeco is privileged to have been selected by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pam-moorhouse-8a6aa516/">Pam Moorhouse</a>, founder and CEO to provide the privacy, security and consent platform for <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com.au">My Life Capsule</a>. My Life Capsule empowers family connection &amp; organisation across multiple generations, relieving day-to-day and time-critical administration. It helps families capture and share memories, important information and data assisting with the emotional and logistical requirements at every stage of life.




 




The Finnies category winners will be announced at the virtual ceremony on Wednesday 28 October (AEST).  Also, <a href="https://www.stoneandchalk.com.au">Stone &amp; Chalk</a> in Sydney, will be hosting a special <a href="https://events.humanitix.com/stone-and-chalk-and-fintech-australia-presents-finnies-2020">in-person event on the night</a>.




 





<blockquote>“We are thrilled with the&nbsp;quality of applications and the finalists, which are a testament of the growth, and strength of the fintech ecosystem.&nbsp;We are excited to celebrate the hard-fought achievements of the ecosystem at this year’s Finnies”&nbsp;<p></p>Rebecca Schot-Guppy, CEO, FinTech Australia</blockquote>




This will be the first virtual Finnies event, starting at 18:00 AEST on October 28. People will be able to watch from home, which means our team in Belgium can also join in the celebrations. 




 




From all of us at Meeco, huge congratulations to all the wonderful finalists. <br>




 




It’s an honour to be counted in such great company, thank you!

					 <p>Digital identity has advanced over time, most recently culminating in self-sovereign identity (SSI). In this Trinsic Basics post, we are going to briefly cover the different models of digital identity and how SSI is the next step in the digital identity evolution. The content in this post is inspired by a <a href="https://medium.com/evernym/the-three-models-of-digital-identity-relationships-ca0727cb5186">blog post</a> written by digital identity expert Timothy Ruff in 2018.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #1: Siloed identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first model of digital identity is the siloed model, and its name describes exactly how it works. In the siloed approach, in order to interact with another company or institution digitally, you must open an account, typically with a username and password. Through this process, the company becomes your identity provider. Over time, you’ll end up managing hundreds of accounts from hundreds of identity providers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your identity provider stores your username and password and other personal data in large data silos. In other words, your personal data is stored with all of the other customers’ personal data in one central location controlled by the company.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The siloed model is broken because it is:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Centralized. You are not in control of your digital identity—the company or institution is. If they choose to block your account or if they shut their doors, your account, along with all of your data, would be gone.  Not secure. Data silos are gold mines for hackers since they essentially only have to crack one silo to gain access to the personal data of a lot of people. Besides this, account security usually relies on a username and password, and research shows that people do not typically create secure passwords and often use the same username and password for many of their accounts.  Poor user experience: How many times have you forgotten your password and had to recreate it? Having so many different accounts with (supposedly) unique usernames and passwords has led to a frustrating customer experience when trying to access services digitally.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #2: Federated identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Digital identity advocates saw the flaws of siloed identity and sought to create a more user-centric approach.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of every company needing to be its own identity provider, anyone could be an identity provider! You could, theoretically, be your own identity provider! But ultimately, this approach to “federated identity” was taken over by big tech companies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although we may not be familiar with the term, we are all very familiar with how federated identity works. The most common federated identity example is the “Login with Google” or “Login with Facebook.” With federated identity, large tech monoliths act as middlemen between you and the company you are interacting with digitally. Instead of the company managing your identity data, the middlemen do.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Although the federated identity model improves the user experience, it too suffers from some problems:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Reliance: In this model, technology monoliths provide us a digital existence. Instead of being independent and in control, we subject ourselves to the whims of the middleman. This has led to anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior that is problematic.  Universality: Logging in with Facebook might work for buying shoes or signing up for a newsletter. But business tools, regulated industries (financial, healthcare, government), and privacy-focused industries will never accept your personal social media account as authentication because it has almost no assurance—anyone can create multiple Google accounts with ease.  Surveillance: When you login with Facebook, Google, or some other service, you give that middleman more data points they can use to track and spy on you so that they can increase their revenue. Interests are fundamentally not aligned between people and the middleman.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Model #3: Self-sovereign identity 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Various approaches have been tried over the years to put individuals in more control of their identity, but they’ve struggled to get adopted. Finally, self-sovereign identity appears to be the solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Various technical innovations including blockchain, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-ssi-digital-wallets/">digital wallets</a>, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-basics-what-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids/">DIDs</a>, and more gave rise to a new, decentralized identity that not only improves the user experience but also the security of the internet. SSI can be summed up as a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With SSI, you’re your own identity provider because, as an individual, you have a human identity! Nobody gave you your real-world identity, so likewise, you don’t need someone to give you a digital one. Instead, you control the information that makes up your identity information as well with whom you share that information with. For the first time ever online, SSI makes it so that you interact as a “peer” with other people, organizations, and more.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Trinsic is the easiest way to implement SSI 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>At Trinsic, we are trying to make this third model of digital identity a reality. Our company’s mission is to make the world and its services more accessible by making self-sovereign identity more accessible. We’ve done that by creating the world’s most advanced SSI platform. Experience SSI firsthand by creating a <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">free Trinsic Studio account</a> today.

<p>Printing and signing documents takes time and resources. Especially in the current situation, a digital process is more important than ever.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since 2016 electronic signatures gained more and more traction. In July 2016, the qualified electronic signature (QES) completely entered the mainstream following the EU regulation known as eIDAS. Since then, it carries the same significance throughout the entire European Economic Area.</p>
<p>The benefits of signing contracts digitally speak for themselves:</p>
 
 Saving time and transport costs. 
 No storage space needed. 
 Reduced risk of incomplete, inaccurate, or lost documents. 
 
<p>Besides purely monetary advantages, other aspects are also convincing:</p>
 
 Higher customer satisfaction. 
 Improved compliance through fast response time for legal audits and revision requests. 
 More agile and flexible work environment. 
 
<p>Studies have shown companies save costs from 5 to 36 Euro and processing time of 1.5 hours per contract. Time to digitize your contract management!</p>

 Daimler Mobility Partners With Ontology To Leverage High-Performance Technologies and Transform the Driving Experience  With Ontology’s decentralized blockchain solutions, drivers can enjoy a suite of new, highly-secured digital driving services! <p>Singapore — 24 September 2020 — In a move that will transform the experience of drivers all over the world, the <a href="https://www.daimler-mobility.com/en/">Daimler Mobility AG</a> Blockchain Factory, which was set up to bring the benefits of blockchain innovation and application to the automotive finance and mobility industry, is partnering with <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the high performance, open-source blockchain specializing in digital identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>Today, at Daimler’s <a href="https://startup-autobahn.com/">Startup Autobahn EXPO Day</a>, a live event bringing together the most innovative minds in mobility solutions, the companies unveiled the fruits of their first collaboration — ‘Welcome Home’, a self-sovereign in-car personalization and management solution.</p><p>Daimler Mobility AG’s Blockchain Factory and Ontology have joined forces to develop MoveX, a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based mobility platform for the automotive and mobility industry. Utilizing ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, MoveX will empower user roaming, bundling, and sharing, as well as facilitate the integration of services across providers — one of the main barriers for adoption.</p><p>Welcome Home, the first product on the MoveX platform, solves the trade-off for users who want to have highly personalized experiences and diverse service integrations while also preserving their data privacy and control. The Welcome Home solution will not only be applicable to in-car experiences but to any smart device as they are becoming increasingly intelligent, connected and data-rich.</p><p>Commenting on the partnership, Andy Ji, Co-founder of <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> stated, “In choosing to partner with Ontology, Daimler Mobility has demonstrated its commitment to innovation and to leveraging advanced emerging technologies such as ONT ID which deliver the best possible experience for drivers around the world. Our decentralized identity solution can offer a range of benefits that focus on security, verification, and trusted data management for not just drivers, but the entire automobile ecosystem.”</p><blockquote>He continued, “To date, Daimler Mobility’s efforts to implement blockchain-based solutions have focused primarily on improving efficiencies in back-end departments and in the supply chain. However, what makes this partnership exciting is that Ontology’s ONT ID integration with Daimler Mobility on MoveX will open doors to allow for inherent interoperability that encompasses offline data like parking tickets or claims, but also digital data like access tokens or driving&nbsp;history.</blockquote><p>The news comes as Ontology continues to strengthen ties with the German enterprise and moves forward with plans to open an office in&nbsp;Berlin.</p><p>Harry Behrens, Head of The Daimler Mobility AG Blockchain Factory, said, “Welcome Home combines mobility with social networking. By using Ontology’s unique framework for DID and highly secure data access we have combined usability with the highest standards for data sovereignty and privacy.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Daimler Mobility Partners With Ontology To Leverage High-Performance Technologies and Transform…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>A couple of things have changed in the Rails world since we published our <a>last blog post on Rails</a>. For one, Rails 6.0 was released on August 16, 2019 (Yay progress!), and, for another, Omniauth had a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">CRSF</a> vulnerability reported (not so great). Does this make you a bit anxious? Don’t worry! Today we will be going over how to create a Rails app from scratch with the new Rails release and go over how to protect ourselves from the CRSF vulnerability.  We are also going to throw in some CRUD action, as well. Last but not least, we will use Okta to take care of authentication and user management in our Rails App.</p>

<p>To get rocking and rolling with this tutorial you will need:</p>

 
   A <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/">basic knowledge</a> of Ruby on Rails 
   A text Editor (I am using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> in my examples) 
   <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails 6</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Create a Rails Application for Login 

<p>Open up the terminal and create a brand new rails application:</p>

   <code>rails new okta_crud
cd okta_crud/
</code>   

<p>Open your code editor and navigate to your Gemfile. It should look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>We are going to add some sweet gems to our gemfile, including:</p>

 
   <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> for scaffolding and user Model Generation 
   <a href="https://github.com/andrewvanbeek-okta/omniauth-oktaoauth">omniauth-oktaoauth</a> - our OAuth strategy gem for Okta 
   <a href="https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store">activerecord-session_store</a> to handle our session 
   <a href="https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro">figaro</a> for managing our application YAML files to hold our environment variables and finally 
   <a href="https://github.com/cookpad/omniauth-rails_csrf_protection">omniauth-rails_csrf_protection</a> to protect us from that CRSF vulnerability mentioned prior 
 

<p>Copy and paste this into your Gemfile:</p>

   <code>gem 'omniauth-oktaoauth'
gem 'activerecord-session_store'
gem 'figaro'
gem  'devise'
gem 'omniauth-rails_csrf_protection', '~&gt; 0.1'
</code>   

<p>It should look like this now:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, hit save in your editor.</p>

<p>Next, go to your terminal and do some Rails magic to install all your new gems, create a database for active record, install devise into your Rails app, and create a user model:</p>

   <code>bundle install
rake db:create
rails g devise:install
rails g devise User
</code>   

<p>Nice! We have Devise setup. Now let’s do the session and omniauth pieces:</p>

   <code>rails generate active_record:session_migration
rails g migration AddOmniauthToUsers provider:index uid:index
</code>   

<p>Let’s also create pages for home and account and a session controller:</p>

   <code>rails g controller pages home account
rails g controller Sessions new create destroy
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s run the migrations in our db:</p>

   <code>rake db:migrate
</code>   

<p>Next, let’s create the Omniauth Controller:</p>

   <code>cd app/controllers
mkdir users
touch users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb
</code>   

<p>That’s enough terminal commands for now. Time to add some code!<br>
Add the Omniauth callback in the file controllers/users/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb:</p>

   <code>class Users::OmniauthCallbacksController &lt; Devise::OmniauthCallbacksController
  def oktaoauth
     @user = User.from_omniauth(request.env["omniauth.auth"])
      session[:oktastate] = request.env["omniauth.auth"]["uid"]
     redirect_to root_path
  end
end
</code>   

<p>Next, go to the session controller, in controllers/sessions_controller.rb, and replace with this code for a logout method:</p>

   <code>class SessionsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def new
  end

  def create
  end

  def destroy
    session[:oktastate] = nil
    @current_user = session[:oktastate]
    @session = session[:oktastate]
    redirect_to root_path
  end
end
</code>   

<p>Let’s edit our page controller. Go to controllers/pages_controller.rb and copy and paste this code:</p>

   <code>class PagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_action :user_is_logged_in?, except: :home

  def home
    puts(session[:oktastate])
    @current_user = User.find_by(uid: session[:oktastate])
  end

  def account
    @current_user = User.find_by(uid: session[:oktastate])
    puts(session[:oktastate])
  end
end
</code>   

<p>Go to the models/users.rb file and add a method:</p>

   <code>devise :omniauthable, omniauth_providers: [:oktaoauth]
  def self.from_omniauth(auth)
    user = User.find_or_create_by(email: auth['info']['email']) do |user|
      user.provider = auth['provider']
      user.uid = auth['uid']
      user.email = auth['info']['email']
    end
  end
</code>   

<p>It should look something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In routes.rb to replace your routes, we have to make some adjustments as below:</p>

   <code>Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get 'sessions/new'
  get 'sessions/create'
  get 'sessions/destroy'
  root 'pages#home'
  get 'pages/account'
  devise_for :users, :controllers =&gt; { :omniauth_callbacks =&gt; "users/omniauth_callbacks" }
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end

</code>   

<p>Next, our Application Controller :</p>

   <code>class ApplicationController &lt; ActionController::Base
protect_from_forgery with: :exception

  def user_is_logged_in?
    if !session[:oktastate]
      print("user is not logged in")
      redirect_to user_oktaoauth_omniauth_authorize_path
    end
  end

  def after_sign_in_path_for(resource)
    request.env['omniauth.origin'] || root_path
  end

end
</code>   

<p>It should now look like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, let’s edit some of our views. Go to pages views/pages/home.html.erb and add this code:</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Pages#home&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find me in app/views/pages/home.html.erb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% if @current_user %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%=@current_user.email %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "Edit your account", "/pages/account", class: "item" %&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "logout", ENV['OKTA_URL'] + "/login/signout?fromURI=http://localhost:3000/sessions/destroy", class: "item" %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;
&lt;%= link_to 'Sign in via Okta', user_oktaoauth_omniauth_authorize_path, method: :post %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code>   

<p>Nice!</p>

 Add CRUD and Auth to Your Ruby on Rails App 

<p>It’s time to add the page that allows us to do CRUD operations. In this case, we are going to add a form where a user can edit their profile information, specifically their favorite gemstone. In views/pages/account.html.erb, copy and paste this code:</p>

   <code>&lt;%= javascript_pack_tag 'account_js' %&gt;
&lt;% if @current_user %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;%=@current_user.email %&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "home", :root, class: "item" %&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "Edit your account", "/pages/account", class: "item" %&gt;
&lt;%= link_to "logout", ENV['OKTA_URL'] + "/login/signout?fromURI=http://localhost:3000/sessions/destroy", class: "item" %&gt;
&lt;% else %&gt;
&lt;%= link_to 'Sign in via Okta', user_oktaoauth_omniauth_authorize_path, method: :post %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;

&lt;form id="accountForm"&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;Your Favorite Gemstone &lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" id="gemname" name="gemname" /&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="submit"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code>   

<p>It looks like there’s a form, but where do we get data from? More importantly, where do we submit data from our form back into Okta’s backend? The answer is a js file!</p>

<p>Go to javascript/packs and create a new file called account_js.js.  Make sure it is named properly because we reference it in our account.html.erb. In that file copy and paste this code:</p>

   <code>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async function () {
    var response = await fetch(`${process.env.OKTA_URL}/api/v1/users/me`, {
      credentials: "include",
      method: "get",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
    });
  
    var userdata = await response.json();
    console.log(userdata.profile);
    document.getElementById("gemname").value = userdata.profile.gemstone
    var wordInput = document.getElementById("gemname");
    var form_el = document.getElementById("accountForm");
    form_el.addEventListener("submit", function (evt) {
      evt.preventDefault();
      submitData();
    });
  
    function submitData() {
      console.log("do something with " + wordInput.value);
      var body = {
        profile: {
          gemstone: wordInput.value,
        },
      };
      fetch(`${process.env.OKTA_URL}/api/v1/users/me`, {
        credentials: "include",
        method: "post",
        headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
        body: JSON.stringify(body),
      }).then((response) =&gt; {
        console.log(response);
        if(response.status == 200) {
          window.location.reload()
        }
      });
    }
  });

</code>   

<p>Last but not least, we need to add initializers in <code>config/initializers/devise.rb</code>:</p>

   <code>require 'omniauth-oktaoauth'
  config.omniauth(:oktaoauth,
                ENV['OKTA_CLIENT_ID'],
                ENV['OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET'],
                :scope =&gt; 'openid profile email',
                :fields =&gt; ['profile', 'email'],
                :client_options =&gt; {site: ENV['OKTA_ISSUER'], authorize_url: ENV['OKTA_ISSUER'] + "/v1/authorize", token_url: ENV['OKTA_ISSUER'] + "/v1/token"},
                :redirect_uri =&gt; ENV["OKTA_REDIRECT_URI"],
                :auth_server_id =&gt; ENV['OKTA_AUTH_SERVER_ID'],
                :issuer =&gt; ENV['OKTA_ISSUER'],
                :strategy_class =&gt; OmniAuth::Strategies::Oktaoauth)
</code>   

<p>Okay it is time to generate our application YAML:</p>

   <code>bundle exec figaro install
</code>   

<p>In the recently added <code>config/application.yml</code>, add this configuration of environment variables.  We are going to come back to it later.</p>

   <code>OKTA_CLIENT_ID: "okta client id"

OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET: "okta client secret"

OKTA_ORG: "your org"
OKTA_DOMAIN: "okta"

OKTA_URL: "your okta url"

OKTA_ISSUER: "your okta oauth server issuer"

OKTA_AUTH_SERVER_ID: "default"

OKTA_REDIRECT_URI: "http://localhost:3000/users/auth/oktaoauth/callback"
</code>   

 Setup Okta as your Rails App External Auth Provider 

<p>Next, let’s go into Okta to get our information.</p>

<p>Dealing with user authentication in web apps is a huge pain for every developer. This is where Okta shines: it helps you secure your web applications with minimal effort. To get started, you’ll need to create an OpenID Connect application in Okta. Sign up for a forever-free developer account (or log in if you already have one).</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once you’ve logged in and land on the dashboard page, copy down the Org URL pictured below. You will need this later.
On this main page find and copy your okta url.  Copy and use for the value in your yml called OKTA_URL.  Also for the value OKTA_ISSUER in your application.yml take your okta url and add /oauth2/default. The okta issuer should look something like <code>https://{your org}.{your domain of okta or oktapreview}.com/oauth2/{your Oauth Server Id which can be a GUID or "default"}</code>.  An example would be like “https://my-cool-company.okta.com/oauth2/default”, where “my-cool-company” is the Org, “okta” is the domain, and “default” is the server Id.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then create a new application by browsing to the Applications tab and clicking Add Application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click the Web platform option (since our blog project is a web app).</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the settings page, enter the following values:</p>

<p>Name: Rails 6
Base URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000</code>
Login redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000/users/auth/oktaoauth/callback</code></p>

<p>After this is done, you should have something like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the button at the bottom of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next page, find your client ID and Sec, and copy that to your rails application.yml file:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, our application user’s profile actually needs a custom value. Since Okta is an extensible Identity provider let’s extend it to add the custom attribute of “gemstone”. In your Okta dashboard, go to User/Directory &gt; Profile Editor:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Find the Default User Schema and click the profile button:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once there click add attribute:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then name the new custom attribute gemstone and the variable gemstone. For easy use just try to copy what is on the image below and then click Save:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, find your custom attribute and click the pencil button next to it:</p>

<p></p>

<p>We need to make sure our users can edit it, so we are going to give the attribute the “read and write permission” in the Okta Profile Editor:</p>

<p></p>

<p>All set! This is looking good. It’s time to try out your application and have fun!  Go to the console and run:</p>

   <code>rails s
</code>   

 Final Result 

<p>Your result should look something like the images below.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

 The market capitalization of stablecoins reached $19.86 billion, The latest development of several decentralized stablecoin protocols <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1485006994">https://bihu.com/article/1485006994</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 22,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   The market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.334 million to $19.86&nbsp;billion.  Last week, 1 billion USDT migrated from Tron to Ethereum. Besides, Tether additionally issued 500 million USDT on Tron twice and 150 million USDT on Ethereum.  From September 13th to 20th, the supply of DAI rose from $475 million to $800 million, an increase of&nbsp;71%.  Pickle developed the feature using Ethereum and stablecoin exchange pairs as LP Tokens to aggregate mining in&nbsp;Uniswap.  On September 20, the one-day transaction volume in Curve set a record of $519&nbsp;million.  After the SWRV lower the inflation rate, the total lock-up volume in Swerve was less than $20&nbsp;million.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(September 12, 2020 ~ September 18, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $1.334 million to $19.86&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>In the past week, the circulation of USDT has increased by 650 million. 1 billion USDT migrated from Tron to Ethereum. Besides, Tether additionally issued 500 million USDT on Tron twice and 150 million USDT on Ethereum. The circulation of USDC increased by 260 million, and the circulation of DAI increased by 230 million. The circulation of PAX, BUSD, TUSD, and GUSD increased by 23.59 million, 93.97 million, 77.86 million, and 1.35 million. The circulation of HUSD decreased by 1.39&nbsp;million.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased by&nbsp;104,702.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, TUSD, and DAI increased by 90,882, 7,319, 570, and 5,947. The number of holding addresses of PAX decreased by&nbsp;16.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 2.43% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins decreased by an average of&nbsp;1.18%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 0.71% from the previous&nbsp;week.</p> 2. The latest development of the decentralized stablecoin protocol <p>The development of the blockchain industry is changing with each passing day, and so are the stablecoin projects. Last week, several decentralized stablecoin protocols have made great progress. This report will introduce these projects to&nbsp;you.</p> MakerDAO <p>MakerDAO is a representative of the decentralized autonomous blockchain project. The stablecoin DAI is the largest on-chain collateralized stablecoin. The governance token MKR can also well realize the unification of power, responsibility, and benefit. With the increase in Dapps on Ethereum, the supply of DAI appears to be insufficient. In the last three months, the supply of DAI has increased by 545%, it still can’t avoid the premium when DAI is in high demand. Last week, MakerDAO passed a series of important votes, which can solve the problem of DAI premium to a large&nbsp;extent.</p>  The clearing lines of USDC-A and PAX-A have gone through two rounds of voting, from 110% and 120% to&nbsp;101%.  The debt ceiling of USDC-A was raised from $100 million to $400 million after two&nbsp;votes.  Activate TUSD as collateral, the debt ceiling is 50 million, and the clearing line is&nbsp;101%.  The global debt ceiling of DAI is raised to 1.2&nbsp;billion.  <p>After a series of expansionary votes, the supply of DAI rose to $800 million, a 70% increase from a week ago. The market capitalization of DAI also exceeds the market capitalization of its governance token MKR. The price of DAI will be closer to the centrally issued USDC, PAX, and TUSD. When DAI has a premium of more than 1%, arbitrageurs can borrow DAI near the clearing line and sell it on the secondary market and can ignore liquidating risks.</p><p>This also brings centralization risk to DAI. Previously, because DAI was the only large-scale decentralized stablecoin issued on Ethereum, the application of DAI on the blockchain was generally better than centralized stablecoins. After that, the boundary between centralization and decentralization may become&nbsp;blurred.</p> Pickle <p>When the demand for a certain stablecoin increases, a premium of more than 3% may appear in the short term. This situation has become frequent in recent yield farming, and users need to switch between different stablecoins. When the popularity of mining passes, the premium will disappear, and users may suffer a 3% principal loss in a short period. As the profitability of yield farming decreases, this loss will be unacceptable for many&nbsp;people.</p><p>Pickle Finance wants to use incentives to allow stablecoins such as DAI and sUSD to return to their anchored value ($1). In the beginning, PICKLE tokens will be distributed to the pledgers of Uniswap LP Tokens of ETH and DAI, USDC, USDT, and sUSD. The LP corresponding to the stablecoin with the lower price will be rewarded with more PICKLE tokens, which will encourage liquidity providers to sell stablecoins with higher prices and buy stablecoins with lower&nbsp;prices.</p><p>The Pickle Swap feature will help users complete the conversion of LP Tokens with one click, including the conversion between platforms (now only supports the conversion from SushiSwap to Uniswap) and the conversion of LP Tokens between different stablecoins and ETH in the platform.</p><p>pJar is the valut in Pickle. Users can pledge Uniswap LP Tokens. pJar will help users automatically mine and sell UNI to exchange for more underlying assets. pJar realizes the aggregate mining using Ethereum and stablecoin as LP Tokens on Uniswap. After users pledge Uniswap LP Tokens in pJar, they will get pToken, such as staking UNIV2 DAI/ETH LP will get pUNIDAI. Over time, 1 pUNIDAI will correspond to more UNIV2 DAI/ETH LP. Staking pUNIDAI will also receive additional PICKLE&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Although Pickle Finance may not be able to achieve the goal of returning stablecoins to anchored value, this direction is worth the effort. Because of the token incentives of Uniswap, more and more stablecoins and ETH exchange pairs will be used for mining in Uniswap, and pJar aggregate mining will be more&nbsp;useful.</p> Curve <p>Curve was originally a stablecoin exchange protocol. With the development of cross-chain assets, there are now many Bitcoin anchor tokens on the platform. When trading in Curve, the platform only charges a 0.04% commission. In August, after the release of Curve’s platform token CRV, the funds in Curve rose from less than $300 million to more than $1 billion. Currently, Curve has a total of $1.6 billion in assets. On September 20, the one-day transaction volume in Curve set a record of $519&nbsp;million.</p><p>The price of CRV has dropped from $30 at the initial issuance to $1.4 now, and the annualized rate of return in the y pool has also dropped to 14.39%, but there are still more than $600 million stablecoins in the y pool. The decrease in mining yield did not reduce the amount of funds and transactions in Curve. It can be seen that the token incentives of Curve are effective. After the revenue declines, users have not lost a&nbsp;lot.</p> Swerve <p>Two weeks ago, Swerve forked from Curve. Its governance token SWRV has no team reservations and no pre-mining. Swerve has also optimized the gas fee in use. Because of the high incentives at the early stage, the total lock-up volume in Swerve reached up to $900 million. However, the economic model of Swerve has a fatal problem. It allocates 9 million SWRV in the first two weeks and 9 million SWRV in the following year. At the end of last week, SWRV completed its first token-issued cut, and now the total lock-up volume in Swerve is less than $20 million. A decrease in the lock-up volume will increase transaction slippage, which will affect the experience of&nbsp;Swerve.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

<p>We know that the universe of knowledge surrounding identity verification and security can feel vast. We’re here to help! Consider this glossary your one stop shop, a way to help equip you with the ABCs of KYC. Share it with your friends or colleagues, or let it be your secret weapon as you become the resident expert—we won’t tell.&nbsp;</p>



 The Basics&nbsp; 



  Biometric is the “measurement of the human body”, the science of analyzing physical or behavioral characteristics specific to each individual. <br><br>  KYC means Know Your Customer. It is the process of a business verifying the identity of its customer and assessing their suitability. <br><br>  Identity Verification is the process of confirming a person’s identity. Easy!<br><br>  Selfie Authentication uses facial recognition and biometric data to allow users to verify and match themselves to the piece of identity used in the verification process.&nbsp;  



 The Tech 



  AI stands for artificial intelligence and is the simulation of human intelligence processes such as learning, reasoning, and self-correction by machines.&nbsp;  



  Facial Recognition is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or video. In identity authentication or verification, this is usually used to compare a selfie or with an image on file to see if the faces match.<br><br>  Machine Learning is a category of algorithms that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.<br><br>  



 &nbsp;For the Experts <br><br> 



  AML stands for Anti-Money Laundering and refers to a set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income.&nbsp;  



  GDPR means General Data Protection Regulation in the EU law on data protection and privacy for all individuals within the EU and the EEA.&nbsp;  



  Hashing is meant to verify that a file or data is authentic and has not been altered. It uses an algorithm to map data of any size to a fixed length called a hash value/hash code and is one-way.<br><br>  Privacy by design means privacy is incorporated into technology and systems by default when designing a product. <br><br>  Private key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to decrypt the message by converting the received message back to the original message and is kept secret.<br><br>  Public key is a type of lock used in asymmetric encryption that is used to encrypt the message by converting it to an unreadable form and is widely distributed.<br><br>  Spoofing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain someone’s personal information by pretending to be a source known to the receiver. For tips to keep yourself and your company safe, head <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">here</a>. <br><br>

<p>This week Ontology made impressive strides in DeFi as Wing, the cross-chain DeFi platform, initiated its first Flash Pool vote on whether to change the WING reward distribution rate during the WING Mining Celebration — resulting in increased rewards for users who participated in the Flash Pool Mining Celebration.

Community members were invited to vote for a change to the WING reward distribution rate during the WING Mining Celebration. Over 1/3 of all current WING in circulation participated in the vote. As a result, the distribution rate will change to twice, compared with the previous ten times, effective from 00:05, September 18th. <br>- From September 18th to 29th, through the Flash Pool Mining Celebration, users will be rewarded extra incentives. Users who deposit their WING in the Wing DAO Supply Pool during this period will receive a ten-fold increase in rewards between September 18th and 24th, and a five-fold increase in rewards between September 25th and 29th.<br>- On September 20th (UTC), the WING/EWING swap was launched in Flash Pool of Wing, with the aim of increasing the project’s liquidity&nbsp;. Recently, project teams such as OpenOcean.finance also announced that WING-related swaps would soon be launched online, opening new channels for WING’s circulation and increased scenarios where WING could be used. <br> <br>Global Events<br>- On September 18th, Jun LI (founder of Ontology) took part in a panel discussion themed “Prospects of Decentralized Finance” at 2020 International Fintech Innovation Conference (IFIC) in Shanghai. During the panel discussion, Li stated that should Ontology wish to stand out in the DeFi industry while avoiding stepping into the transaction-fee issue as faced by Ethereum, it needs to work harder on its strategy to support different charges in scenarios of different technical complexities. He said, “Ontology is determined to integrate all types of data, including real-life identity data, credit data and asset data of various groups of people, on the blockchain to build a ‘Super Oracle’ that provides the whole package of data and identity information in various DeFi services.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-16-22-634f2d3c6a24">Ontology Weekly Report (September 16–22)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Few strategies and strategic plans, if any, will survive COVID-19 unchanged. The pandemic recovery has prompted <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">a reset in business strategy</a>, and CIOs and other technology leaders have to determine whether, and by how much, to rethink the IT strategic plan and recalibrate execution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given today’s fast-changing conditions, senior business leaders are increasingly using <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">adaptive strategies</a> to (re)define the long-term direction of the enterprise. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-imperatives-for-streamlined-strategic-planning-for-functional-leaders/">Functional strategic plans</a> follow, with a roadmap of initiatives and investments required to achieve the objectives defined in the strategy. For most CIOs, it’s time to consider recalibrating those strategic plans for IT.</p>
<p>“First, you need to determine the impact of strategy shifts on the existing IT strategic plan,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/30969">Joanne Kopcho</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “Only once you know whether the impact is negligible, minor, major or critical can you determine whether you need to refresh or update the plan, or overhaul it completely.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="37208"]&nbsp;</p>
 How far has and will the business strategy shift? 
<p>In their initial response to the pandemic, many enterprises had to halt certain activities or deploy temporary solutions on very short timelines. As organizations move past response and into recovery and renewal, senior leaders are deciding whether to reverse those initial changes or reinforce them over the long term.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many pandemic-driven changes are unlikely to reverse. A Gartner Board of Directors survey showed that seven out of 10 board directors believe the COVID-19 impact has already <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerated digital business initiatives</a>. This acceleration is likely to have an ongoing and significant impact on in-flight IT strategic plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in these volatile conditions, senior leaders need a formal long-term strategy that articulates what the enterprise will do to compete and succeed in its chosen markets or, for the public sector, what the agency will do to achieve its mission. The question for functional leaders is how much those new strategies impact existing strategic plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz04OGU0ZWIwYmY4ZWUxMWVhYmQ1ZTBhN2YyMTUyMDQ0NQ=="></a></p>
 Initiate, update or refresh the IT strategic plan 
<p>By using the Gartner checklist approach, CIOs can determine the extent to which strategic actions, principles and metrics have changed in response to the crisis. The checklist contains a series of questions to guide CIOs, as they rethink or revisit changes to existing strategic plans, such as:</p>
 
 During our initial response to the crisis, did we build or acquire any new or temporary capabilities that we no longer need — or that need to be made permanent? 
 Have there been changes to the business objectives, goals or strategies that need to be reflected in the strategic principles? Have changes affected the business model or markets? 
 Has change occurred that is impacting the balance of cost, risk and value within the strategic plan? 
 
<p>As CIOs complete the checklist, the responses help to determine the degree of recalibration required, based on these impacts:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Critical change could require a new IT strategic plan built from scratch. 
 Major change likely requires key components of the plan to be rebuilt. 
 Minor change means adjusting execution within the existing plan. 
 No change means continuing to execute the existing plan as originally envisaged. 
 
 Recalibrate IT strategic plans for today and tomorrow 
<p>The extent of changes and recalibration for the IT strategic plan can vary by organization. Additional activities to recalibrate may require one or all of these actions:</p>
 
 Reprioritize and address conflicts, e.g., determine which initiatives to stop, pause or start. 
 Reset engagement and communication, e.g., articulate new priorities across the organization. 
 Validate strategic plan metrics and triggers, e.g., change dashboards and reporting practices to reflect new or changed roadmaps. 
 
<p>CIOs should establish checkpoints to continue recalibrating over time as conditions, digital trends and objectives evolve. The accelerated-digital trend adds unique demands on IT strategic plans. Under the microscope, for example, will be the composable technology foundation that’s needed to balance efficiency with resilience and the need for any-scale operations that can spin up and down with demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going forward, for example, organizations should be applying digital business acceleration to a range of activities, from meeting the needs of the “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-cios-design-for-the-everything-customer/">everything customer</a>” (who demands both personalization and privacy) to building an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/hybrid-workforce-models-speed-digital-transformation/">adaptable workforce</a> equipped with the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">skills</a>, processes, information and autonomy to flex in the face of disruption.</p>
<p>And ultimately, the IT strategic plan must be able to flex not only with evolving strategy, but to accommodate <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">scenario plans</a> and totally unforeseen circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>When the products we develop collect sensitive data, it’s essential to secure and safeguard it to protect user privacy and the user’s identity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">Personally identifiable information</a> (PII) is any data that can be used to identify a specific individual, such as name, email address, phone number, US Social Security number, birth date, and so on. Yet companies also need to store user-related data that is not as sensitive as PII. In this tutorial, you will learn how to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/">Entity Framework Core</a> together with Okta for storing user’s non-sensitive data and PII.</p>

<p>Entity Framework Core is an open-source, cross-platform object-relational mapper (ORM) that allows .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects. With EF Core, you no longer need to write SQL queries and commands manually. Instead, you query data with strongly typed LINQ (Language Integrated Query) queries and EF Core automatically tracks any changes you make to the result of the query.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   Basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio 2019</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core">.NET Core 3.1 SDK</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
 

 Create an ASP.NET Core MVC Web App with Entity Framework Core 

<p>Let’s build a web app for tracking personal expenses. Fire up Visual Studio and create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project select ASP.NET Core Web Application, and click Next. Name the app ExpenseTracker and click Create. On the next window, select Web Application (Model-View-Controller). As we need to create and store user accounts, click Change under Authentication on the right side of the window, select Individual User Accounts and click OK. Now, click Create and Visual Studio will create a new web project with Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core Identity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create the project by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>dotnet new mvc --auth Individual -uld
</code>   

<p>ASP.NET Core Identity is the membership system for ASP.NET Core web applications that provides UI for login functionality and an API for managing users, roles, user data, and so on. Out of the box, ASP.NET Core Identity stores all data in a SQL Server database. The new project includes the migration code to create necessary tables and database objects—you just need to apply it using the <code>dotnet ef</code> tool.</p>

<p>If <code>dotnet ef</code> has not been installed, install it as a global tool:</p>

   <code>dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
</code>   

<p>To apply the migration open terminal in the project folder and run the following command to:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>Finally, go to the <code>Startup.cs</code> file and change</p>

   <code>services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = true)
</code>   

<p>with</p>

   <code>services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
</code>   

<p>so that you don’t have to confirm the account after signup.</p>

<p>Let’s run the project now and see what our website looks like. Hit the F5 button and you will see a page like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you click the Register button you will see a sign-up page where you can create a local user and sign in to the website:</p>

<p>Now, let’s move on and add expense tracking with Entity Framework Core.</p>

 Create Data Model and Set Up Database 

<p>In the <code>ExpenseTracker</code> project inside the <code>Models</code> folder add <code>Category.cs</code> and <code>Expense.cs</code> classes:</p>

   <code>public class Category
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
  public IdentityUser CreatedBy { get; set; }
  public List&lt;Expense&gt; Expenses { get; set; }
}

</code>   

   <code>public class Expense
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public decimal Amount { get; set; }
  public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }
  public IdentityUser CreatedBy { get; set; }
  public string CreatedById { get; set; }
  public Category Category { get; set; }
  public int CategoryId { get; set; }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, you will need to update the <code>ApplicationDbContext</code> database context that was generated when you created the project. Open the <code>ApplicationDbContext.cs</code> file and add these two properties:</p>

   <code>  public DbSet&lt;Category&gt; Categories { get; set; }
  public DbSet&lt;Expense&gt; Expenses { get; set; }
</code>   

<p>After that override the <code>OnModelCreating</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder builder)
{
  base.OnModelCreating(builder);

  builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().Property(category =&gt; category.Name).IsRequired();
  builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().HasMany(category =&gt; category.Expenses)
                            .WithOne(expense =&gt; expense.Category).IsRequired();

  builder.Entity&lt;Expense&gt;().Property(expense =&gt; expense.CreatedById).IsRequired();
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>DbContext</code> class serves as an entry point to the database. It represents a session to the database and is used to query and save instances of our database entities. The <code>DbSet</code> properties represent the entities exposed by the database that can be queried and modified. The <code>OnModelCreating</code> method allows you to configure the model using the Fluent API.</p>

<p>As you have modified the data model you need to create and apply a database migration to create corresponding tables for the new entities. Run the following commands in terminal:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef migrations add AddCategoryExpense
dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>The first command generates a new migration called <code>AddCategoryExpense</code> and the second one applies it to the database.</p>

<p>Now let’s populate the database with some dummy data. In the <code>ApplicationDbContext</code> class add the following at the end of <code>OnModelCreating</code> method:</p>

   <code>builder.Entity&lt;Category&gt;().HasData(new Category { Name = "Travel", Id = -1 }, new Category { Name = "Education", Id = -2 },
                                   new Category { Name = "Food", Id = -3 }, new Category { Name = "Healthcare", Id = -4 });
</code>   

<p>Once again add a new migration for the seed data and apply the migration to the database:</p>

   <code>dotnet ef migrations add SeedData
dotnet ef database update
</code>   

<p>Our database setup is now complete and you are ready to build a web app around our database.</p>

 Build a Simple CRUD with Entity Framework Core 

<p>Let’s start with building a simple Create/Read/Update/Delete form for <code>Categories</code>. In Visual Studio, right click on the Controllers folder, click Add and click Controller. In the window that appears select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework and click OK. Select Category (ExpenseTracker.Models) for the model class, select ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) for the data context class and click Add.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After code generation is complete, you will see a new controller in the Controllers folder and new views in the Views-&gt; Categories folder. Run the app, visit the <code>/Categories</code> url and you should see a list of available categories:</p>

<p>As you can see, you can also create a new Category, view details of the existing category, modify it, or delete a category. Before moving on to Expenses let’s make some changes to the Categories page.</p>

<p>First, let’s disable editing and deleting for the built-in categories and categories belonging to other users. Open the <code>Views\Categories\Index.cshtml</code> file and replace:</p>

   <code>@model IEnumerable&lt;ExpenseTracker.Models.Category&gt;
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
}
</code>   

<p>with this:</p>

   <code>@using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity
@model IEnumerable&lt;ExpenseTracker.Models.Category&gt;
@inject UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; userManager

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Index";
    var currentUser = await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name);
}
</code>   

<p>Now replace</p>

   <code>&lt;td&gt;
  &lt;a asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt; |
  &lt;a asp-action="Delete" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
</code>   

<p>with</p>

   <code>@if (item.CreatedById != null &amp;&amp; item.CreatedById == currentUser.Id)
{
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Edit" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Edit&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt; |
    &lt;a asp-action="Delete" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;td&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Details" asp-route-id="@item.Id"&gt;Details&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;</code> class provides an API for managing users of the application. I use it to get the <code>Id</code> of the current user and toggle <code>Delete</code> and <code>Edit</code> link visibility.</p>

<p>This way <code>Delete</code> and <code>Edit</code> links are only visible if the category was created by the current user. Now, open the <code>CategoriesController</code> class and add <code>UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;</code> parameter to the constructor.</p>

   <code>public CategoriesController(ApplicationDbContext context, UserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt; userManager)
{
  this.context = context;
  this.userManager = userManager;
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add the following lines to the <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Edit(int id, [Bind("Id,Name")] Category category)</code> method:</p>

   <code>var existingCategory = await context.FindAsync&lt;Category&gt;(id);
var user = await userManager.FindByIdAsync(category.CreatedById);

if (existingCategory.CreatedById == null || user.UserName != HttpContext.User.Identity.Name)
{
  return NotFound();
}
</code>   

<p>The code loads the category with the specified id from the database and checks if the category was created by the current user or not.</p>

<p>Add the same snippet to the <code>DeleteConfirmed</code> method too.</p>

<p>Secondly, modify <code>Create</code> method like this:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind("Id,Name")] Category category)
{
  if (ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    category.CreatedById = (await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name)).Id;
    context.Add(category);
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
    return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
  }
  return View(category);
</code>   

<p>Finally, as you want only authentication users making the changes to categories, add the <code>Authorize</code> attribute to the <code>CategoriesController</code> class:</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public class CategoriesController : Controller
{
  //Rest of the code
}
</code>   

<p>Now, let’s build a CRUD for expenses. Right-click the Controllers folder again, click Add and click Controller. Select MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework in the new window, and click OK. This time select Expenses (ExpenseTracker.Models) for the model class, ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) for the data context class and click Add:</p>

<p></p>

<p>I will update the <code>Create</code> and <code>Edit</code> methods in the <code>ExpensesController</code> so that <code>CreatedBy</code> and <code>CreatedAt</code> are set correctly and also update every corresponding cshtml file so that it doesn’t show textbox for <code>CreatedAt</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I will add the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute to the <code>ExpensesController</code> class and also add <code>UserManager</code> parameter to the constructor:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Create([Bind("Id,Amount,CategoryId")] Expense expense)
{
  if (ModelState.IsValid)
  {
      expense.CreatedAt = DateTime.Now;
      expense.CreatedById = (await userManager.FindByNameAsync(User.Identity.Name)).Id
      _context.Add(expense);
      await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
      return RedirectToAction(nameof(Index));
  }
  ViewData["CategoryId"] = new SelectList(_context.Categories, "Id", "Name", expenseCategoryId);
  return View(expense);
}
</code>   

<p>Also, as I need to show the expenses belonging to the current user I will add a filter for that too:</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Index()
{
  var user = await userManager.FindByIdAsync(User.Identity.Name);
  var applicationDbContext = context.Expenses.Where(expense =&gt; expense.CreatedById == user.Id)
                                              .Include(e =&gt; e.Category);
  return View(await applicationDbContext.ToListAsync());
}

</code>   

<p>Before running the app, open the <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> file in <code>Views/Shared</code> folder and add categories and expenses menu items to the <code>ul</code> with the <code>navbar-nav</code> class:</p>

   <code>&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
  &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controller="asp-action="Index"&gt;Categories&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
  &lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-controllerasp-action="Index"&gt;Expenses&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, run the app and you should be able to manage your expenses:</p>

<p></p>

 Store a User’s Personally Identifiable Information in Okta 

<p>The sample website already supports user authentication but all the user PII is stored in SQL Server database. Instead of that, I will store users’ personal information in Okta and secure the web app. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication, as well as all OpenID Connect flows out of the box—it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer account</a>, via the URL you were emailed after signing up, to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, go to API in the menu, click Tokens, and click the Create Token button. Enter the name of the token (I will use ExpenseTracker) and click the Create Token button. Make sure you copy the token because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, create a new application. Click Applications in the top menu and then Add Application. Select Web and click Next. Enter a name for the app (I will use ExpenseTracker again), replace <code>8080</code> with your local port number (in my case it’s <code>44376</code>), and set the Login redirect URIs to <code>signin-okta</code> and click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On the next screen, you will see <code>Client Id</code> and <code>Client Secret</code> of the application. You will need these to configure the Okta middleware, so take note of them:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In Visual Studio, open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file and add a new section <code>Okta</code> below the <code>Logging</code> section and put the details of your app and token:</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": "",
    "ApiToken": "{yourToken}"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to store users in Okta. Switch to Visual Studio and add the <code>Okta.Sdk</code> Nuget package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.Sdk
</code>   

<p>Next, create a new folder called <code>Identity</code> and add these two classes:</p>

   <code>public class OktaUserManager&lt;T&gt; : UserManager&lt;T&gt; where T : IdentityUser&lt;string&gt;, new()
{
  private OktaClient oktaClient;

  public OktaUserManager(IConfiguration configuration, IUserStore&lt;T&gt; store,IOptions&lt;IdentityOptions&gt; optionsAccessor,
                         IPasswordHasher&lt;T&gt; passwordHasher,IEnumerable&lt;IUserValidator&lt;T&gt;&gt; userValidators,
                         IEnumerable&lt;IPasswordValidator&lt;T&gt;&gt; passwordValidators,ILookupNormalizer keyNormalizer,
                         IdentityErrorDescriber errors, IServiceProvider services,ILogger&lt;UserManager&lt;T&gt;&gt; logger)
  : base(store, optionsAccessor, passwordHasher, userValidators, passwordValidators, keyNormalizer, errors, services, logger)
  {
    oktaClient = new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
    {
        OktaDomain = "https://${yourOktaDomain}",
        Token = configuration["Okta:ApiToken"]
    });
  }

  public override async Task&lt;IdentityResult&gt; CreateAsync(T user, string password)
  {
    var validate = await ValidatePasswordAsync(user, password);
    if (!validate.Succeeded)
    {
        return validate;
    }

    var result = await CreateAsync(user);
    if (!result.Succeeded)
    {
        return result;
    }

    await oktaClient.Users.PartialUpdateUserAsync(new User
    {
        Credentials = new UserCredentials
        {

</code>   

<p>The <code>OktaUserStore</code> class derives from the existing <code>UserStore</code> class used by ASP.NET Core Identity, overrides existing methods, and uses <code>OktaClient</code> from the Okta SDK to store users in Okta. The built-in ASP.NET Core dependency injection will inject the current <code>IConfiguration</code> object that will read configuration values from the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file.</p>

<p>Similarly, <code>OktaUserManager</code> derives from the built-in <code>UserManager</code> class and overrides the <code>CreateAsync</code> method to create a user in Okta and set the user’s password.</p>

<p>Finally, open the <code>Startup</code> class to plug these classes instead of the built-in ones. Add <code>AddDbContext&lt;DbContext, ApplicationDbContext&gt;()</code> after the call to <code>AddDbContext</code> and add <code>AddUserManager&lt;OktaUserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;().AddUserStore&lt;OktaUserStore&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;()</code> after the call to <code>AddEntityFrameworkStores</code>:</p>

   <code>services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
    options.UseSqlServer(
        Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")))
    .AddDbContext&lt;DbContext, ApplicationDbContext&gt;();

services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;(options =&gt; options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedAccount = false)
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
    .AddUserManager&lt;OktaUserManager&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;().AddUserStore&lt;OktaUserStore&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;();
</code>   

<p>As a result of this, all our users and their PII will be stored in Okta instead of the SQL Server database. The only remaining thing is to configure the web app so that it uses Okta for login too.</p>

 Configure Okta Middleware 

<p>You can use the official <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Okta.AspNetCore">Okta OIDC integration for .NET Core</a>, but for this sample, I chose Martin Costello’s <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta">NuGet package</a> for configuration. Feel free to use whatever library you like for handling an Open ID Connect / OAuth provider in your .NET Core application.</p>

<p>First, run the following command in terminal to install <code>AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta</code> package:</p>

   <code>dotnet add package AspNet.Security.OAuth.Okta
</code>   

<p>Go the <code>Startup</code> class and add this code in <code>ConfigureServices</code> before <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>:</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication().AddOkta(options =&gt;
{
  options.Domain = Configuration["Okta:Domain"];
  options.ClientId = Configuration["Okta:ClientId"];
  options.ClientSecret = Configuration["Okta:ClientSecret"];
});
</code>   

<p>You have now configured the app to use the Okta Sign-In widget. Before running the app let’s get rid of the <code>Use a local account to log in.</code> section from the login page.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio, right-click on the project, click Add, click New Scaffolded Item…, click Identity on the left side of the window and select Identity again. In the new window check Account\Login, select ApplicationDbContext (ExpenseTracker.Data) in Data context class (even though you aren’t using it any more) and click Add:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After code generation is complete, open the <code>Login.cshtml</code> file from the <code>Areas\Identity\Pages\Account</code> folder and delete the first <code>div</code> with <code>col-md-4</code> class. Also, replace <code>&lt;h4&gt;Use another service to log in.&lt;/h4&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h4&gt;Use Okta to log in.&lt;/h4&gt;</code></p>

<p>Finally, you are ready to run the app! Run the app, click Register, and create a new user account. If you now go to your Okta Developer Console and click Users, you will see the new user account that you just created:</p>

<p></p>

<p>To test the login flow, click the Logout button in the web app then click Login. Click the Okta button and you will be redirected to the Okta’s Single Sign-On page for authentication. Once you log in, you will be redirected back to the app and you will be logged in with your Okta account.</p>

<p>That’s it! We now have a web app that uses Okta to securely store users and their personally identifiable information and Entity Framework Core for other data.</p>

   New CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins Enable Coexistence and Just-In-Time User Migration Between SiteMinder and ForgeRock 

 The Agonizing Decision to Modernize or Stay Put 

<p>Whether it’s to adapt the realities of a digital transformation program, addressing problems with scaling to provide access to new apps and services, managing the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), or the handling of challenges associated with a growing number of CIAM (customer IAM) and workforce users due to COVID-19, many organizations are currently exploring the options to update or “modernize” their existing legacy identity and access (IAM) systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What we now refer to as “legacy” IAM systems are, in fact, platforms developed 10 to 15 years ago, back when most applications were on-premises and built on a client-server model. Fast forward to today, and these systems are struggling to keep up with cloud-first enterprise application needs. Support options are dwindling because vendors and developers are not keeping pace to support the latest feature sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legacy IAM systems are functionally at their end-of-life. While they may continue to crank along and seem to perform the old workhorse identity functions, they are unable to meet new business needs. For example, updates on these legacy systems are expensive and time-consuming, and stability challenges can arise as more identities and attributes are added. Integrating new apps is cumbersome. As many of these legacy solutions live on premises, the timeframe for new apps to “go live” is often measured in months, if not years. This is not exactly what you would call “agile IT.”</p>

<p>Modern identity platforms in contrast, are built to truly enable digital transformation, operate at IoT scale, provide continuous security, support cloud and hybrid deployments, seamlessly integrate new applications, and support security models like Zero Trust and the Gartner CARTA (Continuous Adaptive Risk and Trust Assessment) model. They are continuously adding new features and staying on the cutting edge of the market to keep organizations at a competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>

 Not a “Rip and Replace” Decision 

<p>But why might now be a good time to consider making this move? Well, for starters, everything is going digital, and your users and customers are expecting an optimized, online digital channel experience. Access problems, slow app performance due to identity-related issues, and poor authentication experiences will send them looking for workarounds--which your competitors are more than happy to provide.</p>

<p>But just as importantly, the decision to migrate at this time isn’t a binary one. As “rip and replace” is an option for the few, what is needed is a more seamless, step-by-step approach that allows you to go at your own pace, migrate the apps you need to migrate, and achieve a smooth transition to a modern IAM solution with a committed innovator in this space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>ForgeRock and our partners are here to help. We have assisted countless organizations on the journey from legacy to modern. We stand ready to do the same for your organization, no matter how difficult the challenge or how complex your IAM system may be. We have built a robust set of tools, guides, and documentation to help you make the transition to modern IAM. And it’s all available to you for free.&nbsp;</p>

 Making It Easy: New CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins from ForgeRock 

<p>ForgeRock is excited to announce the latest of these tools – a new set of Open Source <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/modernize-accelerators/tree/master/forgerock-am-siteminder-migration-sso-jit">CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins</a> joining the existing <a href="https://github.com/ForgeRock/modernize-accelerators">Oracle Plug Ins</a> as part of its portfolio of <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-simplifies-process-companies-migrate-legacy-products-modern">Modernize IAM Accelerators</a>. The CA SiteMinder Plug-Ins enable coexistence and just-in-time user migration between SiteMinder and ForgeRock, so you can migrate at your own pace. For instance, you can choose to migrate 10 apps per week, one app per month, or whatever your organization may call for. ForgeRock Accelerators enable this migration to occur without any disruption to your customers or employees. It’s all done in a totally transparent manner. One of the benefits of this approach is that you can make immediate use of the new capabilities of the ForgeRock platform – &nbsp;like Intelligent Access, self-service trees, and passwordless authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, the new SiteMinder Plug-Ins for the Modernize IAM Accelerators can help in the following areas:</p>

  Authenticate in SiteMinder and single sign-on (SSO) to ForgeRock 
	 Authenticate in ForgeRock and SSO to SiteMinder 
	 SSO to legacy apps integrated via CA agents 
	 Migration of user profiles 
	 Secure migration of user passwords 
	 Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning&nbsp; 
	 Modular and extensible for easier integration into current environments 
	 Open source so it relies on industry standard protocols and libraries 
 <p>In the end the SiteMinder Plug-Ins are designed to help make migration seamless and invisible to the user, while having a significant impact in time to value around the design and build of coexistence and user migration strategies.&nbsp;</p>

With President Trump giving his blessing to the TikTok/Oracle deal and his WeChat ban running into some legal challenges, Ray Dalio has published a timely post on China, his latest in his Big Cycles&nbsp;series.   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chapter-6-big-cycle-china-its-currency-ray-dalio/">Chapter 6: The Big Cycle of China and Its&nbsp;Currency</a>  Photo: Web&nbsp;Summit<p>We won’t dive too deep into this one, but he provides a neat overview on how the Chinese historically think and operate by drilling down on its core philosophies:</p><blockquote>The Chinese culture developed as an extension of the experiences the Chinese had and the lessons they learned over the millennia. They were set out in philosophies about how things work and what ways work best in dealing with these realities. These philosophies made clear how people should be with each other, how political decision making should be done, and how the economic system should work. In the Western world the dominant philosophies are Judeo-Christian, democratic, and capitalist/socialist. Each person pretty much chooses from these to come up with the mix that suits them. In China, the main ones were Confucian, Taoist, and Legalist until the early 20th century when Marxism and capitalism entered the mix. The most desired mix to follow has historically been the emperor’s most desired mix. Emperors typically study Chinese history to see how these have worked and come up with their own preferences, put them into practice, learn, and adapt. If the mix works, the dynasty survives and prospers (in their parlance it has the “Mandate of Heaven”). If it doesn’t, it fails and is replaced by another dynasty. This process has gone on from before history was recorded and will go on as long as there are people who have to decide how to collectively do&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>While I can’t do these philosophies justice in a couple of sentences each without digressing too deeply (though I will go into them more deeply in Part 2), here is the best I can&nbsp;do:</blockquote>  Confucianism seeks to bring about harmony by having people know their roles in the hierarchy and know how to play them well starting from within the family (between the husband and the wife, the father and the son, the older sibling and the younger sibling, etc.) and extending up to the ruler and their subjects, with them bound together by benevolence and obedience. Each person respects and obeys those above them, who are both benevolent and impose standards of behavior on them. All people are expected to be kind, honest, and fair. Confucianism values harmony, broad-based education, and meritocracy.  Legalism favors conquest and unification of “all under heaven” as soon as possible by an autocratic leader. It believes that the world is a “kill or be killed” jungle in which the strength of the emperor’s central government and strict obedience to it must exist without much benevolence given to the people by the emperor/government. The Western equivalent is&nbsp;fascism.  Taoism teaches that the laws of nature and living in harmony with them are of paramount importance. Taoists believe that all of nature is composed of opposites and that harmony comes from balancing them well — yin and yang. This plays an important role in how the Chinese seek the balance of opposites.  <p>And how China’s culture fundamentally differs from the&nbsp;U.S.:</p><blockquote>All of these Chinese systems from the beginning of recorded history were hierarchical and non-egalitarian. I was told by one of the most senior Chinese leaders, who is also a highly informed historian and an extremely practical top policy maker, that the core difference between Americans and the Chinese is that Americans put the individual above all else and the Chinese put the family and the collective above all else. He explained that Chinese leaders seek to run the country the way they think parents should run the family — from the top down, maintaining high standards of behavior, putting the collective interest ahead of any individual interest, with each person knowing their place and having filial respect for those in the hierarchy so that the system works in an orderly way. He explained that the word “country” consists of two characters, “state” and “family,” which represents how the leaders view their roles in looking after their state/family — like strict parents. So one might say that the Chinese government is run from the top down (like a family) and optimizes for the collective while the American approach is run from the bottom up (e.g., democracy) and optimizes for the individual. (These differences of approach can lead to policies that those on the opposite side find objectionable, which I will explore in more detail in the next chapter.)</blockquote><p>These are fundamental differences that are hard to reconcile. Extrapolating this framework to the current ongoing conflicts around the internet and platforms makes you think that existing divisions will only deepen without some sort of new approach.</p> 2. And so you have&nbsp;this: <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-china-d42ab331-0cb3-4d2a-9b36-bce6e6610df7.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>A group of researchers from Europe, the U.S. and Japan are proposing a “tech alliance” of democratic countries in response to the Chinese government’s use of technology standards and its tech sector as instruments of state power abroad, according to a version of the proposal viewed by&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote><blockquote>The proposal, called “Common Code: An Alliance Framework for Democratic Technology Policy” to be published next month, recommends that founding members of the new tech alliance include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the U.S., as well as the European&nbsp;Union.</blockquote><blockquote>What they’re saying: “The status quo of uncoordinated and reactive technology policymaking for the major democratic technology powers in Asia, Europe and North America means growing risk of ceding their technological leadership,” the authors&nbsp;write.</blockquote> 3. All of this of course coincides with the ongoing shift to digital as a result of the pandemic. <p>And there’s plenty to figure out on that front as well — <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-da0f7769-d5e3-4a59-810d-3525a43b4e63.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>The shift to online schooling is running roughshod over children’s privacy rules and rights and creating new inequalities, experts tell Ashley&nbsp;Gold.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Minors are the only group that enjoys federal online privacy protections in the U.S., but that’s not enough to protect their privacy rights as school districts and teachers scramble to move all classwork to the internet amid the pandemic.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: These rules aren’t just technicalities. If companies don’t maintain rigorous data security and privacy practices, children’s personal information, photos and video could end up in the wrong&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: “We’re trying to take brick-and-mortar school and shove it onto the internet, and the two things just aren’t compatible,” Karen Richardson, executive director for the Virginia Society for Technology in Education, told&nbsp;Axios.</blockquote> 4.

 Skip to 1:25:36 to see Civic’s presentation.



<p>Recently, our CEO, Vinny Lingham, joined a forum hosted by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) to present an overview of Health Key by Civic. The forum, called “Tourism Tech Adventures on Aviation Technologies,” showcased the best ways to jumpstart the tourism industry as the world evaluates safe reopenings. The UNWTO was founded to cultivate modern tourism, which is closely linked to socio-economic progress around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Health Key by Civic offers one way to provide safe passage abroad. The solution can help travelers keep their identity and health information private, while allowing organizations to create safe spaces on airplanes, in hotels, and at large gatherings. It is built to comply with international GDPR and CCPA and other data privacy regulations.</p>



<p>For travelers, providing health status verification to gatekeepers is as easy as getting a vaccine from a qualified partner and then setting up Health Key by Civic in our Civic Wallet app. When a user signs up, they are authenticated as a real person, using both AI and blockchain-based technology. Civic does not take custody of personal data or medical records.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses, Health Key by Civic streamlines the management of entry points. This is critical because there are complicated logistics that the industry will need to navigate. First, there are many vaccines currently undergoing testing with varying efficacy rates. Second, there are <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/24-08-2020-172-countries-and-multiple-candidate-vaccines-engaged-in-covid-19-vaccine-global-access-facility">172 economies</a> collaborating on distribution. This means that countries and organizations will need to confirm that an individual has received a vaccine, whether the vaccine received is effective, and which local entry point regulations must be followed around the world. It’s a problem that may be solved with thoughtful technology.</p>



<p>While we’ve been working hard to provide the right kind of technology solutions, we also know that collaboration on health status verification is essential. Civic partnered with <a href="https://www.circlemedical.com/">Circle Medical</a> to supply testing for interested San Francisco Bay Area companies. Additional regional testing partners will be coming online to support customers in other locales. Together, we seek to give individuals control over their own credentials and facilitate economic rebuilding.</p>



<p>And, along with collaborating in the medical and international communities, Civic has been making progress on other fronts. Recently, we’ve been <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB2004">working with California lawmakers</a> on a bill that will provide privacy-oriented guidelines for proof-of-health technology.</p>



<p>To learn more about proof-of-health and the travel industry, we invite you to watch the UNWTO forum and <a href="https://youtu.be/U4TnqeG_F5g?t=5136">check out Health Key by Civic</a>.</p>

   For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. ITSM is about working behind the scenes to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.

  <p>For today’s companies, IT service management is more than IT support. <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/itsm.html">ITSM is about working behind the scenes</a> to help employees to do the work that drives your business – providing a one-stop shop for service needs, upgrades, improvements, and asset management.</p>
<p>If IGA doesn’t play a critical role in your ITSM strategy, it should. We frequently hear from customers who are looking to better align IGA and ITSM, and our conversations with the analyst firm KuppingerCole often focus on this topic as well.</p>
<p>Simply put, it just makes sense to marry IGA and ITSM. There’s a relationship between every service that an employee can access and the role of that employee within your organization. Sometimes it’s a simple matter of convenience, such as automatically granting new hires in Sales access to the sales software. Sometimes it’s a matter of security and risk management, so employees with privileged accounts can safely view mission-critical data when they aren’t on the physical network.</p>
<p>On Oct. 1, I’ll be delivering a keynote at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">KuppingerCole IGA Solutions for ServiceNow Infrastructures virtual event</a> focused on the alignment of ITSM and IGA. <a href="https://clearskye.com/">At Clear Skye</a>, we’re well positioned to talk about this, since we’re an IGA solution built on top of the ServiceNow platform – running natively without the need for custom integrations. Here’s a look at five key ways your company performs better when IGA and ITSM are able to work hand in hand.</p>
<p>Read Martin Kuppinger's Executive View |&nbsp;<a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole">Clear Skye IGA: IGA on the ServiceNow NOW Platform</a><a href="https://identity.clearskye.com/kuppingercole"></a></p>
<p>Self-Service Requests. It’s one thing to automate service requests such as account or group access. Why not take that to the next level and apply logic to the request based on a user’s role? Say a VP of Operations in the Dallas office requests permission to join one Active Directory group. There are likely other groups for Operations personnel, VPs, and the Dallas office that she should also join – as well as legacy Active Directory groups that she should be steered away from. The same is often true for many other types of requests. If an employee wants access to the travel booking software, for example, he probably wants access to the expense reporting tool, too. Identifying and taking action on similar requests simultaneously will save time for users and ITSM alike. As an added bonus, your end-users will be using an interface that they already feel comfortable with: ServiceNow. That means increased productivity and faster time to value.</p>
<p>Separation of Duties. If a software engineer based in Asia is logging onto the network in the middle of the night to access a dev server, that’s not unusual. If a VP of Accounting is logging on from New York at 3 a.m. to access financial software, well, that’s a problem. Restricting access to certain systems – by requiring higher-up approval or denying access outright – can prevent activity both nefarious and accidental (such as an HR rep accidentally attaching the salary spreadsheet to a company-wide email). You could also take this level of access a step further – and protect valuable assets to boot – by restricting access to certain systems unless a user has completed security training, installed required patches, or updated potentially vulnerable systems, all by matching their privileges to the systems they have access to and the level of security those systems require. The ServiceNow Common Services Data Model (CSDM) gives you visibility and alignment in data value, utilization, hygiene, compliance, governance, risk and security.</p>
<p>Incident Management. Responding to open tickets is often a matter of hunting for valuable information such as what permissions a user has, what software versions a user is running, or whether that security training was completed. When you bring together ITSM and IGA, the analyst working on a ticket can pull up this information right away and solve the problem – along with identifying other issues that a user may need to address, such as expiring credentials. For organizations with thousands of employees, this improved efficiency can quickly save a full FTE on the Help Desk.</p>
<p>Change Management. Knowing the roles and privileges of all end users who will be impacted by a software upgrade or hardware replacement helps organization manage risk, plan backup support, schedule outages, and identify vulnerabilities. This has the clear benefit of minimizing the disruption to clinical business services. It also provides predictive and retrospective insight into which changes can be treated as low-risk repeatable actions and which changes require more extensive preparation, as well as knowledge of which roles are most likely to request which changes. Instead of being a hassle, change management can become an efficient and differentiating process for your organization.</p>
<p>Mobility. Employees who respond to incidents or manage deliveries on a large campus rarely have a physical office, so mobile apps are critical for their fay-to-day role. They’ve also become a lifeline for remote employees who are juggling school and family care and need the flexibility of mobile solutions. Marrying IGA and ITSM on the Now Platform is more than just being able to offer SSO for multiple mobile solutions – it’s giving employees a single point of entry for those solutions, one that’s maintained by a trusted partner in ServiceNow.</p>
 Looking to the Future 
<p>The ultimate goal of marrying IGA and ITSM is taking a more holistic approach to enabling your staff / people / teams. Instead of the stimulus-and-response process of opening and closing tickets to fix a single issue, it’s being able to draw on a wealth of data that’s no longer sitting in silos to automate when possible and evaluate risk when necessary – whether it’s risk from outdated security settings, risk from the combination of a user’s privileges, or a bit of both. This enables an organization to manage the present and plan the future, whether it’s updating critical systems, culling obsolete Active Directory groups, or updating admin privileges.</p>
<p>Few organizations have truly reached this point, however. Instead of breaking down silos and leveraging single control plans and common interfaces, the market has primarily focused on integrating and synchronizing data and workflows across two or more disparate systems. This only adds complexity – which is the last thing ITSM needs.</p>
<p>At Clear Skye, we believe there’s a better way. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/iga-servicenow">Register to join our keynote discussion on Oct</a>. 1 and learn more about our vision to bring IGA and ITSM together natively on the Now Platform.</p>

  <p>Cloud migrations picked up at the onset of the coronavirus outbreak as organizations shifted to support remote work. However, some workloads had to remain on-premises.</p>
<p>Ahead of the virtual 2020 Gartner IT Infrastructure, Operations &amp; Cloud Strategies Conference —&nbsp; 7 to 10 December 2020 in the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/infrastructure-operations-cloud-us">Americas</a> and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-uk">EMEA</a> —&nbsp; Smarter With Gartner asked <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/4800">David Cappuccio</a>, Conference Chair and Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner, for insight on how traditional infrastructure and operations (I&amp;O) teams are adapting to the new normal and how I&amp;O leaders can tackle their most imminent challenges.</p>
 What is the difference between cloud infrastructure and data centers? 
<p>From an IT planner perspective, the primary difference between cloud and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/data-center">data center</a> infrastructures revolves around how you deliver a given workload to your business. A simplified view is that data centers own the physical infrastructure and deliver business value via that infrastructure.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some organizations use a cloud infrastructure to deliver that workload, using the cloud provider’s physical infrastructure and paying for consumption of resources, rather than the physical infrastructure.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 With the rise of cloud computing, how are traditional enterprise data centers adapting and evolving? 
<p>Most data centers owners have realized that while <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> may not be the answer to all of their problems, it still needs to be a part of every application or workload delivery conversation. In some cases, cloud computing could be an ideal solution; for instance, when high availability websites or applications require rapid scale (up or down).</p>
<p>In other cases, on-premises computing may be the best solution; for example, when data location is critical or latency-sensitive applications are involved. The end result is <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-steps-to-adapt-io-to-the-hybrid-world/">a hybrid world</a> where the focus is to deploy workloads from the best location to solve business problems.</p>
 What are the benefits of cloud computing compared with data centers? 
<p>Gartner clients consistently tell us that the real benefits of cloud computing are enterprise agility —or developing and deploying workloads quickly — and the ability to move toward a consumption-based solution where heavy investment in IT infrastructure is no longer required. However, migrating to the cloud is not simple, as there is a significant impact on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-must-have-competencies-for-infrastructure-operations-leaders/">I&amp;O skills</a>, tools, governance, process and cost management, to name a few.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For data centers themselves, the core benefits are those that have been around for years, namely total control of both the facility and IT computing environments. For mission-critical applications, especially those with tight audit or compliance requirements, or those requiring specialty hardware/software, on-premises data centers will remain viable solutions.</p>

 Gartner says that modern “infrastructures are everywhere.” What does that mean? 
<p>For the past decade, the number of options that IT and the business have had for deploying computing workloads has continued to grow, whether it’s on-premises, colocation, hosting, cloud computing (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/infrastructure-as-a-service-iaas">IaaS</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/platform-as-a-service-paas">PaaS</a>, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/software-as-a-service-saas">SaaS</a>) or edge computing. In most enterprises, the answer for where to deploy workloads is “all of the above,” which means that the infrastructure for IT services is no longer just in the data center, but essentially everywhere. And yet, even though it’s out of sight, IT is still responsible for that service.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that by 2025, 85% of infrastructure strategies will integrate on-premises, colocation, cloud and edge delivery options, compared with 20% in 2020.</p>

<p>Prepare I&amp;O to Enable the Everywhere Enterprise, a session with Roger Williams, VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>
 Although migrations to the cloud picked up during COVID-19, some workloads had to remain on-premises. How can I&amp;O leaders improve enterprise data center delivery while reducing costs? 
<p>The interest in cloud migrations has increased due to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-cloud-providers-to-support-customers-through-covid-19/">COVID-19,</a> but the focus was often driven by data center teams rethinking their delivery models around the idea of what services must remain on-premises versus which ones could be safely migrated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Once enterprises completed such analysis, the focus shifted to optimizing costs and increasing efficiencies for on-premises delivery of the remaining workloads. The options to do so were via hyperconverged solutions, increased floor and rack densities, increased automation and consolidation of redundant systems or offerings.&nbsp;</p>

 What are the biggest challenges facing I&amp;O leaders today? 
<p>IT leaders today are dealing with competing objectives: To keep the lights on — running mission-critical applications while protecting the business from outages — and to enable the business to react to market changes quickly and adopt new technologies or services when they need them (not necessarily when IT is ready or has the cash to spend on them).</p>
<p>Essentially, I&amp;O needs to develop a toolbox of choices that enable the rapid development and deployment of services, but at the same time set the guide rails for the infrastructure delivery model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this year's IT Infrastructure, Operations &amp; Cloud Strategies Conference, my colleagues and I will discuss how I&amp;O leaders must adapt and innovate IT to deliver competitive advantage and keep core systems operational and resilient in a world that is full of disruptions, like COVID-19.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hi, my name is Joël Franusic and I’m happy to announce that I am,
once again, a developer advocate at Okta, focusing on the Python and Go communities.</p>

<p>(Why do I say “once again”? Because six years ago, I started my Okta career as a
developer advocate but over the course of time I worked in a series
of other roles including: “Software Engineer”, “Technical Marketing
Manager”, and “Product Marketing Manager”)</p>

<p>This blog post has two parts:</p>

 
   An introduction to myself and my personal mission statement 
   An example of how to run Python from inside of a web browser - which is an example of how I’m putting my personal mission statement into action 
 

 Introducing myself 

<p>The best way that I can think of to introduce myself is by sharing
my “personal mission statement”.  Before I do that, though, 
I want to give some background on why I have
one in the first place.</p>

<p>It’s common for corporations to have a “mission statement” — a short
statement on what they view as their goals.</p>

<p>People often mock corporate mission statements, and for
good reason. Mission statements are frequently long, vague, and uninspiring.
But not always! Sometimes a company will create a mission statement that
is truly great: short, inspiring and so lofty it almost seems unachievable.</p>

<p>For example. Microsoft’s statement once was: “A computer on every desk and in every home.”
This mission statement probably seemed unachievable
when it was first announced by Bill Gates in 1980. Forty years later, it’s
clear that this mission statement wasn’t grand enough!</p>

<p>One day, as I was reflecting on mission statements that sound impossible, I
started brainstorming joke statements to share with a friend. In the process, I stumbled across a statement that I couldn’t
stop thinking about:</p>

<p>“Make all software, from all time, instantly available for use by any
programmer” — this is now what I consider my personal mission statement to be.</p>

 My personal mission statement: 

<p>There are a lot of ways to interpret this mission
statement-which I like. I want this mission statement to be
flexible and able to grow and change over time.
That said, let me break down how I’m thinking about it right now:</p>

<p>Let’s start with the first part of the mission statement: “Make all software,
from all time”. My thinking here is that, given enough time, software can be refined to the point that it’s nearly perfect, or at least its inadequacies are well
understood. When software reaches this level of perfection, it
doesn’t really make sense to re-write it. So, why should we have to?
It should be easy to use code from any programming language in
any other programming language. Most programming languages have
limited support for this type of functionality, though it usually
involves bindings into code written in C. Why should it end there? I want to be able to use, Haskell code from Python, Java from Lua, or
Fortran from Go, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, for the next part of the mission statement: “instantly available”. I  believe that a programmer’s code should go into production as soon as they lift their finger off the keyboard. They shouldn’t have
to wait for a compile to finish, for tests to pass, or for an
interpreter to reload their code. All of those things, especially
testing, are important, but they should happen automatically and
finish within milliseconds.</p>

<p>Now for the last part of the mission statement: “for use by any programmer”.
My opinion is that any programmer should be able to leverage code written by
another programmer, no matter what the skill level or programming language
either programmer has. This distinction is important to me because nearly
everything I’ve described above is already possible, but only for very
experienced programmers. As William Gibson famously said, “The future is
already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.”</p>

 That all sounds great, but what are you going to do about it? 

<p>Even if you agree that the things I want to do are worthwhile, it’s
still fair to ask what that means in concrete terms.</p>

<p>One of things that I’m passionate about is making software
development more “instantly available”. There are many problems that need solving in this
area. For example, much of software development today involves unnecessary waiting. As
programmers, we spend a lot of time waiting for software to install, tests to
pass, a deploy to finish-the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way, though. We can and should make better tools for
ourselves and each other.</p>

<p>One example of something I’ve made is a page that lets
you <a href="https://developer.okta.com/live-widget/">edit the code of the Okta Sign-In Widget with instant feedback, from inside
your web browser</a>. However, it uses JavaScript and, since I’m focusing
on Python and Go, I wanted to make an example of running Python from inside of
the browser. So, I wrote a game for you to play which I have included below:</p>

 Running Python in a Web Browser 

<p>This is a simple game where the goal is to write a Python function (<code>answer()</code>) that takes
three numbers of a sequence as input (we label these <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>) and
returns the next number in that sequence.</p>

<p>For example, let’s imagine that the <code>answer(a, b, c)</code> function is given part of this
integer sequence as input:</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://dilbert.com/strip/2001-10-25">
    
  </a>      
</p>

<p>In this case, <code>answer()</code> would be called with the first three numbers of the sequence, like so:
<code>answer(9, 9, 9)</code>. In this case, the correct answer would be <code>9</code> and the code
to “solve” this sequence might look something like this:</p>

   <code>def answer(a, b, c):
    return 9
</code>   

<p>To win this game, you have to write a function that will be able to give
the correct answer for all of the sequences that show up on the
checklist below. The checklist will update as you solve for each sequence.
Update the Python code below to start playing!</p>

<p>Sequence checklist:</p>

 
   
   
   
    You did it!
    Reward yourself by <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome">learning more about The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a> ®
    and why Donald Knuth says you can use it to
    <a href="https://youtu.be/BxQw4CdxLr8?t=1187">"compute your way into the literature"</a>.
   
  def answer(a, b, c):
    return True

play(answer)
 


<p>Edit the code above to play. No need to press a “save” button or anything. Your code will run once you’ve
stopped typing for a bit.</p>

 “That’s interesting, I guess. Why should I care?” 

<p>Perhaps you played the game, perhaps you didn’t. But in either case, the reason
I included this game in this blog post might not be apparent. I
did so to show that, not only is it fairly easy to run
a non-JavaScript interpreter in the browser, it can be a lot of fun when you do.</p>

<p>I wanted to make something that:</p>

 
   Involves writing some mildly-complex code, something just a little bit more complicated than “hello world”. 
   Runs as soon as you stop typing. 
   Teaches the player something new. 
   Shows that it’s fairly easy, and fun, to run Python directly from a browser. 
 

<p>If you want to see how all of this works, just use the “View Source”
functionality of your browser. The entire game is written in Python and I plan
on writing an in-depth explanation of the code behind this game in a subsequent
post.</p>

 That’s all for now 

<p>In closing, I hope you found my “personal mission statement” to be as thought
provoking as I do and I hope that you had as much fun playing
my little game as I did making it.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear from you in the comments below, or <a href="https://twitter.com/jf">on Twitter</a>.</p>

  <p>At ForgeRock, we like partnerships that deliver real business and technical value to our customers and prospects. Today’s <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/about-us/press-releases/forgerock-joins-microsoft-intelligent-security-association">announcement</a> that we’ve joined the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) is a text-book example of two organizations coming together to provide even greater value for its shared customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re proud to earn a spot in the MISA ecosystem. Membership means an organization has met a high bar for delivering an integration with Microsoft Cloud Security services that will make a meaningful difference for customers. In our case, the new integrations we’ve delivered will help reduce risk and strengthen compliance for joint customers using Microsoft Endpoint Manager, Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Azure Sentinel.&nbsp;</p>

 Microsoft Graph Integrations 

<p>We approached the ForgeRock integrations in a way that would allow customers to benefit from Microsoft Cloud Security’s vast threat intelligence data to deliver a multi-layered risk mitigation strategy throughout a user's authentication and authorization journey. We did this by working with Microsoft to help strengthen the security of the user, the device they are on, and understand the user’s activities. This required three integrations with three different services, all enabled by ForgeRock’s integrations with the Microsoft Graph.</p>

<p>To understand the risk associated with a user we can check the posture of that user by leveraging a component of Azure Active Directory (AAD) called Confirm Compromise (a feature of their <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/overview-identity-protection">Azure Active Directory Identity Protection</a>). We built an <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/am/7/authentication-guide/about-authentication-trees.html">authentication node</a> for <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">ForgeRock Intelligent Access</a> that reaches out to the Microsoft Security Graph. This node&nbsp; checks whether or not AAD thinks a particular user is risky. Depending on the risk level reported by Microsoft Identity Protection, ForgeRock Intelligent Access can adjust the user’s journey to require additional step-up authentication or deny the user access altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next layer in this risk mitigation strategy is to understand the security of the device the user has. To understand the user’s “device posture”, we once again built a ForgeRock authentication node that utilizes the Microsoft Graph to query Microsoft’s Unified Endpoint Management solution, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-endpoint-manager">Microsoft Endpoint Manager.</a> We do this in order to understand whether or not the end user’s device satisfies a Compliance Policy. These organizationally defined policies may require a device to not be jail-broken, or that a machine is running the latest OS, before it is allowed to access a protected resource. Once ForgeRock Intelligent Access understands this device context from Microsoft Endpoint Manager, it can use it to make runtime decisions about the user’s authentication and authorization journey.</p>

<p>The final component in our layered approach required integration with one of the Microsoft Cloud’s newest solutions <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/">Microsoft Azure Sentinel</a>. Microsoft Azure Sentinel is a cloud-based Security Information Event Management (SIEM) that leverages advanced machine learning capabilities. To integrate with Sentinel, ForgeRock used our <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/common-services/common-audit">Common Audit Framework</a> (CAUD) which allows us to monitor user activity across our entire platform. This enables us to record any ForgeRock event, logging it to disk, relational databases, Splunk, or even syslog. We built a deep integration between CAUD and Azure Sentinel by leveraging a data format standard called Common Event Format (CEF). Since Microsoft has a number of pre-built visualizations, reports, dashboards and alerts that work out of the box on CEF data, our integration seamlessly leverages these powerful artifacts Microsoft has already built.</p>

<p>We believe these integrations are going to make a real impact in reducing risk for our joint customers and we look forward to hearing your feedback.</p>

<p>We believe the decentralized identity layer is finally mature enough to enable the next phase of development in DeFi. In an upcoming series of posts we will dive into the components that need to be built to enable unsecured DeFi lending, and lay out our vision for how to get there.</p><p>What has Bloom been up to?</p><p>For the last two and a half years, Bloom has been working towards the vision of a financial services ecosystem which is open and accessible to all individuals with any amount of inclusion in the traditional credit system.</p><p>In our original whitepaper, we outlined a multi-phase approach to achieve a decentralized credit system: First, we needed an identity layer that allowed individuals to receive, store, and share verified attributes about themselves. Next, we built a competitive marketplace to efficiently seek prices for identity verifications. Finally, with the first two pieces in place, we could build a system to aggregate data and build open risk assessment systems.</p><p>In April 2018, we built a <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/introducing-bloom-payment-channels-enabled-by-ethereum-whisper/">discovery marketplace</a> based on the BLT token, using a combination of smart contracts and Ethereum Whisper, which enabled vendors and individuals to find each other, in order to facilitate payment for identity verification related work. Shortly thereafter, we engaged in negotiations with data vendors to get the right data into the Bloom ecosystem and built connectors that enabled users to pull in data about their phone numbers, email addresses, watch-list screens, social media, identity documents, income &amp; assets.</p><p>First Key Lesson: Ecosystem Data</p><p>Attaining vendor participation in Bloom’s marketplace presented challenges. On the one hand, most vendors require custom enterprise contracts with monthly or yearly minimums. On the other hand, the scalable approach to these marketplaces requires transaction-based pricing. The vendors simply didn't understand the potential in a decentralized data marketplace. So, we got to work on building the demand for that data, with the goal of re-introducing the marketplace at the right time.</p><p>Second Key Lesson: Built-In User Privacy</p><p>By the EthSanFrancisco Hackathon in Fall 2018, Bloom had a fully functional end-to-end flow - Users could sign up, generate a unique identifier, receive credentials, and share with any 3rd party that integrated Bloom’s free-to-use <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a>. The overwhelming number of project submissions (<a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--lending-party-lets-anyone-get-a-decentralized-fiat-loan-with-bloom-protocol-and-/">Lending Party</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--how-sendput-makes-employee-expense-reimbursements-instant-with-bloom-protocol/">SendPut</a>, <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/built-on-bloom--blocusign-makes-digital-signatures-provable-and-secure-with-bloomid/">BlocuSign</a>) at that first hackathon led the Bloom team to expand Bloom’s vision of the identity layer.</p><p>Users wanted the ability to selectively disclose identity traits, share data without being tracked by an Ethereum address, and pull in traits we hadn't considered before. Our team responded to that need by building the <a href="https://bloom.co/blog/how-does-share-kit-work/">Selective Disclosure Merkle tree spec</a>.</p><p>Third Key Lesson: No Point in Doing This Alone</p><p>In February 2019, our team went to EthDenver to share the latest Share Kit improvements and review the next round of feedback and submissions from developers (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-mpOEjT9D0">Check out the workshop video here</a>). When we arrived, we learned the conference was using UPort decentralized identity wallets to register attendees for events. We each downloaded uPort, claimed a credential that verified our email addresses, and shared them by scanning a QR code. We realized that interoperability would have enabled us to register for the events using the Bloom app. Clearly, we needed to expand BloomID to be part of the wider decentralized identity community! This realization compelled the Bloom team to join the <a href="https://identity.foundation">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> and start collaborating with the 100+ other companies working to make decentralized identity a reality.</p><p>How has Bloom decentralized the identity layer?</p><p>Since Bloom began, we have migrated the protocol to adopt the most open, interoperable, and extensible proposals from the community.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AccountRegistryLogic.sol">BloomID</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (Decentralized Identifier)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core/blob/master/contracts/AttestationLogic.sol">Bloom Attestations</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-vault">Bloom Vault</a> → <a href="https://digitalbazaar.github.io/encrypted-data-vaults/">Encrypted Data Vault</a> &amp; <a href="https://identity.foundation/secure-data-store/">Secure Data Store</a> community  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/hellobloom.github.io/blob/master/attestation-data/Bloom-Merkle-Tree-22facf0b-bedb-4b45-bb7d-edcd57213eb0.md">Bloom Selective Disclosure Merkle Tree</a> -&gt; <a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">Mattr BBS signatures</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/core">Bloom Attestation Smart Contracts </a>→ <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-status-rl-2020">W3C RevocationList2020 spec</a> (among others)  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/share-kit">Bloom Share Kit</a> →<a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/presentation-exchange"> Presentation Exchange Specification</a> &amp; <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">Credential Handler API (CHAPI)</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/vc/tree/master/packages/verify-kit#example">Bloom Share Kit Payload</a> → <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>  <p>More than 60 DID methods have been invented, none by Bloom. Bloom products have adopted the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/element">Element</a> specification which is supported by multiple companies and is based on a protocol called Sidetree, maintained by <a href="https://www.transmute.industries">Transmute</a> and Microsoft, among others.</p><p>Why do we think the identity layer is ready?</p><p>The decentralized identity space is rapidly maturing. Additionally, developer tooling is becoming more and more accessible. The following examples illustrate an industry shift to make decentralized identity significantly more approachable for companies</p>  <a href="https://didproject.azurewebsites.net/docs/overview.html">Tutorial from Microsoft on generating DIDs &amp; Verifiable Credentials using Azure</a>  <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">Mattr tutorial for issuing credentials</a>  <p>What is the role of the Bloom App?</p><p>Think of the Bloom App as your DeFi credit utility. We aim to provide users with the best on-ramp experience to DeFi with vetted service providers, and access to all the data you need to get started. We want to open up the world of DeFi savings &amp; lending products to traditional users. That's why in the app today, you'll find an experience that is familiar and close to many other free credit monitoring applications, with a live integration with TransUnion for credit scoring, and breach monitoring powered by Have I Been Pwned.</p><p>Why isn't there already an affiliate marketplace in the app?</p><p>Some users may remember we briefly had a BloomID based marketplace in the app, but restrictions from Apple forced us to move this online. We will be revamping our approach to this marketplace with instant onboarding opportunities for users, in a way that also allows us to stay within Apple's guidelines.</p><p>What do we need to make it happen?</p><p>We need to call on all of our early partnerships from the early days of crypto, as well as newer companies that are working towards the vision of accessible DeFi products for consumers like <a href="https://www.teller.finance">Teller</a>.</p><p>At the same time we have prepared ourselves for the next step</p><p>We have built the first specification &amp; reference implementation for a Verifiable Credential Aggregator (BloomIQ) that solves the issue of user controlled aggregation without self-censoring negative signals. In an upcoming series of DeFi related posts, we will expand on BloomIQ and how we plan to roll it as part of our journey to enabled unsecured DeFi loans and credit-based crypto on-ramps.</p>

 Create an Ionic App 

<p>To begin, you’ll need to install the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/">Ionic CLI</a>.</p>

   <code>npm i -g @ionic/cli@6.11.0
</code>   

<p>Then, use <code>ionic start</code> to create a new Angular app with tabs. You might notice this command also specifies Capacitor. Using Capacitor is the recommended way to run Ionic apps on mobile devices from 2020 onward.</p>

   <code>ionic start ionic-social tabs --type angular --capacitor
cd ionic-social
</code>   

<p>Run <code>ionic serve</code> and make sure you can see the app in your browser.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>The easiest way to add OIDC authentication to an Ionic app is with OktaDev Schematics. Before I show you how to do that, you’ll need to create an Okta developer account and register your app to get a client ID. Head on over to <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">developer.okta.com/signup</a> if you’d like to do this in your browser.</p>

<p>If you prefer the command line, install the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-cli">Okta CLI</a>. Run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account.</p>

<p>Log in to your Okta Developer account or use <code>okta apps create</code>. If you use your browser, go to Applications &gt; Add Application.</p>

<p>On the Create New Application page, select Native. Name your app <code>Ionic Social</code>, and configure it as follows:</p>

 
   Login redirect URIs:
     
       <code>http://localhost:8100/callback</code> 
       <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta Org URL) 
     
   
   Logout redirect URIs:
     
       <code>http://localhost:8100/logout</code> 
       <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/logout</code> 
     
   
   Grant type allowed:
     
       Authorization Code 
       Refresh Token 
     
   
   Click Done 
 

<p>If you’re using the command line, you’ll have to use your browser to adjust the redirect URIs. Your app’s settings should look similar to the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the following command to add a sign-in feature to your Ionic + Capacitor app.</p>

   <code>ng add @oktadev/schematics@2.2.0 --platform=capacitor
</code>   

<p>Running this command will prompt you for an issuer and client ID. If you used your browser to create an app, the client ID is displayed on your screen. You can find the issuer in your Okta dashboard at API &gt; Authorization Servers. It usually looks something like <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>If you used the CLI, you should have this information in your terminal. You can run <code>okta apps</code> to see your apps and <code>okta apps config --app=&lt;appName&gt;</code> to get your app’s info.</p>

<p>This process will install several dependencies and a plethora of files to handle OIDC authentication.</p>

<p>Click Login to sign in to your Okta developer account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You’ll be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Get User Details to fetch the user’s information using the following code in <code>src/app/tab1/tab1.page.ts</code>.</p>

   <code>public async getUserInfo(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
  this.userInfo = await this.authService.getUserInfo&lt;IUserInfo&gt;();
}
</code>   

<p>Your user information will be rendered in <code>src/app/tab1/tab1.page.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;ion-card *ngIf="userInfo"&gt;
  &lt;ion-card-header&gt;
    User Info
  &lt;/ion-card-header&gt;
  &lt;ion-card-content&gt;
    {{userInfo | json}}
  &lt;/ion-card-content&gt;
&lt;/ion-card&gt;
</code>   

<p>One of the neat things you can do with your Okta developer account is add additional identity providers. This means you can add Apple as an identity source and easily add Sign in with Apple to your Ionic app!</p>

 Configure Sign in with Apple 

<p>To begin, you must have an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple developer account</a>. You’ll need to create an App ID, a Services ID, and a private key.</p>

 Create an App ID on Apple 

<p>Log in to <a href="https://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a> and go to Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles. Select Identifiers on the left and click the blue + icon. Select App IDs and Continue. Select App and Continue. Enter a description and bundle ID. I used <code>Ionic Social</code> and <code>com.okta.developer.ionic-social</code>.</p>

<p>Scroll down and select Sign in with Apple, click Continue, and then Register.</p>

 Create a Services ID on Apple 

<p>To create a Services ID (with allowed redirect URIs), go to Identifiers &gt; blue + icon Services IDs &gt; Continue. I used <code>Okta</code> for the description and <code>com.okta.developer.ionic</code> for the identifier. Click Continue, then Register.</p>

<p>Select the identifier that you just created.</p>

<p>Select the Sign in with Apple checkbox, and then click Configure to define the domain your app is running on and the redirect URLs used during the OAuth flow.</p>

<p>Enter the domain name where your app runs in the Domains and Subdomains box (e.g., <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code>). In the Return URLs box, enter your Okta tenant’s <code>/authorize/callback</code> URL, for example <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code>.</p>

<p>Click Next, Done, Continue, and then Save.</p>

 Create a Private Key for Client Authentication 

<p>On the Certificates, Identifiers, &amp; Profiles page, select Keys, and then Create a key.</p>

<p>Give your key a name (e.g., <code>AppleLoginKey</code>), select Sign in with Apple, and click Configure.</p>

<p>Select your App ID from the Primary App ID drop-down box and click Save. Apple will generate a new private key.</p>

<p>Click Continue, Register, and then Download.</p>

<p>Click Done, and then on the Keys page, click the key that you just created and make a note of the Key ID. You need it in the next section.</p>

<p>Make a note of your Team ID in the upper-right corner of your Apple developer dashboard (just below your account name).</p>

<p>TIP: See Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/apple/create-an-app-at-idp/">developer docs for Sign in with Apple</a> if these steps don’t work.</p>

 Add Apple as an Identity Provider in Okta 

<p>Open your Okta developer console in a new tab and navigate to Users &gt; Social &amp; Identity Providers &gt; Add Identity Provider &gt; Add Apple.</p>

 
   Name: <code>Apple</code> 
   Client ID: <code>com.okta.developer.ionic</code> (your Services ID from Apple) 
   Client Secret Signing Key: upload the <code>.p8</code> file you downloaded 
   Key ID and Team ID: available in your last tab 
   Scopes: defaults (<code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>openid</code>) are fine 
 

<p>Click Add Identity Provider. Click the arrow next to your new IdP, and you’ll see its ID.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy this ID and open <code>src/app/auth/auth.service.ts</code> in a text editor. Add <code>auth_extras</code> as a property to <code>authConfig</code> and add your Apple IdP’s ID as an <code>idp</code> property.</p>

   <code>const authConfig: any = {
  ...
  usePkce: true,
  auth_extras: {
    idp: '&lt;your-apple-idp-id&gt;'
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Restart your Ionic app and open <code>http://localhost:8100</code> in a private window. Click Login 
and you’ll be redirected to Apple to sign in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Log in, and you should be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you receive an error about <code>Missing fields: 'firstName','lastName'</code>, you’ll need to remove the app from your Apple ID. On a Mac, go to System Preferences &gt; Apple ID &gt; Password &amp; Security &gt; Apps Using Your Apple ID &gt; Edit. Go to Ionic Social and click Stop Using Apple ID. This error happens because Apple sends the name only the very first time you log in.</p>

<p>Click Get User Details, and your info will be fetched from Apple via Okta.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s pretty cool that you can add Sign in with Apple via Okta, don’t you think?! 😀</p>

<p>But what if you want to allow people to sign up for an account and you want to manage your users? The good news is you can configure Okta as your main login screen with buttons to sign in with Apple, Google, and many other identity providers.</p>

<p>TIP: To see how to enable user registration, see <a>Tutorial: User Login and Registration in Ionic &gt; Add User Registration</a>.</p>

 What about Okta’s Angular SDK and Sign-In Widget? 

<p>Okta provides an <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-angular">Angular SDK</a> as well as the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget">Sign-In Widget</a>. I’ve encountered quite a few developers that want to have an in-app login screen without popping a browser.</p>

<p>The Sign-In Widget seems like a good solution for this. However, in a Capacitor app, <code>capacitor://localhost</code> is sent as an <code>origin</code> header, and Okta only allows <code>http</code> and <code>https</code> as schemas. This means the CORS request for the <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> metadata fails.</p>

<p>I thought the <a href="https://github.com/capacitor-community/http">Capacitor Community’s HTTP module</a> would fix this, but <a href="https://github.com/capacitor-community/http/issues/45">it does not</a>. I’m currently trying to convince Okta to allow <code>capacitor://</code> as a schema for trusted origins.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can customize the Okta-hosted version of the Sign-In Widget. To do this, you need to create a custom domain.</p>

 Create a Custom Domain and TLS Certificate with Cloudflare 

<p>To use a custom domain with Okta, you need to have access to its DNS settings and create a TLS certificate.</p>

<p>Cloudflare makes this easy. <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up">Sign up for Cloudflare</a> if you don’t have an account.</p>

<p>Log in to Cloudflare and select +Add Site. It’s best if you point a whole domain at Cloudflare. For example, I used <code>mattraible.com</code>. The free plan is good enough for this tutorial.</p>

<p>After transferring your domain, you’ll need to create an origin CA certificate.</p>

 
   Click the SSL/TLS app 
   Click the Origin Server tab 
   Click Create Certificate to open the Origin Certificate Installation window 
   Select Let Cloudflare generate a private key and a CSR 
   Change Certificate Validity to 1 year (Okta will reject the certificates with a 15-year expiration) 
   Click Next 
 

<p>Copy the Origin Certificate to a <code>tls.cert</code> file on your hard drive. Copy the Private key to <code>private.key</code>.</p>

<p>In Okta, go to Customization &gt; Domain Name &gt; Edit &gt; Get Started. Enter a subdomain name (e.g., <code>id.mattraible.com</code>) and click Next. You’ll be prompted to verify domain ownership. Add the specified <code>TXT</code> record on Cloudflare via the DNS &gt; + Add record option.</p>

<p>Click Verify &gt; Next on Okta.</p>

<p>For the Certificate field, copy/paste the contents of <code>tls.cert</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a Mac, you can use <code>cat tls.cert | pbcopy</code> in a terminal to copy the file to your clipboard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Put the contents of <code>private.key</code> in the Private key box. Click Next.</p>

<p>You’ll be prompted to add a CNAME record. Add this to your Cloudflare DNS. Click Finish.</p>

<p>NOTE: When I first tried this, I found that my home network caches DNS entries, and I was unable to get to <code>id.mattraible.com</code> for days. However, if I connected with my phone, I was able to load it. I grabbed the IP address when I was connected to my phone and added an entry to my <code>hosts</code> file as a workaround.</p>

<p>Wait until <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;</code> resolves in your browser before continuing.</p>

 Configure a Custom Domain for Your Authorization Server 

<p>The OpenID Connect specification requires a <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> endpoint with metadata about your app’s endpoints. You should be able to see yours at:</p>

   <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
</code>   

<p>You might notice that it has your Okta <code>dev-*</code> domain, rather than your custom domain name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You need to update your authorization server to use your custom domain to fix this. Log in to your Okta account and go to API &gt; Authorization Servers &gt; default &gt; Edit. Change the Issuer to use Custom URL.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Try <code>./well-known/openid-configuration</code> again; it should have your custom domain now.</p>

 Configure Apple to Allow Your Custom Domain 

<p>Since you’ve added a new domain, you’ve created another possible redirect URL. Log in to your <a href="https://developer.apple.com">Apple developer account</a> and go to the Service ID you created. Edit your service and configure Sign in with Apple. Add a new Website URL with your domain and authorize callback.</p>

 
   Domains: <code>&lt;id.domain.name&gt;</code> 
   Return URLs: <code>https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code> 
 

<p>You can see the values I used below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done, Continue, and Save.</p>

 Configure Ionic to use Your Custom Domain 

<p>Open <code>src/app/auth/auth.service.ts</code> in your Ionic app and change the configuration to use your custom domain. Remove <code>auth_extras</code> too.</p>

   <code>const issuer = 'https://&lt;id.domain.name&gt;/oauth2/default';
const authConfig: any = {
  identity_client: clientId,
  identity_server: issuer,
  redirect_url: redirectUri,
  end_session_redirect_url: logoutRedirectUri,
  scopes,
  usePkce: true
};
</code>   

<p>Now you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget.</p>

 Add Sign in with Apple to the Hosted Sign-In Widget 

<p>In Okta, go to Customization &gt; Sign-in Page. Make sure you’re using the latest version, then modify the HTML on the right. Find the line with <code>var config</code> and add the following after it, where <code>&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;</code> can be found at Users &gt; Social &amp; Identity Providers &gt; (&gt;) before Apple.</p>

   <code>config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;'}
];
config.idpDisplay = "PRIMARY";
</code>   

<p>Scroll up and click Save and Publish.</p>

<p>Navigate to your custom <code>id.domain.name</code>, and you should see a Sign in with Apple button.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Social Login with Google 

<p>If you want to add Sign in with Google, you can do it with very similar steps. Rather than repeat all the steps verbatim here, I invite you to check out Okta’s <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/google/create-an-app-at-idp/">Google Social Login Guide</a>.</p>

<p>Tip: You’ll need to add <code>http://localhost:8100</code> as a JavaScript origin to sign in with Google via your browser in development.</p>

<p>After you’ve registered Google as an identity provider, update your sign-in page’s code.</p>

   <code>config.idps = [
  {type: 'APPLE', id: '&lt;apple-idp-id&gt;'},
  {type: 'GOOGLE', id: '&lt;google-idp-id&gt;'},
];
</code>   

<p>Click Save and Publish. Now you should be able to sign in with Apple or Google. How cool is that?! 😎</p>

<p></p>

 Run Your Ionic App in iOS Simulator 

<p>To build your app and run it on iOS Simulator, run the following commands:</p>

   <code>ionic build --prod
npx cap add ios
npx cap open ios
</code>   

<p>Add your custom scheme to <code>ios/App/App/Info.plist</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLTypes&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
  &lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLName&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.getcapacitor.capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;CFBundleURLSchemes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;array&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;capacitor&lt;/string&gt;
      &lt;string&gt;com.okta.$dev-subdomain&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;/array&gt;
  &lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
</code>   

<p>In Xcode, go to App &gt; Signing &amp; Capabilities and select your team. Then, click the ▶ button in the top left and deploy to an iPhone X. Click the Login button, and you should see options to sign in with Apple, Google, or your Okta credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>NOTE: If you want to debug your Ionic app in Simulator, you can use Safari to debug Simulator in its Develop menu.</p>

<p>Sign in with Apple and then click the button to get your user details. You should see everything working.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Google should work too!</p>

<p></p>

 Deploy Ionic App to iOS Phone 

<p>If you have an iPhone, you should be able to deploy your Ionic app to it. Plug your iPhone in via USB, and it should show up as a target in Xcode. You should see an App &gt; Your Phone Name at the top. Click ▶ to deploy to your (unlocked) phone.</p>

<p>I dig the Sign in with Apple experience on my iPhone 11! iOS takes over without a redirect and makes it seamless.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For me, Face ID is even part of the flow! 😃</p>

 

  

 

 Learn More about Ionic and Social Login 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial on how to add Sign in with Apple (and Google) to your Ionic apps. The thing I dig about Okta’s setup is that I can use the same identity provider for all my apps that use my authorization server. That means I only have to configure external IdPs once, and all my apps can take advantage of it.</p>

<p>You can find all the code for this example on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-social-login-example">@oktadeveloper/okta-ionic-social-login-example repository</a>.</p>

<p>For the full conversation, watch the video below or read the transcript that follows, which has been edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p></p>
 
 Digital business is not technology 
 Chris  
<p>Before we dig in, it would be useful for us to talk about what digital business is. It's certainly a term that we've been using here at Gartner for some time. How do you think about digital business, Kristen?</p>
 Kristin 
<p>It's not technology. Digital business is about using technology to create new products, to create new business models, new operating models. And we distinguish between optimization and transformation. Optimization is where you're using technology to improve customer engagement or sell more of your existing product. It's about doing old things in new ways.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/avoid-these-9-corporate-digital-business-transformation-mistakes/">Transformation</a> is different. It's about doing new things in new ways. It’s about using digital to change the game in your industry and create new digital products and new business models. And I find that with just about every client that I work with, it's a good thing to level-set on what it is, because just when you think everybody's on the same page, you find out that they’re not.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36189"]</p>
 Instead of a cost, digital is considered a tool to move forward 
 Chris 
<p>It is. And speaking of being thrust onto the same page, it's very much the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">dynamic of the crisis </a>that we've been through and why this topic has sort of come to the foreground of that. I like to say that the future has been brought forward and many of the things that we were working on before all of a sudden started to move faster.</p>
<p>It's different from a typical recession. It's different in lots of different ways. First of all, it's a legislated recession, so that dynamic is completely different. It's not like the financial system fell apart, but it did make us have to scramble to figure out how to keep the business going in some cases and respond to the situation that was surrounding us.</p>
<p>In a typical recession, executives are very much focused on cost-cutting, for example. And there's been some of that, certainly cost avoidance in order to trim those things that we could, but we've seen in the data a shift actually away from that recently toward more aggressive types of actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>69% of board directors are now saying that they want digital</p>
</blockquote>
 Kristin 
<p>What we're seeing is that 69% of board directors are now saying that they want digital business. Instead of a typical cost-cutting-type reaction, the reaction this time is different. In some ways it's our first digital recession, where digital is a tool that can help us move forward. And so it's really out with the old and in with the new.</p>
<p>Some of the IT spend data that we're seeing is also showing that this recession is very different. In most recessions, what you see as you see a dip in IT spending, then followed by an increase in IT spending. And right now there's a divergence, where you see spending for things like RPA up by 13% and infrastructure as a service up 14%, but then things like inkjet printers are down 24% and on-premises communications down 27%.</p>
 Chris 
<p>One of the other pieces of data from that board of directors survey talks about their intention to invest more generally in information and technology. And the way that I read that data is not just for central IT, but across wherever IT solutions are developed within the organization, what I call the IT diaspora, in that you have a lot of very skilled technical people delivering solutions that sit in line of business or closer to the customer and so on. And the intention is to fund that.</p>
<p>Now it's a shift of funding, so some parts of the organization, like marketing, are experiencing a decrease in funding for maybe obvious reasons, but it's a signal that at the top level, at the corporate director level, the belief is that investment in technology is actually a way to scale out of this situation that we're in.</p>
<p>What I find interesting about the situation is that the corporate directors that we're surveying and talking to are reporting the status of what's actually happening. And 70% are telling us that things are moving faster, so that's really optimistic and it's a vote of confidence for those who have been working really hard to deliver solutions to keep the business running over the last seven months. So it's an interesting time, a positive time. And I don't want to miss the fact that it's fairly optimistic.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/decide-now-how-much-to-recalibrate-it-strategic-plans/">Decide Now How Much to Recalibrate IT Strategic Plans</a></p>
 Kristin 
<p>The thing is that now the board of directors is ready to go, but that doesn't just magically mean that all of a sudden, “Oh, great, we'll just accelerate. Sure, we haven't been trying to do that for the last five years at all.“ I think it's really a time where leadership matters more than ever. And there are things that IT leaders, CIOs and executive leaders can be doing right now to make most of the situation. Get rid of things that are in the way that slow things down.</p>
<p>We've seen a lot of process automation. Automation in manufacturing settings has reduced the need to have 10 people in a tight, small area to one. Decisions are a big part of what slowed us down pre-COVID. And I recommend always trying to reduce the scope of decisions. Sometimes what you're trying to make a decision on is just too big and it could be broken down into smaller pieces.</p>
 A need for digital business speed 
 Chris 
<p>We had to get rid of a lot of the ritual in our decision making and remove bureaucratic gates and stop points. Actually, people had to work together really quickly and ended up breaking things that needed to be broken perhaps before, so that you could move more quickly. So if it's a physical environment we're talking about, real physics, you would reduce drag and friction and inertia, at least the inertia that keeps you still in order to move more quickly. What are some other things that organizations can do to increase their acceleration even more?</p>
 Kristin 
<p>So there's drags and then the opposite of that is force multipliers, like doing things purposefully. If you're a B2B company, put a prominent “here's how to buy from us” on your website. And go as close as possible to one-click purchasing. Another tactic is about redirecting resources and that can be financial, it can be people. You could shift the travel and expense money that isn't being spent now into the cloud. We're seeing a big shift in spending, a big acceleration toward the cloud.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes going slow helps you actually go faster</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have complex sourcing arrangements, can you move some of that to gig workers? And then most importantly of all, it's a time to pause and rethink how you're winning in the marketplace. There's new demand. There's all kinds of new opportunities that are emerging in this different kind of world that we're living in. And sometimes going slow helps you actually go faster. So one way to do that would be creative video about what's happening digitally in your industry on a worldwide basis.</p>
 Talent and cultures role in digital business acceleration 
 Chris 
<p>The other thing in the conversations that I'm having with executives and really over the last six months, the conversation often starts as a human conversation. This is a first, a human catastrophe that we're in the middle of, and that causes a psychological ripple effect through everything that we do. And even though we're talking about digital business acceleration, what this really is, it's a story of human resilience.</p>
<p>So it is people in their determination to survive. And that actually gets transposed into business context, into government context and so on. And it takes me back to my undergrad psychology days. We go through time with a set of heuristics that works for processing the world that we experience. And that's fine until the context is completely broken, which of course is what we've experienced.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now is a time to hack for emotions, culture hacks for pride, for belonging, for agency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And at that time, what the brain does is it searches for new patterns. It searches for the things that are going to work next. It's a very experimental, very innovative time and so on. And we do that as a species to survive. But it's fascinating that businesses do this, too. And so all the things you've talked through in terms of reducing drag and reallocating resources, adding accelerants and fuel into this seizing value, all of these things are true survival mechanisms. And the thing that of course makes this easier now is the state of technology.</p>
<p>So even though digital business isn't really about technology at its essence, it couldn't exist without it. So the things that we've been able to do, for example, to get people working remotely really effectively — think if this had happened 20 years ago, we wouldn't be able to have these kinds of conversations. There wasn't enough bandwidth, we didn't have the right kind of dial-up for all of this. And so there's this shift that I'm sensing, which is human to enterprise to society actually.</p>
 Kristin 
<p>Yeah. I think when we think about acceleration, a couple of the bigger barriers that CIOs have been dealing with over the last bunch of years are talent and culture. And because of all the things you just mentioned, we're in a different situation with those two areas. They’re still very important things to pay attention to, but from a culture standpoint, people's lives have been turned upside down in so many different ways. And we've all had to make big changes in our personal lives. We're primed for change. And we want our companies to succeed and thrive and do well.</p>
<p>We've done some new research around culture hacking where now is a time to hack for emotions, culture hacks for pride, for belonging, for agency. We're ready for change. We're having to change all the time right now. Then from a talent perspective, it's a great time to take talent in your organization that maybe <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-covid-19-downtime-to-upskill-for-digital/">isn't as busy as they usually are and retrain them</a> to areas that have been in high demand, like data science.</p>

 Determine where digital business initiatives fit within business goals 
 Chris 
<p>Ultimately this results in more work to be done and the need for some kind of prioritization for initiatives that are going to move at different speeds. How do we think about that in terms of staying in your lane?</p>
 Kristin 
<p>You don't want to stay in your lane, and very few are still in the exact same lane that they were in, six months ago. There's a fast lane and this includes projects that you had to do really quickly, such as work from home during lockdown. And now is a good time to go back and make that more robust. Another example is digital commerce that companies got up really quickly, which may not have delivered the best customer experience, so go back and improve.</p>
<p>There's a growth lane and that's new opportunities that have been uncovered because of COVID-19. So for example, AI for customer segmentation or machine learning for product optimization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Customer retention is such an important metric right now because that's the foundation for future growth, as is finding new customer segments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a fix-it lane for initiatives that are not working very well. I just saw that a lot of the small and midsize banks in the U.S. that were planning core banking system replacements, they're continuing forward with because even as digital as that industry has been, there's a lot more transactions that are being done through a mobile and contact list and so forth. And they want to make sure that their systems are robust enough to handle that.</p>
<p>And there's slow lane things that because of COVID-19, maybe you deemphasize. So in some industries, if you were doing a lot of work around blockchain experimentation, it's not that you stop that, but digital commerce might be a more important priority right now.</p>
<p>Then there's the exit lane, things that you were doing before that just don't make sense now. For example, we see dramatically declining spend on on-premises communications because people aren't in the office right now.</p>
 Prioritize digital investments to demonstrate success 
 Chris 
<p>You’ve given us the five lanes, but how do you decide which digital initiatives to prioritize?</p>
 Kristin 
<p>I think it's really two things. It's about what matters to customers and what matters to you as an enterprise. And so I would evaluate both of those things on a scale of one to five. It's about revenue for you as an enterprise, it's about net profits, but then for customers, it's about what can you do? That's really going to provide more value to customers. Customer retention is such an important metric right now because that's the foundation for future growth, as is finding new customer segments.</p>
 Chris 
<p>You talked about skills a little bit. Some of the things that I'm seeing is the move toward cloud for one and automation is another. And the skills that are associated with that are really important. For example, teaching people to really understand container architectures and how to use those for cloud. Because that's a resilience characteristic, and it's a pattern that's easy to break, which ends up in bad things.</p>
<p>In the automation space, there are a lot of underlying process improvements that have to happen. It's not enough just to automate processes that already exist, but to really rethink those. So there's a process analysis element to that. And then of course, everything having to do with data and information, information governance. Those are always perennially important topics, but even more so now if we're trying to make decisions more quickly and understand the environment. Those are some of the ones that I see.</p>
 Kristin 
<p>I would add to that design thinking because we've made this rapid transition to digital customer interactions. And then, we've seen such a high demand for AI cybersecurity as well.</p>
 COVID-19 and its effect on digital business 
 Chris 
<p>How might COVID-19 slow us down when it comes to accelerating digital businesses? Is COVID-19 itself a drag on an acceleration?</p>
 Kristin 
<p>It's kind of like as people, our biggest strengths are usually our biggest weaknesses, but I think some of the slowdown is good in terms of pausing and rethinking. What state of disruption is your industry in, even aside from COVID-19. Because we will come out of COVID-19, and many of the forces that we're acting on in various industries will be there as strong as ever.</p>
 Chris 
<p>When it comes to COVID-19, where I see it creating drag, is it creates a hesitancy because we don't know how the virus is going to act. So if you think about it, human catastrophe, many businesses were impacted really negatively. Not all, it's not sort of universally bad.</p>
<p>There were some where demand actually increased, but it changed the whole nature of what we do. And it changes so frequently — every week seems a different priority. Combine that with the downstream instabilities that the virus caused. So whether that be social instability, economic, instability, geopolitical, instability, it makes it really hard to plan.</p>
<p>So when I'm looking at scenario exercises, now they're not three years out, they're three quarters out at the longest. The drag that comes from COVID-19 is to not plan or think toward the future.</p>
<p>A really significant psychological dynamic happened when Q2 ended. And we're seeing in the economics data in many parts of the world where March, April and May was the very nature of the very bottom of this thing. And starting to come back up again, economically and so on. So there's a sense that there's some forward movement there. COVID-19, because of the uncertainties of the epidemiological models themselves makes it hard to plan, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't plan. That's how I think about it.</p>

<p>The
Procivis Think Tank meeting of 3 September 2020 took place against the backdrop
of a corona flare up and new travel restrictions in Europe. Accordingly, at
short notice we switched to our first-ever webinar format. </p>



<p>Our
first speaker, MEP Eva Kaili, shared her views against the background of the announcement
of the EU’s €750 billion “Next Generation” pandemic recovery plan in addition
to its new long-term budget of €1,100 billion. She highlighted the EU’s priorities
– “green and digital” and security in North Africa/Middle East.</p>



<p>How
did the European parliament operate during the lockdown? </p>



<p>Eva
Kaili explained that ballots were submitted via email. This illustrates how one
always makes do with the technology that one has during an emergency. Projects
were under way to make the system more resilient. During the Q&amp;A with Eva
Kaili it was also helpful to be reminded again that the EU only has the
competences that were conferred to it by member states in treaties. </p>



<p>Shaping
Digital Europe 2040</p>



<p>Gianluca
Misuraca presented his research on “Shaping Digital Europe 2040: Artificial intelligence
&amp; public sector innovation in a data-driven society”. It was interesting to
see that the EU is funding such long-term research. Looking ahead to 2040, he presented
scenarios based on a sliding scale of digital participation by citizens vs. the
degree to which this participation was regulated. &nbsp;The digital future might not be knowable, but
we can imagine its contours, challenges and opportunities.</p>

<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> has some very happy news to share about a new partnership with <a href="https://heder.be">Heder VZW</a> and a new&nbsp;KidTech&nbsp;product planned to launch December 2020. But first, we would like to share a little about why we believe this is so important.



Back in April 2019, we presented our thoughts at the World Government Summit on the digital future for Kids.




<blockquote>“Every child born in today’s digital world will live a dual physical and digital life. How we enable privacy and security for their digital twin in as important as the rights afforded to them in the physical world. If we don’t get this right, we risk a generation born into digital slavery”<p></p>– Katryna Dow, Meeco<br>World Government Summit, 2019</blockquote>




Sadly, a year on from the Summit and our concerns are evidenced all too often. This week by the news that the parents of 5 million British children under the age of 13, are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-14/google-faces-3-billion-u-k-suit-over-use-of-children-s-data?srnd=technology-vp">mounting a legal battle</a> with the tech giant Google, for $3 Billion.



At the heart of their claims is the desire to protect the digital rights of their children. The lawsuit alleges that YouTube’s method of targeting underage audiences constitute “major breaches” of UK and European privacy and data rules designed to protect citizens, especially kids.




 




This month NETFLIX released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaaC57tcci0">The Social Dilemma</a>, a must watch documentary on the social media addiction that is both alluring and alienating for each of us, especially our children. The documentary includes alarming statistics on the increase in childhood depression, self-harm and suicide.




 




Most alarming is that the age group impacted is getting younger and younger and directly linked to their early access to social media. These platforms make it all too easy for underage children to access and be subjected to unfiltered feedback that contributes to feelings of inadequacy, dissatisfaction and isolation.




<blockquote>“There has to be a better way for us to enable children to participate in the digital world, along with making their first digital experiences safe.”  

<br>– Katryna Dow, Meeco</blockquote>





 




Enter <a href="https://heder.be">Heder</a>, a not-for-profit organisation based in Antwerp, Belgium. Heder provides care and guidance to improve quality of life for children with different abilities, along with their families and extended networks.




 




Heder’s philosophy is to always start from present strengths. Finding small things or looking for bigger solutions that enable people to focus on their unique strengths. Fostering pride and allowing themselves to experience joy from everyday things. Cultivating this from early childhood, together with support from family and community really makes a difference.




 




Their multidisciplinary experts work together to give support in different ways including creative play, adjusted sports, training, physical and psychological therapy.&nbsp;Heder offers services in the home, at day-care, school or on campus, and is just some of the ways Heder contributes to a more inclusive society.




 




And now, there’s another way; drawing on Heder’s philosophy of building on strengths, the idea for mIKs-it was born. After a number of years of research, the inspiring vision of Gaby Pereira Martins (Masters in Educational Sciences) and Kim Struyf (Director of Early Development), supported by Heder’s Senior General Manager, Erik Van Acker, will now become a reality.




 





<blockquote>“Together with Meeco we can give mIKs-it a strong foundation” 



<br> – Kim Struyf, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://www.meeco.me">Meeco</a> is honoured to announce our partnership with Heder to co-develop a media platform for kids, focussing on the developmental stages of 0-7 years. The platform is called mIKs-it. It has been designed to foster joy and connection to everyday life for kids, with privacy, security and control as the foundation.




 




Early childhood is the most vulnerable time in a child’s development as they are totally dependent on family and society for nurturing and protection. It is also likely the period when they will first come into contact with technology. Whether it is playing with their parents’ phone, watching YouTube or listening to content, all these media choices present new challenges to navigate in order to keep children safe.




 




In designing mIKs-it we had the privilege to work with <a href="https://trendwolves.com">Trendwolves</a>, who validated the design, usability and kid’s experience through a series of research projects. The research was led by Maarten Leyts, the founder of Trendwolves. Maarten brought unique insight to the project, given his expertise in KidTech. Many of the issues we wanted to understand were addressed by Maarten in his upcoming book “Generation Alpha in Beta”, due for release later this year.




 





<blockquote>“Today’s and tomorrow’s kids swipe before they draw. Say hi to Generation Alpha. But we’re facing a challenge here. Fully immersed in technology during their formative years and in a fast-changing world, differentiates Gen Alpha from previous generations.”

<br>– Maarten Leyts, Trendwolves</blockquote>





 




Working with Trendwolves was the obvious choice as they specialise in trend research focusing on families and global youth culture. Their insights help shape and validate product design, always focussing on how we can enhance meaningful human relationships.&nbsp;




 




Following a successful proof-of-concept completed earlier in the year, the decision to develop the platform was clear. The results of the research, and especially observing kids with a wide range of abilities interact with personal content touched our hearts and motivated our action. Especially as the study included kids with a diverse range of physical and developmental abilities, focussing on media formats for kids with reduced motor skills or that are visually or hearing impaired.




 





<blockquote>“Meeco’s guiding principle in the digital world is the same as Heder’s principle for the physical world: children are entitled to a safe and positive climate in which to flourish.”   

<br>– Gaby Pereira Martins, Heder</blockquote>




<a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> has been designed to provide a safe digital place for children to interact with multimedia; photos, video and audio files. The platform is developed using Meeco’s globally awarded technology, with content secured and encrypted using the same approach Meeco developed to protect bank applications, like the digital vault for KBC Bank in Belgium.




 




mIKs-it is a family platform and not a social network. There are two companion apps – a media app for kids, supported by an app for their trusted grown-ups to manage connections, consent and content. The features of mIKs-it are all the things that it doesn’t do, such as:




 
 
  no ads  no tracking  no manipulation  no unauthorised access to your media  no contacts without your approval  no content without your consent  no data mining  
 



 








  
 
 




Most importantly, the control is always with parents and guardians, and personal data is never sold!








<blockquote>“Heder and Meeco is a purpose driven partnership, our shared goal is to enable a more empowering digital experience for all children.”

<br>– Erik Van Acker,  Heder</blockquote>





 




If you would like to know more about our progress over the coming months and the launch you can register your interest at the <a href="https://miks-it.com">mIKs-it</a> website.
<br>












 




We realise there’s still a lot to do to help our kids develop healthy and empowering digital habits, but our hope is that mIKs-it is a small, but meaningful step in the right direction.




 




Now we invite you to join us on this most wonderful adventure, into the land of mIKs-it: a playground where children and their grown ups can connect and safely share snippets of everyday life and build lasting memories.

<p>“Business leaders continue to treat security as a business inhibitor due to the lack of a defensible security program that links into business outcomes,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26004">Tom Scholtz</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.</p>

<p>To achieve a defensible information security management program, security and risk management leaders must <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/security-experts-must-connect-cybersecurity-to-business-outcomes/">bring the business along</a> as they establish governance and develop the ability to assess and interpret risk effectively.&nbsp;</p>
 Establish accountability with a security charter 
<p>A key aspect of defensibility is having the proper documentation and processes in place to&nbsp; enable risk-based control decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To form the foundation of your security program, create an Enterprise Security Charter. This short, plain-language document establishes clear owner accountability for protecting information resources and provides a mandate for the CISO (or equivalent) to establish and maintain the security program.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/5-security-questions-board-will-definitely-ask/">Executive leadership </a>must read, understand, visibly endorse and annually review the charter, ensuring sign-off on roles, scope and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Establish an information security steering committee to ensure decisions aren’t made in a vacuum by the security team. Include direct, decision-making representation across business units and functions.</p>
<p>By creating a place for ongoing input and support for security programs from senior business leaders, other leaders are able to see the risks not only to their own business unit, but across the business.</p>
 Set a clear vision for security programs 
<p>Business support for the security program hinges on conveying a clear vision that reflects the unique business context of the enterprise. Has there been recent cost cutting? Where’s the organization on its digital journey? What regulatory requirements have shifted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Executives are more likely to subscribe to a vision when the components and objectives are relevant and laid out in nontechnical terms. The vision should reflect the mid and long-term business needs for security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-security-and-risk-leaders-can-prepare-for-reduced-budgets/">How Security and Risk Leaders Can Prepare for Reduced Budgets</a></p>
<p>Provide a prioritized roadmap that clearly links projects and corrective actions to risks, vulnerabilities and the relevant business, technology and environmental drivers.&nbsp;</p>
 Demonstrate a quick response to changing threats 
<p>Security is a moving target, and executives are under pressure to demonstrate that the enterprise can handle changing threats. By gearing programs toward anticipating and reacting to frequent, unexpected changes, security and risk management leaders illustrate their ability to protect the organization — no matter what happens in the business environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To guide agile security planning implementation and operations day to day, develop a set of agreed-upon principles with business partners.&nbsp;Examples of principles include:</p>
 
 
<p>Supporting business outcomes rather than solely protecting the infrastructure</p>
 
 
<p>Considering the human element when designing and managing security controls</p>
 
 
<p>Conducting regular/periodic vulnerability assessments of the enterprise’s environment</p>
 
 
<p>Laying out these principles can help you continuously improve the effectiveness and efficiency of security controls while also reacting to change.</p>

<p>MATTR is proud to announce we’ve added support for privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our platform using&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures-spec">BBS+ signatures</a>. Using a technique to implement selective disclosure, we’ve added the ability to generate credentials that support zero knowledge proofs without revealing any unnecessary information about the end-user, or placing any added burden on issuers, in the process. Since we&nbsp;<a href="https://iiw.idcommons.net/ZKPs_for_JSON-LD">first introduced</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">open-sourced</a>&nbsp;JSON-LD BBS+ Signatures at&nbsp;<a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW30</a>&nbsp;in April of this year, we’ve received lots of engagement, feedback and contributions from the broader technical community to further develop the implementations and specifications we presented. You can read more about our approach to privacy-preserving verifiable credentials on our introductory&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">blog post</a>.</p>



<p>One of the benefits of using the BBS+ cryptographic scheme to sign credentials is the ability to derive a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">zero knowledge proof</a>&nbsp;from the signature, where the party generating the proof can choose to partially disclose statements from the original message. When enabled, this feature allows issuers to create a credential that effectively enforces minimal data disclosure using the MATTR Platform and a compliant digital wallet.</p>



Issuers can create ZKP-enabled credentials that allow the user to selectively disclose data



<p>To support this functionality, we generate the keys required to support these signatures and create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifier</a>&nbsp;(DID) with the keys referenced in the DID Document. BBS+ signatures require what’s called a&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-03">pairing-friendly curve</a>, we use&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-02#section-2.4">BLS12–381</a>. This DID can be referenced in credentials to establish the issuer of the data, a common practice to allow a verifier or relying party to trace the root of trust in a credential.</p>



<p>To issue a ZKP-enabled credential, simply use our API endpoint to create a new DID Key with type set to BLS 12–381. Then, create a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;(VC) using your new DID Key as the issuer DID. Our platform will automatically detect this capability is available in your DID and create a ZKP-enabled BBS+ credential for you. You can use the platform this way to create a privacy-enabled credential, or you can create a regular credential by providing a DID with a different key type — you have the option.</p>



<p>On the user side, you can hold ZKP-enabled credentials in your wallet alongside all of your other credentials. We’ve designed this process in a way that minimizes friction to the user. In future updates, our Mobile Wallet App will be able to detect if BBS+ signatures are being used in a credential. When you get a request to verify some information contained in one of these privacy-enabled credentials, it will derive a new presentation that selectively discloses the required info using a zero-knowledge proof. The platform will then allow verification of the proof using the same interface as any other type of presentation.</p>



<p>Our integrated approach treats zero-knowledge proofs as an extension of VCs, rather than an entirely new framework with a separate set of dependencies. We have built BBS+ Signatures and privacy-enabled credentials into our platform for anybody to experiment with, in what we think is a significant milestone for standards-based credential solutions on the market today.</p>



<p>As a technology, BBS+ digital signatures can be used to sign more than just verifiable credentials. Combining these technologies is quite effective, though they can also be treated as modular or separate components. We’ve open-sourced software for creating and verifying BBS+ signatures in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bbs-signatures">browser</a>&nbsp;environments as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/node-bbs-signatures">node.js</a>, and we’ve also published a library for generating&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/bls12381-key-pair">BLS 12–381</a>&nbsp;keypairs for signing and verifying BBS+ Signatures.</p>



<p>By leveraging pairing-friendly elliptic-curve cryptography in the context of&nbsp;<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/">Linked Data Proofs</a>, our approach provides an unprecedented way to perform zero-knowledge proofs using the semantics of&nbsp;<a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a>. This allows credential issuers to tap into vast data vocabularies that exist on the web today, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://schema.org/">schema.org</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/knowledge-graph">Google Knowledge Graph</a>, making user data more context-rich without sacrificing security and privacy of the user in the process. Not only is this approach more interoperable with existing implementations of the VC data model and semantic web technologies, it also doesn’t rely on any external dependencies to operate (like a distributed ledger), meaning it’s&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/a-solution-for-privacy-preserving-verifiable-credentials-f1650aa16093">far more efficient</a>&nbsp;than other approaches based on&nbsp;<a href="https://asecuritysite.com/encryption/cl">CL-signatures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/">zk-SNARKs</a>. We’ve open-sourced our&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mattrglobal/jsonld-signatures-bbs">LD-Proofs suite for VCs</a>&nbsp;including performance benchmarks so you can check it out yourself.</p>



<p>We’re excited to finally make these powerful privacy features easily accessible for everyone, and we can’t wait to see what you build with it. To get started,&nbsp;<a href="https://mattr.global/get-started">sign up now</a>&nbsp;on our website and follow our tutorials on&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.mattr.global/tutorials/issue/issue-basic">MATTR Learn</a>&nbsp;to start creating ZKP-enabled verifiable credentials on the MATTR Platform.</p>

  <p>It used to be that before you walked out the door, you always made sure you had your keys and your wallet. The “key and wallet check” was essential to leaving your home with a clear head. Now, your smartphone has undoubtedly joined the fray as something equal to, or even more important than, those other vital items. Leaving your house without your smartphone likely seems inconceivable, and whether we want to admit it or not, it is one of the most ubiquitous things in our lives.</p>

 Your Smartphone Can Do More 

<p>Your phone understands who you are, knows where you are, it’s connected to a powerful network that is your portal to the world. So why not use that knowledge? Why do websites continue to ask me to register and log in with usernames and passwords when there is a device in my pocket that can authenticate me? Could the networks that power our smart devices play a role by adding additional, seamless security?</p>

 Using ZenKey to Unlock Trust 

<p>These questions now have an answer. AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon have created something meaningful with the launch of ZenKey. ZenKey is a new solution that leverages the&nbsp; network and SIM card details to deliver authentication and identity verification features to web and mobile applications. ZenKey is differentiated because it relies on network and device data and can’t be hacked using only a stolen username and password or even a malicious SIM swap.</p>

 What This Means for Your Security 

<p>Even more exciting is that ForgeRock is a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-wireless-providers-and-consumer-brands-go-live-with-zenkey-301132800.html?tc=eml_cleartime">launch partner</a> with ZenKey, giving customers the ability to leverage the ZenKey Authentication Node in ForgeRock’s Intelligent Access solution. This node provides instant, drop-in support for the ZenKey service. By simply leveraging the ZenKey node, any website or service can offer an alternative to long registration forms and password-based logins with a highly secure, device-based, multifactor authentication.</p>

<p>Now, ForgeRock customers can quickly reduce abandonment during sign-ups while receiving trusted user attributes from MNOs. This capability helps reduce the risk of fraud while creating an identity pre-populated with user attributes. Once a user is enrolled in ZenKey, ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management/intelligent-access">Intelligent Access </a>can use ZenKey to power a highly secure passwordless authentication experience. This integration delivers a tremendous balance between security and usability, something every ForgeRock customer is trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>As more apps, websites and services take advantage of the combination of ZenKey and ForgeRock for seamless registration and authentication, one of the keys you will never leave home without will be your ZenKey.</p>

  <p>The shortage of technical security staff, the rapid migration to cloud computing, regulatory compliance requirements and the unrelenting evolution of threats continue to be the most significant ongoing major security challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">responding to COVID-19</a> remains the biggest challenge for most security organizations in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The pandemic, and its resulting changes to the business world, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-now-is-the-time-to-accelerate-digital/">accelerated digitalization </a>of business processes, endpoint mobility and the expansion of cloud computing in most organizations, revealing legacy thinking and technologies,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/25610">Peter Firstbrook</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner, during the virtual Gartner Security and Risk Management Summit, 2020.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
<p>COVID-19 refocused security teams on the value of cloud delivered security and operational tools that don’t require a LAN connection to function, reviewing remote access policies and tools, migration to cloud data centers and SaaS applications, and securing new digitization efforts to minimize person-to-person interactions.</p>
<p>Gartner has identified nine annual top trends that are the response by leading organizations to these longer-term external trends. These top trends highlight strategic shifts in the security ecosystem that aren’t yet widely recognized, but are expected to have broad industry impact and significant potential for disruption.</p>
 Trend No. 1: Extended detection and response capabilities emerge to improve accuracy and productivity 
<p>Extended detection and response (XDR) solutions are emerging that automatically collect and correlate data from multiple security products to improve threat detection and provide an incident response capability. For example, an <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-how-security-leaders-can-secure-against-an-evolved-threat-landscape/">attack</a> that caused alerts on email, endpoint and network can be combined into a single incident. The primary goals of an XDR solution are to increase detection accuracy and improve security operations efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>“Centralization and normalization of data also helps improve detection by combining softer signals from more components to detect events that might otherwise be ignored,” said Firstbrook.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Security process automation emerges to eliminate repetitive tasks 
<p>The shortage of skilled security practitioners and the availability of automation within security tools have driven the use of more security process automation. This technology automates computer-centric security operations tasks based on predefined rules and templates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Automated security tasks can be performed much faster, in a scalable way and with fewer errors. However, there are diminishing returns to building and maintaining automation. SRM leaders must invest in automation projects that help to eliminate repetitive tasks that consume a lot of time, leaving more time to focus on more critical security functions.</p>
 Trend No. 3: AI creates new security responsibilities for protecting digital business initiatives 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI</a>, and especially machine learning (ML), continues to automate and augment human decision making across a broad set of use cases in security and digital business. However, these technologies require security expertise to address three key challenges: Protect AI-powered digital business systems, leverage AI with packaged security products to enhance security defense and anticipate nefarious use of AI by attackers.</p>
 Trend No. 4: Enterprise-level chief security officers (CSOs) emerge to bring together multiple security-oriented silos 
<p>In 2019, incidents, threats and vulnerability disclosures <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/why-cisos-need-cloud-to-secure-the-network/">outside of traditional enterprise IT systems</a> increased, and pushed leading organizations to rethink security across the cyber and physical worlds. Emerging <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-ways-to-stop-insider-threats/">threats</a> such as ransomware attacks on business processes, potential siegeware attacks on building management systems, GPS spoofing and continuing OT/IOT system vulnerabilities straddle the cyber-physical world. Organizations primarily focused on information-security-centric efforts are not equipped to deal with the effect of security failures on physical safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, leading organizations that deploy cyber-physical systems are implementing enterprise-level CSOs to bring together multiple security-oriented silos both for defensive purposes and, in some cases, to be a business enabler. The CSO can aggregate IT security, OT security, physical security, supply chain security, product management security, and health, safety and environmental programs into a centralized organization and governance model.</p>
 Trend No 5. Privacy is becoming a discipline of its own 
<p>No longer “just a part of” compliance, legal or auditing, privacy is becoming an increasingly influential, defined discipline of its own, affecting almost all aspects of an organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rapidly growing stand-alone discipline, privacy needs to be more integrated throughout the organization. Specifically, the privacy discipline co-directs the corporate strategy, and as such needs to closely align with security, IT/OT/IoT, procurement, HR, legal, governance and more.</p>
 Trend No. 6: New “digital trust and safety” teams focus on maintaining the integrity of all interactions where consumer meets the brand 
<p>Consumers interact with brands through an increasing variety of touchpoints, from social media to retail. How secure the consumer feels within that touchpoint is a business differentiator. Security for these touchpoints is often managed by discrete groups, with specific business units focusing on areas they run. However, companies are increasingly moving toward cross-functional trust and safety teams to oversee all the interactions, ensuring a standard level of safety across each space where consumers interact with the business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 7: Network security transforms from the focus on LAN-based appliance models to SASE 
<p>Cloud-delivered security services are growing increasingly popular with the evolution of remote office technology. Secure access service edge (SASE) technology allows organizations to better protect mobile workers and cloud applications by routing traffic through a cloud-based security stack, versus backhauling the traffic so it flows through a physical security system in a data center.&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 8: A full life cycle approach for protection of the dynamic requirements of cloud-native applications 
<p>Many organizations use the same security product on end-user-facing endpoints as they did for server workloads, a technique that often continued on during “lift and shift” cloud migrations. But cloud-native applications require different rules and techniques, leading to the development of cloud workload protection (CWPP). But as the applications grow increasingly dynamic, the security options need to shift as well. Combining CWPP with the emerging cloud security posture management (CSPM) accounts for all evolution in security needs.&nbsp;</p>
 Trend No. 9: Zero-trust network access technology begins to replace VPNs 
<p>The COVID pandemic has highlighted many of the problems with traditional VPNs. Emerging zero-trust network access (ZTNA) enables enterprises to control remote access to specific applications. This is a more secure option, as it “hides” applications from the internet — ZTNA only communicates to the ZTNA service provider, and can only be accessed via the ZTNA provider’s cloud service. </p>
<p>This reduces the risk of an attacker piggybacking on the VPN connection to attack other applications. Full-scale ZTNA adoption does require enterprises to have an accurate mapping of which users need access to what applications, which will slow adoption.</p>

<p>Greg Kidd is the co-founder and CEO of GlobaliD and the founding partner of Hard Yaka, an investment firm focused on fintech ecosystems. His commitment to innovation and democratization in banking and payments has led to his involvement in other projects such as <a href="https://aptopayments.com/">Apto</a>, a Y-Combinator alum focused on developer-first card issuance he co-founded with CEO Meg Nakamura.</p><p>In 2014, after several years working for a regulatory and compliance advisory company, I co-founded Apto with my colleague and friend Meg Nakamura. It became apparent from my experience that the financial services landscape was in need of a significant upgrade — the industry was dependent on outdated, legacy infrastructure and entangled in a web of opaque regulatory requirements, making it difficult to build and launch innovative and bespoke card programs specifically designed for their&nbsp;users.</p><p>The system was set up to serve only the most highly-resourced, established players in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Since those foundational experiences in finance, we’ve been passionate about creating a payments ecosystem that is more fair and equitable, allowing the most aspirational companies to enter the market quickly and responsibly. To this end, we’ve prioritized working with those who are equally as enthusiastic about creating user-first experiences in the financial services sector as we built Apto. Since its Y-Combinator days, when Apto was known as Shift Payments, we now support several of the fastest growing fintech companies in the U.S. and expanded our business to Europe as of 2019. After building cutting-edge card programs for fintech innovators like Venmo and Coinbase, we’re expanding our purview to make card programs truly accessible for&nbsp;all.</p><p>I’m thrilled to announce that in the coming weeks, Apto will be taking an exciting and important step forward in democratizing fintech by launching an instant card issuance portal for developers at companies of any&nbsp;size.</p><p>Launching a card program is historically a long, painful process.

 The market capitalization of stablecoins increased to $18.53 billion, The rise of&nbsp;CBDC <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1793611236">https://bihu.com/article/1793611236</a></p><p>Original publish time: September 15,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   At present, the market capitalization of major stablecoins has increased by $987 million to $18.53&nbsp;billion.  Last week, Tether additionally issued 500 million USDT on Tron&nbsp;twice.  MakerDAO added USDT and PAX as collateral for&nbsp;DAI.  DC/EP may be the most advanced CBDC project currently.  Sweden is experiencing the largest and fastest decline in cash use, and more and more stores no longer accept&nbsp;cash.  The Bank of Canada stated that there is currently no convincing reason to issue the&nbsp;CBDC.  No central bank is willing to take the risk of using distributed ledger technology without permission.   1.

The rise of&nbsp;CBDC <p>CBDC has received unprecedented attention, but the motives, policies, and technical design of each country are different. On August 24, BIS released a working paper entitled ‘The Rise of CBDC: Driving Factors, Methods, and Technologies’. The article introduces the current status of CBDC research by central banks in various countries, calls on central banks to learn from each other, and gives three representative cases of&nbsp;CBDC.</p> 80% of the central banks surveyed are engaged in the research, experimentation, or development of&nbsp;CBDC <p>For centuries, a series of new payment technologies have met social needs. Coins, banknotes, checks, and credit cards are all innovations of their era. Now, there are more and more discussions about a new payment technology-CBDC. CBDC represents the digital liabilities of the central bank. Wholesale CBDC may become a new settlement tool between financial institutions, while retail CBDC will be the liability of the central bank that everyone can use. Although the concept of CBDC has been proposed decades ago, in the past year, the attitude of central banks on whether to issue CBDC has changed significantly.</p><p>During the Covid-19 epidemic, the public worried that the virus would spread through cash. The payment plan from government to individual is accelerating the transition to digital payment. Over time, the decline in cash usage in some countries has aroused people’s attention, and central banks in many countries have begun to consider issuing CBDC. As of the end of 2019, A total of central banks representing one-fifth of the world’s population stated that they may issue CBDC soon. Similarly, the proportion of central banks considering the issuance of retail CBDC within 1–6 years doubled in 2019 to 20%. Among the central banks surveyed, 80% are engaged in the research, experiment, or development of&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>CBDC is mentioned more and more in speeches and reports. In the 12-week moving average of Google searches, the peak of Bitcoin appeared in early 2018, the peak of Libra in 2019, and the number of searches for CBDC is increasing.</p><p>Source: Rise of the central bank digital currencies: drivers, approaches and technologies</p> DC/EP may be the most advanced CBDC project currently <p>For many years, central banks around the world have been studying the concept and design of CBDC. Such as the ‘Dinerolectrónico’ of the Central Bank of Ecuador, the ‘Dukaton’ of the ABN-AMRO Bank, and the ‘Ubin’ of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p>Currently, the most advanced CBDC may be the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DC/EP) of the People’s Bank of China. DC/EP represents debt in the form of cash from the People’s Bank of China, which can be used by the public and foreign tourists to China through an account-based interface.</p><p>The Bank of Canada stated that it is leading the work of the retail CBDC in response to emergencies such as a sudden decline in cash usage or widespread use of private digital currencies. The Central Bank of the Eastern Caribbean launched the ‘DXCD’ pilot. The Central Bank of the Bahamas launched the ‘Sand Dollar’&nbsp;pilot.</p><p>Source: central banks’&nbsp;websites</p> Commonality in&nbsp;CBDC <p>The development of global business digitization, the rise of private digital currencies, and concerns that cash may spread the COVID-19 virus have all contributed to the increase in interest in CBDC. However, the economic and institutional motivations for issuing CBDC vary from country to country. This part of the content hopes to cross the national dimension, explain the research and development of CBDC from the economic and institutional drive, and find common ground to explain why some countries/regions increase the research and development of CBDC. This will also help us understand how they designed CBDC projects.</p><p>Research has found that the development of CBDC is closely related to mobile and Internet utilization, innovation capabilities, and government efficiency. It develops faster in places with high per Capita GDP and high levels of financial development. Retail CBDC develops faster in areas with high innovation capabilities. Wholesale CBDC is positively related to financial development, which also reflects the role of wholesale CBDC in improving the efficiency of wholesale settlement. Many wholesale CBDC focus on cross-border dimensions.</p> Technical design of&nbsp;CBDC <p>‘CBDC pyramid’ is a classification method designed by CBDC. This method starts from the consumer needs addressed by retail CBDC, determines the technology, and then arrives at the final design&nbsp;plan.</p><p>The first thing to choose is the technical architecture. According to the roles played by central banks and private intermediaries in CBDC, the technical architecture of CBDC is divided into four types: direct CBDC, hybrid CBDC, intermediary CBDC, and indirect or synthetic CBDC.</p><p>The second layer is the infrastructure. It can be based on a traditional centralized database or distributed ledger technology (DLT). The difference in technology also leads to differences in the efficiency of CBDC and the degree of single point failure protection. However, among all the central banks engaged in the research of CBDC, no central bank is willing to take the risk of using the same distributed ledger technology without permission as&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>The third layer is the admission of CBDC. The combination of account-based CBDC and identity verification can provide a basis for payment activities. But for those without a bank account or who care about privacy, it may be difficult to gain access. If the barriers to entry are lowered, it may bring new illegal activities.</p><p>The fourth layer is the cross-border payment of CBDC, which involves the interconnection of the retail and wholesale of&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>In terms of structure, four central banks in the survey sample considered adopting a direct model, and seven central banks considered a hybrid or intermediary model. Many central banks have not yet determined the structure, but no central bank said they would adopt indirect or synthetic CBDC.</p><p>In terms of infrastructure, seven central banks are considering running CBDC on DLT, three are considering using traditional technology, and one is considering a combination of the&nbsp;two.</p><p>In terms of access, account-based access is the most&nbsp;common.</p><p>CBDC of most central banks focused on domestic use. Only a few projects, such as the CBDC built by the European Central Bank, France, Spain, and the Dutch Central Bank, will focus on cross-border payments.</p> Three examples of CBDC design&nbsp;method <p>Although the CBDC schemes of various countries may be different, central banks of different countries can also learn from each other. The following describes three unique CBDC schemes, which are located in Asia, North America, and Europe geographically. That is, the DC/EP of the People’s Bank of China, the e-krona of the Riksbank, and the work of the Bank of Canada on the&nbsp;CBDC.</p> The People’s Bank of China: DC/EP project (pilot&nbsp;phase) <p>Among all the current CBDC projects, the DC/EP of the Bank of China is at the highest stage of development, and China’s efforts on CBDC can be traced back to 2014. At the end of 2019, the Chinese announced a pilot study on the retail CBDC — digital currency and electronic payment tool (DC/EP) project. On April 20, 2020, a spokesperson for the People’s Bank of China confirmed that it is currently piloting projects in several cities including Shenzhen, Suzhou, Chengdu, Xi’an, and&nbsp;Beijing.</p><p>China’s CBDC has developed under the circumstances of a highly digital economy and the widespread use of digital payment services. In addition to facilitating online transactions, CBDC will also bring diversity to the current payment monopoly of Alipay and WeChat, which controls 94% of mobile payments. China’s DC/EP will serve as a supplement to M0, and it is not intended to completely replace physical&nbsp;cash.</p><p>The structure of DC/EP belongs to ‘hybrid CBDC’. CBDC represents direct claims to the People’s Bank of China, but access and real-time payment services are operated by intermediaries (authorized operators), and the central bank regularly receives and stores retail holdings and transaction copies.</p><p>The People’s Bank of China provides core infrastructure, while commercial banks, other payment service providers, telecommunications, and other intermediaries will provide services to the public. This method prevents risks from being concentrated in the central bank and also prevents duplication and waste of resources.</p><p>The People’s Bank of China does not require intermediaries to use specific infrastructure or specific technical routes. Financial intermediaries will be responsible for KYC verification obligations and retail services.</p><p>In terms of access, the People’s Bank of China decided to use value-based, semi-account-based, and account-based hybrid payment tools. The identity will be based on ‘loosely coupled account links’. Users can use DC/EP anonymously in daily transactions, but allow the central bank to track necessary data, implement prudential supervision, combat money laundering, and other criminal&nbsp;crimes.</p> Riksbank: Electronic Krona&nbsp;Project <p>Sweden is a highly digitalized economy. Sweden is experiencing the largest and fastest decline in cash usage, and more and more stores no longer accept cash. Therefore, Sweden is more likely to issue&nbsp;CBDC.</p><p>The Riksbank, like other central banks, has studied a variety of CBDC technologies and methods. The proof of the concept of the electronic Krona project is currently underway, and the purpose of CBDC is also to supplement cash.</p><p>The current proof-of-concept structure of the Riksbank is a hybrid CBDC. This design will require the Riksbank to provide emergency solutions when the intermediary fails to prevent users from being unable to use the electronic Krona in the&nbsp;end.</p><p>The architecture and technical implementation of electronic Krona are based on&nbsp;DLT.</p><p>In terms of access, the CBDC piloted by the Riksbank is account-based, but it also considers low-value prepaid cards. The Riksbank may also develop a CBDC payment card, which can be used directly for micropayments without accessing the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Bank of Canada: CBDC Emergency Plan <p>The Bank of Canada conducted effective research and policy communication on the topic of digital currency. Despite an early start, the Bank of Canada has not yet announced a retail CBDC pilot or proof of concept. Canada’s CBDC outlines a comprehensive plan, also lists potential structures, and accumulates relevant technology and knowledge through new projects, which also cooperate with other central&nbsp;banks.</p><p>However, the Bank of Canada stated that there is currently no compelling reason to issue CBDC, and Canadians will continue to receive good services from the existing payment ecosystem, provided that it is modern and still suitable for current goals. The world is changing rapidly, the Bank of Canada will consider the scenario of issuing the CBDC so that it can continue to provide Canadians with a reliable payment&nbsp;method.</p><p>The Bank of Canada considered reducing or eliminating the use of physical cash, as well as the significant progress made in the use of private cryptocurrencies or stablecoin as a means of&nbsp;payment.</p><p>Architecturally, Canada’s CBDC will not adopt an indirect/synthetic model and consider the use of direct CBDC, hybrid CBDC, or intermediary CBDC.</p><p>In terms of infrastructure, the Bank of Canada has a lot of DLT-based proof-of-concept experience. DLT can be used as an infrastructure solution, but it is not necessary.</p><p>In terms of access, the Bank of Canada considers access solutions based on accounts and coupons. Anonymous coupons will be allowed to be used for micropayments. Large usage will require the use of account-based access&nbsp;rights.</p> Sum up <p>CBDC is a new type of payment technology that may soon be launched in many countries around the world. Research shows that CBDC is developing faster in countries with higher mobile phone usage and innovation capabilities. Countries will vary according to their economic situation and priorities, but they also have some key common characteristics. All of the CBDC designs investigated are supplements of cash, none of the designs adopt an indirect model, and no central bank is willing to take the risk of using the same distributed ledger technology without permission as&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

<p>Here at MATTR, we have been hard at work building a suite of products to serve the next generation of digital trust. We’ve designed our products based on a few key principles: extensible data formats, secure authentication protocols, a rigorous semantic data model, industry-standard cryptography, and the use of drivers and extensions to allow modular and configurable use of the platform over time. By combining our core capabilities with extensions and drivers, our platform offers developers convenience without compromising flexibility or choice.</p>



  



<p>The MATTR Platform delivers digital trust in a scalable manner. Our belief is that a modular security architecture is one which can work across many different contexts. When it comes to trust, context is everything, and we know our users each have their own unique requirements and expectations when it comes to their digital interactions.</p>



<p>We provide flexible and configurable building blocks for trust on the web in order to create a digital ecosystem that can support global scale.</p>



<p>The platform consists of 3 main components:</p>



  Platform Core  Platform Extensions  Platform Drivers  



<p>Our platform provides the capabilities needed for digital trust through a set of modular and flexible building blocks known as our&nbsp;Platform Core. This includes the ability to establish and use DIDs, sign and encrypt messages, manage the verifiable credentials lifecycle, and share privacy-preserving verifiable presentations. Platform Core is designed as a set of simple APIs that are available for all of our users, with operational tools and documentation.</p>



<p>We’ve designed the platform to have cryptographic agility and flexibility built in at a fundamental level.&nbsp;Platform Drivers&nbsp;are pre-configured integrations that allow our capabilities to be pluggable and extensible over time, preventing vendor lock-in and enabling user choice. They identify key areas where flexibility, choice, and optionality are desirable and surface them to the user to promote more resilient security architectures for the future. They are typically surfaced to the user as pluggable parameters in our Platform Core.</p>



<p>Extensibility is a key component of our platform architecture.&nbsp;Platform Extensions&nbsp;are higher level capabilities that plug in to our platform, providing convenient and easy-to-access application logic, such as service orchestration and workflow. They are built on top of our Platform Core, allowing users to smoothly onboard and extend our platform as well as enabling MATTR’s digital trust infrastructure to integrate with digital services and protocols that exist outside of our products. They are modular components in terms of logic and configuration, operating independently of Platform Core as an extensible set of APIs.</p>



<p>Finally, we offer a growing number of&nbsp;Developer Tools&nbsp;to simplify the user experience by providing additional interfaces and ways to interact with our platform. These tools are free and mostly optional to use, though they do simplify setting up the infrastructure needed to get started experimenting with the platform. Some tools, like some of the features exposed by MATTR’s Mobile Wallet, may be required to use certain features of the platform. Our Developer Tools are designed to work natively with Platform Core as well as our Platform Extensions.</p>



 



<p>Over the past 6 months, we have been working in close collaboration with a number of preview customers to create a great developer experience and identify features that are important for a wide variety of use cases. We’ve been working with partners from industry and government to make sure we’ve built a solution for the problems that matter to you.</p>

   What is Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)?&nbsp; 

<blockquote><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">Identity governance and administration (IGA)</a> enables admins, security teams, and internal auditors to manage and reduce the risk that comes with excessive or unnecessary user access to applications, systems, and data.</blockquote>

<p>As the digital world continues to evolve, IGA is now mission-critical to secure every organization. Yet few know what it is. With new <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">data privacy and security regulations</a> constantly emerging, organizations must now balance risk and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/customer-identity">customer experience</a> while achieving regulatory compliance. Having the right identity governance and administration solution in place can play a crucial role in achieving this balance, <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/digital-identity/employee-identity-access-management">keeping workforces productive</a>, and enterprises secure. To fully understand what IGA is and why it’s become such a priority, we must look at how the need for it emerged in the first place.</p>

 The Early Years: User Provisioning and Mounting Regulations 

<p>To understand IGA, it’s important to understand what provisioning is and how user data was initially stored. <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/identity-provisioning">User provisioning</a> is the process that ensures that user accounts are created with the proper permissions. IT administrators use provisioning to monitor and control access to systems and applications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the early years of the digital age (1980s - early 90s), user provisioning was rather straightforward as it focused solely on users (employees) within an organization. Access to users outside an organization, like customers or citizens, was not common. Additionally, there weren’t as many systems within an organization to manage access to, making the provisioning process relatively manageable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this time, servers housed user accounts and identity data centrally on on-premises systems within the enterprise. However, in the mid-late 1990s as the .com market rapidly took off and external user access to systems and applications became ubiquitous, more sensitive user data such as name, address, social security number, country code, email address, bank account number, etc. were collected by global organizations. The need to protect this personally identifiable information (PII), the systems and applications that hosted this information quickly became critical. To address these requirements, new regulations were enacted that mandated stricter security protocols for user access permissions, required improved controls and policies to prove to auditors that the protocols had been implemented.&nbsp;</p>

 The Rise of Identity Governance Regulations 

<p>Introduced in 1996, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) was created to provide stronger data privacy and security provisions for safeguarding medical information. As physicians later moved to digitized health records, the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">HIPAA Security Rule</a> was issued as a best practice for securing sensitive digital information and establishing national standards to protect individuals’ electronic personal health information. This rule required appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the security of patient data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2002, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/3763">Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)</a> was introduced to bolster stronger trust and security around the financials of publicly traded companies. SOX imposed even more regulatory protocols regarding electronic records. It mandated the joint responsibility of auditors and management for the detection of fraud and external threats, requiring stringent record keeping, audits, and controls. Noncompliance with SOX can cost organizations up to $25 million in fines, criminal and civil prosecution, and prison sentences of up to 20 years for those found in breach of the mandate.</p>

<p>In 2006, the PCI Council (formed by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa) created a body of security standards known as the <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/maintaining_payment_security">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</a>. Every merchant that <a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/insights/merchant-solutions-worldpay/article/how-to-accept-credit-cards">accepts credit card payments</a> must be in compliance with PCI DSS. PCI DSS includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, and other critical protective measures. Failure to comply with PCI mandates leaves businesses vulnerable to the negative impacts of data breaches, such as fines, fees, and lost business.</p>

<p>With these new regulations and stricter protocols, organizations began to feel the strain of ensuring and proving compliance. This pressure only intensified in the mid-2000s as the market saw a massive increase in enterprise user demand for access to cloud-based applications and systems. As a result, this created a larger provisioning problem. Existing user provisioning solutions only supported internal user (employee) populations. They were not equipped to handle the growing numbers of users, accounts, systems and applications while trying to continue to meet regulatory compliance requirements. The need for a solution that supported <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management/identity-provisioning">user provisioning and management for internal and external systems and applications</a> thus emerged.&nbsp;</p>

 Turning to Identity Management as a Possible Fix 

<p>As traditional provisioning solutions struggled to keep up with increasing identity demands and regulations, many organizations turned to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-management">identity management (IDM) solutions</a> to address these challenges. With the digital landscape evolving at a rapid pace as the introduction of cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and solutions began sweeping through the enterprise landscape. The transition to these technologies meant that internal user identities were now being used to access new external cloud-based applications and systems outside of the enterprise network. The result was a tangled web of access to internal and external systems; a disorganized mass of accounts for workforce, consumers, and partners; and varying levels of access across multiple environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of these new and ever-growing challenges, identity management solutions were unable to <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/solutions/privacy">meet compliance regulations</a> to ensure user access was reviewed, allowed, and/or revoked periodically. As a result, organizations would manually create and review user access certifications via spreadsheets distributed by email to business line managers annually or biannually for review and approval. Yet, with the exploding number of internal and external user identities, systems, and cloud applications, this process was no longer a scalable or viable option. With pressure mounting on organizations to achieve regulatory compliance, a new approach was needed.</p>

 The Emergence of Identity Governance and Administration 

<p>With a new approach, the existing user provisioning market morphed into identity management. In parallel, the genesis of identity governance came about due to the growing number of compliance regulations. Over time, both the identity management and identity governance markets merged into one market: <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance and administration</a> (IGA). IGA solutions address the needs of regulatory compliance through identity governance and user provisioning requirements through administration. In addition, identity governance and administration addresses user access privileges for both on-premises systems and applications, as well as cloud-based applications and systems, bridging the gap where previous solutions fell short.</p>

<p>Today, identity governance and administration helps organizations address common business challenges throughout their network and users. Benefits include better access compliance through certifying the appropriate level of users’ access and enhanced business productivity by providing this access to the right resources at the right time. IGA also benefits security and risk management by allowing organizations to govern user access with policy-based controls and minimizing operational inefficiencies by streamlining business processes.</p>

<p>In addition to helping overcome business challenges, Identity Governance and Administration supports a number of underlying use cases. These use cases include;&nbsp; access requests (users requesting access to systems and applications), access approvals (managers approving user requests), access reviews (managers confirming user approvals or revoking user access), and role optimization (reviewing and updating role definitions).</p>

<p>Munich / September 16th, 2020 – IDnow, a leading Identity verification specialist, welcomes that Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period incorporating the new and upcoming legal framework by October 15th. This transition clarifies existing and new mandates including, and importantly, age verification requirements for online gambling. The new regime officially enters into effect in July of next year. </p>
<p>IDnow, in its mission, is to make the connected world a safer place, is pleased about this decision among the German states. The company looks forward to supporting the operators in order to provide greater safety for users. For IDnow, this ensures better protection for customers under German law as well as clearer rules in regard to responsible gambling.</p>
<p>“This is a big step for Germany’s online gambling industry, and again, it shows the importance of eKYC methods and their need to evolve. In a world that becomes more and more digital by the day, we need to stay vigilant and constantly adapt our security requirements,” says Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow. “IDnow strives to contribute to responsible corporate citizenship, ensuring that the social responsibility for this industry can be achieved effectively through innovative methods. This is the strong desire of the federal and state governments within Germany, and IDnow has been and –&nbsp; will continue to be –&nbsp;an active supporter of those efforts,” she adds.</p>
<p>“We have developed our products together with our clients – the biggest players in the market –&nbsp; to perfectly meet their needs. IDnow offers AML compliant video verification, but also an approved automated verification solution. Gambling operators can choose, depending on their security needs, which of those multiple solutions they want to use. All of them fulfill mandatory age verification requirements.” says Oliver Obitayo CSO at IDnow. “To us, it is more than important that our clients can offer safe service platforms to customers so underage use can be prevented,” he adds.</p>
<p>After a period of uncertainty, each of Germany’s 16 states have agreed to a transition period for online gambling in Germany before the official start date of July 1, 2021. This transition period is noted by the shared agreement to not punish gambling companies who conform to the new law that will officially go into effect next year.</p>
<p>In January 2020, the German states agreed on an amendment to the State Treaty on Gambling (Glücksspielstaatsvertrag) that also comes into effect on July 1, 2021. This date was partly put into jeopardy, as was the process to issue sports betting licenses, in the first half of this year when matters came to a halt due to a court injunction sought by an Austrian gambling operator.</p>
<p>In a welcome development last week, Germany’s 16 states agreed to a transition period for gambling activities. This will allow operators to offer casino-style gaming and poker as long as such activities are fully compliant with the draft for the new Glücksspielstaatsvertrag. Online gambling operators must meet all licensing requirements by an October 15 deadline. This will include an Age Verification (AV) solution for online operators.</p>
<p>Under the new and upcoming regulatory regime, the following changes will be implemented:</p>
 
 It will be possible for German players to play online casino games and online poker under strict regulations 
 A wagering limit of €1 will be placed per spin for slot games 
 The number of licenses for table games will be limited to the number of physical locations for casinos in each state 
 A €1,000 deposit limit will now be implemented across all online gambling verticals in Germany. 
 
<p>&nbsp;With the recent acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services into the IDnow Group, the Munich based company has created additional capacities and possibilities for more flexibility in order to be able to adequately support its customers in every situation.</p>

<p>Identity Verification Provider from Munich welcomes Bettina Pauck as Manager of the Operations Division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich – September 4th, 2020, IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions, is welcoming Bettina Pauck as Chief Operations Officer to its management team. She will head the Operations division at the Munich site as well as the Leipzig site, which will be part of the IDnow Group as of September. IDnow took this new subsidiary over as part of the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services.</p>
<p>Following the successful takeover of Wirecard Communication Services GmbH at the beginning of this week, IDnow announces the appointment of Bettina Pauck as Chief Operations Officer to the management team of the Munich-based identity verification provider. Within the scope of the acquisition, she has already assisted in the valuation of the company. Her main task in the coming months will be to integrate the former Wirecard Communication Services GmbH – now IDnow Services GmbH – into the existing processes and to optimally position the business unit for the foreseeable growth.</p>
<p>In the last 12 years Bettina Pauck has been working with her own company as a consultant for companies like N26, reBuy or Axel Springer and has optimized their customer operations. She has been working in customer service since 2004 and now brings her many years of experience in strategic, tactical and operational customer management as well as in the conception and control of service structures to IDnow.</p>
<p>“Identity verification is at the heart of many industries, but most of all it ensures the security and sense of security of many customers. Since the customers are the focus of all my activities, I am particularly pleased to be able to make a real difference for the customers – and for IDnow – in this central function,” says Bettina Pauck. “IDnow is a company with a strong vision and my goal is to take the Operations division to a new level together with the outstanding team,” she adds.</p>
<p>“I am pleased that we were able to win Bettina Pauck as COO for IDnow. She will play a central role in the scaling of our operations area, also and especially in the context of the recent strong increase in demand. With the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services, we have created additional capacity and infrastructure in order to further improve our range and service quality,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>

Nick believed that in the DeFi course, Wing has its defining value in its credit lending function, enabled by integrating <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore</a>, which is an on-chain credit evaluation system. He also noted that Wing’s infrastructure demands are met by the credit-based identity and data framework exclusively provided by Ontology. He added, “The power of blockchain lies in consensus. It could be found in something as trivial as the record of a single transaction, or as big as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It’s what enables us to envision a future where blockchain technology facilitates the process of globalization, and is on the way to breaking the barriers between races, national borders, assets and social classes. The debated catchphrases in the blockchain arena, such as decentralization, immutability and equitability, all check the boxes of derivative values born out of consensus built on blockchain.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-8-15-7c90576a44cd">Ontology Weekly Report (September 8–15)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Eighty-two percent of security and risk leaders do not adjust their budgets based on environmental or business impact, which means they operate in a silo and are not aligned with the business.</p>
<p>Without that solid alignment, when a disruption happens, it can be difficult to ensure security is supporting what is important to the organization.</p>
<p>“With any disruption, with any crisis, you’re always going to have uncertainty, and uncertainty has a negative impact on your budget,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/47425/Sam-Olyaei">Sam Olyaei</a>, Director Analyst, during the virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit, 2020</a>. “Ultimately there has to be some sort of trigger or change within the budget planning process to navigate past the challenges.”</p>
<p>Gartner suggests five action items to guide security and risk leaders through cost optimization to enable a balanced and valuable outcome.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
 Action item 1: Identify crisis phase and what actions you will take 
<p>Leaders must be able to know <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/reset-your-business-strategy-in-covid-19-recovery/">which phase of the crisis</a> the organization is currently in to be able to respond accordingly. The first is the respond phase, which focuses on keeping the lights on, essential services and making sure cost optimization is in place. In this phase, an organization might make policies more flexible or focus on tech that provides immediate value.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-top-security-projects-for-2020-2021/">Gartner Top 10 Security Projects for 2020-2021</a></p>
<p>The next phase is recovery. This is where the strategic cost optimization begins now that leaders can look beyond the day to day. In the recovery phase, optimize for value and manage risk in comparison to cost. Effective security and risk leaders will use this phase to demonstrate value in the business by stretching staff skills and accelerating automation.</p>
<p>The final stage is the renew phase. Discussions will move past cost cuts to drive innovation and exploit opportunities to create value. This is the phase to scale digital with agile practices and prepare for a new normal. Arguably, this is where most leaders differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack.</p>
 Action item 2: Equip yourself with data for decision making 
<p>Whether it’s gathered from business reports, benchmarking, current state assessment or asset inventory, data is critical. Ideally, you’ll want to use a combination of all the sources to get the best pictures of the organization. Data can be used to move away from making decisions based on legacy or emotions, and toward efficiency and metrics. It will enable you to showcase and highlight how security and risk is making decisions and why you’ve reached a particular conclusion.</p>
 Action item 3: Build adaptable and realistic budget scenarios 
<p>Although scenario planning isn’t usually a large part of the security and risk business unit, it’s important to plan, test and design budgets for scenarios that you might face in the near or short term.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-balance-risk-trust-and-opportunity-in-an-uncertain-world/">Gartner Keynote: Balance Risk, Trust and Opportunity in an Uncertain World</a></p>
<p>For example, how would security handle an emergency budget cut, like being asked to cut spending by half through 2Q? What about selective cost reduction of 10% of the budget every quarter? What if security was asked to preserve costs and emphasize growth by maintaining the current budget but focusing aggressively on delivering business value?</p>
 Action 4: Align based on business unit value, risk and cost 
<p>Consider how to allocate resources to particular business units based on the potential value of each unit as it relates to the business. Look for indicators like revenue, business value or number of employees to help balance risk, value and cost.</p>
<p>For example, at an entertainment company, hospitality has high business value, but a bad risk posture. For security and risk, this represents a true opportunity to increase investment in ensuring better security posture for a business unit that is vital to the overall business.</p>
 Action 5: Take a portfolio view of cost optimization 
<p>Security and risk leaders need a holistic view of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/set-up-a-budget-friendly-application-security-program/">cost optimization</a>. It boils down to two pieces: Supply and demand. Supply has two main areas, security contract management and cost savings, within security. Here are opportunities to negotiate strategies and deliver technology value efficiently.</p>
<p>On the demand side, focus on joint business as well as security and business optimization. This includes activities/actions such as accelerating business outcomes by looking a little further out and enabling new digital business models.</p>

 The GiD Report #126 — Forget Zoom, the video revolution begins&nbsp;now <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-125-everyone-v-apple-discords-groups-vision-a9067bc219be">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The GiD Report is back after a brief hiatus. Today’s newsletter will be a bit of a quickie as I’m still getting up to&nbsp;speed.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  The beginning of a video revolution  Book Club preview: Marc Andreessen  The need for positive tech narratives  The Economist on digital&nbsp;identity  What’s going on with Epic v.&nbsp;Apple  The NYTimes on&nbsp;WeChat  Stuff happens   1. The pandemic has changed the way we work, play, and connect, accelerating brewing trends. What was once a ten-year horizon has transpired overnight, the domain of nerds and early adopters suddenly mainstream. And Zoom is one of the hottest stocks around because it’s all about video. The thing is, this is just the beginning. <p>Here’s a great overview from the Telegraph via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> (pdf attached):</p><blockquote>If Wu and other start-ups get their way, Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams will one day seem like the Model T of video calling services: functional and pioneering, but primitive. As the stubborn coronavirus continues, and the likelihood of increasing reliance on screens even after it passes, investors and entrepreneurs are now going through an explosion of dedicated video apps intended to replace today’s one-size-fits-all services.</blockquote><p>In a sense, it’s not so different from how Ayo thinks about fintech (re: vertical neobanks). One-size-fits-all is a reasonable way to start. But it’s only a matter of time before fine-tuned UX for specific target groups will rule the&nbsp;roost.</p>Photo: cottonbro<blockquote>Cannon says Zoom fulfils the specific and valuable task it was designed for: virtual workplace meetings. But it was not designed for classrooms, doctors’ appointments, live concerts or hen parties, all of which it has been co-opted for in the last six&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>The most recent batch of companies at Y Combinator, the leading Silicon Valley start-up school that is seen as a barometer of new tech trends, had at least a dozen video-related services. They ranged from Together, a video chat app for grandparents and grandchildren that includes games and bedtime stories, to Zuddl, for holding and streaming large business conferences online.</blockquote><blockquote>Another, Rally, aims to let people hold parties online without everyone shouting over one another: individuals can “take the stage”, for example when delivering a speech, or groups can split off into “tables”, where the muffled noise of the rest of the party can still be heard in the background.</blockquote><blockquote>Former yoga teacher Rachel Lea Fishman founded Sutra, which lets fitness instructors host classes online, earlier this year. The service was originally designed to let instructors rent out space and host classes, but was forced to shift to video as coronavirus closed&nbsp;gyms.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/facebook-introduces-a-co-viewing-experience-in-messenger-watch-together/">Facebook introduces a co-viewing experience in Messenger, ‘Watch Together’ — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://oneworldidentity.com/know-identity-digital-forum-recap-identitys-role-re-opening-the-economy/">KNOW Identity Digital Forum Recap: Identity’s Role in Re-Opening the Economy — One World&nbsp;Identity</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a> — <a href="https://www.netflix.com/si/title/81254224">The Social Dilemma | Netflix Official&nbsp;Site</a>  <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-second-quarter-results-fiscal-year-2021/">Zoom is killin’&nbsp;it</a>   2. Book Club preview: Marc Andreessen On Productivity, Scheduling, Reading Habits, Work, and&nbsp;More <p><a href="https://a16z.com/2020/09/07/on-productivity-scheduling-reading-habits-marc-andreessen/">It’s an interview with a16z founder Marc Andreessen</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>). We’ll dive into this later in the week with the Book&nbsp;Club.</p> 3. The last decade of tech has naturally gravitated us towards a more dystopian outlook on technology, further emphasized by popular culture with TV shows like Black Mirror and books like The Circle. Given the outcomes, challenges, and unintended consequences of this last cycle of tech, the reaction feels natural. But maybe it’s time for a more positive narratives to take hold to balance all the negativity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200901&amp;instance_id=21808&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=37277&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fdb7a24ca-9d2d-586c-b9ec-d10ceb772efd&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Sriram Krishnan, a technology executive whom I respect, tweeted a few days ago asking for more optimistic descriptions in movies and television of people building technology. He didn’t put it quite this way, but I imagined he wanted less fiction like “The Circle,” about a surveillance-state corporate cult, and more like “Iron Man,” in which a tech nerd cobbles together a suit that saves his life and gives him superhero powers.</blockquote><blockquote>I get what Krishnan is saying, and there’s a bigger meaning behind it. Right now, there’s a lot of pessimism about the harm of social media, the creepiness of digital surveillance of our smartphones and our faces and the nefarious power of tech&nbsp;giants.</blockquote><blockquote>Those downers sometimes drown out the ways that we know technology has made many of our lives immeasurably better. Both “The Circle” and “Iron Man” encompass some form of reality, but it’s easy to see technology as either one or the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>Which I believe is very apt for the work we’re trying to do here at GlobaliD. Technology shouldn’t force you to undermine your values or concede your individuality. There’s a hugely positive story to tell here and we’re writing it every&nbsp;day.</p><p>Speaking of which — why <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-15c454b7-d99f-4cdc-bfb2-ccbb2a66d76f.html">telling that story in the right way from day one is so important</a>:</p><blockquote>Zuckerberg says he regrets not explaining Facebook’s free-speech ideals from the&nbsp;start.</blockquote><blockquote>“I just wish that I’d spent more time earlier on communicating about what our principles are and what we stand for — you know, things like free expression and voice and that we’re going to defend&nbsp;those.”</blockquote><blockquote>“Now a lot of people look at us and they see this as a successful company. With a lot of money. And it’s a little hard now, I think, for us to go back and talk about our principles and have people see the principles for anything but, you know, some talking&nbsp;points.”</blockquote> 4. Along with video, the pandemic has also put a spotlight on digital identity. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/09/05/covid-19-strengthens-the-case-for-digital-id-cards">The Economist</a>:</p><blockquote>In countries without a system of secure digital identities, the closure of bricks-and-mortar government offices and the shift of public services online have caused havoc (see article). Divorces and adoptions have run into a virtual brick wall. Italy’s system for doling out emergency payments crashed and then demanded paperwork that applicants could not obtain because government offices were shut. In America, Washington state paid $650m in unemployment insurance to fraudsters who made applications using stolen identities.</blockquote><blockquote>No such havoc occurred in Estonia, a tiny Baltic state where every citizen has an electronic identity. More than just an identity card, it links every Estonian’s records together. So when the government created a furlough system for workers affected by the pandemic, it already knew where they worked and how to pay them. Nobody in Estonia had to join a queue on a pavement to claim benefits, as people in other places&nbsp;did.</blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2020/08/29/apple-pay-was-not-disruptive-but-apple-id-will-be/">Apple Pay Was Not Disruptive But Apple ID Will Be</a> (via&nbsp;Luka)</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/u-k-digital-id-tool-passes-big-test/">U.K. digital ID tool passes big test — SecureIDNews</a>  Phil Windley — <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/08/authentic_digital_relationships.shtml">Authentic Digital Relationships</a>  <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=51193&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94620315&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--JebTsL19WdjcZszHMnrGsAJaWvma_91VeJzQhDEJ5plstlAwLi73eXBJyhR9l6qP7rxqHSI6_UDJSzBZJM1ea2cPJCA&amp;utm_content=94620315&amp;utm_source=hs_email">LG CNS to Take Lead in Developing Next-generation Digital Identification Technology</a>   5. What’s going on with Epic v.&nbsp;Apple: <p>The Information:</p><blockquote>Apple on Tuesday countersued Epic Games, the developer of “Fortnite,” asking a judge for monetary damages in the escalating legal battle between the two companies.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple made its claims in a filing with a federal court in the Northern District of California on Tuesday, in which the company also rejected the legal claims Epic made in an antitrust lawsuit it filed against Apple last&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>While Apple’s counter-suit was anticipated and didn’t contain any big surprises, the company tucked a noteworthy detail into the filing, saying that Epic has earned over $600 million in revenue through iOS apps in the past. That’s a substantial figure that likely represents the success of “Fortnite,” Epic’s hit battle&nbsp;game.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple justified its demand for financial damages in part because it said Epic has deprived it of App Store commissions by allowing “Fortnite” users to bypass an Apple payment system. The company also said Epic has hurt Apple’s image through an “extensive smear campaign” and requested punitive damages for its&nbsp;conduct.</blockquote><p>See also: <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1301962581180067846">Tim Sweeney on open platforms</a></p> 6.

As the coronavirus crisis struck China, her family used it to coordinate food orders during lockdowns. She also needs a local government health code featured on the app to use public transport or enter&nbsp;stores.</blockquote><blockquote>“I want to switch to other chat apps, but there’s no way,” she&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“If there were a real alternative I would change, but WeChat is terrible because there is no alternative. It’s too closely tied to life. For shopping, paying, for work, you have to use it,” she said. “If you jump to another app, then you are&nbsp;alone.”</blockquote> 7.

 And how zero-trust biometric solutions can help you transition to a more secure digital workplace <p>We’re rapidly approaching a future fueled by digital technology — one where users and employees frequently access private systems outside the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>Traditional security systems, which are flawed to begin with, fail to offer adequate protection from cyber threats outside of the security perimeters of a workplace.</p><p>To properly secure remote working environments, organizations must start thinking about implementing radically different security&nbsp;models.</p> In this article, we’ll&nbsp;cover:   Traditional security models and their&nbsp;failings  Zero-trust security&nbsp;models  A biometric multi-factor authentication alternative   What are traditional security&nbsp;models? <p>Traditional security models refer mainly to perimeter network firewalls.</p><p>Firewalls were designed to protect corporate systems from malicious attacks by erecting security defenses that ward off threats from outside of the perimeters of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>Security experts often refer to this as the “castle and moat” approach. The idea is based on the assumption that anyone outside the “moat” (firewall), cannot be trusted; and that anyone in the “castle” (the network) can&nbsp;be.</p> The issue with this approach is that it assumes anyone within the network can be&nbsp;trusted.  This is problematic for two&nbsp;reasons:   The assumption that everyone inside a network is trusted leaves organization’s vulnerable to insider-orchestrated attacks  This approach fails to protect organizations when employees are accessing systems from outside the security perimeters of a firewall. With the dramatic increase in remote work — firewalls are not just weak, they’re redundant.  <p>Remote-work security is traditionally tackled with VPNs, but with the rising adoption of smart technology comes the proliferation of security backdoors — greatly increasing the likelihood of a hacker successfully breaching a corporate network via poorly protected remote&nbsp;devices.</p><p>If a hacker compromises one smart-device within a home network, then the potential to launch further attacks on other devices (used to access company systems) greatly increases. In theory, hackers could potentially hijack a user’s device, steal their login credentials, and use them to bypass a&nbsp;VPN.</p> Hackers only need to find the weakest entry point to a network in order to infiltrate it. <p>Once a hacker has gained access to a network, they’re then free to move laterally within the network until reaching a target — usually a highly sensitive database that contains the private data of users, employees or&nbsp;clients.</p><p>According to IBM, the average breach went <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2019-07-23-IBM-Study-Shows-Data-Breach-Costs-on-the-Rise-Financial-Impact-Felt-for-Years">unnoticed for up to 206 days</a> (just under six months), giving malicious parties plenty of time to steal such&nbsp;data.</p> Zero-trust security: assume no one is&nbsp;trusted <p>Zero-trust authentication systems take a radically different approach to network security.</p><p>They assume that no-one can be trusted — whether inside a network or not. Therefore anyone attempting to access systems must be authenticated no matter where, when or how they access&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Since no trust is assumed, zero-trust models make a point of frequently authenticating users as they move through a&nbsp;network.</p> Zero-trust solutions protect against insider&nbsp;threats <p>Insider threats and cybersecurity incidents doubled between 2018 and 2019 — meaning it’s absolutely true that not everyone who has permissions to a network can be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>Since zero-trust models assume that no one is trusted, they protect organizations from such threats. Insider organized threats can otherwise have large-scale financial and reputational consequences for organizations.</p> Zero-trust multi-factor authentication <p>Zero-trust multi-factor authentication solutions combine the principles of zero-trust security, with the principles of strong authentication.</p><p>Strong authentication, or MFA, improves security by presenting users with at least two different kinds of security challenges.</p><p>For example, an MFA solution may require a user to enter their login credentials, followed by a one-time-password sent to the user’s registered phone&nbsp;number.</p><p>Traditional MFA solutions create a range of user-experience problems when combined with the idea of zero-trust security: having to authenticate at every level of access can be disruptive when the authentication experience is cumbersome.</p><p>Plus, legacy MFA solutions are not immune to threats — since 2015, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/30/bank-customers-lose-91-million-five-years-sim-swap-scams/">customers in the UK lost £9.1 million due to SIM swapping attacks</a>. (SIM swapping is where a bad actor is able to bypass 2FA by having the ‘one-time code’ sent to the victim’s phone number, diverted to a new&nbsp;SIM).</p><p>Read more about security issues with 2FA solutions like YubiKey <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/local-authentication-vs-keyless-pt-1-faceid-and-yubikey-cb1b594d399c">in this&nbsp;article</a>.</p> The Keyless solution: Zero-Knowledge Biometrics <p>At Keyless, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing secure multiparty computation to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-first way to authenticate users that is minimally disruptive to the user-experience.</p><p>Our privacy-enhancing biometric authentication solutions offer multi-factor (MFA) security by&nbsp;design:</p>  Keyless verifies users are authenticating from their trusted device. If a device is not registered, the user won’t be able to authenticate.  Keyless uses facial biometrics to verify users across every touchpoint — a universal inherence factor as an added level of security.  Keyless will soon also leverage behavioral biometrics, which serves as another, transparent third authentication factor.  <p>Once a user is registered, all they need to do to access their accounts is look into the camera of their&nbsp;device.</p><p>This simple, user-friendly solution can be implemented at multiple access points, ensuring that only the right users have the right access at the right time, while offering cutting-edge security.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations against fraudulent takeovers, Keyless leverages advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques, in addition to the built-in multi-factor security. This allows Keyless to ensure that the user is in fact,&nbsp;real.</p><p>Simple, secure, and above all, private authentication</p><p>To recap&nbsp;that’s:</p>  No passwords  No one-time&nbsp;codes  No secret questions  <p>Or in other words that’s nothing to remember, nothing to type, nothing to lose, nothing to forget, nothing to phish and nothing to copy and&nbsp;paste.</p><p>To find out how Keyless’ ZKB™ biometrics work, watch the&nbsp;video!</p> How we protect biometric data <p>Keyless never stores sensitive information on a user’s device or on centralized servers. Instead, encrypted shares of data are stored on the Keyless Network, a distributed cloud&nbsp;network.</p><p>This is possible thanks to our patent-pending technology zero-knowledge biometric (ZKB™) authentication — enabled by the unique combination of state-of-the-art biometrics with <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/how-keyless-uses-zero-knowledge-proofs-to-protect-your-private-data-255d936be4fd">zero-knowledge cryptography</a> and privacy-enhancing <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">multi-party computation.</a></p><p>This breakthrough technology allows Keyless to authenticate users, without needing or being able to access the raw contents of someone’s sensitive information. In other words, we don’t trust anyone, not even ourselves.</p> Request a Free Trial of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io/">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io/">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io/">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/why-legacy-security-models-dont-work-5ea3b0f192da">Why legacy security models don’t work</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>“Are you trying to ensure security for your remote workforce but don’t want to hinder business productivity?” “Are you struggling with identifying risks and gaps in security capabilities?” “Where should CISOs focus time and resources?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security and risk management experts constantly ask these questions, but the real question should be what projects will drive the most business value and reduce risk for the organization in a constantly shifting security landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We can spend too much precious time overanalyzing choices we make about security, striving for this notion of perfect protection that just simply does not exist,” said <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/53783/Brian-Reed">Brian Reed</a>, Sr. Director Analyst, during the virtual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/na/security-risk-management-us">Gartner Security &amp; Risk Management Summit, 2020</a>. “We must look beyond basic protection decisions and improve organizational resilience through innovative approaches to detection and response, and ultimately, recovery from security incidents.“</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="28186"]</p>
<p>The key is to prioritize business enablement and reduce risk — and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/security-experts-must-connect-cybersecurity-to-business-outcomes/">communicate those priorities</a> effectively to the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s top 10 security projects, based on Gartner forecasts and adjusted for the impact of COVID-19 — feature eight new projects, focused heavily on risk management and understanding process breakdowns. These projects, which aren’t listed in order of importance, can be executed independently.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 1: Securing your remote workforce 
<p>Focus on business requirements and understand how users and groups access data and applications. Now that a few months have passed since the initial remote push, it’s time for a needs assessment and review of what has changed to determine if access levels are correct and whether any <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/6-principles-for-employee-privacy/">security measures</a> are actually impeding work.</p>
 No. 2: Risk-based vulnerability management 
<p>Don’t try to patch everything; focus on vulnerabilities that are actually exploitable. Go beyond a bulk assessment of threats and use threat intelligence, attacker activity and internal asset criticality to provide a better view of real organizational risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 No. 3: Extended detection and response (XDR) 
<p>XDR is a unified security and incident response platform that collects and correlates data from multiple proprietary components. The platform-level integration occurs at the point of deployment rather than being added in later. This consolidates multiple security products into one and may help provide better overall security outcomes. Organizations should consider using this technology to simplify and streamline security.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 4: Cloud security posture management 
<p>Organizations need to ensure common controls across IaaS and PaaS, as well as support automated assessment and remediation. Cloud applications are extremely dynamic and need an automated DevSecOps style of security. It can be challenging to secure the public cloud without a means to ensure policy uniformity across cloud security approaches.&nbsp;</p>

 No. 5: Simplify cloud access controls 
<p>Cloud access controls typically are done through a CASB. They offer real-time enforcement through an in-line proxy that can provide policy enforcement and active blocking. CASBs also offer flexibility by, for example, starting out in monitoring mode to better ensure fidelity of traffic and understand security access.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: DMARC 
<p>Organizations use email as the single source of verification, and users struggle to determine real messages from fakes. DMARC, or domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance, is an email authentication policy. DMARC is not a total solution for email security, and should be one piece of a holistic security approach. However, it can offer an additional layer of trust and verification with the sender’s domain. DMARC can help domain spoofing but will not address all email security issues.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 7: Passwordless authentication 
<p>While employees may not think twice about using the same password for their work computer as they do for the personal email, it can cause major security headaches. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-a-passwordless-approach-to-improve-security/">Passwordless authentication</a>, which can functionally work in a few different ways, offers a better solution for security. The goal should be to increase trust and improve the user experience.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 8: Data classification and protection 
<p>All data is not the same. A one-size-fits-all security approach will create areas of too much security and others of too little, increasing the risk for the organization. Start with policies and definitions to get the process right before beginning to layer in the security technologies.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 9: Workforce competencies assessment 
<p>Install the right people with the right skills in the right roles. It’s critical but challenging to combine hard technical skills with softer leadership expertise. There are no perfect candidates, but you can identify five or six must-have competencies for each project. Assess competencies in a range of ways, including cyber-ranging and cybersimulations and softer skill assessments.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 10: Automating security risk assessments&nbsp; 
<p>This is one way to help security teams understand risks related to security operations, new projects or program-level risk. Risk assessment tends to be either skipped entirely or done on a limited basis. These assessments will allow for limited risk automation and visibility into where risk gaps exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   Symantec Enterprise: With more informed decisions comes more automated security. 
<p>In today’s Zero Trust world, where the principle of least privilege is ubiquitous, enterprises are struggling to balance security while simultaneously enabling a highly agile business environment. There has always been friction with security and making highly specific security decisions quickly and efficiently contributes to this. Moreover, decision-making in enterprises exists on a spectrum from completely manual to completely automated. Regardless of where your organization resides on this scale, you are moving more and more towards automation--whether you know it or not. The real question is, as your business becomes more agile, how can you keep your security posture from falling off a cliff?</p>
<p>Traditional security tools can help with decision-making, but oftentimes there isn’t enough data to automate this decision-making process, or there isn’t enough confidence with the data that does exist. This results in a lot of manual effort, which cannot be supported by overworked and understaffed security teams. The solution to this challenge is more data; the more data you have, the more informed any automated decision will be to grant access (and specifically which type of access). Thus, from a Zero Trust standpoint more data is almost always better, and as we move towards a more secure enterprise environment, it will be essential to draw on data from numerous sources, including access requests, authentication, authorization, session activity, user behavior, etc. The more data, the clearer the picture - the clearer the picture, the safer and faster the decision.</p>
<p>But where do we collect this data? The answer is, you already have some of it - you just aren’t leveraging it. The data that your existing identity and access management solutions are collecting while they are continuously monitoring user access and activity is invaluable. This data might include things like login times, login locations, associated roles/access, etc. But the marginal benefits of additional data, which might initially seem irrelevant, should not be underestimated. For example, suppose we gather average session data for users, which on its own might not be predictive of risk. It could be that longer average session time combined with administrator access is the single most predictive measure of malicious behavior, but if we don’t bother collecting the data, we’d never know that.</p>
<p>The upside of collecting and consolidating identity and other data is that machine learning tools can continually analyze this data to search for new patterns that enable more informed decisions. These tools are capable of learning not only which data is valuable for risk assessment at any given time, but also how to apply that risk assessment to make informed security decisions. And through more informed decisions comes more automated security, which enables business agility.</p>
<p>At Broadcom, we are focused on a future state where all data inputs - from authorization, access requests, authentication, session monitoring, and contextual user behavior - are used at the business level. <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/info/symantec/global-intelligence-network">Symantec’s Global Intelligence Network</a> (GIN) is one of the largest civilian data repositories in existence, providing an extraordinary amount of data to inform security decisions. As the mindset of security has evolved, we are capable of making much more granular decisions with a greater level of context, creating and enforcing policies that are highly contextual. We are evolving beyond identity, because the data we gather allows businesses to function at the next level.</p>

However, Bart Cant, Founder and Managing Partner of <a href="http://www.rtledgers.com/">Rethink Ledgers</a>, decided to use a unique approach in developing his prototype app. Not only did he use verifiable credentials for the secure sharing of COVID-19 test results and vaccine information, but he also based his app on smart contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bart’s app uses the Trinsic platform for the verifiable credentials portion, so we interviewed him further about his app, how it works, and future plans.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Let's dive right in. What is the app called, and what does it do? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The app is called “State Surveillance System for Covid19 Testing and Vaccine Distribution Management”. It is a prototype app developed using <a href="https://daml.com/">DAML</a> (Digital Assets Modeling Language) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C’s verifiable credentials</a>. The app showcases a prototype solution that provides a digital, secure experience for citizens, health clinic providers, and state agencies to share COVID-19 test results, “proof of vaccine” administration, and other “immunity proofs” using a centralized ledger.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What inspired you to build this app? What problems are you trying to solve? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>My background has been in digital transformation, and I spent the last few years building blockchain-based solutions for large enterprises at Capgemini and IBM. While blockchain and distributed ledger technology provide many opportunities, I realized in the last few years that for many use cases and processes, there are some components of blockchain that are really valuable (e.g., cryptography, tamper-proof evidence), but some processes could be better served in a more centralized way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I wanted to apply my knowledge and talent, so I decided to join the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.com/">COVID-19 Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI). By contributing to the use case and development of a prototype application, I hope to contribute to building solutions that can help keep people safe and bring back some normalcy in our daily lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problems I am trying to solve include the secure and timely sharing of COVID-19 testing data. Specifically in the case of COVID-19 testing, it is essential that all test results are communicated in a secure, privacy-enhanced, and safe environment. Secondly, accurate and timely data is critical for policy setting, so sharing data with state or local agencies in an automated way is also achieved. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does the app use both smart contracts and verifiable credentials? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As I mentioned previously, the app was developed using a combination of the DAML privacy-enhancing, smart contract language and W3C’s verifiable credentials. DAML guarantees privacy by coding the solution as rights and obligations. The information is stored, so it cannot be accessed unless the party accessing that data has been explicitly configured in the smart contracts to access it. DAML is also one of the few solutions that allows interoperability across networks. The solution is built on a centralized ledger based solution (<a href="https://projectdabl.com/">https://projectdabl.com/</a>) but could be easily deployed on other blockchain networks (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Sawtooth, Besu or R3 Corda), centralized ledgers (e.g., AWS QLDB), or traditional databases (e.g., Postgres).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second major technical component of the solution is how it interacts with verifiable credentials. Verifiable credentials are used to securely transmit COVID-19 test information from the health clinics to the patient. The application provides a digital workflow for this experience (including a mobile experience) while still being HIPAA compliant and providing a safe and secure mechanism for sharing COVID-19 test data that allows the recipient to be in control of his or her data and decide on what to share and with whom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The application is already looking forward to the future situation where COVID-19 vaccines will become available. When vaccines are available, at least a portion of the population will receive the COVID-19 vaccine and therefore will be better protected from contracting the virus or potentially infecting others in their communities. By providing verifiable credentials for vaccine proofs, we enhance the trust factor of sharing and disclosing medical information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What role does Trinsic play in the app? How was Trinsic's platform helpful in the development of your app? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is a critical component of the overall architecture of the solution. It is the glue for connecting the smart contracts to the distribution of verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It uses the <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-studio/">Trinsic Studio</a> for setting up DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and schemas and can be used as a monitoring tool for connections and distribution of the verifiable credentials. The Trinsic Studio is an easy-to-use web interface for managing verifiable credential exchange with no code. It’s so easy to use that it makes it possible to issue a verifiable credential in less than five minutes! The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is also used for accepting and presenting the verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does this solution balance the need to track, analyze, and share COVID-19 related data and the privacy concerns that come with that? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>With COVID-19, there is a great emphasis on privacy and regulation. Verifiable credentials allow you to share medical data directly from the issuer to the holder without the need to store the data. Smart contracts can be leveraged to orchestrate this process. Additionally, smart contracts can be used to anonymize data by using DIDs, for instance. Additionally, the critical medical data can be blinded and encrypted by the DAML smart contract, so the solution can be both HIPAA and GDPR compliant. </p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the next step from here? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since the release of my prototype and associated video, I have received a lot of feedback from healthcare professionals and self-sovereign identity advocates. I also am exploring further enhancements to a variety of use cases. There are many similar opportunities to leverage smart contracts and verifiable credentials for COVID-19 tests or vaccines in the entertainment, travel, or education industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, the solution could be very helpful in international travel. By using the app, tourists from the US that are planning to go to the Caribbean islands can easily share their pre-boarding screening information about COVID-19 tests or vaccines and then provide additional test information upon returning back to the US, avoiding long lines upon entry or mandatory quarantine requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(end of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes joined Bart and DAML representatives in a webinar to discuss and demo the prototype app. To view the webinar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0mSf0TNz9M&amp;utm_campaign=DAML%20for%20Enterprise&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=94512634&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_WANWD3dc6FImKtBVJDX9cdEjmDaQSXbXomOS-1tYSITgnPfyO5_U7tpgTLvFnUpH5bFF8G6jdHxt8kE-4YBg9Cz_WPg&amp;utm_content=94512634&amp;utm_source=hs_email">click here</a>.

<p>OScore is a self-sovereign credit evaluation system based on user data stored on the Ontology blockchain. With full integration of ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, OScore supports cross-chain interaction and verifiable credentials, connecting user identities with personal accounts on the Ontology blockchain, eliminating third parties from the process. Once a user authorizes their financial data, Ontology’s OScore system generates a quantifiable credit score, while ensuring the user’s privacy is fully protected.</p><p>OScore gives users full control over their digital assets and contracts addresses through a mechanism that gives them full autonomy regarding who has access to their data. Users are permitted to bind their digital assets or contract addresses to their ONT ID, and subsequently unbind them whenever they wish to do so. It is entirely up to the user to authorize third-party access to their data. Data used in OScore calculations includes the user’s digital asset balance, historical holding records, transaction records, records dApp&nbsp;usage.</p><p>OScore is an independent on-chain reputation system, generated by specific onchain user data that is not associated with their off-chain identities. In this way, OScore protects the user’s privacy and supports full anonymity.</p><p>In the financial sector, a huge chasm remains in the data collaboration between both the off-chain and on-chain worlds. For most blockchain users, on-chain assets and actions constitute a significant aspect of their financial profile. However, most credit-related scenarios in the world today still require the user’s off-chain information to be reliable, without taking into account that their onchain data could also give insight into their credit&nbsp;history.</p><p>OScore seeks to bridge the gap between users and DeFi services, allowing users to enjoy the DeFi projects, dApps and blockchain platforms suited to their needs. Users can manage their on-chain credit data at their will, and if they have a positive credit history, they can put their credit data to use in more rewarding financial products, all the while knowing that their privacy is safe from intrusion. In addition, users can bind their OScore and off-chain real-name data to their ONT ID, pooling their off-chain and on-chain data to form a more complete credit profile for themselves that can be applied in both the on-chain and off-chain worlds.</p><p>OScore finds an optimal application in Wing, a DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain. Wing integrates OScore into its credit evaluation module to support its DeFi services. Each Wing product pool can use OScore to increase the credibility of its DeFi services. Users can benefit from OScore in the following ways:</p><blockquote>OScore helps users avoid over-collateralization when looking to borrow a variety of digital&nbsp;assets</blockquote><p>An OScore is generated for the user based on a hybrid calculation of their digital identity and assets. Users with a high OScore may enjoy under-collateralization in crediting digital assets, such as collateralizing 8 bitcoins to get&nbsp;10.</p><blockquote>OScore users can enjoy WING incentives</blockquote><p>Based on the user’s level of participation, the product pool will distribute extra WINGs in every transaction as incentives for crediting participants with an OScore. Users who return their credited assets on time will receive extra OScore points as a reward. Other DeFi projects or credit-evaluating products can also utilize OScore for similar functions.</p><blockquote>OScore protects user privacy, even when they have not met contractual terms</blockquote><p>Users who breach terms will be listed on an OScore privacy-protecting list. Despite this, they still have control over which entities have access to this list, as they have completed the authorization process before joining the crediting activities.</p><p>OScore offers a framework where users can find credit evaluating tools that serve different purposes. Every user can write their own credit evaluation algorithm or re-use the credit score issued by a trusted third party. From the user’s perspective, OScore can be used to desensitize their credit data and provide verifiable credentials with scoring algorithms and credit data as trust endorsement for credit-related business.</p><p>Currently, OScore’s primary credit evaluation mechanism calculates the user’s balance and historical holding records of digital assets and supports blockchain platforms based on BTC, ETH, and ONT. In the future, updated OScore systems will continue to incorporate more types of on-chain data and evaluation mechanisms. In addition, Ontology also has plans to integrate OScore into the ONTO wallet. Relevant SDKs and APIs will also be released to allow integration and deployment by third-party apps.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore: Everything You Need to Know</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>For these organizations, an adaptable Active Directory-centered (AD) approach can address the areas of highest impact. By adding cloud-based access request and access certification functionality to the mix, a company can achieve a basic IGA solution for a fraction of the cost, complexity, and deployment time. This approach also provides the opportunity to expand the scope beyond AD and Azure AD by embracing many non-Windows systems (such as Unix/Linux) and SaaS applications (via SCIM connectivity). Learn how to build a strategy for a modular approach to identity that can be custom fit to company needs, size, complexity, and budget.</p>
<p>This webinar will equip you to:</p>
 
 Provision your AD and Azure environment – and beyond 
 Approach baseline IAM implementation efficiently 
 Plan a short track for improving security and compliance 
 Set up your identity program for ongoing success 
 Be well-positioned to expand to IGA and PAM when the time is right. 
 
<p>In the first part, KuppingerCole Principal Analyst Martin Kuppinger will give a brief overview of identity in general as well as of IAM, IGA and PAM strategies, and will look at what every business, regardless of size and industry, needs in IAM.</p>
<p>He will be joined by One Identity Field Strategist Dan Conrad, who will explain how to prioritize IGA capabilities for maximum impact and show why you should opt for a modular approach with AD-optimized tools.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/iam_strategies_that_grow_with_your_business"></a>

				 <p>I have been talking to numerous founders lately about the various oddities and niceties of raising funds – and the crazy things that VCs and aggressive angels do. Over the years I have advised many companies and I thought that there was a page that gave the founder-centric view of things – but I can’t find it. So… Here we go.</p>
<p>General Terminology – <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-venture-capital-terms">CB Insights</a> does a good job here. Key for raising are the following phrases (go to the page for the definitions):</p>
 
 pre-money valuation and post-money valuation are crucial terms – simple to get but if you haven’t heard them they sound odd. 
 liquidation preferences and especially any mention of a full ratchet. 
 
<p>Key warnings:</p>
 
 Be really careful about <a href="https://feld.com/archives/2004/07/liquidation-preferences.html">liquidation preferences</a>.&nbsp; 
 Watch out for the <a href="https://venturehacks.com/option-pool-shuffle">employee stock option game</a> that aggressive VCs play. This seemingly simple concept creates massive dilution that isn’t in a founder’s favour.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Interesting Approach – Vesting for Founders – One interesting thought is that some of the best places have quite long vesting periods, even for founders. AngelList, for example, has a <a href="https://venturehacks.com/6-year-vesting">6-year vesting period</a> – for everyone, including Naval.</p>

<p>We have had a very exciting week here at Ontology as <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing</a>, the first credit-based DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain, released its first whitepaper. Integrated with Ontology’s decentralized identity and credit evaluation systems, Wing fuels cross-chain interaction for various DeFi products and decentralized governance.</p><p>We are also delighted to share that our tokens ONT and ONG can now be swapped to eONT and eONG on the Ethereum blockchain, and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-ong-now-listed-on-uniswap-to-support-all-types-of-defi-products-on-ethereum-852f3268a8f0">eONT and eONG are listed on the UniSwap platform</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we continued performance testing with bloXroute by providing reliable technical assistance to our partners.</p><p>Back-end</p><p>- Completed 50% of Ontology GraphQL interface development</p><p>- The Rust Wasm contract development hub released ontio-std v0.3</p><p>Product Development</p><p>ONTO</p><p>- ONTO v3.3.0&nbsp;released</p><p>- Completed the connection with&nbsp;Tron</p><p>- Completed the connection with&nbsp;Polkadot</p><p>- Upgraded credential functions</p><p>- Upgraded asset score functions by including stablecoins into the calculation of asset&nbsp;score</p><p>- Upgraded asset score and credential tutorial</p><p>dApp</p><p>- 71 dApps now live on&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>- 6,065,687 dApp-related transactions since genesis&nbsp;block</p><p>- 14,320 dApp-related transactions in the past&nbsp;week</p><p>Bounty Program</p><p>- 1 new application for the technical documentation translation and 1 new application for SDK&nbsp;bounty</p><p>Community Growth</p><p>- We onboarded 753 new members across Ontology’s Vietnamese, Swedish, and Romanian communities.</p><p>Newly Released</p><p>- Wing, the first credit-integrated DeFi project based on the Ontology blockchain, released its first whitepaper. According to the whitepaper, Wing serves as a DeFi platform based on Ontology’s decentralized identity and credit evaluating systems. It supports cross-chain interaction between various DeFi products and decentralized governance and introduces a risk control mechanism that promotes a healthy relationship between borrowers, creditors, and guarantors, breaking the barriers with traditional finance through the incorporation of&nbsp;credit.</p><p>- Ontology’s digital assets, ONT and ONG, have completed mapping to the Ethereum blockchain platform. ONT and ONG are now listed on UniSwap to support all types of DeFi products on Ethereum. This move marks Ontology as the first mainstream public blockchain that has completed cross-chain communication for Ethereum. Digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain can now be swapped to the Ontology blockchain as bi-directional cross-chain communications are enabled between Ontology and Ethereum.</p><p>- Ontology continued its performance testing with bloXroute, with a focus on BDN performance during periods of slow internet. Ontology improved the speed of block propagation, block recovering speed, and transaction stream speed, and announced a partnership with Chainstack.</p><p>Global Events</p><p>- From September 2–4, Ontology co-organized the event ‘Cointelegraph China’s DeFi Marathon’. On 2 September, the launch of the event, professionals including DeFi project teams, high-tech individuals, senior investors, community enthusiasts, investment research organizations, and media personnel met at the Shanghai site to discuss DeFi topics and the future growth of decentralized finance. Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, addressed the audience during “Ontology: Empowering DeFi with Credit” and joined a panel discussion themed “Public Chain’s Choice amid DeFi Pressure”. He shared inspiring insights on why Ontology decided to get involved with DeFi, our technical upgrading and ongoing development, our new governance and staking economic model, and empowering DeFi with Wing, Ontology’s latest credit-based DeFi project. He added, “By empowering DeFi with credit, we are poised to build the next ‘Super-Oracle’”. In addition, during the event, Erick Pinos, Americas Ecosystem Lead, was engaged in a discussion with the lead of Aave as well as other renowned projects.</p><p>- On September 4, Jun LI, Founder of Ontology, participated in a live AMA panel hosted by HyperPay on the topic of “Braving the DeFi-spurred Storm: Where Will Public Chains Head”. During the panel, he unveiled Ontology’s blueprint for DeFi, and briefed community users on the innovative and transformative features of Wing, the credit-based DeFi cross-chain platform.</p><p>- On September 3, Kendall MAO, Dean of Ontology Institute, discussed the dilemma posed by DeFi to public chains at a SheKnows live panel organized by 8BTCnews, along with representatives from Bytom Blockchain. Kendall mentioned, “Wing, Ontology’s latest cross-chain DeFi project, is integrated with the element of credit. We believe that a dynamic integration with the OScore system will create new paradigms for DeFi innovations, opening up new opportunities for Ontology.”</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-weekly-report-september-1-7-90d60ee16104">Ontology Weekly Report (September 1–7)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The magic of innovation means that once a technology, product or tool becomes mainstream, it’s difficult for people to remember a time without it. E-commerce and same-day delivery options are to be expected whether you’re buying clothing, household items, electronics, and now even groceries. While the online grocery store market has seen steady growth, COVID-19—<a href="https://authenteq.com/how-covid-19-have-changed-the-self-tour-industry/">as it did with many industries</a>—dramatically shifted consumer behavior and, seemingly overnight, became the new norm. And yet, even for those grocery stores who were already operating online, there is one item on their shelves that presents a unique problem: alcohol.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a<a href="https://research.rabobank.com/far/en/sectors/beverages/the-2020-alcohol-e-commerce-playbook.html"> RaboResearch report</a>, online alcohol sales reached $2.6 billion in the US in 2019, up 22 percent. Despite this growth, the same report predicts that alcohol brands are losing billions of dollars in online sales opportunities and missing out on building digital relationships with their consumers.</p>



<p>The physical sale of alcohol is one area where the legislation is very clear. A legal purchasing limit is set. Age verification is required. Fines are actively enforced. In Europe and the US, alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores, corner stores, specialty shops, and even in some pharmacies. These purchases require a face to face interaction solely because of the age verification step. But while good innovation can feel like magic, legislation often lags behind, as is the case with online alcohol sales. Add in a global pandemic, social distancing, and isolation, and suddenly what felt more like an exception becomes the rule.</p>



<p>Bier mich</p>



<p>In Germany, a system has been honed over the years that have in fact included the online purchase of alcohol. Wine or beer can be ordered and delivered to a private residence, but to receive the alcohol, a government-issued ID needs to be provided by the purchasing party and verified by the delivery person. Before COVID-19 hit, there were issues with deliveries being sent to locations like DHL boxes which meant the identity verification step could not be completed. However, by and large, the system was working, and it was working well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As COVID-19 spread, Germans, and citizens around the world for that matter, needed more space and less interaction. E-commerce and shipping providers began offering zero contact delivery in response. With no human exchange taking place at all anymore, what does this mean for alcohol sales? In the absence of updated nationwide regulations, the onus of how to navigate increased online alcohol sales has been left up to the individual shops. As it turns out, ensuring that alcohol is not being purchased and consumed by minors is much harder to regulate during a global pandemic.</p>



<p>More than money&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underage drinking poses a number of risks. In the US, alcohol plays a role in over 180,000 injuries and 4,000 deaths<a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/underage-drinking"> annually</a>. Selling alcohol online is more than a matter of profit or meeting economic demands, it is also a matter of corporate social responsibility. For any company that values protecting minors online, selling any product or service that could be classified within the vice industry—that is alcohol, tobacco, gaming and betting, adult websites—proper age and identity verification absolutely needs to be baked in.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Retailers across Europe and the US, both large multinationals and smaller brick and mortar shops, can easily integrate a KYC solution into their online systems. Rather than implementing a basic age checkbox, an automated identity and age verification system can protect your business and your customers.</p>



<p>Authenteq allows you to verify your customers and their identity through any channel without compromising their privacy or security. The omnichannel solution is fully automated and provides verification within minutes. With desktop and mobile solutions, it can be easily integrated into the sales process without channel breakage to keep your customer retention and completion rates high. Of course, a KYC tool with manual verification of online sales is better than no KYC at all, but with the expected immediacy of online purchases, manual intervention is both costly and lengthy.</p>



<p>By implementing an identity and age verification process like Authenteq’s into your own solution, you can unlock new growth potential in a safe and secure way for all.</p>



<p>Looking ahead</p>



<p>COVID-19 has taught us many things, but perhaps one of the biggest lessons so far is how adaptable companies and consumers must be. Consumer buying behavior evolves over time, but it can also change overnight.</p>



<p>As e-commerce sales continue to grow across all sectors, the barriers to entry are, for now, harder for alcohol marketplaces. Those that see these barriers as a reason to not enter the space at all, will see profound consequences. Participating in the online ecosystem is necessary for brands to stay connected to their customers, but brands that also consider and incorporate their own corporate social responsibility goals into that online presence are much better poised to respond to changes, and flourish while doing so.</p>



<p>—</p>



<p>Are you ready to incorporate KYC into your own corporate social responsibility goals? <a href="https://cal.services/multi/Authenteq-Demo/-1jva2cQw">Connect with one of our sales experts</a> today to learn how Authenteq can help you reach them.<br></p>

  <p>IAM implementations are not all same, but for sure there is not as many implementations as there are situations.I have selected 3 major factors which defined our IAM project. Of course, final result was a consequence of lot more things.</p>
<p>And yes, we succeeded to implement full Identity lifecycle in the enterprise where starting point is a complex matrix of requirements like&nbsp;multiple legal entities, multiple contracts, kinds of work relationships, several account directories, manual processes.</p>
<p>Just name any situation, we had it. We were on the edge of failure and almost ready to add yet another failed IAM project to the list.&nbsp;But we made it and if I had to do it yet again in another place, in another situation, I would take these 3 with me.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Takeaways:</p>
<p>-Correct data is vital for every IT project, IAM is not special. But where to exactly look in the IAM project? Which issues with the data are toxic?</p>
<p>-The analysis of the system drives implementation architecture and design. Thereby the steering must be correct.</p>
<p>-And finally, how to bring it out in the enterprise scale if you cannot do big bang but same time you cannot left anybody behind?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_vool"></a>

<p>Given that background, you might assume that this was another session about zero trust. It’s not.</p>
<p>Recently, a growing emphasis on data privacy has sought to treat identities and their associated data as valuable works of art as well, worthy of protection and compensation for use. Through the lens of the Gardner Theft, we’ll evaluate the current proposals and concepts around user-owned data and explore the benefits and pitfalls of each.</p>
<p>We'll step through the heist, recreate those 81 minutes, and discover how identity data is the new Vermeer. Note: If we somehow crack the case together, we'll split the $10 million between us all.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve8_2020_09_03_kiser"></a>

<p>Der Regierungsrat hat am 25. April 2018 die
Strategie «<a href="https://rr.zh.ch/dam/regierungsrat/rat/pdf/kommissionen/sdi/strategie/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf.spooler.download.1531402793115.pdf/Strategie_Digitale_Verwaltung.pdf">Digitale
Verwaltung</a>» festgesetzt. Sie zeigt auf, wie die Verwaltung die digitale
Entwicklung gestalten und die Chance der Digitalisierung nutzen will. Teil der
Strategie ist ein Impulsprogramm mit Digitalisierungsvorhaben, die vorrangig
und eng koordiniert angegangen werden. Das Impulsprogramm umfasst unter Ziel 1
«Vereinfachung und Ausbau des digitalen Leistungsangebotes» auch das Projekt
«IP1.5: Studie zum Einsatz der Blockchain-Technologie». Procivis&nbsp;wurde
mit der Ausarbeitung dieser Studie betraut. Wir veröffentlichen hier die
Zusammenfassung der Studie.&nbsp;Den Link zur gesamten Studie&nbsp;ist am Ende
des Blogs zu finden</p>



 Zusammenfassung 



<p>Eine Blockchain ist die
Aneinanderreihung von Datensätzen, Blöcke genannt, die durch kryptographische
Verfahren miteinander fest verkettet sind. Die Darstellung von Informationen
als Kette (“Chain“) von Blöcken (“Block“)
ergibt das Kunstwort Blockchain. Die Verkettung der Blöcke mittels Hashes
erlaubt es, die gesamte Vorgeschichte einer Blockchain jeweils in den neuesten
Block zu kondensieren. Damit entsteht ein unverfälschbarer Audit-Trail.</p>



<p>Blockchains können
unterschiedlich konzipiert werden. Erstens wird differenziert bezüglich des
Grads der Zugangsrechte (Unterscheidung nach Lese- und Schreiberechten).
Zweitens wird unterschieden nach Konsensregeln, die festlegen, wer den
nächsten Block berechnen und publizieren darf. Es besteht eine logische
Abhängigkeit zwischen Zugangsrechten und Konsensregeln. Blockchains, die Lese-
und Schreibrechte uneingeschränkt gewähren, wenden normalerweise die
Konsensregel Proof-of-Work an. Bei dieser Konsensregel ist die Rechenleistung
der einzelnen Teilnehmer der entscheidende Faktor. Bekannteste Beispiele dieser
Art von Blockchain sind Bitcoin und Ethereum. Diese Art von Blockchains hat
sich bezüglich der Sicherheit als robust erwiesen; ihr grösster Nachteil ist,
dass der Skalierung – also der Fähigkeit, grosse Mengen von Transaktionen
durchzuführen, Grenzen gesetzt sind. Zudem brauchen sie grosse Mengen Energie.
Am anderen Ende des Blockchain-Spektrums bewegen sich private Blockchains, wo
sowohl Lese- wie auch Schreibrechte auf einen ausgewählten Kreis beschränkt
sind. Hier stellt die Skalierung kein sonderliches Problem dar; auch der
Energieverbrauch ist bei solchen Blockchains vernachlässigbar. Allerdings
bieten solche Blockchains aufgrund der fehlenden Transparenz und
Dezentralisierung nicht die gleichen Vorteile wie öffentliche Blockchains.</p>



<p>Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass
Blockchains dynamischen Charakter haben, also die Entwicklung von einzelnen
Datenpunkten über die Zeit darstellen, ist es möglich, auf der Blockchain
Transaktionen in Abhängigkeit von Bedingungen zu programmieren. Dies geschieht
mittels Smart Contracts. Diese sorgen dafür, dass Transaktionen
ausgeführt werden, sobald eine gewisse Bedingung erfüllt ist. Dies erlaubt es,
auch komplexe Transaktionen weitergehend zu automatisieren.</p>



<p>Die Blockchain-Technologie wurde
ursprünglich entwickelt, um über eine Infrastruktur zu verfügen, die ohne eine
zentrale Autorität auskommt. Deshalb stellt sich die Frage, inwiefern es für
den Staat Sinn macht, diese Technologie einzusetzen, ist er als Inhaber des physischen
Gewaltmonopols doch das Sinnbild einer zentralen Autorität. Im Falle eines idealen
Staates, der effizient und ordnungsgemäss arbeitet, bedeutet die Anwendung
der Blockchain-Technologie eine Verkomplizierung; zentrale Datenbanken genügen.
Ein besonderer Anwendungsbereich bilden demokratische Wahl- und
Abstimmungsverfahren, bei denen Bürgerinnen und Bürger ihr Wahlgeheimnis
gewahrt wissen, gleichzeitig aber auch sicher sein wollen, dass ihr politischer
Wille korrekt ins Ergebnis einfliesst. Auf öffentlichen Blockchains wäre dies
möglich; allerdings zum Preis der Unmöglichkeit der späteren Vernichtung der
Wahlunterlagen.</p>



<p>Staaten weichen vom Ideal ab, indem sie Strukturen und Prozesse aufweisen,
die einen mehr oder weniger effizienten Mitteleinsatz zur Folge haben. Zudem
können sich Amtsträgerinnen und Amtsträger und Staatsangestellte mehr oder
weniger gesetzeskonform verhalten bzw. Fehler machen. Blockchains können die
damit verbundenen Ineffizienzen mildern, indem sie die Grundlage für
Datenkonsistenz bieten. Darauf aufbauend können Prozesse weiter digitalisiert
und automatisiert werden, und (unbeabsichtigtes) menschliches Fehlverhalten
kann besser kontrolliert werden. Blockchains verhindern gesetzeswidriges
Verhalten nicht per se, aber ein jederzeit einsehbarer und unverfälschbarer
Audit-Trail erhöht den Druck, sich korrekt zu verhalten.</p>



<p>Der Nutzen einer
Blockchain-Lösung kann sich nur entfalten, wenn die entsprechenden
Rahmenbedingungen gegeben sind. Jeder Veränderungsprozess setzt politischen
Willen und Führungsverantwortung voraus. Dies ist bei allfälligen
Blockchain-Anwendungen umso mehr der Fall, weil deren Implementation
Konsequenzen haben, die über technische Aspekte weit hinausgehen. Neben
organisatorischen und kulturellen Fragen sind insbesondere auch rechtliche
Fragen zu beachten: Erstens ist jeweils zu prüfen, ob für eine
Blockchain-Anwendung die erforderliche rechtliche Grundlage vorhanden
ist und zweitens, ob diese mit dem Datenschutzrecht in Einklang, und
drittens, ob eine rechtskonforme Archivierung möglich ist. Den
verfassungsmässig garantierten Rechten – Schutz von Personendaten, Recht auf
Korrektur und Löschung, Recht auf Erinnerung (die zueinander in Konkurrenz
stehen können) – ist Rechnung zu tragen.</p>



<p>Im Zuge der allgemeinen
Begeisterung über die Blockchain-Technologie im Allgemeinen und Kryptowährungen
im Speziellen sind weltweit hunderte Konzepte formuliert und Pilotprojekte für Blockchain-Anwendungen
in öffentlichen Verwaltungen durchgeführt worden. Produktive Anwendungen
mit namhaften Transaktionsvolumina sind aber noch keine bekannt. Dieser Befund
trifft auch auf die Schweiz zu: IIm Rahmen dieser Studie konnten acht
Blockchain-Projekte identifiziert werden, in denen kantonale Verwaltungen und
das Fürstentum Liechtenstein in den Bereichen Register, elektronische
Identitäten, E-Voting und Bezahlung von Gebühren erste Erfahrungen gesammelt
haben oder sammeln. Diese Projekte sind abgeschlossen worden, teilweise noch im
Gang oder in Vorbereitung. </p>



<p>Auf der Grundlage von
Prozessbeschreibungen, die im Rahmen des Projekts «Strategie Datenmanagement
und Data-Governance IP3.1» erarbeitet worden sind, wurden im Rahmen der
vorliegenden Studie vier mögliche Anwendungsbeispiele für den Kanton Zürich
entwickelt:</p>



  Registrierung von amtlichen Dokumenten auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Bürgerdossier mit Blockchain-basiertem Logbuch zur Stärkung der Rechtssicherheit  Inventarkontrolle auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  Öffentliche Ausschreibungen auf der Blockchain zur Erhöhung der Transparenz  



<p></p>



<p>Der Reifegrad dieser Beispiele ist unterschiedlich, ebenso wie die Schwierigkeiten bei einer allfälligen Umsetzung. Allen ist jedoch gemeinsam, dass sie sich die unmittelbare und nicht mehr verfälschbare Transparenz von Blockchains zunutze machen. Zentrale Datenbanken sind nicht dafür ausgelegt, einem grossen Kreis in dynamischer Weise Transparenz zu bieten. Eine solche Funktion kann zwar auch in zentralen Architekturen nachgebaut werden, Blockchains lösen das Problem jedoch eleganter. Hinzu kommt, dass dezentrale Architekturen, wie sie Blockchains aufweisen, tendenziell einen Vertrauensvorsprung bieten, der von zentral konzipierten Lösungen nicht eingeholt werden kann.</p>

  When it comes to identity management many companies depend heavily on Microsoft Active Directory (AD). This high degree of dependency on one service can become a problem when this service faces an outage. Also, respective of the requirements companies have, all services have certain limitations which are sometimes necessary to overcome. Many cyberattacks are perpetrated via staff endpoint devices (computers, smartphones or even printers). This necessitates a fine-mesh risk management approach with a centralized solution, called Identity Fabric at KuppingerCole.

					 <p>“Identifiers” are how you are identified as a unique person and recognized as that same unique person over time. With other people, your primary identifier is your face. With organizations, it might be a student ID, social security number, or driver’s license number. Online, it might be a username, phone number, or email address.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using identifiers properly helps to avoid confusing two people with one another. But identifiers can also be harmful—if a hacker gets ahold of your social security number, it could mean trouble!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most identifiers are given to us by centralized registration authorities like governments, telephone companies, and email providers. But that puts an organization in between us and our ability to access basic services, compromising privacy and putting individuals in a position of powerlessness. The answer to this problem is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C standard</a> called Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs).</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 A new type of identifier 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>DIDs are “a new type of globally unique identifier”¹ that is used in <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). It looks like this:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>You’ll notice it has three parts:<br><br></p>  Scheme: DIDs all start with <code>did:</code> just like how all website addresses start with <code>http://</code> . This is so that computers can tell what they’re looking at.  Method: After DIDs are generated, they have to be stored somewhere. They’re often stored in a blockchain or a digital wallet, but they can be stored anywhere. The method, which is the <code>example:</code> part of the DID in the example above, tells computers where to go to find the DID. For example, issuers of verifiable credentials in the Trinsic platform get a DID that has a <code>did:sov:</code> method, because the DID goes on the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Network</a>.  Identifier: This is the unique identifier of the DID.  <p>According to the W3C, a DID has the following four characteristics²:<br><br></p>  Decentralized: There should be no central issuing agency. That means you should be able to create your own DIDs independently of anyone else.  Persistent: The identifier should be inherently persistent, not requiring the continued operation of an underling organization. This is in contrast to your email, for example; if Gmail shuts down, you’d lose access to your Gmail messages.  Crytopgraphically verifiable: It should be possible to prove control of the identifier cryptographically.  Resolvable: It should be possible to discover metadata about the identifier.   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How are DIDs used? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>As identifiers in the Trinsic system, DIDs serve two primary functions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Publicly identifying credential issuers  Privately identifying relationships (connections)  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Credential issuers need to be publicly identifiable if they want the credentials they issue to be verifiable. We use a blockchain to post the issuers’ DID, which acts as a public key. The issuer signs the credential attributes with the corresponding private key.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each relationship in the Trinsic system is called a connection. When you make a connection, you create a DID just for that relationship and share it with the counterparty. When you want to send messages, you encrypt them so that only the counterparty can decrypt the message using the DID you shared with them. This creates a super secure, peer-to-peer channel to interact. The identifiers for these connections are kept privately in your (and the counterparty’s) wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in learning more about DIDs, feel free to <a href="https://trinsic.id/contact-us/">contact us</a> or read the W3C’s DID specification at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/</a>.</p>

  <p>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst for digitization in many companies and led to an increase in remote work and adoption of the bring your own device (BYOD) policy. Every device and digital service that employees use is a potential gateway into company networks and thus poses a security risk. The risks are magnified even more when privileged accounts enter the equation because they enable access to critical data. Given the immediacy and speed with which companies had to shift from office to remote work, security concerns were often neglected leading to an increase in successful cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Facing this situation of increased risks and attack vectors, companies need to have foolproof security in place to keep their data safe and secure. IT teams should start with the very basics such as giving the company staff cybersecurity awareness trainings and monitoring remote access. While it has become a well-known fact that Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; is an integral part of cybersecurity in modern companies, Secure Compliance Management (SCM) and&nbsp;User Behaviour Analytics (UBA) perhaps have not been given proper attention in the security world yet.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_workforce_security"></a>

<p>As organizations have accelerated their investments in digital initiatives, business and app teams have embraced the DevOps model, a process that speeds up software delivery. DevOps enables businesses to be agile enough to quickly adapt or be the first to market, which can have a tremendous impact on the bottom line.<br>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for identity to join the DevOps party. For far too long, identity initiatives have been stretched to their limits while struggling to keep pace with application growth. DevOps is starting to gain traction in the identity space—and for good reason, since identity is a key part of application onboarding. Without collaboration between identity teams and DevOps teams, many of the intended benefits of DevOps can quickly unravel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is DevOps? 
<p>The DevOps methodology for software development breaks down traditional silos by eliminating manual tasks and replacing them with automation via code so that releases and updates can be pushed out faster and more frequently. At its core, DevOps improves the efficiencies between app development and IT operations or infrastructure teams. Previously, developers would make manual requests to identity teams or IT ops and lose valuable time. In DevOps, the identity teams enable the software to be consumable via APIs or infrastructure-as-code, the preferred methods for developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the DevOps model has specific tools for implementation. The most common include Docker, which enables software in images or “containers,” and Kubernetes, the orchestration engine that manages containers. These tools allow developers to easily spin up infrastructure and perform updates with minimal interruption.</p>

This was a fun&nbsp;one:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team — Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD&nbsp;Labs</a>  <p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Quick updates on the war against Apple’s App&nbsp;Store  Facebook’s multi-pronged fight with&nbsp;Apple  Discord’s long term vision (it sounds a little like&nbsp;Groups)  The shifting challenges of platform moderation  Symbolic: ExxonMobile booted from&nbsp;Dow  Stuff happens   1. We’ve been covering the battle between Tim Sweeney’s Epic Games and Apple’s App Store so a couple of quick updates for&nbsp;you. <p>First, the initial judge ruling, via The Information:</p><blockquote>A federal judge denied a request by Epic Games for a temporary restraining order that would have forced Apple to allow Fortnite, a popular Epic videogame, back into the App Store. But that same judge granted another request by Epic to stop Apple from kicking it out of a developer program.</blockquote><p>….</p><blockquote>In a court filing, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that Epic had not shown that it was at risk of irreparable harm from Apple, which removed Fortnite from the App Store last week after Epic began violating its policies. Epic modified Fortnite to bypass an Apple payment mechanism, which in turn enabled Epic to avoid paying Apple the standard 30% commission it collects on in-app transactions.</blockquote>Photo: Mike Deerkoski<blockquote>But the judge ruled that Epic was more persuasive about the harm that could have resulted from another matter — a threat by Apple to deny Epic access to developer tools for its iOS and Mac operating systems. Epic depends on those tools for the development of Unreal Engine, an Epic product used by many outside companies to build&nbsp;games.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge said that Apple had “chosen to act severely” and that denying Epic access to the developer could have hurt games made by independent companies. The judge ordered Epic to file a motion for a longer-term injunction by Sept. 4 and a hearing it on the matter is scheduled for Sept.&nbsp;28.</blockquote><p>Apple has also made peace with Wordpress creator Automattic:</p><blockquote>Apple says it has come to an agreement with Automattic, which operates the WordPress content management system application, after Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg announced on Friday that Apple had blocked updates for the iOS version of WordPress until he agreed to add in-app purchases.</blockquote><p>The first couple of skirmishes but the war is far from&nbsp;over.</p><p>In any case, Ben Thompson thinks <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Apple’s App Store policy is bad for innovation, bad for customers, and ultimately bad for&nbsp;Apple</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/from-kingmaker-to-autocrat-how-game-makers-went-to-war-with-apple">From Kingmaker to ‘Autocrat’: How Game Makers Went to War With&nbsp;Apple</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402547/fortnite-epic-games-apple-ios-macos-two-different-games">Fortnite is splitting into two different games because of Epic and Apple’s&nbsp;fight</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-makers-apple-fight-leaves-some-developers-wary-11598274027?mod=djem10point">‘Fortnite’ Maker’s Apple Fight Leaves Some Developers Wary</a>  Ben Thompson — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/rethinking-the-app-store/">Rethinking the App&nbsp;Store</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3htFFcoo6Lc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Linus weighs in on Apple vs Epic&nbsp;Games</a>   2. In part because Facebook has joined the chat. That’s because Apple’s policies are a threat to Mark Zuckerberg’s long term vision of making Facebook more of a super app in the vein of&nbsp;WeChat. <p>He made that pretty clear in a company wide town hall last week, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">reported by Buzzfeed</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg took a swing at Apple on Thursday, calling the iPhone maker’s app store monopolistic and harmful to customers during a companywide meeting.</blockquote><blockquote>“[Apple has] this unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,” Zuckerberg said to more than 50,000 employees via webcast. He added that the Cupertino, California–based company’s app store “blocks innovation, blocks competition” and “allows Apple to charge monopoly&nbsp;rents.”</blockquote><p>Mark has a point and it’s one reason why China has superapps while the rest of us don’t. Apple has set it up so that the iOS itself is the superapp — further entrenched by its deep integration of features such as payments and now identity.</p><p>It’s not Facebook’s only tiff w/Apple,&nbsp;BTW:</p><blockquote>A new fight between Facebook and Apple over the mechanics of ad tech is surfacing an industry divide over user privacy and spotlighting longstanding dilemmas about the tracking and use of personal information online, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Privacy advocates have been sounding alarms for years about tech firms’ expansive, sometimes inescapable data harvesting without making much headway in the U.S. But the game could change if major industry players start taking opposite&nbsp;sides.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook warned advertisers Wednesday that a coming change to Apple’s iOS could devastate revenue for ads that sends users straight to the App Store to install an app — an approach that’s used widely by developers including mobile game&nbsp;makers.</blockquote><p>Like I said, a lot is at stake and both sides are in it for the long&nbsp;haul.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/f20e9b">Briefing: Facebook Says Apple Changes Could Kill Part of its Ads&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-warns-advertisers-on-apple-privacy-changes-5018b903-c2af-43cb-afef-4f53ce7b0f2a.html">Facebook warns advertisers on Apple privacy&nbsp;changes</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/zuckerberg-apple-monopoly">Mark Zuckerberg Said Apple Has A “Stranglehold” On Your&nbsp;iPhone</a>  <p>3. Because the battle between Facebook and Apple is just starting to heat&nbsp;up.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-00909c64-4f0d-4233-bb83-e8a4f90ef61a.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Facebook and Apple are fighting an increasingly high stakes battle over user privacy and access to the iOS App Store, deepening a rift between two of the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley, Axios’ Scott Rosenberg and I&nbsp;report.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: By trading accusations, Facebook and Apple could just be handing more ammo to critics and regulators — but at the same time, conflict between these giants could be read as a sign of competitive life and a rebuttal to antitrust charges.</blockquote><p>A sign of the&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Our thought bubble: Historically, the big tech companies have maintained power by dominating a key market while competing with one another at the edges. The Apple-Facebook fight shows that they’re now willing to take swings at each other’s core businesses.</blockquote> 3. The thing is, Apple’s approach also bucks the macro trend. More apps want to do&nbsp;more. <p>Consider Discord, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-d2587314-f65c-4cf0-b20f-50ab02564d47.html">via&nbsp;Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Discord began in 2015 as a way for gamers to talk to one another before, during, and after play. Now, the chat company is pursuing a far broader vision: to be the Slack for your non-work&nbsp;life.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: In the age of COVID-19, more than ever before, people need the online equivalent of social spaces like bars, restaurants and&nbsp;stages.</blockquote><blockquote>How it&nbsp;works:</blockquote>  Discord allows people to create their own online community space, to set and enforce rules and decide whether to remain invite-only or open it to the&nbsp;public.  Users can share messages in various channels, chat privately and have group discussions. More recently, the company has added group video&nbsp;chat.  Discord calls each community’s space a “server,” but it’s not a server in the sense of a separate computer controlled by the user. Users can run servers without needing system-administrator knowhow.  This arrangement has pros and cons. It means Discord controls the data and is responsible for complying with law enforcement. But it also means the service can enforce its own code of conduct, handling trust, safety and security.  <p>One way to think about it: all of these various products are really just various combinations of a few core building blocks: identity, messaging, and payments (and groups!).</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/line-launches-digital-asset-wallet-and-blockchain-development-platform">LINE Launches Digital Asset Wallet and Blockchain Development Platform — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/apple-confirms-acquisition-of-vr-startup-spaces-87449f9f-d2b3-4294-a33c-c7377ba90b48.html">Apple confirms acquisition of VR startup&nbsp;Spaces</a>   4. The thing about bringing people together on a platform (through identity, messaging, and payments) is that humans have a tendency to do really amazing things but also some really nasty things. And one of the big takeaways from this latest tech cycle is how we optimize the former and mitigate the&nbsp;latter. <p>A recent battleground has been Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which limits platform liability from user behavior.</p><p>But the days of that laissez-faire approach could be coming to the&nbsp;end.</p><p>AT&amp;T is firing the latest salvo in that movement:</p><blockquote>AT&amp;T will tell the Federal Communications Commission that the agency should craft rules to shrink tech’s longstanding legal shield, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: AT&amp;T is a telecom giant and, since buying Time Warner, a major force in media and entertainment — both industries that have butted heads with Silicon Valley. The company is now launching this fresh attack as tech is under attack in Washington.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: On Monday, AT&amp;T is previewing comments it will make to the FCC Wednesday on reinterpreting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields tech companies from liability over content their users&nbsp;post.</blockquote><blockquote>The company will ask the FCC to modify Section 230 so that tech platforms don’t get such broad immunity.</blockquote><blockquote>It will also argue that Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google should be forced to be more transparent about the decisions they “make on a daily basis,” like how they rank search results and feature news&nbsp;stories.</blockquote><p>Plus <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-825d6da0-1bc2-406c-ba1b-3e246574c5f2.html">the latest from&nbsp;FB</a>:</p><blockquote>After initially taking no action on militia pages organizing an armed counter-protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Facebook said Wednesday that the pages violate a just-enacted policy that imposes stricter limits on QAnon, militia and other extremist groups.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Facebook’s handling of the issue raises fresh questions about its ability and willingness to enforce policies in time to prevent violence rather than after the&nbsp;fact.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/thailand-protests-social-media">How the Battle for Thailand Is Being Fought on Twitter — CoinDesk</a>  Youtube on platform moderation — <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/responsible-policy-enforcement-during-covid-19">Responsible policy enforcement during&nbsp;Covid-19</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/f">/f</a> — <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/post-no-evil">Post No Evil | Radiolab | WNYC&nbsp;Studios</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/greg</a>— <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gun-sellers-use-new-tactic-to-deal-on-facebook-marketplace-11598270872">WSJ News Exclusive | Gun Sellers Use New Tactic to Deal on Facebook Marketplace</a>   5.

It’s no wonder that improving digital literacy and filling digital skills gaps is top of the agenda in many countries, especially in Africa, the youngest and fastest-growing continent where millions of young people are preparing for the future of&nbsp;work.</p><p><a href="http://www.cariboudigital.net">Caribou Digital </a>and <a href="http://www.cenfri.org">Cenfri</a> have been working on various digital skills and upskilling initiatives in Africa, supported by the <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/">Mastercard Foundation</a>. We — Isabelle and Annabel — recently came together to facilitate an online discussion on Youth and Digital Skills for the Future, as part of ODI’s ‘<a href="https://www.odi.org/events/17037-global-consultation-youth-and-digital-technologies-sub-saharan-africa">Youth and Digital Technologies in sub-Saharan Africa</a>’ consultation. Incorporating insights from this session, here we share our thoughts on skills gaps for youth in a digital age: What’s happening? What could be done&nbsp;better?</p> What are digital&nbsp;skills? <p>While some jobs require advanced digital skills, such as cloud computing and data analytics, everyone needs basic digital skills to thrive and survive in a digital economy. To better understand what types of digital skills are needed, Cenfri has developed the following categorizations:</p>  Consumer digital skills are the capabilities that all individuals need to function socially, economically and politically in a digital society: using messaging or social media, making an online purchase, filling in an online application for a passport, navigating a&nbsp;search.  Productive digital skills are the skills that individuals require to apply existing digital technologies for productive purposes: selling goods or services via a digital platform, using programs like Excel or Word for business purposes, and online advertising.  Developer digital skills are the skills required to develop, customize or modify digital technologies and digital infrastructure: coding, data analytics and data science, creating and applying AI and IoT technology, cyber security, network administration.  E-leadership digital skills are the skills required to conceive and execute business models to deliver public or private goods by utilizing digital technologies.  <p>In our ODI session, experts shared their thoughts on the challenges and opportunities of digital skills training. Sarah Boateng, Founder of <a href="https://www.igeaenterprise.org/">IGEA Enterprises</a> asserted that “how to browse the net safely and navigate spam are simple but crucial skills which need to be taught.” Basic, or consumer digital skills are mostly self taught, but usually require someone, a friend or an agent, to demonstrate what to do and share tips on what to look for and what to avoid. Muigai Samuel, the ICT Director for Tharaka Nithi County Government in Kenya, added that, above all, the critical skills for young people are “early introduction to basic computing and access to the internet”.</p> Who’s filling digital skills&nbsp;gaps? <p>The training ecosystem is vast, and youth (by some <a href="https://mastercardfdn.org/strategy/#slide5">definitions this includes those in their mid-thirties</a>) are being upskilled on digital skills, both online and in person, through many different channels. Schools to universities, private learning institutions to NGOs, and employers to peers — each has a role to play. We touch on insights from a few&nbsp;below.</p> Schools <p>Some schools are now teaching digital skills, with some governments trying to make ICT part of the core curriculum. Rwanda has taken this one step further, introducing “smart classrooms” and the one-laptop per child initiative. <a href="https://www.chronicles.rw/2020/01/03/implementation-of-smart-classroom-reaches-over-50-schools-education-ministry/">55% of schools have smart classrooms,</a> but lack of electricity has hampered further progress. In 2017 Kenya launched their <a href="http://icta.go.ke/digischool/about-digischool/">DigiSchool program</a>, and South Africa and Ghana have made ICT compulsory. But this is not without its challenges. Cenfri’s recent study on <a href="https://cenfri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020.06_Skills-for-a-digital-economy.pdf">‘Skills for a Digital Economy</a>’ found that the variability in the quality and supply of ICT teachers, a theoretical rather than practical curriculum, and infrastructure challenges — such as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/03/01/589519475/computer-teacher-with-no-computers-chalks-up-clever-classroom-plan#:~:text=Computer%20Teacher%20With%20No%20Computers%20Chalks%20Up%20Clever%20Classroom%20Plan,-Listen%C2%B7%203%3A08&amp;text=Frimpong%20Innocent-,Owura%20Kwadwo%20Hottish%20illustrates%20a%20window%20of%20Microsoft%20Word%20using,High%20School%20in%20Kumasi%2C%20Ghana.">this Ghanaian ICT class with no computers</a> — hamper these initiatives. Combined with the fact that Africa has the lowest rate of school enrollment and the highest drop-out rate, relying on schools to provide digital skills is beset with problems.</p>DigiSchool Kenya.

However, despite the use of <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/why-covid-crisis-not-edtechs-moment-africa">EdTech doubling in Africa in May</a>, as a response to school closures amid the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption is still low. <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/why-covid-crisis-not-edtechs-moment-africa">One study found</a> that just 19 million out of over 450 million children in Africa are using Edtech, and most of these ‘users’ are consuming it by watching TV.

Given the number of youth who are not in education, training, or formal employment, peer and platform learning is an important resource. During the ODI session, Catherine Fitzgibbon, an independent development consultant working on a project with FSDA, described challenges identified in a project to boost smartphone usage with youth in Kenyan slums, “many youth still want a trainer or facilitator to support them in attaining more nebulous skills such as ‘business’. One comment was that they could not ask questions to the online&nbsp;videos.”</p> The skills gap isn’t just a digital&nbsp;one <p>But we shouldn’t just be thinking about digital skills when preparing youth to thrive in the digital age. According to the IFC (2019), roughly 65% of children entering primary school today will end up working in a job that doesn’t exist yet. Fundamental to job-readiness is continuous learning — the ability to adapt and&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>At Caribou Digital we’ve thought a lot about the range of skills needed for the future of work. In doing so we created a simple ‘<a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/skillsforadigitalage/">Skills for a Digital Age’ framework</a> that outlines a broad set of skills — from digital literacy to financial and soft skills — and a list of suitable and innovative delivery channels that support varying levels of digital access. This dynamic framework can be used across any demographic, in any country, when thinking about the skills needed to access meaningful and fulfilling work.</p>Recruitment platform Jobberman<a href="https://www.transformationalupskilling.org/jobberman"> trains their job seekers in soft skills</a>. Source: Jobberman How can we do&nbsp;better? <p>In addition to thinking beyond just digital skills, a range of other actions could help push the needle on digital skills training across the continent.</p>  Start early: increase and improve teaching of digital skills from primary school. Primary schools have the most inclusive reach for children, especially girls, to be exposed to and build confidence with digital&nbsp;skills.  Adaptive curriculums: build skills for employability, through practical projects, problem solving and presentations. Enabling teachers to introduce new ways of learning the content through “real life” projects can build skills in teamwork, communication and critical thinking.  Exposure to digital businesses: industry-linked e-leadership exposure and training opportunities for rising stars with mentorship. The opportunity to be placed in a digitized company to experience how it operates can provide a fast track for&nbsp;youth.  Enabling environment: access to devices and the cost of data remain a challenge for young people. Community hubs or access points provide a way for youth to get online and learn digital skills with access to a human facilitator to ask questions or seek support from. <a href="https://ajiradigital.go.ke/">Ajira</a> and the <a href="https://www.close-the-gap.org/what-we-do/Digitruck">Digitrucks</a> are some examples of&nbsp;this.  <p>The future of work is exciting, but, in order to thrive in the digital age, individuals need to be equipped with a variety of skills, not all of which are strictly digital. Many channels exist to teach these skills, but certain limiting factors — access to smartphones, electricity, literacy — can hinder even the best laid upskilling plans. We hope that by looking at the bigger picture these skills gaps, digital and otherwise, will start to&nbsp;close.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/how-do-we-develop-work-ready-youth-in-a-digital-age-e0ad006d162d">How do we develop work-ready youth in a digital age?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  The evolution of cybersecurity protection demands a more nuanced response to providing access to a company’s sensitive resources. Policy-based access control (PBAC) combines identity attributes and context variables to enable sophisticated granting of access to corporate systems and protected resources based on centrally managed policies that ensure consistent access control decisions across the enterprise. Advancement in both business requirements and technology (such as growing use of micro-services), require a better way to control access. In a way that is consistent across all silos, dynamic enough to react to change in risk, and provides better control for the application business owners.

					 <p>When the outbreak of COVID-19 started, Michael Corning, the Cryptocosm Architect at <a href="https://www.secours.io/">Secours.io</a>, wanted to build a self-sovereign identity (SSI) based app that would help reopen his local economy in Sisters, Oregon without reopening the pandemic. As we all know, how easy it is to adopt a new technology or software plays a key role in its ultimate success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first version of his app proved to be too complicated and idealistic for businesses and organizations to adopt. He quickly reevaluated his strategy and built a more simplified app, called Safe in Sisters, which was built with adoption in mind. The Q&amp;A below is our interview with him to learn more about the changes he made to create an SSI-based app that was “adoptable”.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What is the Safe in Sisters project? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>After the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state of Oregon and we shuttered shops and public places, here in my little piece of heaven—the city of Sisters—I went to some of my friends at <a href="https://edcoinfo.com/covid-19-central-oregon-business-resources/">Economic Development for Central Oregon</a> and told them how I wanted to reopen the Sisters economy without reopening the pandemic. They both loved the idea. Two of my physicians heard me explain how I was planning to accomplish this mission (I wanted to know how medical providers would react). One doctor was enthusiastic, and the other had an arguable HIPAA-allergic reaction. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Armed with this mix of reactions, I set out to build a set of tools that would provide users with local contact tracing, a COVID symptoms scoring sheet (based on data published by Oregon Health Authority), and verifiable presentations. The verifiable presentations would do something as simple as check a zip code (Sisters had zero COVID cases at the time, but counties nearby glowed purple with the afflicted) or as complicated as checking for a positive COVID test result and two subsequent negative results within a two-week window.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Early on, I realized that writing the code was the easy part. Socializing the protocol and getting people to understand, value, and use the technology would be the hard part.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turns out, I was correct.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Working with my <a href="https://enduringnet.org/">Enduring Net</a> COVID comrades across the pond, we took the prototypes to a large care center in Manchester, England. We showed them all the fancy stuff, and their first response was, “We have six entrances to our facility and handle over 600 people per day. We can’t spend time exchanging QR codes with visitors.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I learned two valuable lessons (actually, I knew the lessons but had never seen their consequences in action quite so starkly): &nbsp;<br><br></p>  My passion for complex solutions usually does not meet with equal user enthusiasm. &nbsp;<br><br>  The second lesson was best taught by Professor Edwin Jaynes in his Probability Theory: The Language of Science. He notes, “The simplest solutions aren’t best because they’re simple. They’re best because simple solutions are more likely to succeed.”&nbsp;  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, I set aside the techno bling, and I started over. I was bound and determined to provide the world with a solution simple enough to succeed. &nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What makes this project unique from some of the other SSI &amp; verifiable credentials projects that are designed to combat the threat of COVID-19?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The first difference is that we focus on local ground conditions. &nbsp;People in Sisters don’t care about COVID prevalence in Manchester. They care about the prevalence at the Sisters High School or the Five Pine Lodge. They don’t care about the prevalence at Heathland Care Center in Manchester, but they care about The Lodge in Sisters care center across the street from the Fika Coffeehouse. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A second difference follows from the first: Local contact tracing is just the first line of defense.&nbsp;If a COVID carrier gets into a room and exposes other healthy people, at least those now at risk know about their invisible condition in time to do something to stop further spread.&nbsp;Once a room has carried a carrier, the room needs to bring out the big guns. The room and its visitors need other tools to access the risk of exposure. This is where symptom tracking and verifiable credentials come into play. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third difference is that we focus on measuring risk. &nbsp;This may turn out to be the most important difference. We understand that a measurement is a set of observations that reduce uncertainty. We don’t guarantee safety; we don’t reduce risk by 100%. But we do use all available data as a set of observations that reduce the uncertainty that plagues us about the virus. Our tools provide users with consistent metrics they can use to make informed decisions about who is safe enough to interact with. No more controversy. No more excuses. No more virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our job as technologists is not to show how cool our technology is. It’s to save lives. It’s to stop the virus in its tracks. My job is to make Sisters the COVID Hotel California—the virus can check-in, but it will never check-out.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Why have you focused on a local contact tracing solution? What is the difference between contact tracing and local contact tracing?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>All politics are local. All battles with the virus are local. Most of those affected by the virus are local. Local contact tracing is far simpler and more reliable than conventional contact tracing. We can control the virus in our town without help from the government or from Apple and Google. We don’t need GPS. We don’t need Bluetooth. But we do need common sense, privacy, and secure messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since local contact tracing is local and not centralized at scale, and since the code and infrastructure is neither complex nor expensive, we expect rapid replication across the planet, not of the virus, but of the tools to kill it.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Can you go into detail of how the Safe in Sisters app works? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Since local contact tracing is a free service, I moved development to my nonprofit counterpart of Secours.io, <a href="http://soteria.id/">the Soteria Institute</a>. The <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">Soteria Local Contact Tracing</a> tool is a Progressive Web App (built with VueJS on the front end and socket.io on the backend). Once you’re on <a href="https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/">https://soterialct.z22.web.core.windows.net/</a>, you can add the app to your phone’s home screen and it looks and acts like a native mobile app. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The app has two views: Room and Visitor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People responsible for a public space manage a Room. Visitors choose that room and check-in when they enter and check-out when they leave. Rooms and Visitors store each of these decisions (to enter a Room or to be allowed to enter a Room) in local storage (IndexedDB) on their phone. Visitors send check-in socket messages to the server, and the server forwards those messages to the Room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a person sends a COVID exposure alert to all the Rooms stored on their phone, the Rooms can pick up the message from the server, list all the Visitors who occupied the room at the same time in the past two weeks, and can send alerts to the server that forwards them on to each of the other Visitors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the simplest scenario, Rooms don’t have to do anything (the alert protocol can be fully automated), and all a Visitor has to do is click a button on the app to log Rooms and another button if they go into quarantine. No QR codes. No room staff overhead. No cost of service.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If that’s still too complicated for people, I’m going into another line of work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Below is a short demo video that shows how the process works:&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How has this project evolved since you first started? What are the obstacles you have run into?   		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>To summarize the evolution of my work:&nbsp;<br><br></p>  The Secours app started as a full-blown application based on Trinsic.&nbsp;  I separated out the simplest capabilities of that original design to focus on local contact tracing using Aries messaging.&nbsp;  I stopped using Aries messaging and refactored LCT with Socket.io (this is the base Service Level Agreement, SLA-0), and I assigned that development to Soteria.&nbsp;  I refactored the Trinsic capabilities into two additional Secours SLAs:  SLA-1 adds personal credentialing and additional risk management tools.  SLA-2 adds COVID test credentials and rich Verifiable Presentations.&nbsp;    I plan to augment Socket.io with more powerful assets like Redis, so I can develop artificial intelligence asserts that will transform my Soteria/Secours-based digital twins into intelligent and helpful digital partners.&nbsp;   
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How has Trinsic helped you along in the process?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic was mission-critical for three reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, making something simple that’s complicated is difficult. Trinsic has met that challenge. Back in the Spring, I was able to get up and running in a few minutes. Trinsic assets are generally well-documented now, and development tools are even simpler than a few months ago. This meant I was able to build my verifiable credential exchange&nbsp;(VCX) prototype in record time. And while I was disappointed that the world wasn’t quite ready for all these new capabilities, it was a forcing function that changed my marketing strategy from push (see how cool this tech is, don’t you want some?) to pull (see how easy it is to do&nbsp;something you couldn’t do before?).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because I built so much in so little time, I was able to set these powerful Trinsic solutions aside and spent one more month getting a simple and stable web socket messaging platform ready for our fist offering: local contact tracing. Having all the rest of the heavy iron waiting in the back room means I can respond immediately to early adopters who quickly needed more power than messaging provides. At each stage of the VCX adoption process, we stay as simple as possible and no simpler. We give our users all the power they need now and no more (until they need it).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, local contact tracing goes global only if thousands of people like me can get their hands on technology that is simple and easy to implement and extend. Trinsic was built on the lowest barrier to entry. All our Trinsic API code is in a public GitHub repo, and we will provide later local contact tracing adopters with training material that will ensure many other communities around the world can stay safe from the virus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I realized something else during this early development phase: As cool as connectionless credentials are, they are not the most important part of the Trinsic platform. Credentials keep your data safe. Verifiable presentations make your data valuable. Trinsic’s implementation of verification policies took all the mystery out of this critical step in VCX; so, again, our users can tell us what they need for verification, and we can respond on the spot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Next time you ask me this question, I may have a third&nbsp;reason to love Trinsic: I suspect verification policies will enable me to implement decentralized semantics with relative ease.&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What stage of development are you in? How big do you see your solution getting, and how do you see it scaling?  		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>I am nearly ready to take the tool back to the UK and see if it is simple enough to be effective. If the app passes acceptance testing, I will recommend a British colleague to fork the GitHub repos (<a href="https://github.com/mcorning/prototyping.git">client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mcorning/socket.io.server.git">server</a>), setup the necessary server assets (static Web App, Ubuntu VM), and take it from there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, I will make it available to my friends and family here in Sisters. And if that works, I will recruit others in Oregon to replicate our success in Sisters.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once my users build muscle memory on Service Level 0, I will continue field testing at SLA-1 and SLA-2. Someday, soon—I hope—I will have the resources to focus on SLA-3: a personal artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If I do my job and our local approach scales effortlessly, then I expect there will be 7 million localities each serving 1,000 users.&nbsp;</p>

					 <p>To my fellow Sisters residents: For our strategy to work, people must care about each other just enough to push two buttons on their phone, maybe three. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a few people in other cities and towns: You can do your part, too. Replicate Safe in Sisters where you live and work. Stop the virus in its tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Together, we can relegate COVID-19 to a display at the Natural History Museum.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And stay safe out there…&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(end of interview)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We, at Trinsic, are currently offering our platform free-of-charge to those working on SSI projects related to COVID-19.

<p>Munich / Leipzig – September 1st, 2020, IDnow, a leading provider of Identity Verification-as-a-Service solutions and Wirecard Communication Services GmbH announce the signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Wirecard Communication Services by IDnow. IDnow will retain the Leipzig location preserving the majority of the 150 employees.</p>
<p>With Wirecard Communication Services, IDnow will focus on providing identity services and continue to build additional capacity for the strong growth of IDnow identification processes. In light of organic growth in digital services as well as the added needs related to restrictons imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, IDnow is experiencing a sharp increase in demand for its digital verification procedures. The acquisition is intended to enhance the service quality of IDnow products and thus further increase the responsiveness for customers and cut waiting times.</p>
<p>Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was established on April 29, 2003, and is part of the Wirecard Group. In a structured investor process, Wirecard Communication Services GmbH was offered for sale by way of an asset deal. IDnow and Wirecard Communication Services have already been working together successfully for more than five years.</p>
<p>At a staff meeting on Monday afternoon, the insolvency administrator, attorney Dr. Nils Freudenberg from Tiefenbacher Insolvency Administration, announced the takeover to the staff of Wirecard Communications Services. The first step will be to provide the employees with appropriate qualifications and to adapt the technical infrastructure. Following this realignment, the Leipzig location will be expanded in a targeted way and integrated into the IDnow processes in order to enable even faster implementation of projects as well as further technical development of the Ident services.</p>

  <p>Even before COVID-19 entered our lexicon, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">privileged access management (PAM)</a> was widely recognized as a foundational <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/cyber-security">cybersecurity technology</a>. In recent years, almost every cyberattack has involved compromised or misused privileges/privileged credentials. Most malware needs privileges to execute and install payload. Once a threat actor has infiltrated an IT network, privileges are typically needed to access resources or compromise additional identities. With privileged credentials and access obtained, a threat actor or piece of malware essentially becomes a malicious “insider”. Outside of PAM, there are few defenses against a rogue insider.</p>
<p>In 2020, the largescale shift to working from home (WFH) imposed by the coronavirus has increased the urgency for maturation of PAM security capabilities. The subsequent increase in BYOD and shadow IT, compound by significantly more reliance on insecure WiFi networks and remote access pathways, has exacerbated many of the thorniest privileged access challenges. It’s also a proven recipe for breaches.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this blog, I will cover the 10 phases, or use cases, of PAM that comprise a complete, holistic privileged access management program. At BeyondTrust, we refer to this as the <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions/universal-privilege-management">Universal Privilege Management model</a>. This approach entails securing every privileged user (human or machine), session, and asset across your IT environment—leaving no privilege undiscovered, unmanaged, or unaudited. The 10 phases can be implemented via the three solutions that comprise a complete PAM platform—privileged password management, endpoint privilege management, and secure remote access.</p>
<p>While organizations most frequently begin with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/privileged-password-management">securing privileged credentials</a> (privileged password management), you can start anywhere, so long as your PAM platform is flexible. With each PAM layer implemented, your organization eliminates and mitigates additional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/new-privileged-attack-vectors-book-q-a-with-author-morey-haber">privileged attack vectors</a>, while realizing new security and operational synergies.</p>
 1. Secure &amp; Audit Privileged Account Credentials 
<p>Gaining control and accountability over privileged accounts—both human and machine—is often the first step organizations take on their PAM journey. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/password-management">Privileged password management solutions</a> can automate the discovery, onboarding, management, and monitoring of the ever-expanding types of human and machine privileged accounts/credential types (privileged user passwords, application passwords, DevOps secrets, SSH keys, certificates, etc.), and bring those accounts/credentials under management within a centralized password safe. This is an important step for preventing or mitigating password re-use attacks and other backdoors (orphaned accounts, etc.) into the IT environment.</p>
 2. Enforce Least Privilege on Desktops (Windows and MacOS) 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-least-privilege">Enforcing least privilege</a> on desktop devices is one of the most powerful ways to reduce <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security risk</a> across the enterprise. <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">Endpoint privilege management solutions</a> can remove local administrative rights and default every user as a standard user. Rather than being enabled, persistent, and always-on, the privileges are only elevated on an as-needed basis and only for the targeted application or process. Limiting both the amount and duration of access condenses both the attack surface and threat window for malicious applications and activity that can abuse privileges.</p>
 3. Apply Least Privilege Across Your Server Environment (Windows, Unix, Linux) 
<p>IT admins often require elevated rights to perform their jobs. Unfortunately, in the wrong hands, high levels of privilege can be abused to inflict considerable damage to an IT environment and exfiltrate data. While sudo can help organizations “get by” in simple environments, it’s not an enterprise-class tool. Sudo suffers from significant security and administration drawbacks. Enterprise-class PAM solutions can enable organizations to efficiently and effectively delegate server privileges without disclosing the passwords for root, local, Active Directory domain, or bridged administrative accounts. Least-privileged, <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/just-in-time-privileged-access-management-jit-pam-the-missing-piece-to-achieving-true-least-privilege-maximum-risk-reduction">just-in-time access</a> should always be enforced, and every privileged session should be closely audited and monitored.</p>
 4. Implement Application Reputation 
<p>PAM solutions should be able to enforce a number of application reputation strategies as part of endpoint privilege management. Some of these include:</p>
 
 Application control capabilities, including allow listing,&nbsp; block listing, and reputation-based listing to restrict applications to only those approved to execute, with the correct privileges, within the appropriate context 
 Applying real-time risk intelligence to inform privilege delegation and elevation decisions 
 Command filtering (on Unix and Linux systems) and PowerShell script management (on Windows systems) 
 <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/how-trusted-application-protection-builds-on-application-control-endpoint-privilege-management">Trusted application protection</a> to add context to the IT process tree to prevent fileless attacks and attacks leveraging trusted applications to perform malicious activities 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Control Remote Access 
<p>Rarely does a cyber attacker operate directly on a resource (such as a stolen laptop). Most attacks start externally via a remote access connection. Typically, these threats initially compromise a remote vendor or employee, then piggyback into an organization’s network. VPNs and other widely used remote access tools lack connection isolation, granular privilege and access controls, and application-based audit capabilities. With the recent, largescale shift to remote work, tools like VPNs and RDP are being stretched way beyond their legitimate use cases, contributing to a surge in targeted attacks and breaches. PAM platforms with <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/solutions#secure-remote-access">privileged remote access capabilities</a> can enforce least-privilege access and session auditing for remote access sessions—for both vendors and employees better than traditional VPN solutions alone.</p>
 6. Extend PAM Best Practices to Network Devices and IoT/IIoT 
<p>Some non-traditional endpoints and edge devices, like IoT, have minimal computing power, which means they may not be candidates for traditional <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/endpoint-security">endpoint security tools</a>, like AV. Additionally, IoT and network devices may have embedded or easy-to-guess credentials, among other design flaws. That’s why it’s critical to extend credential management, least privilege, and other PAM controls to these devices and keep them properly segmented across your environment.</p>
 7. Extend PAM Best Practices to the Cloud and Virtualized Environments 
<p>In addition to suffering from many of the same privileged access weaknesses as on-premise environments, the cloud presents unique use cases, such as hypervisors, cloud management consoles, and APIs. In the cloud, ephemeral privileged accounts and credentials are rapidly instantiated and disposed of when new cloud and virtual instances are spun up and, just as easily, spun down. When managing any privileged account, discovery is the critical first step to gaining control over these assets and the many planes of privileges across cloud environments. Once cloud and virtualized instances and their assets are found, they must be managed to limit exposure, and all session access should be monitored and audited. Simply put, PAM has a substantive role to play when it comes to both <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/cloud-security-best-practices">cloud security</a> and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/api-security-privileged-access-management">API security</a>, regardless of the access and implementation of privileged accounts.</p>
 8. Extend PAM to DevOps and DevSecOps 
<p>DevOps seems to magnify many of the worst PAM challenges due to the heavy emphasis on automation and speed. Common DevOps risks include:</p>
 
 Insecure code and <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/hardcoded-and-embedded-credentials-are-an-it-security-hazard-heres-what-you-need-to-know">hardcoded passwords</a> 
 Scripts or vulnerabilities in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, that could deploy malware or sabotage code 
 Over-provisioning of privileges 
 Sharing of <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/secrets-management">DevOps secrets</a> 
 
<p>While DevOps presents some special use cases, PAM’s role in <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/devops-security-best-practices">DevOps security</a> is comparable to any other environment—managing privileged accounts/credentials (including for CI/for CI/CD tools, service accounts, etc.), enforcing least privilege, etc. It also essential that the PAM solution does not disrupt or delay workflows, but rather enables peak DevOps agility. Securing the accounts, keys, and certificates required for automation is a fundamental part of extending PAM into your development and automation practices.</p>
 9. Integrate PAM and Identity Access Management 
<p><a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-identity-and-access-management-and-why-is-it-a-vital-it-security-layer">Identity and access management (IAM) solutions</a> help IT teams answer, “Who has access to what?” PAM solutions answer the questions of “Is that access appropriate?” and “Is that access being used appropriately?” Complete visibility and accountability over identities requires bi-directional integration of privilege management and IAM solutions. Some PAM solutions also include <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/privilege-management/active-directory-bridge">AD Bridging capabilities</a>, which help further centralize identity management and authentication by providing single sign on across Windows, Unix, Linux, and macOS environments using the same account for simplified access, monitoring, and reporting.</p>
 10. Integrate PAM with Other IT Tools 
<p>PAM + IAM integration is imperative, but your privileged access security workflows and data should also integrate with the rest of your IT and security ecosystem. Gaps in this ecosystem translate into security vulnerabilities and lost productivity. The better your PAM platform integrates (such as with SIEM, ITSM, etc.), the more effective your ability to orchestrate pinpoint responses to problems—or opportunities.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, any security technology that solves a problem, but that does not integrate into the rest of your ecosystem, is a point solution with a finite lifespan. It could be argued that siloed solutions are also a waste of money and resources. Therefore, make sure your PAM investment works with, and integrates with, your overall IT and security ecosystem to best serve your environment.</p>

<p>Last month<a href="https://authenteq.com/short-sweet-and-fully-automated-july-product-update/"> </a>at Authenteq: besides striving to be trustworthy and secure we also strive to be fully automated. As automation is the key to the success last month our product updated focused on automated flagging – since last month instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you. What is more, you can take a glimpse at the verification data with our dashboard quick-view and not waste your precious time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This month our product update is one of the biggest product releases we ever had! Here’s what’s new:</p>



 Let your customers pick up where they left 



<p>At Authenteq we know that the conversion rate is the key metric that you use to calculate your business success and that even small friction can have a high impact on your user satisfaction. To make sure that your customers are always pleased with the onboarding process we’ve added a feature that allows your customer to exit the flow at any point or move the app to the background and not cancel the onboarding flow. This will allow your users to pick up where they left the flow and will provide for a truly frictionless mobile onboarding experience.</p>



 Enhanced security – always&nbsp; 



<p>Our customer dashboard has never been as secure. Now you can facilitate data collection in three different ways and never have to touch the images of the identification documents again. Here are the ways you can facilitate the data collection: mobile SDK, mobile end-point, or a webhook. Read more about it on our API documentation. <br><br>What is more, our team added a small but no less important <a href="https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) for additional security to the customer dashboard. You can enable it by going to the settings section of your company dashboard. Interesting in learning more about how to protect your data and increase your business security?&nbsp; Check out <a href="https://authenteq.com/anti-spoofing-tips-and-tools-to-keep-you-and-your-company-safe-and-secure/">our latest blog</a> on anti-spoofing where we share useful tips.</p>



 Features that will help you onboard customers with international documents 



<p>As part of our continued efforts to provide document support worldwide, we’ve introduced some API changes that will benefit your user onboarding process. We know that personal identification document formats differ across the globe, for example, those with the US or Australian drivers licenses or passports that are being issued by certain Asian countries might have difficulty with verifying their identity.</p>



<p>The main issue was that these documents do not distinguish between the surname and given names field. In order to solve this issue, Authenteq will now pass you the entire field as SurnameandGivenNames. By introducing this change we empower you to cater to a truly secure, frictionless experience to your users.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Want to unleash the power of frictionless verification. Fetch your API keys by starting a <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30-day-trial</a> with us, or <a href="https://cal.services/multi/Authenteq-Demo/-1jva2cQw">have a chat</a> with one of our identity verification and KYC experts. </p>

 Taming the Beast — Refactoring to Empower&nbsp;Teams <p>One day I stumbled onto a ticket from the website team that was open for several days. The ticket was for a simple change, to enable file compression.</p><p>The comments went back and forth. First we would try something, then we would ask someone else to test. Then they would come back and say it didn’t work. This repeated 3 or 4 times until everyone gave&nbsp;up.</p><p>I was confused, the request seemed easy to do. I decided to investigate, and that’s when I found The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Unraveling The&nbsp;Beast <p>To understand The Beast, you need to understand what would happen at the time when you opened onfido.com on your&nbsp;phone.</p><p>A request would first go to Kubernetes, then an nginx server, then a Cloudfront distribution, and finally to an S3&nbsp;bucket!</p>Here was the&nbsp;beast<p>Each step on this chain had a different owner, was in a different project, and had a different release process. Each team had to verify that changes to the website didn’t break their main service. It took time to make&nbsp;changes.</p><p>Not only that, it was also slow. US users had to wait twice as long as European users to see the&nbsp;page.</p> How did it get to&nbsp;this <p>To understand how we got to this beast, we need to go back to when it was just a tiny&nbsp;puppy.</p><p>Many years ago, the website was done in Rails, and its code was part of our platform. And all of this was behind an Nginx instance.</p>Life was simple for the young&nbsp;puppy<p>The developers managed the website, the Rails app handled routing, the Nginx proxy handled requests and caching, and the user saw a&nbsp;website.</p><p>Eventually one Rails app became many Rails apps. Nginx started serving the static assets from a folder. The puppy’s fur grew and nobody was there to trim&nbsp;it.</p><p>A couple more years and the website became separate, so the marketing team could own it. But because all the paths were intrinsically linked, it continued to be served by&nbsp;Nginx.</p><p>A bit more time and Kubernetes was added to the mix, and all of this was moved inside&nbsp;it.</p><p>The puppy’s fur grew and grew, and nobody gave it a trim. The puppy grew to become The&nbsp;Beast.</p> Taming The&nbsp;Beast <p>So how do you go towards taming The&nbsp;Beast?</p><p>We had to understand how that devilish Nginx configuration came to be. We had to understand what we had to keep, what we could rearrange and what we could throw away. We wanted to understand what the user workflows were.</p><p>So we talked with teams to see what they knew about this beast and evaluated the access logs for the website. With that precious information in mind, we were able to propose a new architecture that removed the website out of the way of other&nbsp;teams.</p><p>In this new architecture, we start with a Cloudfront distribution, this distribution has one single goal, to see what goes towards the website and what goes towards Kubernetes.</p>Proposed taming of The&nbsp;Beast<p>With this new architecture designed and the approval of all the teams, we prepared our new test environment. We made it match the behaviour of the real website as much as possible.</p><p>With a few days of trials, we got confidence that we could proceed. We did a dark launch of production only in our office network. Teams did their final end-to-end tests. Minor hiccups were fixed and we got ready for the big&nbsp;switch.</p> Launch Day <p>It was early morning, the release scheduled to happen in just a few hours. There was some tension. This could have a large impact, both on our image as well as for our&nbsp;clients.</p><p>All internal stakeholders were gathered, rollout procedures were ready and rollback procedures were prepared in case of a disaster. Eyes all on the various graphs and monitors. The pull request had one single change, onfido.com stopped pointing to the Load Balancer and would instead point to CloudFront.</p><p>The commit was merged, the CI ran and the changes were&nbsp;applied.</p><p>We waited.</p><p>No alarms were sounded. All services were normal. The website looked exactly the same. Nobody had noticed the&nbsp;change.</p><p>Exactly as intended.</p> Results <p>So, visually it looked the same. What&nbsp;changed?</p><p>First, we finally could fix that ticket from the start. And not having to go all the way to Europe on every request made the average page loads in the United States go from 5.59 seconds to 2.01&nbsp;seconds.</p>Page load times from the weeks before and after the switch, even depending on the internet connection of the person the load times fell by over a second worldwide<p>But even if all of these metrics continued the same, the changes would have been worth it. They enabled our website team to act independently.</p><p>With the smaller and self-contained code base, the team was able to own it. They went from opening tickets to change something to opening pull requests themselves. The devops team has less load and the website team can change things fearlessly.</p> Key Takeaways <p>When faced with a large scary beast, the first instinct is to run! But that beast will not go away! It will terrify everyone who passes by and any change will take an eternity to&nbsp;do.</p><p>The proper action is to be fearless and tame the beast! When it is no more than a harmless puppy, teams will be more confident to make changes and will act&nbsp;quicker.</p><p>It’s a win-win for everyone, and all it needs is that initial push for&nbsp;change!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/taming-the-beast-refactoring-to-empower-teams-8957a7df969b">Taming The Beast — Refactoring to empower teams</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Privileged accounts have traditionally been given to administrators to access critical data and applications.

Erik Westra, Technical Architect<p>We have a fun one for you—the inaugural interview of our new Meet the Team series of employee profiles.</p><p>Meet the Team is an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>As a remote company with employees around the world—from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand—it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little better (especially with current travel restrictions).</p><p>Today, we’re introducing Erik Westra, technical architect at GlobaliD, head of GlobaliD Labs, and avid&nbsp;cyclist.</p><p>Not only is Erik working on a ton of super cool projects here at GlobaliD, he also has a unique perspective given his decades-long relationship with our co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd, which, as you’d expect, involves plenty of crazy adventures.</p><p>During our chat, Erik covered a range of&nbsp;topics:</p>  How GlobaliD Labs came to&nbsp;be  Some of the cool projects Labs is working on right&nbsp;now  How Erik met Greg back in the ’80s (spoiler alert: payments data, an insane bike ride, and hypothermia)  Their first company together (which went public on the NASDAQ and had over 6000 employees)  How a young Jack Dorsey hacked into their&nbsp;systems  The time Erik saved both their lives (and the essence of their relationship)  Standing up for their values and being sued for $13&nbsp;trillion  Coming full circle and the birth of GlobaliD (and&nbsp;Groups!)   1. Who are you and what do you do at GlobaliD? <p>My name’s Erik! I’m head of GlobaliD Labs, which is responsible for the experimental aspects of what we’re trying to build. My job involves designing systems, writing proof of concepts, and managing the Labs team. We’re always trying to push the envelope.</p><p>GlobaliD Labs exists because the current way we build our system has to be relatively structured to ensure quality code and security — everything needs to work and run smoothly. Like other startups, we employ agile frameworks for development, but we need to balance that with long term planning.</p><p>That has huge benefits for the quality of our core product, but sometimes this structured approach can crowd out more experimental ideas.</p><p>I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD Groups. It’s a feature that’s been central to our long term vision from day one, but for one reason or another, we weren’t able to get it into a production environment. Something else always required higher priority when it came to the core business.</p><blockquote>“I like to call myself the unofficial champion of GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups.”</blockquote><p>Even though Groups had a long term upside for us — especially when it came to our vision and our mission — we never had time to develop&nbsp;it.</p><p>That’s when we decided to spin it off and create GlobaliD Labs, which helps bring balance between our short term development needs with our long term aspirations. Now, we have a separate team dedicated to Groups that’s also exploring other cool&nbsp;ideas.</p> 2. What kind of cool&nbsp;ideas? <p>We believe that Groups should be able to issue credentials to people. You might get a license to ride a particular mountain bike trail — one of Greg’s favorite things, being a mountain biker. You might get a ticket to a Zoom concert. Or you might get a credential for receiving a&nbsp;vaccine.</p><p>It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — connecting directly with employees and customers, matching up seekers and providers of goods and services, managing bookings, sending and receiving payments, and of course marketing and promotions — all done through the GlobaliD platform.</p><blockquote>“It’s an open platform so people can come up with their own ideas on how to use it. You could even set up a group and run your business through it — all done through the GlobaliD platform.”</blockquote><p>Another project we’ve been investing time into is email — what I call the email anonymizer, an idea I find quite&nbsp;cool.</p><p>One of the problems today is that whenever you sign up for anything online, you need to provide your email. Do this enough times and your inbox is now full of spam. You’ve essentially lost control of your email address. With the email anonymizer, you can set up a one-time address. That way, you never reveal your private email. You stay in control of your&nbsp;email.</p><p>Let’s say you want to sign up for Amazon and they ask for your email. Now, you can create an anonymous address just for Amazon. If you choose to receive those messages, emails sent by Amazon will go to your private address. If you decide that you don’t want to deal with Amazon anymore, you can simply disable the address. Privacy is a fundamental tenet of our company, and this is another way of keeping your identity&nbsp;private.</p><p>It’s little things like this that I find quite cool. If both sides are using the anonymizer, you can actually have both parties communicate back and forth without either party knowing the other’s real&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s just one of the things we’re working on right now. At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat. Maybe they don’t work technically or there’s no business need for it. We’ll learn from those lessons. We’re the mad scientists at GlobaliD.</p><blockquote>“At Labs, we go in a lot of odd directions; there’s a lot of exploration. For every idea that does work out, there will be plenty that fall flat. Maybe they don’t work technically or there’s no business need for it. We’ll learn from those lessons. We’re the mad scientists at GlobaliD.”</blockquote> 3. How did you end up in this&nbsp;role? <p>I met Greg [GlobaliD co-founder and CEO] around 1980 when I was still a young man — a very, very long time ago. I was studying computer science and psychology at university in New Zealand. I was really into human-computer interaction.</p><p>Greg came to New Zealand to restructure the banking industry. I was taking a part-time course in the evenings at the polytechnic at the time and word came around that people were looking for students to help with data analysis as a part-time job. I put my hand&nbsp;up.</p><p>It was a company called Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton — where Greg was working at the time. They were management consultants working with Data Bank of New Zealand, a centralized check processing company, to help make their operations more efficient. My job was to analyze data using Excel macros, and the results would be displayed in various charts. Excel charts didn’t look professional enough for the presentations they wanted, so we had to draw them by hand in&nbsp;MacDraw.</p><p>One day, I was at my desk, busily drawing one of these charts when Greg walks by and notices my bike pump sticking out of my&nbsp;bag.</p><p>“Oh, you ride a bike?” he asked. It was more of a statement, really. “We’ll go for a ride this weekend. I’ll pick you&nbsp;up.”</p><p>“Okay, cool!”</p><p>Or so I thought. I figured it would probably be a three or four hour ride. After all, all we had were our road bikes — real, old-school technology. No&nbsp;problem.</p><p>But then Greg got this idea. “Oh, look. There’s this route — it goes over this hill and goes all the way out to the coast. This looks pretty cool. We’ll go that&nbsp;way.”</p><p>And so off we&nbsp;go.</p><p>That hill ended up being a rather large mountain — mostly rock with severe slopes. You can imagine us going up and down, up and down on these narrow-tired road bikes with our big clunky shoes with cleats on the bottom. I suffered something like six flats going over that mountain&nbsp;range.</p><p>Oh yeah, it was mid&nbsp;winter.</p><p>By the time we got to the other side of the coastline, it was dusk, and we still had another 70 kilometers to ride back to the car — the only silver lining being that it was on the road&nbsp;again.</p><p>But it was dark, and I was getting really cold. At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the&nbsp;car.</p><p>In all, it was a 13-hour bike ride. It was absolutely insane.</p><p>That’s how we met each other for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>We’ve been doing crazy things together ever&nbsp;since.</p><blockquote>“At one point, I became hypothermic and I had to lie in a ditch by the side of the road while Greg rode back himself to get the car. In all, it was a 13-hour bike ride. It was absolutely insane. That’s how we met each other for the first time. We’ve been doing crazy things together ever&nbsp;since.”</blockquote> 4. On the beginning of a lifelong partnership <p>Around 1986, Greg called me. “Hey, can you come meet me? I want you to see something.”</p><p>I met him at this really old, dingy building in downtown Wellington, New Zealand. People are running in and out with their bicycles. What are these guys doing, I’m wondering to&nbsp;myself.</p><p>Apparently, it was an urgent messenger delivery company. The guys running around with bikes were delivering parcels.</p><p>“Come look at this,” Greg said. We went up the stairs. “Open this door — that’s where we’re going. But be careful. If the wind blows, we’re in real trouble.”</p><p>We sneak in and shut the door behind us. On two wooden supports is this door covered with hundreds of bits of&nbsp;paper.</p><p>That’s how they kept track of all the&nbsp;parcels.</p><p>Their service could guarantee delivery within 15 minutes from the time of your call — super efficient. For a while, we just stood there and watched it&nbsp;work.</p><p>Then Greg looked over at me. “Can you build a computer program that does&nbsp;that?”</p><p>That was our first business together. It took us about eight years to build it. But it was very successful. Eventually, it made it to the U.S., and we actually wound up being listed on the NASDAQ. We had about 6,000 employees at one stage. The company was called DMS corporation — Dispatch Management Services.</p><blockquote>“That was our first business together.

We had about 6,000 employees at one stage. The company was called DMS corporation — Dispatch Management Services.”</blockquote><p>We were really lucky. It was our first try at building something together and it succeeded.</p> 5. On Jack Dorsey hacking into their&nbsp;system <p>We ultimately left DMS and explored various other ventures together. I want to tell you about one because it’s kind of interesting.</p><p>We were building a system for last-mile ecommerce delivery. You could order online, and someone would pick it up from the depot and bring it to you within an hour. We needed an admin interface that had to be access-controlled. “Let’s do something quick! Just hardwire it into the code,” Greg said — which was typical for him at the time. Everything was about speed and minimum viable products. So that’s what we&nbsp;did.</p><p>Of course, someone broke in and sent Greg a message: “Your security&nbsp;sucks.”</p><p>That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.</p><blockquote>“Of course, someone broke [into our system] and sent Greg a message: ‘Your security sucks.’ That someone was Jack&nbsp;Dorsey.”</blockquote><p>Greg decided to hire him and we worked together for a while before he went off and founded&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>It was my fault that Jack broke in. In my defense, it’s what Greg told me to do. We’ve taken our security a bit more seriously since then&nbsp;:)</p> 6. I certainly hope so! What’s it like working with&nbsp;Greg? <p>That’s been the essence of our relationship.</p><p>Greg lived in New Zealand for about six years — if I remember correctly.</p><p>“We should go for a hike in the mountains,” he said one&nbsp;day.</p><p>So off we&nbsp;went.</p><p>Along the way, we reached the Broken Axe Pinnacles. The name speaks for itself — it’s pretty insane, this narrow little ledge with maybe a thousand-foot drop on either side plus strong winds. We were creeping along this sliver of a ledge when suddenly it started sloping downhill, steeper and&nbsp;steeper.</p><p>“Come on, we gotta get down there!” Greg&nbsp;said.</p><p>“Hang on a minute, Greg. Let’s just wait and&nbsp;check.”</p><p>We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.</p><blockquote>“We stopped for a moment to check the compass and the map. Sure enough, that path dropped off into a cliff. Had we kept going, we wouldn’t have been able to get back up. We could have died up&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><p>That’s one way to view our working relationship — we’ve been working as a team for many years. There’s always a lot of back and forth. Greg would come up with all these mad ideas, and I’d figure out how to make them&nbsp;work.</p><p>It’s been like that ever since we&nbsp;met.</p> 7. Public information should be&nbsp;free <p>We’ve had a number of crazy adventures together. Another one of the companies we worked on, 3Taps, was sued by Craigslist for the nice sum of $13 trillion — an insane, arbitrary number.</p><p>[3Taps was an exchange company dedicated to keeping public facts publicly accessible — which included Craigslist listings.]</p><p>Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.</p><blockquote>“Greg was steadfast — he believed that public information should be free. If the information is freely available, it should be available to everybody. You can’t make it available to some people and not to&nbsp;others.”</blockquote><p>[Greg was an executive producer of and contributor to the Aaron Schwartz documentary — <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3268458/">The Internet’s Own Boy: The Story of Aaron&nbsp;Swartz</a>.]</p><p>He fought the case, which went on for several years. It got pretty ugly and I wondered if we’d lose everything. Eventually, they reached a settlement, which Greg saw as a victory. He agreed to pay out $1 million — except to the charity of his choice, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>After that saga, we were in a little bit of a&nbsp;lull.</p><p>Then out of the blue, Greg invited me to join him in Ljubljana, Slovenia. You can guess where this is&nbsp;going.</p> 8. “The early days of GlobaliD” <p>This was the early days of GlobaliD — the company had only been up and running for a couple of&nbsp;months.</p><p>We were there for two weeks, discussing the possibilities of a self-sovereign identity platform complemented with messaging and a&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>We came up with this notion of Groups. Having your digital identity is great. Here’s my phone, my wallet — my identity. I’m an individual. I can do what I need to do. But it’s when you have collections of people working together — there’s an emergent quality that’s greater than the sum of our&nbsp;parts.</p><blockquote>“We came up with this notion of Groups.

But it’s when you have collections of people working together — there’s an emergent quality that’s greater than the sum of our&nbsp;parts.”</blockquote><p>That’s where Groups comes into play. It’s this notion that you can do a lot more with people together than with people individually.</p><p>I wrote a bunch of white papers outlining how Groups should work, but it took another three years to get the foundation in place. This is where GlobaliD Labs came&nbsp;in.</p><p>I’m going to paraphrase Greg here, but once you put together the three different pieces, identity, messaging, and money — and now with Groups — magic&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Most people in our company are relatively young. Greg and I — we’re not spring chickens anymore. We’ve worked on a number of projects over the years. With GlobaliD, we just thought, “Let’s do this.” It’s our last big chance to do something amazing.</p><p>This isn’t a job. This is a mission. We are absolutely one thousand percent dedicated to making this&nbsp;succeed.</p><p>You might also&nbsp;like:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-groups-multi-person-chat-and-vouches-6f391ce3ea50">GlobaliD App — Introducing Groups, Vouches, and multi-person chat</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-messaging-is-end-to-end-encrypted-by-default-9c5d5e7d199d">GlobaliD messaging is end-to-end encrypted by&nbsp;default</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-the-wallet-87870843dc1b">GlobaliD App — Introducing the&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-app-introducing-sepa-and-crypto-transfers-to-your-wallet-6147deb5f6cd">GlobaliD App: Introducing SEPA and crypto transfers to your&nbsp;Wallet</a>  <p>Join a growing trusted community and experience how digital identity works for&nbsp;you.</p><a href="http://link.global.id/invite"></a> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-erik-westra-head-of-globalid-labs-57fe63b5f1ba">Meet the Team—Erik Westra, head of GlobaliD Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   When organizations modernize their Identity and Access Management (IAM), they have three fundamental requirements: an understanding of current capabilities, a migration strategy to transform the IAM infrastructure and finally, the staff with the expertise to execute the plan. The challenges on the way from legacy IAM to a modern IAM infrastructure are manifold and should be considered beforehand.

 The GiD Report#124 — Fortnite’s philosophical crusade for a more open, interoperable future <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-123-balkanization-and-what-that-means-for-the-future-of-the-internet-4fb493177e38">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Epic and all the other huge companies fighting Apple (now a $2 trillion&nbsp;company)  This isn’t Epic’s first rodeo — like the time they took on Valve (and everyone won — including Valve)  Epic’s founder Tim Sweeney has been criticizing tech monopolies for years. Why he believes the future will be less centralized/closed and more distributed/open/interoperable.  Tim Sweeney’s also a fan of blockchain.  Greg on Occulus: “The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.”  This week on TikTok/WeChat (spoiler: this is what Facebook has been lobbying&nbsp;for)  A new era of the Federal&nbsp;Reserve  Race for central bank digital currencies heats&nbsp;up  Stuff happens   1. What’s really remarkable about the moment we’re in is just how suddenly the tides can shift — economically, culturally, and technologically. It speaks to where we are in the cycle. I’m, of course, talking about Apple, and what began as a trickle, the backlash against the App Store now feels like a&nbsp;tsunami. <p>Axios:</p><blockquote>A steady drip of criticism over Apple’s App Store policies has become a torrent, as even other tech giants feel emboldened to pile on — but Apple’s path to satisfying its critics is uncertain.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Apple’s policies aren’t that different from those governing other digital marketplaces, but its size and inflexibility could fuel regulatory action from antitrust authorities in the U.S. and&nbsp;beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: The criticisms of the App Store are many and varied, but most revolve around the 30% cut that Apple takes on sales of apps and other digital goods, with very limited workarounds.</blockquote><blockquote>Driving the news: Microsoft Sunday became the latest company to take aim at Apple, warning in a court filing that a move to restrict Epic Games’ access to developer tools could impact lots of games from other developers that rely on Epic’s Unreal game&nbsp;engine.</blockquote><p>Hey, a new email app from the creators of Basecamp, should get some credit for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">sparking the latest wave of&nbsp;protest</a>.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve seen that story before — some small fry developer complaining about big ‘ol Apple and their tyrannical policies. But Apple always seemed untouchable. They would ignore the criticism and continue on their merry way, never conceding any&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Moreover, Apple had some fair arguments in their defense. After all, in building the App Store from scratch, Apple created a new paradigm, unleashing immense value to the ecosystem. It made sense that Apple took a cut — they deserved credit for their work. It also made sense that they’d moderate the App Store — in itself a way to create more value in a safe, curated environment.</p><p>And as it created value for the ecosystem, it also created tremendous value for Apple, <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-50f38776-84cb-42f5-bcf9-9bffaa476b2c.html">which just hit a market cap of $2 trillion</a>:</p><p>Apple made Wall Street history when its 2020 stock surge pushed its market value over $2 trillion, a first for a U.S. company, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>“While it took Apple 38 years to reach its first $1 trillion in value, the next trillion only took two&nbsp;years.”</p><p>Apple shares have more than doubled since&nbsp;March.</p><p>Crazy stat: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, account for 23% of the S&amp;P 500’s entire&nbsp;value.</p><p>Saudi Aramco in December became the world’s first company worth $2 trillion, but now trails Apple at $1.8 trillion.</p><p>As Apple has grown, so has the App Store and the nature of our relationship with our apps. Apps do a lot more now. Our expectations for what we want them to do has also grown. You could argue that Apple’s model for how it manages and charges for the App Store hasn’t evolved with the&nbsp;times.</p><p>Instead, most of their decisions seem to leverage their position, expanding power over the ecosystem across more touchpoints, demanding control of essential features and services such as identity and payments.</p><p>So it was only a matter of time before companies got tired of paying these exorbitant companies to the most valuable company on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Because small fries, these are&nbsp;not:</p><blockquote>Epic itself, locked in a battle over the 30% commission, which wants a court to restore Fortnite to the App Store and stop Apple from cutting off its developer access.

(Apple clarified its position and apologized for any confusion over the weekend.)</blockquote><blockquote>Plus, a group of news publishers asking for better App Store terms; Facebook, which suggests Apple’s terms will hurt small businesses; and Airbnb, which reportedly talked with House antitrust enforcers after Apple asked for a commission on Airbnb’s recently launched online experiences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Spotify, for instance, says Apple gives itself a competitive edge by keeping all Apple Music subscription revenue while eating into that generated by other streaming services. EU antitrust regulators are now probing the App Store, in part due to Spotify’s complaints.</blockquote><blockquote>Match Group says Apple puts paid services at a disadvantage against ad-funded rivals that don’t have to give Apple a cut of their&nbsp;revenue.</blockquote><p>For what it’s worth, here’s Apple’s take on the situation, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">via Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>During the Congressional hearings over the market power of large technology firms, Apple CEO Tim Cook insisted that Apple had little market power over mobile apps, because developers and consumers could always switch over to different types of phones or platforms on which to create software. Epic’s attempt to restructure terms with Apple is a great test case for Cook’s argument. One would expect, based on Cook’s views, that developers of popular apps have leverage against Apple, if Apple had little market power over app stores. Certainly, Epic’s Fortnite is popular, a massive multi-billion dollar game, as close to a must-have app as possible.</blockquote><p>The problem, of course, is that I don’t want to give up my iPhone, and Apple knows this. Moreover, Google’s Play Store has more or less copied Apple’s model regarding commission and payment&nbsp;options.</p><p>So it’s a sticky situation for developers and users alike. They don’t really have much in the way of options. (Epic has a parallel suit with&nbsp;Google):</p><blockquote>Yes, but: Apple’s rules are slightly stricter, but not all that different from those on other digital marketplaces, including those run by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.</blockquote><p>The primary difference between iOS and Android, however, is that Epic is still able to provide their app directly to its users, bypassing the Play&nbsp;Store.</p><p>Still, this will likely be one for the regulators:</p><blockquote>The bottom line: Expect these arguments to come from more companies in more settings, with courts and regulators likely having to decide if there’s an antitrust problem at&nbsp;play.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21258214.130991/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9lZjU1OWI3ZTEyMjhiNjViNzM0YTRmNWFiNzg3NzU5ZT91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2FtJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcBe05717eb">Apple reaches $2 trillion market value as tech fortunes&nbsp;soar</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-china-loopholes-are-starting-to-close">Apple’s China Loopholes Are Starting to&nbsp;Close</a>  <a href="https://nl.nytimes.com/f/newsletter/z8sG5UERte1Rmyb1myHo1w~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRhH5XqP0TgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOC8xOS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2JpZy10ZWNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLWRvbWluYXRpb24uaHRtbD9jYW1wYWlnbl9pZD00JmVtYz1lZGl0X2RrXzIwMjAwODE5Jmluc3RhbmNlX2lkPTIxNDEwJm5sPWRlYWxib29rJnJlZ2lfaWQ9NjI5NjUzNTUmc2VnbWVudF9pZD0zNjUwMSZ0ZT0xJnVzZXJfaWQ9NzZlMDdlNjBiNDkyZTNjOTY4MGUwYzM1OTcwZGM5ZWZXA255dEIKABzqED1f10sDB1ISYWxlY3hsaXVAZ21haWwuY29tWAQAAAAA">Big Tech’s Domination of Business Reaches New&nbsp;Heights</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-political-censorship-poll-6bd4fbaf-43a9-49ac-8e20-48b07f5af38c.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Most Americans think social media platforms censor political viewpoints</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">@FortniteGame</a> 2. We can’t talk about the App Store controversy without talking about Epic Games, which is a super cool story in and of itself. First off, it’s not their first rodeo. They also took on Valve, which owns the Steam gaming platform. <p>For those who aren’t familiar with the gaming space, Steam is <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">essentially the Apple App Store of&nbsp;games</a>:</p><blockquote>Countless challengers had tried and failed to overcome Valve’s primacy. Many carved niches for themselves, like GOG with DRM-free and classic games. But for the biggest PC releases? Why buy elsewhere if you already owned a few dozen (or few hundred) games through Steam? You wouldn’t.</blockquote><p>Did Epic care? Not much so. They went after Valve with the same kind of swagger that they’re swinging around to take on&nbsp;Apple.</p><p>One interesting takeaway — without getting too much into the landscape of gaming — is that many believed that this was actually beneficial to Steam over the last two years. Funny how healthy competition works,&nbsp;huh?</p><blockquote>A year ago, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3326060/epic-games-store-steam-rival-valve.html">I wrote these words</a>: “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be scared.” And for good reason: The Epic Games Store debuted December 6, 2018 and upended the PC gaming market. Valve, once unassailable, suddenly seemed very vulnerable. Flush with Fortnite money, Epic provided the first real competition to Steam since its inception 15 years prior. What company wouldn’t&nbsp;worry?</blockquote><blockquote>If I could amend that headline now though, I’d instead write “Epic Games is creating a Steam rival and Valve should be grateful.”</blockquote><p>We can talk about the results a little bit, though — and you’ll soon see why. Here’s <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">Matt&nbsp;Stoller</a>:</p><blockquote>I suspect that a legal approach was not what Epic wanted to do. Epic has experience using the marketplace to address monopoly power; a few years ago, Epic took on Valve, which owned a monopoly game store, Steam, by launching its rival Epic Games Store. And Epic has used Fortnite’s draw to force interoperability among PC, Mac, Xbox One, PS4 and mobile platforms.</blockquote><p>It’s easy to get why this would be huge for users (gamers). Why was it great for Valve? Well, it forced them to up their game — literally. No longer able to rely on their platform dominance, they decided to improve their actual products. And they did exactly that. Steam, despite aggressive competition from Epic, is now better than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>Talk about a win-win-win situation. Goliath won, but so did David. And then users reaped the benefits.</p><p>But Epic’s battle with Apple will be fundamentally different in nature simply because of Apple’s complete dominance in their arena. It’s why Epic has taken the legal route — a strategy Greg has discussed and taken&nbsp;himself:</p><blockquote>But because Apple’s monopoly power over the iPhone is so total, Epic chose to use the legal and political system to make an aggressive set of claims that, if accepted by a judge, would essentially destroy Apple’s control over the app ecosystem on the&nbsp;iPhone.</blockquote><p>And according to Matt, Epic has a strong case (as well as a legendary attack&nbsp;dog):</p><blockquote>These claims include the argument that Apple has tied its payments system to its app store, which is a fairly strong legal argument that judges have often (though not always) upheld. It also included an argument that the app store is what is called an ‘essential facility,’ and that Apple as a monopolist in control of such a facility has to share it with competitors or customers on reasonable terms. Judges have generally not upheld this kind of claim. So Epic is not only trying to take its dispute with Apple to the courts, it is also seeking to overturn court precedent, and encourage Congress to write statute overturning judge-made law.</blockquote><blockquote>As its head lawyer, Epic hired antitrust royalty, Christine Varney, who served as the Assistant Antitrust Attorney General under Obama, and before that worked for Netscape during the Microsoft battle in the 1990s. The suit draws heavily from the House Antitrust Subcommittee investigation and hearing, with multiple footnotes citing information unearthed by investigators, as well as a quote from Rep. Hank&nbsp;Johnson.</blockquote><p>Let’s be clear, Epic is certainly on the attack. And as Matt notes, these are indeed peculiar&nbsp;times:</p><blockquote>Typically large businesses reserve their political capital to limit government enforcers or regulators, but something strange started happening a few years ago, and it’s continuing today with this suit. Businesses began battling each other, and some started asking for an expansion of public power to structure markets. This suit is the latest on that score, the escalation of an ideological civil war within the business world, an attempt to undo deep changes in our society implemented forty years&nbsp;ago.</blockquote><p>Hard to take your eyes off this one. Grab some&nbsp;popcorn.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/epic-games-kicks-off-the-civil-war">Epic Games Kicks Off the Civil War in American&nbsp;Business</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/epic-games-seeks-to-form-coalition-of-apple-critics">Epic Games Seeks to Form Coalition of Apple&nbsp;Critics</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnite-creator-says-apple-threatening-to-restrict-access-to-software-tools-11597697909">‘Fortnite’ Creator Says Apple Is Threatening to Curb Access to Software&nbsp;Tools</a>   3. We also can’t talk about Epic without talking about its founder, Tim Sweeney. Because for Tim, this isn’t simply a battle for money — although it clearly is. But Tim is waging a philosophical crusade in order to create a digital world that’s less closed and centralized and more distributed and open and interoperable. (Sound familiar?) <p>Here are some highlights from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/30/game-boss-interview-epics-tim-sweeney-on-blockchain-digital-humans-and-fortnite/">a fantastic VentureBeat interview</a>:</p><blockquote>We talked about his vision for the Metaverse, the virtual world envisioned by Neal Stephenson in his 1997 novel Snow Crash. Sweeney thinks it’s possible to build such a world and the digital economy that goes with it, but he believes it shouldn’t be owned by a single company. He has been outspoken about ensuring openness in gaming in the past couple of&nbsp;years.</blockquote><p>For one, he’s an outspoken critic of tech monopolists (which incidentally, came after a deep chat about blockchain and&nbsp;crypto):</p><blockquote>GamesBeat: It’s a tool to pull power away from centralized authority, which is something you’ve worried about. Platform owners have proprietary technology.</blockquote><blockquote>Sweeney: And they use it to exert arbitrary control. They tilt the market in their favor. They censor people whose political views they disagree with. It’s a big and growing problem, the amount of power possessed by Google and Facebook. President Eisenhower said it about the military-industrial complex. They pose a grave threat to our democracy.</blockquote><p>He talks about games and virtual worlds like we talk about GlobaliD&nbsp;Groups:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There’s real value in that. If you look at why people are paid to do things, it’s because they’re creating a good or delivering a service that’s valuable to somebody. There’s just as much potential for that in these virtual environments as there is in the real world. If, by playing a game or doing something in a virtual world, you’re making someone else’s life better, then you can be paid for&nbsp;that.</blockquote><blockquote>We need to start rethinking the way we structure these large-scale game economies, especially as they get bigger and more complex. They should not simply be a means for the developer to suck money out of the users. It should be a bi-directional thing where users participate. Some pay, some sell, some buy, and there’s a real&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>If you look at what Valve has done with CS: GO and other games, they have a vibrant economy. Lots of people earn a living in those games. When you buy something, you’re not just buying it from Valve. You’re often buying it on an open marketplace from some other seller. It’s a very complex economy. There’s a lot of potential in that. We need to move toward a model like that in order to scale up to something like the metaverse. As long as it’s just the machination of a single company, there’s not going to be this bidirectional exchange of value. We need to keep that circulating.</blockquote><p>He believes we’re on the cusp of a new chapter for our digital world — one that’s less centralized closed and increasingly distributed and&nbsp;open:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: It’s really popular. That’s not even a closed economy. You’re not actually getting any incremental value for these tips. Imagine if you actually got additional benefits for doing that — recognition or power or something like that. I think that could go much further than it’s gone&nbsp;before.</blockquote><blockquote>These technology revolutions come in waves. The social network could have developed 10 years earlier than it did. You just needed a generation of people that were okay with putting all their personal information into these services. The limiting factor wasn’t technology. It was social expectations.</blockquote><blockquote>Now we’re approaching 10 years of the blockchain. As these technologies become more widely accepted, we’ll see a whole new generation of distributed systems, which really changes the game — away from closed to open. Instead of building a business that extracts money from a service, you build an economy in which everybody can be rewarded for participating in many different ways.</blockquote><p>Tim’s been talking about this stuff for years. He’s been in the industries for decades — started programming BASIC on an IBM PC at the age of&nbsp;11.</p><p>What’s super cool, though, is that he’s putting his money where his mouth is. He’s on the frontlines, battling for a digital world that he truly believes&nbsp;in.</p> 4. BONUS: What Tim Sweeney thinks about blockchain stuff. <p>Let’s just say, he’s a&nbsp;fan:</p><blockquote>Sweeney: There are some incredibly powerful ideas there. I feel like they’ve only begun to be developed. There’s Bitcoin, but the more interesting one is Ethereum, which runs general programs in the blockchain. Instead of mining coins by verifying transactions, miners are running programs specified in the blockchain and computing the results of those. They can be anything from programs to effect a single transaction, exchanging money for a good, or they can be entire distributed autonomous organizations that execute governance rules designed by shareholders and can be extended over time by majority vote. You can implement these arbitrarily complex&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>You come to the realization that the blockchain is really a general mechanism for running programs, storing data, and verifiably carrying out transactions. It’s a superset of everything that exists in computing. We’ll eventually come to look at it as a computer that’s distributed and runs a billion times faster than the computer we have on our desktops, because it’s the combination of everyone’s computer.</blockquote><p>5. Digital worlds, digital identities. Facebook is merging Oculus identity with Facebook’s.</p><p><a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>:</p><blockquote>The Oculus move (under the direction of Facebook) towards a single, unified, and somewhat portable identity, bespeaks the future to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">A Single Way to Log Into Oculus and Unlock Social&nbsp;Features</a>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21372322/instagram-qr-code-launch-global-nametag">Instagram launches QR codes globally, letting people open a profile from any camera&nbsp;app</a>   6. Some quickies on TikTok and WeChat: Mark Zuckerberg lobbied hard for TikTok ban, and Trump is privately telling businesses they can still use&nbsp;WeChat. <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-stoked-washingtons-fears-about-tiktok-11598223133">WSJ on&nbsp;Mark</a>:</p><blockquote>When Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg delivered a speech about freedom of expression in Washington, D.C., last fall, there was also another agenda: to raise the alarm about the threat from Chinese tech companies and, more specifically, the popular video-sharing app&nbsp;TikTok.</blockquote><blockquote>Tucked into the speech was a line pointing to Facebook’s rising rival: Mr. Zuckerberg told Georgetown students that TikTok doesn’t share Facebook’s commitment to freedom of expression, and represents a risk to American values and technological supremacy.</blockquote><blockquote>That was a message Mr. Zuckerberg hammered behind the scenes in meetings with officials and lawmakers during the October trip and a separate visit to Washington weeks earlier, according to people familiar with the&nbsp;matter.</blockquote><blockquote>In a private dinner at the White House in late October, Mr. Zuckerberg made the case to President Trump that the rise of Chinese internet companies threatens American business, and should be a bigger concern than reining in Facebook, some of the people&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Zuckerberg discussed TikTok specifically in meetings with several senators, according to people familiar with the meetings. In late October, Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) — who met with Mr. Zuckerberg in September — and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) wrote a letter to intelligence officials demanding an inquiry into TikTok. The government began a national-security review of the company soon after, and by the spring, Mr. Trump began threatening to ban the app entirely. This month he signed an executive order demanding that TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance Ltd., divest itself of its U.S. operations.</blockquote><blockquote>Few tech companies have as much to gain as Facebook from TikTok’s travails, and the social-media giant has taken an active role in raising concerns about the popular app and its Chinese&nbsp;owners.</blockquote><p>A touch of irony here given the influence Facebook had in making TikTok a raving success, <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">as we discussed a couple weeks&nbsp;ago</a>.</p><p>On the WeChat front, there’s now a lawsuit.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-u-s-wechat-ban-is-unconstitutional-11598059765">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, claims the executive order is unconstitutional. It was filed by U.S. WeChat Users Alliance, a nonprofit organization, as well as other plaintiffs including a small business and several individuals.</blockquote><blockquote>The plaintiffs aren’t connected with the popular app or its Chinese-based parent, Tencent Holdings Ltd., representatives said. They said the user alliance was formed by people who depend on WeChat in their business and personal&nbsp;lives.</blockquote><p>(TikTok is also filing a lawsuit.)</p><p>In classic Trump fashion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/trump-administration-signals-u-s-firms-can-use-wechat-in-china">the president is playing both&nbsp;sides</a>:</p><blockquote>The Trump administration is privately seeking to reassure U.S. companies including Apple Inc. that they can still do business with the WeChat messaging app in China, according to several people familiar with the matter, two weeks after President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned service.</blockquote><blockquote>In recent days, senior administration officials have been reaching out to some companies, realizing that the impact of an all-out ban on the popular app, owned by China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd., could be devastating for U.S. technology, retail, gaming, telecommunications and other industries, people familiar with the discussions said.</blockquote><p>Just another day, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-faces-hate-speech-grilling-by-indian-lawmakers-after-journal-article-11597747734">Facebook Faces Hate-Speech Questioning by Indian Lawmakers After Journal&nbsp;Article</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/technology/facebook-zuckerberg-ftc-questioned.html">Mark Zuckerberg Questioned Under Oath in F.T.C.

On the other side of the (digital) coin, the race is heating&nbsp;up. <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-markets-be605d90-4ee5-48f3-b2c1-b553938cf5b6.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>China is moving ahead “rapidly” with its version of a central bank-issued digital currency and the Fed looks to be prioritizing development and moving forward with urgency to produce one in the U.S. as&nbsp;well.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Digital currencies would provide a number of new policy tools to help stimulate the economy, including allowing Congress to send money more quickly and efficiently to Americans or facilitating direct transmissions from the Fed to consumers.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Spending patterns by the unemployed and others who received funds through the CARES Act and private company progress on digital currencies “has intensified calls for [central bank digital currencies] CBDCs to maintain the sovereign currency as the anchor of the nation’s payment systems,” Fed governor Lael Brainard said in a speech earlier this month. “Moreover, China has moved ahead rapidly on its version of a&nbsp;CBDC.”</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Watch this space: Separate House and Senate bills have emerged this year proposing the creation of digital currencies.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>The intrigue: A digital currency could also help the Fed implement monetary policy by setting interest rates on consumers’ accounts holding the digital currency — analysts say this also could be a more efficient way for the Fed to institute negative interest rates to boost consumption and inflation.</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: China already is far ahead of the U.S. and much of the developed world in mobile payments, and a new digital currency could provide another avenue to challenge the dollar’s supremacy as the world’s funding currency.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>What’s next: The Fed could provide some hints on the next steps in developing a digital currency at its annual Jackson Hole Symposium, which is set to kickoff virtually on Thursday.</blockquote><p>This new “Cold War” with China — whatever you want to call it — may very well have a silver lining. Sure, there’s going to be plenty of disruption — as we’re already seeing with the trade war, Huawei, TikTok,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>But it’s also creating real urgency for companies, central banks, and governments to deliver the goods. There’s nowhere to hide and everyone’s looking over the shoulder.

 Ten overarching themes which emerged from this&nbsp;research <p><a href="https://medium.com/u/2a3294b983d7">Savita Bailur</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/908fbaeafc08">Hélène&nbsp;Smertnik</a></p>Cover page of our research report on Women, Work and&nbsp;ID<p>Digital identity — or as we prefer to call it at Caribou Digital, identification in a digital age — is often pursued from the supply side, in terms of increasing access to legal identification. We hear of SDG 16.9 (free and universal legal identity for all, including birth registration by 2030) and the commitment to serve the 1 billion people in the world without ID. Common use cases often mentioned for ID include access to education, healthcare and citizenship (e.g, voting). However, the demand-side or the reasons to obtain ID are less clear, particularly from women’s perspectives.</p><p>Supported by the Australian Government, through the Commonwealth Digital Identity Initiative, we set out to <a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/when-ID-works-for-women-report-1.pdf">conduct qualitative research on women, work and ID in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka</a> in 2019. Our aim was to understand the extent to which ID played a role in obtaining work and being able to retain and protect income for lower income women. We produced <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">a series of blogs</a> and attach our overarching report&nbsp;here.</p><p>In each country we spoke to women in domestic work, garment work and online work (both physical work found online and fully digital work) as these are three broad areas in which low-income women are employed (and in the case of online work, increasingly employed), and that we could compare across the two countries.</p><p><a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/when-ID-works-for-women-report-1.pdf">In this report,</a> we share ten overarching points which emerged from the research:</p><blockquote>1. ID access needs to be as easy as possible for&nbsp;women.</blockquote><blockquote>2. The relevance of ID for women should be made more evident to end users, policymakers and male family and&nbsp;friends.</blockquote><blockquote>3. Employment and income are two key drivers for women to obtain ID and should be leveraged more as incentives.</blockquote><blockquote>4. An ID enables more choice and holds aspirational value.</blockquote><blockquote>5. Having an ID leads to more formal work and potentially greater protection for&nbsp;women.</blockquote><blockquote>6. Possession of an ID empowers women to seek fair and equal treatment.</blockquote><blockquote>7. While ID offers several protections, it does not reduce discrimination or underage employment — these need additional regulation.</blockquote><blockquote>8. Using one’s own ID is especially important for financial independence.</blockquote><blockquote>9. Awareness-raising campaigns and stronger regulation need to address risks of workarounds.</blockquote><blockquote>10. The future of work — especially digital — needs to recognise the underlying ID processes can be more challenging for women than&nbsp;men.</blockquote><p>Note that while many of these apply to men as well as women, the distinction that emerged in our research was that women found it harder to justify obtaining an ID because they could not always see the value of their own ID. However, relying on others for identification entails risks which need to be communicated more strongly to women and those who have influence over their&nbsp;lives.</p><p>This report highlights the ways in which ID is critical for women in finding work and therefore could be used as a driver to incentivise women to obtain and have agency over their own&nbsp;IDs.</p><p><a href="https://www.cariboudigital.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/when-ID-works-for-women-report-1.pdf">Read the full report&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Caribou Digital would like to express thanks&nbsp;to:</p>  all our respondents in Bangladesh and Sri&nbsp;Lanka;  our partners in the Commonwealth Digital Identity initiative — GSMA and the World Bank — for feedback;  the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade innovationXchange, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka country&nbsp;offices;  our external advisory team of Dr. Sanchita Banerjee Saxena, Helani Galpaya and Lani&nbsp;Jacobs;  our final draft reviewers Victoria Esquivel-Korsiak and Lani&nbsp;Jacobs;  our internal advisory team of Niamh Barry, Dr. Jonathan Donner and Nicki&nbsp;McGoh;  Alina Kaiser for social media&nbsp;support;  Sharon Rhodes for&nbsp;editing;  the field research teams BizInsights and Nowshin Noor in Bangladesh and Mithula Guganeshan in Sri&nbsp;Lanka;  the Awaj Foundation in Bangladesh and Stand Up in Sri Lanka as well as their founders, respectively Nazma Akter and Ashila Niroshi, both former garment factory workers who set up their organisations to support workers’&nbsp;rights;  and finally to Big Blue Communications for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCufQ-antUG_DJ8_aJHIoYXA">video production</a>.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/women-work-and-id-8c7a2df76acc">Women, work and ID</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Those that work in the digital privacy space may feel that they aren’t at risk like other companies or individuals. We here at Authenteq are not those people. We know that protecting one’s privacy online extends far beyond just safeguarding the identity of our customers, we take the security of our own digital identities, and our shared systems, seriously. As the saying goes, sometimes you have to eat your own dog food. So, in the spirit of transparency, we thought we’d share how we handle things here to help anyone that may be looking for ways to better protect themselves.</p>



 The Cost of Spoofs 



<p>No one who uses the internet – and really, is there anyone who doesn’t? – is immune to cyberattacks. A simple check on sites like<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Pwned</a>&nbsp;can show you all the compromised sites where your email address has been used. Last year, a hacker gained access to CapitalOne’s system affecting 100 million Americans and 6 million Canadians, costing the company upwards of<a href="https://www.virtualarmour.com/the-capital-one-hack-the-latest-in-a-series-of-high-profile-breaches/"> $100 million</a>. Phishing and spoofing attacks have risen steadily every year and according to Agari’s<a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2h-2020-trends-report/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=h2trendsreport"> H2 2020 Email Fraud &amp; Identity Deception Trends Report</a>, 80 percent of FTSE 100 companies are vulnerable to brand impersonation online. TL; DR anti-spoofing efforts should matter to everyone.</p>



 Email and Phone 



<p>Ensuring that you request some pretty basic information may seem obvious, but there are easy steps to implement to protect your employees and customers that can go a long way.</p>



<p>At Authenteq, we’ve changed fields on our website so that only someone with a professional, or corporate, an email address can schedule a demo. That means no Hotmail, no Gmail, no personal emails at all. It’s a good first step in preventing either bad actors from entering your system as a worst-case scenario, but it’s also a way to prevent low quality leads from taking up time from your workforce by flooding support with questions, booking demos of products they don’t intend to purchase or license, and generally wasting time and resources. If an email address does make its way into your system, flag it as spam and block it immediately.<br></p>



 Regular Training&nbsp; 



<p>Keep your staff up to date by offering regular training around anti-spoofing measures. Just like any facet of life, trends come and go, and so it’s important to know the latest. When new scams emerge, ensure that you have measures in place to protect yourselves. Your employees should also be aware of any new scams in case customers get targeted and turn to their sales or account representative looking for guidance or assurance.</p>



<p>COVID, for example, brought a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2020/08/03/which-covid-scams-are-hot-now/#46c0369e1577"> new wave of scams</a>, particularly around robocalls, as a flood of new financial assistance funds were released. People were stuck at home, either by their own choice or by their government’s insistence, which meant companies or government agencies suddenly reaching out by phone didn’t feel at all out of place.</p>



<p>Furthermore, your employees themselves need to make sure they are verifying their own emails for suspicious emails, know not to share passwords or private information via email, and to always back up their work. All it takes is one employee that opens a phishing email and your entire operation could be compromised. If an employee gets an email from their CEO that seems off, they should know and feel empowered to be able to question it instead of opening it and clicking suspicious links.</p>



 Two-Factor Authentication 



<p>As companies grow, the security measures that worked for a team of say 10 employees will not work for a team of 100. One thing companies often fail to implement is increased security as this growth happens. Having to go back and adjust things retroactively is much harder than putting in what may feel like an overly vigorous system in place before the need is felt. Two-factor authentication on emails, sites where internal documents are kept like Jira or<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa"> GitHub</a>, or even shared social media sites is a great best practice to set up. At Authenteq, we require employees to set up two-factor authentication for our internal emails, and they must reverify their authentication every time a new device is used or if they’re in a new location.</p>



<p>In addition to 2FA, we use<a href="https://1password.com/"> 1Password</a>, a password manager, for our shared accounts. We also have three different VPNs. All employees’ pay slips are encrypted. And for physical onsite security, the<a href="https://nuki.io/en/"> Nuki</a> smart lock and app is the only way to gain access inside the office, and we keep employee records, confidential documents, and any expensive hardware in a safe.</p>



 Planning 



<p>Having a plan in place to respond to any worst-case scenario is a good idea for some and crucial for others. Even if it’s not on your “need to have”, we can’t think of any situation in which this wouldn’t be a “nice to have.” If a hacker breached your internal IT system, consider what that would mean, what and who would be affected and most at risk, and the people on your team who could respond.</p>



 Liveness Checks&nbsp; 



<p>Integrating a fully automated KYC solution into your onboarding process is the ultimate tactic to prevent spoofers from sneaking in. But identity verification tools with an accompanying liveness check leaves almost no room for them.</p>



<p>Liveness checks can also prevent deepfakes from entering your system, the latest in spoofing threats. Using neural network-powered artificial intelligence and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into algorithms to create a “mask”, replacing or manipulating the original faces with lookalike data. Deepfakes do pose a threat to identity theft online, but can also be<a href="https://authenteq.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-deepfakes-the-importance-of-kyc/"> prevented</a> with sophisticated KYC tools and liveness checks.</p>

<p>The symbol for the denarius, the reference coin in the Roman Empire</p>



<p>This is the fourth in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state, this time focusing on new digital forms of government-issued money.</p>



<p>Technology
is changing the building blocks of government. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a> we
saw that the trend to e-government is leaving no pillar untouched. <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>
showed how the technology by which people make their political choices is
changing, and <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/30/the-digital-state-part-3/">Part 3</a>
looked at how law-making is being shaped by new digital tools.</p>



<p>The
rush to digital government is now evident everywhere. Recently, for example, we
learnt about the chaos caused in the UK by a government algorithm that decided
which students passed their university entry exams. [1] The point of this negative
example is not to be negative, but merely to show that the state is now
embracing digital tools big time.</p>



<p>And
what can be a bigger than government-issued digital currencies?</p>



<p>E-government
and its money</p>



<p>The
latest technology has always shaped the physical characteristics of money. We
know that there was a time without coins – a pre-metallic monetary period. One
form of money then was cowrie shells, which could not be counterfeited. Its
monetary area encompassed the Indian ocean coastal regions of Africa, Asia and Oceania.
We know that when the shift to metallic money happened, coins started out as little
blobs. As the technology got more sophisticated, the coins became rounder and
flatter, with symbols stamped on them. We know that the metallic composition of
coins was impacted by mining discoveries – also linked to new technology. We
know that Marco Polo was hugely impressed when he discovered that the Chinese were
using a new technology for money: paper. And we know that Australia introduced
the first banknotes made from a rubber-like substance (polymer). So, we know
that the composition of money reflected the technology and resources of the
era.</p>



<p>Should
we now be terribly surprised, therefore, that in our era the state is
experimenting with new technology for the issuance, distribution, safe-keeping
and exchange of money? No. And should we be surprised that the essence of this
new money is something we cannot see or touch: digital stuff? No. And wouldn’t Marco
Polo have been impressed? Yes!</p>



<p>So,
what’s new about CBDCs?</p>



<p>While
computers are not new and electronic payments are not new and central bank
digital book entries are not new, there is something new about central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs). The new feature is that technology is changing how
and where they can be distributed and stored. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A
new digital highway, interspersed with cool digital gadgets, is creating a new
monetary transmission mechanism directly from the central bank to those
devices. The technology is not holding up its introduction, the missing legal
framework is. Where is the law that governs the new digital wallets at the
central bank? Where are the laws that govern the settlement of cross-border
payments linked to these new wallets? </p>



<p>What
we know from history is that where technology leads, society and the law inevitably
follow. The new laws will also follow from the local driving forces. One such
case is currently happening in Switzerland. The country’s stock exchange is
building a trading platform for “digital assets”. The central bank needs to
understand what that might mean for the payments system, counterparty risk and
systemic stability. One potential outcome could be a “digital Swiss franc”, which
would be used to settle payments between wholesale participants on that
platform. Nothing has been decided yet. But if that were decided, it could
happen as early as 2021.</p>



<p>Central
banks all over the world are taking a closer look at what this new digital
infrastructure might mean for their mandates. While the motivations and urgency
differ from country to country, it appears at this point that the introductions
of the first central bank digital currencies will not replace “cash” – they
will merely be an additional pool of digital units for a newly defined purpose,
distributed and stored via a new infrastructure. It also appears clear at this
stage that central banks are not keen on the idea that retail clients should
have digital wallets at the central bank.</p>



<p>Blockchain
agnostic</p>



<p>Central
bank digital currencies do not need blockchain. Recall that bitcoin was born as
the anti-central bank fiat currency. Central banks want control over the amount
of money they issue; they are not going to give up that control to a public
blockchain. Central bank digital money is anti-bitcoin money; it has a central
counterparty: the central bank. Some central banks are indeed experimenting
with blockchain, and it is not inconceivable that some could even issue a
currency on a private or permissioned blockchain, but that means they will
still exercise control.</p>



<p>Concluding
thoughts: What we can learn from the big Ӿ</p>



<p>The
era of central bank digital currencies is dawning just as governments all over
the world have issued war-time levels of debt and central banks have increased
their balance sheets to previously unimaginable sizes. It is not unreasonable
to ask if central bank digital currencies stored on new digital wallets would
not make it easier to push more digital units through the system or even remove
units via new negative interest rates? The answer to both questions is probably
yes.</p>



<p>The
algorithm problem in the UK cited above is also meant to illustrate the point
that e-government also needs a superior governance framework. This is not just
about downloading new software; e-government should also be smart government
that serves the people more efficiently.</p>



<p>Similarly,
the introduction of central bank digital currencies will need a superior
governance framework to prevent bad outcomes. Here we perhaps need to be
reminded about bad monetary outcomes in history. It is difficult to separate
the role of the issuer of money, be it a mint in ancient Greece or a modern
central bank, from the fiscal obligations of its owner, the sovereign.&nbsp; These are two sides of the coin. Several
writers who focused on the finances of the ancient world conclude that the
unsustainable public finances of ancient Greece and Rome were ultimately the
real cause of the collapse of those empires. [2]</p>



<p>In
one of the largest recorded increases in the money supply of the Roman Empire&nbsp;– a tenfold
rise in the circulation of mainly silver coinage between 157BC and 50BC – smart
administration and structural changes initially held back inflation. The measures included more cash reserves held by the
banks and the Roman treasury.
But these supportive factors eventually reversed. The Roman coin
the denarius (which had its own symbol Ӿ), was gradually debased from a practically pure
silver coin to one just washed in silver. Its value plummeted (figure 1). </p>



<p>Figure 1: The price of one pound of gold in denarii,
log scale, 50 BC to 350 AD</p>



Source [3]



<p>The
wealthy were initially able to protect themselves from inflation with a
diversified portfolio that included gold, silver and real estate. But when Rome
eventually fell to the invaders, and the new capital moved to Ravenna, the rich
could not take their land with them. </p>



<p>Rome was not built in a day and its money was not destroyed in a day either. We will need a smart new governance framework for the era of central bank digital currencies. </p>

					 <p>The easiest way to explain <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is to pull out an item that people carry on a daily basis—a wallet.¹ It’s strange to use a leather pouch to explain such a complex, nascent technology as SSI, but it works! And it works because most of the magic of SSI happens within and between digital wallets.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Going from leather to digital 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Apart from money, the leather wallet you carry in your pocket or purse stores important identifying cards (i.e., your driver’s license, health insurance card, employee badge, etc.). We show these cards to people and organizations on a daily basis to receive access to services by proving we are who we say we are. A wallet makes it easy to access these cards when we need them, and it keeps the cards from being lost or stolen.²</p><p><br>Just like a leather wallet stores a variety of important physical cards, an SSI digital wallet stores your <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, making it easy for you to show those credentials to others in a secure, private way. As the name implies, a digital wallet is digital and can exist locally (ie., on your mobile device or desktop) or in the cloud. A more formal definition of digital wallets is below:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A digital wallet, in the context of self-sovereign identity, is a software application and encrypted database that stores credentials, keys, and other secrets necessary for self-sovereign identity.³			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Each participant in the SSI ecosystem (the issuer, the holder, and the verifier) needs a digital wallet in order to issue, hold, and verify verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What can you do with an SSI digital wallet? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Just like the leather pouch in your pocket stores important documents, your digital wallet stores your verifiable credentials. When you are issued a credential, it will be stored in your wallet. The wallet makes it so that the credentials are:<br><br></p>  Easily accessible: With a click of a button, you have access to all of your credentials which you can seamlessly share with others.  Secure: Your credentials are stored only on your device. No one else has access to them—not even the wallet provider (e.g., Trinsic).  Private: You are in full control of who you send the credential to and what pieces of information on the credential you show them.

					 <p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road. When you have a digital wallet, anybody can request information from you. The information is entirely under your control, so you can choose to share the information or reject their request. If you decide to respond, the wallet finds credentials with the relevant data and shares just what they need to know, without sharing everything. For example, you might share your address from your driver’s license credential without sharing your name or birthdate. This is possible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs).</p><p><br>Best of all, the information you share is instantly verifiable, so you can receive access to services seamlessly, just like you do in the real world when you use your physical wallet.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
				 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Finally, if there are parties you want to interact with frequently over time, you can establish a super-private, securely-encrypted connection between you and the other party. You can share information, messages, or any other interaction through this channel with a high degree of trust. While connections are powerful, they’re not always needed; <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a> is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact, especially when the relationship isn’t long-term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making a connection is as easy as scanning a QR code with your wallet, after which your connection will show up under your “Connections” tab in your wallet. You can also create your own QR code so others can connect with you.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is the world’s first SSI digital wallet to have proven <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">interoperability</a> and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. As a cross-platform mobile application with a locally-stored wallet, the Trinsic Wallet is built to be ideal for developers while being accessible and simple enough for the average user. Also, when you use the Trinsic Wallet, you don’t need to worry about vendor lock-in because you can easily export your verifiable credentials and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>. Download the Trinsic Wallet for free today or build your own wallet with Trinsic’s tools.</p>

 	 Drummond Reed, an SSI expert, is famous for pulling out his wallet during presentations on SSI. Timothy Ruff, wrote about this tactic in his blog “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">When Explaining SSI, Start with the Wallet</a>“. 
 	 Of course wallets are not foolproof. They can be stolen or lost, but overall, they do a pretty good job of keeping all of our cards in one place that we can keep on us most times throughout the day. SSI digital wallets have their own security protections that are not listed out in detail here as this is an intro post. 
 	 For simplicity’s sake, at Trinsic, we call it all a “wallet” although in more technical circles, you’ll find the term “agent” used for the application that routes messages and decrypts the wallet, and “wallet” used for the storage layer of the agent.

 The GiD Report #123 — Balkanization and what that means for the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-122-what-will-replace-wechat-and-how-facebook-fueled-tiktoks-rise-ce34d1dc9ef0">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Hello, hello!</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  Why a more balkanized internet is a sign that we’re entering a new chapter of decentralization (according to Peter&nbsp;Thiel)  Real demand for new solutions from mega corporations and individuals alike  It’s full circle for Apple circa 1984–2020  The EU version of a balkanized internet and the unintended consequences  An open question about moderation  Closing remarks from Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the&nbsp;U.S.   1. The biggest fear of a balkanized internet is that it means we’ll be more closed off and less connected. But the fear itself doesn’t mean it will become a&nbsp;reality. Image: University of&nbsp;Chicago<p>Because one reason we have this fear is because we’re looking at today’s events through the lens of today’s frameworks — which are grounded in a centralized approach.</p><p>China wants control so it won’t let in centralized Big Tech. The U.S. doesn’t trust China so ditto state-connected enterprises like ByteDance and&nbsp;Tencent.</p><p>But hey, email still&nbsp;works.</p><p>What that means is that a balkanized internet will only accelerate the transition toward new approaches so that we can continue to connect even as the rules of the game&nbsp;shift.</p><p>Anyway, that’s what Peter Thiel is betting on. (Always the contrarian and often controversial, but never disappoints with his insights.)</p><p>Here’s Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufm85wHJk5A">speaking at the Discovery Institute’s technology summit in&nbsp;July</a>:</p><blockquote>If we’d been assembled in 1969, the future of computers was going to be massive centralization. It was giant databases, giant AI-like computer intelligences that would run everything. IBM was HAL transposed in the movie The Space Odyssey, one letter off. It was one of the early Star Trek episodes. They come to the planet Beta, where thousands of years earlier, somebody had unified the planet and left a computer program that ran the whole planet and all the people were peaceful, but very docile — nothing ever happened. But the future of the computer age circa 1969 was centralization — a few large companies, a few large governments, a few large computers that controlled everything.</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 1999, the future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. It was sort of libertarian and anarchist. It was the corollary to the end of the Soviet Union, that information had this decentralizing tendency, and the internet was going to fragment things and it was going to be this anarchic libertarian place.</blockquote><blockquote>If we fast forward to 2019, the consensus view of the future today, I would submit, is that the pendulum has somehow swung back all the way to 1969. And the consensus view again is that it is about large centralization — Google like governments that control all of the world’s information in this super centralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>The Life After Google thesis that I agree with and endorse is that if we look at this past — and people got it terribly wrong in ‘69 — and things were going to go to decentralization in ’99, it actually started going back the other way from the point of view of 2019. Even if I’m hesitant to talk about the absolute future and where this all ends, ultimately, perhaps the contrarian thing is to say maybe the pendulum can swing back towards more decentralization, more privacy, and things like that. This is what seems to be at least contrarian and at least something we should always take more seriously.</blockquote><blockquote>If you want to frame it in terms of the buzzwords of the day, if it were in terms of crypto and AI, it is easily understood by people. It’s always understood that crypto is somehow vaguely libertarian, but we never are willing to say the opposite, which is that AI is communist. It’s because it’s centralized. The computer knows more about you than you know about yourself. It’s totalitarian.</blockquote><blockquote>Communist China loves AI and dislikes crypto. We should at least consider the possibility that Silicon Valley is probably way too enamored of AI, not just for technological reasons, but also because it expresses this sort of left wing centralized zeitgeist.</blockquote><blockquote>The first sort of contrarian idea I have is that perhaps it’s time for the pendulum to swing back and Life After Google, at its core, means that we are going to go back from this very centralized world today towards a more decentralized one. That seems to me to be the correct thing to bet&nbsp;on.</blockquote><p>Going by Peter’s timeline, 1999 might have felt like the height of the decentralization movement but it was also the beginning of the cycle for the rise of Google, Amazon, Apple (again), and later Facebook.</p><p>Those companies are now among the most valuable on&nbsp;earth.</p><p>So even if today feels like peak centralization, it’s reasonable — particularly if you’re feeling contrarian — that this only means that the pendulum is about the swing the other way.

What’s clear is that there’s suddenly ample demand for new solutions. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>More than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns in a call with White House officials Tuesday about the potentially broad scope and impact of Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting WeChat, set to take effect late next&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those participating in the call, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>“For those who don’t live in China, they don’t understand how vast the implications are if American companies aren’t allowed to use it,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “They are going to be held at a severe disadvantage to every competitor,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Other participants in the call Tuesday included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Intel Corp., MetLife Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Cargill Inc., according to the&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-98146fea-684f-411e-b873-40fd00171f93.html">ample demand from individuals, too,&nbsp;BTW</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans using digital services would gladly switch to companies that are more committed to data privacy, according to survey results shared exclusively with Axios’ Kyle&nbsp;Daly.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s the latest sign people are frustrated with the digital status quo, even as companies make efforts to give users more control over how their data gets collected, stored and&nbsp;used.</blockquote><blockquote>Details: The survey of 1,018 Americans, conducted in June, found people want more control over what happens with their personal information and think existing tools seem outdated and should be easier to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><blockquote>93% of Americans would switch to a company that prioritizes their data&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>91% would prefer to buy from companies that always guarantee them access to their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>88% are frustrated that they don’t have more control over their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>73% reported finding the process of downloading their data from a company “outdated”; 32%, “hard”; 32%, “confusing.”</blockquote><blockquote>About two-thirds said they want to be able to choose what data companies can and can’t&nbsp;collect.</blockquote><p>They’re also just waiting for an alternative.</p> 3. And just to point out the swings of the pendulum — there’s Apple, complaining about the WeChat ban. Back in 1984, Apple released that iconic Super Bowl ad about IBM referencing George&nbsp;Orwell. <p>Now they’re getting a taste of their own medicine <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">with Riot’s Fortnite&nbsp;spoof</a>.</p><p>Of course, Facebook <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">sees an opportunity</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: Facebook is trying to position itself as friendlier to small businesses than Apple, which also faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games over its commission and in-app payment restrictions.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook said Friday that it will launch “Paid Online Events” for small businesses in 20 countries around the world to charge Facebook users to attend their classes, instructions and other&nbsp;events.</blockquote><blockquote>The feature could be useful for any small business or individual offering a service, such a preacher, musician, yoga teacher or cooking instructor.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook asked Apple to either waive its 30% cut or let Facebook go around it and process event payments via Facebook Pay, in either case letting event hosts keep all the revenue they generate.

The other thing about technological balkanization is that it’s not always going to be black and white. A lot of the time it’s gray. That’s a good way to describe what’s been happening in Europe in terms of how they’ve dealt with the influence of American Big Tech. Rather than ban anything outright, they just force companies to play by their&nbsp;rules. <p>That’s well and good in theory. In practice, it’s really messy with a lot of unintended consequences.</p><p>For instance:</p><blockquote>Some businesses fear growing liability while others worry that small and mid-sized firms will get hurt as the U.S. and Europe begin work to replace Privacy Shield, the pact that let thousands of firms transfer data across the Atlantic without breaking EU privacy rules, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Without a replacement in place after the EU’s high court struck Privacy Shield down last month, thousands of businesses will be stuck complying with an agreement that no longer applies in the EU while scrambling to figure out how to get data over from Europe without exposing themselves to legal&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s new: This week, the Department of Commerce and European Commission announced they have started discussions to come up with a new framework to govern data transfers between the EU and the&nbsp;U.S.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21182755.18680/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29tbWVyY2UuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC8wOC9qb2ludC1wcmVzcy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtdXMtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LWNvbW1lcmNlLXdpbGJ1ci1yb3NzLWFuZC1ldXJvcGVhbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB191b30f7">Joint Press Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Justice Didier&nbsp;Reynders</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kyv/a-princess-is-making-google-to-forget-her-drunken-rant-about-killing-muslims">A Princess Is Making Google Forget Her Drunken Rant About Killing&nbsp;Muslims</a>  <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165131-strong-customer-authentication-a-requirement-to-combat-payments-fraud-might-lead-to-many-customers-abandoning-purchases-at-checkout/">Strong Customer Authentication, a Requirement to Combat Payments Fraud, Might Lead to Many Customers Abandoning Purchases at&nbsp;Checkout</a>   5. We’ve talked about balkanization. We’ve touched on regulation. One of the missing pieces that’s become a pivotal question of the day is moderation, which is understandably a controversial topic of the day. If you listened at all to the recent antitrust hearings, then you know that Republicans have their collective pitchforks out about platform censorship. <p>And it’s easy to think about moderation negatively particularly with what’s going on in&nbsp;China.</p><p>But just as not every habit needs to be labeled an addiction — there are good habits, after all — not all moderation should be labeled censorship.</p><p>Good moderation is helpful in creating the right incentives that align with a community’s core values — whether that’s a small group of friends or an entire&nbsp;country.</p><p>And good moderation will mean different things for different people.</p><p>A big part of why there’s such a negative slant to the idea of moderation with today’s status quo isn’t moderation itself, it’s the issue of centralized power and the lack of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">the New Yorker</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In a 2018 article published in the Harvard Law Review, “The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,” Kate Klonick, who is now a professor at St. John’s University Law School, tallies the sometimes conflicting factors that have shaped the moderation policies at Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The companies, she writes, have been influenced by a fundamental belief in American “free speech norms,” a sense of corporate responsibility, and user expectations. They’ve also reacted to government requests, media scrutiny, pressure from users or public figures, and the demands of third-party civil-society groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League. They have sometimes instituted new rules in response to individual incidents. There are downsides to this kind of improvisational responsiveness: a lack of transparency and accountability creates conditions ripe for preferential treatment and double standards.</blockquote><p>It’s also the type of problem inherent to huge centralized organizations and platforms. The more decentralized, transparent, and flexible moderation is, the less oppressive moderation feels.</p><p>I mean I get it. Why should Mark Zuckerberg decide the rules for billions of people? Who made him king? (And I get Mark’s side — when you have your own employees protesting because you won’t take stuff down because they don’t like&nbsp;it.)</p><p>It’s like that thing that Aristotle said: That dude that has a lotta friends basically has no&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Mark gets it, too. That’s why he created an independent (supposedly) subcommittee to decide that&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a solution, though, it’s still kind of a bandaid. When you’re as big and as powerful as Facebook, any solution to the problem will be a bit cumbersome.</p><p>When you don’t have a system built on real trust and real identities, it’s impossible to delegate that responsibility to your users or your communities. If you never trusted them in the first place, how can you provide them&nbsp;agency.</p><p>It’s a point that we touched upon a couple weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin:</p><blockquote>If you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><p>Anyway, this was more of an open question. Something to think&nbsp;about.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/08/07/google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust">To Head Off Regulators, Google Makes Certain Words Taboo — The&nbsp;Markup</a>   6. OK. I’ll leave you with a little more Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the U.S. from that same talk. (Sorry, Chamath is pushed back&nbsp;again.) <blockquote>If we look at the rate of progress in Silicon Valley, it was charismatic because it was the one place where things were still happening relative to the rest of the U.S., and it’s become a lot less charismatic in the last five&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>We think about the vibe in 2014, it was this place where the future was being built. In 2019, the big tech companies are probably as self hating in some ways as the big banks were in&nbsp;2009.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s a sense of, “uh, it’s not quite working.”</blockquote><blockquote>If you pick on Google a little bit here, the Google propaganda of the future was that it was all going to be more automation. The story in 2014 were things like Google Glass so you could identify anybody you looked at at any time. It was the self-driving car. I would say these aren’t that big of a set of innovations — a self-driving car is a step from a car but not as big a step as a far from a&nbsp;horse.</blockquote><blockquote>So we can debate quite how big these things are and how to quantify them. But that was still the narrative that was very intact in&nbsp;2014.</blockquote><blockquote>When you fast forward to 2019, it’s striking how there’s absolutely no narrative of the future left. Google doesn’t even talk about the self-driving car very much. There’s a sense that it may still happen, but it’s further in the future. The expected time seems to be getting further&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>So there’s sort of the sense that perhaps there’s this danger that we have slowed progress even in tech, even in the world of information technology.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow Silicon Valley has consolidated into larger companies. It’s gotten harder for new companies to break through, and it’s gotten harder because new companies or small companies are good at doing new things and people are doing fewer new things. Then the big companies are more dominant.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>The stagnation idea is that at the end of the day, technology is about people. It’s not about inanimate forces. It’s not some kind of Marxist historicism about the way things are inevitably going to happen. The stress is always on individuals, small teams that start companies, new projects that do new&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a question of human agency. It’s not deterministic. We have every possibility to do these things, but at the end of the day, it is up to us to make it happen. And it’s not set in stone that it’s going to happen one way or&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In conclusion, I think one other gloss in Life After Google is that perhaps you should have the title with “life” being italicized or stressed or put in&nbsp;bold.</blockquote><blockquote>The critical thing is there is life, life goes on and in particular, human life, humanity goes on. Even though the dominant narrative in tech is about inanimate forces or Marxist historicism — it really is, at its core, about human beings and we should always bet on the indomitability of the human&nbsp;spirit.</blockquote> 7.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Informatica has <a href="https://www.informatica.com/about-us/news/news-releases/2020/08/20200818-informatica-acquires-greenbay-technologies-to-advance-ai-and-machine-learning-capabilities.html">just announced</a> that they have made another acquisition this summer: GreenBay Technologies, a startup focused on AI and machine learning. Read about their July 2020 acquisition <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/big-data-informatica-announces-acquisition-of-compact-solutions">here</a>.</p>
<p>GreenBay Technologies brings CloudMatcher to Informatica’s Intelligent Data Platform (IDP). CloudMatcher uses machine learning to automate entity matching and schema matching tasks with high accuracy. This impacts several key data management capabilities such as master data management, data cataloging, data quality, governance, and data integration.</p>
<p>This acquisition adds to the core capabilities of Informatica’s CLAIRE® engine. Informatica has previously collaborated with and invested in GreenBay Technologies, with some elements of CloudMatcher technology already embedded in Informatica products. Founders and team members of GreenBay Technologies will join Informatica as full-time employees. The collaboration, investment, and mutual aim to provide a more complete view and understanding of enterprise data foreshadows a successful acquisition.</p>
<p>Empowering the Business User with AI-Powered Data Management Tools</p>
<p>CloudMatcher further strengthens Informatica’s approach to no-code data management. It brings innovations to both schema matching and entity matching. While schema matching determines that two columns in two tables, such as “ename” and “emp name”, are semantically the same, entity matching determines that two records, such as (David Smith, Acme Company) and (Dave M. Smith, Acme), are the same real-world entity.</p>
<p>Historically, entity matching has remained a complex problem because the solutions are rule-based that require skilled developers and a significant amount of time. GreenBay Technologies has created a blend of “declarative rules” and “AI rules” for match classification. Many existing solutions to schema and entity matching use hand-crafted rules. With this acquisition, Informatica adds a powerful machine learning model that can capture complex and powerful matching rules, the kind of rules that users cannot create manually. The supervised learning used in this approach requires relatively little effort from the user to train the system. The active learning stage presents the business user with interactive labeling exercises for tuple pairs from two separate tables. Simultaneously, the system learns from more user feedback and curation to continuously improve over time. This workflow goes through multiple iterations and yields a high degree of accuracy. CloudMatcher is also highly amenable to distributed and parallel processing, allowing the solution to scale to very large data sets and dramatically reduce manual data stewardship required.</p>
<p>This opens the door for many data management services to be “hands-off”, meaning easily usable by business users without the need for coding or a developer background. As data sets are getting larger and larger, the improved match rate offered by CloudMatcher will help reduce the false positives. By applying a crowdsourcing approach with business users labeling training data, Informatica can configure a sophisticated data matching system that adapts to an organization’s data landscape in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks. This technology also helps in extending matching beyond identity data by matching product, supplier, location, and other types of data domains with even higher accuracy.</p>
<p>AI on Demand: A Continuation of the Platform Economy</p>
<p>We see the trend of harnessing AI to make complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users rising in many different fields. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/#article-slice-14228">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a> is one such area with many vendors providing the general technology and language capabilities, with support to train the chatbot on a customer’s specific industry and corporate knowledge. Other areas include <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, with AI capabilities already integrated into the cybersecurity solution and able to be trained in a context-specific environment rather than a “build it yourself” approach. This may shift in the future though, as methodologies for presenting the AI development process (data preparation, model selection, training, validating, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) to non-AI experts improve. Some tech companies (read about some examples <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80232/ibm-watson/">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80233/microsoft-azure-ai-platform/">here</a>) are offering AI capabilities irrespective of industry; they aim to provide the infrastructure, data pipeline management, automated support to determine appropriate learning models, and governance for the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>The data management use cases that we see Informatica addressing have the potential to unlock more data-based insights at a lower cost – be it through reducing time-to-value or by enabling subject matter experts to work with their data as a data scientist or developer would. Enabling more data-driven business will shape the processes, internal decisions, production goals, and much more. But this is only possible with strong data management practice, including the correct labeling of entities. User-friendly AI to manage this step is key to seeing more value from data management products.</p>

					 <p>“Portable” is one of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 principles</a> of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored. They must be able to leave their current provider and move to a new provider and never be trapped in vendor lock-in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet portability for individuals has always been an aspiration of wallet providers, but until today, has never been successful. We’re proud to announce that Trinsic has achieved interoperable wallet portability with two other SSI wallet vendors—<a href="https://lissi.id">Lissi</a> and <a href="https://esatus.com">esatus AG</a>. For the first time, an individual can “fire their wallet”¹ and use a new one.</p>

					 <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first implementation amongst 3 vendors is a first step in what we hope will be a larger community effort to converge on best practices for interoperability of SSI wallets.</p>

					 <p>Our approach to wallet portability shouldn’t be viewed as the end-all be-all. Further iterations and evolution will happen over time as the SSI community continues to converge on standards and protocols relating to wallet portability. We do commit, however, to being involved in that effort. If you’d like to get involved, here are some things we’d love your contributions on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Currently connections are lost through the import/export process. Connections are a persistent 1:1 relationship between two parties and rely on endpoints provided by mediator agents to ensure messages are routed to the correct wallet. Because the approach to mediator agents aren’t completely standardized between vendors, connections do not transfer seamlessly across different vendors.  The export function creates an encrypted, duplicate wallet which you can use as a backup. This is extremely useful if you lose your device and want to restore your wallet. But it also enables you to upload your wallet to multiple devices. This is useful if you want a tablet &amp; mobile wallet to be in sync, but can be problematic if you duplicated your wallet onto other people’s devices, allowing them to present your credentials. Ensuring the integrity of credentials across the import/export process is the subject of future work.  All the mobile wallets that support portability are based on the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. Further testing will be required to determine whether the exported wallet can be opened seamlessly in other Aries frameworks or whether additional limitations will arise.  The import/export implementation is specifically geared toward local wallets and applications (ie., mobile wallets). Enterprise wallets and cloud wallets are out of scope.

<p>As far as tech industry standards go, it has been a slow burn <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">finding out exactly how</a> 130 Verified Twitter Accounts, and thousands of unverified accounts, came to suddenly begin promoting fake charities or Bitcoin giveaways last month. Piece by piece security experts have gleaned information directly from hackers, found tidbits on the dark web, and learned more from Twitter - the company has been updating their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident almost every day since it was first posted on July 18, 2020.</p><p>However, this type of hack can happen to any company that has an administration panel or dashboard for their app that’s protected by a username and password. Even taking the time and effort to fully integrate back end systems, enable two-factor authentication, and take other precautionary measures can still lead to a similar breach thanks to clever social engineering tricks and hacks that have become increasingly common. </p><p>One way to really lock down your administration panel, possibly the best method as of today, is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. For example, faking a BloomID is almost impossible -- only one BloomID can be created using an email address, it’s secured by a private key that cannot be duplicated or spoofed, and accessing the accompanying Bloom app requires physical access to someone’s iOS or Android device, or taking full control of their Apple ID or Google account and restoring everything to a new device, which would cause multiple emails and alarms to go off for the affected party. Your Apple ID has been used to sign in to a new device! Your Google account has a new device associated with it! It’s kind of hard to ignore, and the most security conscious of us have locked down our wireless carrier and Apple/Google accounts, leaving only the usernames and passwords we use left to secure, or rather abandon passwords entirely, which is a movement already <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">supported</a> across all the most popular platforms but not implemented widely. </p><p>So how do you lock down your administration panel, ensuring your God Mode or Super Admin mode is only accessed by those who are truly authorized to have it? Let’s dive in.</p> Server Side <p>We’re not going to use anything like Verify Kit this time, there’s no need. All we want to do is ensure that the person trying to access the administration panel has the appropriate rights, and that can be correlated by the email address they share via Bloom’s mobile app to an existing database that contains role-based access control permissions and rights. </p><p>We will assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of an Express-based app, or that can be passed a payload from an Express library. This is largely true for many administration apps since JavaScript is so flexible.</p> Let’s Use Bloom Starter for Auth <p>There are two parts to the Bloom Starter app; the server-side (Express) and client-side (React).</p><p>Getting Started</p><p>First we’re going to start the Express server, start ngrok to proxy the Express server so that the mobile app can POST share-kit data to the url, and then start the React app. </p><p>Follow these steps to make it happen:</p>  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter.git</code>  And then <code>cd bloom-starter/bloom-starter-auth</code>  Then run <code>npm run deps</code> (this installs any dependencies for both the server and client)  Before starting up the dev server, you will need a .env file with these variables set:     <code>PORT</code>  <code>NODE_ENV</code>, and   <code>SESSION_SECRET</code>   <p>Please see the .env.sample file in the repository for an example of where your .env should be located, and what it should look like. There’s no need to go in blind. </p><p>And finally run <code>npm run dev</code>.</p><p>If all went well, and the <code>REACT_APP_SERVER_URL</code> env var is set to the ngrok url, then we can move on to the client.</p> Time for the Client Setup <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Since the administration app is a web app, we can continue leveraging the same Bloom Starter repository. </p><p>For this demonstration, we don’t need much. The only Verifiable Credential we’re going to use is <code>email</code>, which we can tie back to our existing database to ensure it’s someone that should have access to the admin panel.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/demo">Share Kit demo</a> to generate the code needed to place the QR code on the login page. For the DatingApp administration panel login, we end up with:</p> <code>import React from 'react'
import {RequestElement, Action} from '@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react'

const requestData = {
  action: Action.attestation,
  token: 'e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e',
  org_name: 'DatingApp Admin',
  url: 'https://receive-kit.datingapp.co/api/receive',
  org_logo_url: 'https://datingapp.co/images/DatingApp-Logo.png',
  org_usage_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/terms',
  org_privacy_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy',
  types: ['email']
}

const MyComponent: React.SFC = props =&gt; (
  &lt;RequestElement
    requestData={requestData}
    buttonCallbackUrl="https://datingapp.co/admin?token=e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e"
    qrOptions={{
      size: 256,
      hideLogo: false,
      fgColor: '#16325b'
    }}
  /&gt;
)
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own token as a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources. This also ensures you are receiving data from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Also note that the <code>Action</code> in this request, unlike others, is <code>Action.authentication</code>.

<p>Nothing felt strange when former president Barack Obama began his speech about the importance of taking a critical look at what we see on the internet. That is until he started making some, shall we say, uncharacteristic statements. The now-famous deepfake was one of the first of its kind to go viral, showing both how easy it is to be fooled and the dangers of not looking more closely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“This is a dangerous time, moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It’s a time we need to rely on trusted news sources,” </p>– Peele through Obama</blockquote>



 

 



<p>The word <a href="https://medium.com/@songda/a-short-history-of-deepfakes-604ac7be6016">deepfake was coined by a Reddit user back in 2017</a> and is a portmanteau of the words deep learning and fake. Today, it is a blanket term for artificial intelligence (AI) powered face swapping, i.e. when one person is replaced by another in a photo or video footage. On Reddit it began as a way to make fake adult videos of famous celebrities, and while that “trend” continues, deepfakes have become a way to create and disseminate misinformation and fake news. Peele’s decision to use Obama illustrates just how easy it is to manipulate politicians’ words, which is particularly worrisome as the 2020 election approaches. And while some can be fun to watch, like Bill Hader transforming into<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrhRBb-1Ig"> Tom Cruise</a> or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, they all come with a warning bell.&nbsp;</p>



 How’d They Do That? 



<p>Deep learning is an AI technique that uses huge data sets to create standard models and formats. Inspired by artificial neural networks, a function of the biological brain, it is considered to be the breakthrough within the field of AI. By leveraging neural network powered AI and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into an algorithm that creates a “mask” which can be used to replace or manipulate original faces or and voices by using lookalike data. The algorithms train themselves to improve over time. If Peele hadn’t appeared in the video next to Obama, the manipulation would have been difficult for many humans to even detect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the software involved in creating deepfakes is open-sourced like Google’s TensorFlow or uses widely available tools like Adobe’s After Effects. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however. Peele’s skilled production team spent 56 hours to create the one-minute Obama video.</p>



 What Does This Mean for KYC?&nbsp; 



<p>The rise and advancement of deepfakes does pose a threat in that many organizations have found themselves wondering if these techniques could be used to create false identities not easily detectable within their onboarding processes. For sophisticated KYC and verification tools like <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s</a>, however, deepfakes can be thwarted at several entry points.</p>



<p>Authenticating one’s identity within a fully automated, robust KYC solution means that a person has to scan and upload a copy of their government-issued ID. The next step is to take a selfie and using facial recognition technology, the customer’s identity can only be verified once the biometrics of the selfie match those of the photo ID. The liveness check done with the real-time selfie also determines whether the customer is a real person, and so anything pre-recorded or played through a screen wouldn’t pass. Biometric authentication that doesn’t include a liveness check is only doing half the job as far as KYC efforts go.</p>



<p>Once verified within Authenteq’s system, spot ID checks can also be implemented if suspicious behavior is detected. If the identity does match the ID used in the onboarding process, the account could be flagged or even deactivated.</p>



<p>There has also been a series of legislation introduced to help tackle this problem. In 2019, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230"> DEEPFAKES Accountability Act</a> was introduced in the House of Representatives, and California passed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902884/california-deepfake-political-ban-election-2020"> legislation</a> making it illegal to produce deepfakes of politicians. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfakes can be<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-deep-fake-pornography-and-is-it-illegal-in-the-uk_uk_5bf4197ce4b0376c9e68f8c5?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANO465UhdTIOSqTKHRjw0X8c-MSstQyicQRLFRn2icdH1SuNC7u3R-zoqNfcARCzR-WeClmyXYgxvjChZ3zayJqECu8v_8LA3r5rdDhaz_-c5a3Sz2Y5oZkxi43chLqjGphrH5i9EUIiBHhEE13RXZkNQXCRBa01XfrK4OZomQWJ"> prosecuted</a> for harassment.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>Much of the very warranted concern over deepfakes revolves around prominent public figures like politicians and celebrities, but what about the average consumer or businesses? Identity theft and fraud are a growing concern for people in every country and business in every sector. Like all technology, we can’t predict with any certainty what will be possible with deepfakes in the coming years but when it comes to identity verification, one thing is certain. As deepfake technology gets more sophisticated, so too will our KYC and identity verification tools.<br></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, recently released <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" title="Zero Trust Architecture">SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture</a>. The NIST special publication examines the principles of and motivations for ZTA, as well as implementation considerations, security concerns, and suggestions for improvements to architecture. NIST SPs are authored primarily for consumption by other US government agencies. In practice, however, their documents often become de facto standards and guidelines used more broadly in industry. In this post I’ll review the strengths of the SP and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The NIST document serves as a good introduction for ZTA. The authors correctly describe the fundamental principles of ZTA, which are a combination of traditional security tenets of Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth. In practice, Least Privilege means only granting sufficient permissions to accomplish specific actions and not more than that; Defense-in-Depth means inserting layers and gates of security at all relevant control points in a use case. Wide open networks behind firewalls are easy targets. These ideas have become more commonly accepted in modern security architectures, as organizations realize that firewalls and other perimeter-based designs are porous and not sufficient for protecting against proliferating threats.</p>
 Zero Trust Architecture is more than networks – it is also about data and applications 
<p>We have often heard about “Zero Trust Networking” at trade shows and conferences. SP 800-207 does a good job of explaining that ZTA is not limited to networks. In fact, ZTA must transcend network-layer thinking in order to be successful. ZTA requires proper authentication and authorization for each session involving users, applications, networks (including clouds), and data. Other key components of ZTA are continuous risk-adaptive authentication and dynamic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 references OASIS XACML 2.0 architecture, including Policy Administration Points (PAPs), Policy Decision Points (PDPs), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The document should have referenced the updated <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html" title="XACML 3.0">XACML 3.0</a>, which contains the elements of Obligations and Advice that can be used in ZTA scenarios where risk-adaptive authentication and authorization may be required by policies. There are also rule and policy combining algorithm optimizations in v. 3 that fit better with the description of Trust Algorithms in the NIST SP (p. 17).</p>
 Does the new NIST standard meet all requirements? 
<p>SP 800-207 defines conceptual components that go beyond the standard XACML PAP/PDP/PEP reference architecture. In my view, the breakdown of PDP into Policy Engine and Policy Administrator doesn’t add value and can create confusion. The XACML 3.0 reference architecture is still valid today, and is used in authorization and access control solutions even where explicit support for the XACML language is missing.</p>
<p>The illustration and definition of contributing components in Figure 2 (p. 9), namely CDM System, Industry Compliance, Activity Logs, SIEM System, etc. adhere to other US federal program definitions, but do not exactly match common usage. For example, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) roughly translate to asset, vulnerability, and configuration management. Industry Compliance is not a set of functions localized to one product or platform. Activity logs are consumed by SIEM, SOAR, and forensics tools. Some extrapolation and normalization of terminology and illustration may make this section applicable outside the US government.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 claims that threat intelligence “is the only component that will most likely be under the control of a service rather than the enterprise” (p. 19). Such a view discounts the prevalence and use of Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and other kinds of 3rd-party services, including discrete authentication services, and fraud risk services. At KuppingerCole, expect to see more usage and development of additional modular functional services that can enhance the ZTA authentication and authorization experiences for enterprises, covering all permutations of user-device-app-data interactions.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the new doc addresses use cases and deployment scenarios:</p>
 
 Enterprises with satellite offices (includes teleworkers) 
 Multi-cloud/cloud-to-cloud enterprises 
 Contractors and non-employee access 
 Cross domain collaboration 
 Public and/or consumer facing organizations 
 
<p>There are some variations to these use cases that could use additional detail, such as more about remote workforces and cloud-native enterprises. Section 4 is good starting point for planning how to migrate to ZTA.</p>
 What are the threats when looking into a Zero Trust Architecture? 
<p>Most discussions of ZTA tend to highlight the security advantages, of which there are several. Section 5 of SP 800-207 provides a list of possible threats specific to ZTA that industry needs to consider and begin mitigating against. Of special note here are DoS attacks on PDPs, the need for full enterprise monitoring (not just endpoint or network), and potential weaknesses in proprietary/non-standard APIs.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 also lists the use of non-person entities in ZTA administration as a possible threat. It is true that innovative IAM and IGA solutions increasingly employ non-person agents/processes to reduce the workload on human admins. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to:</p>
 
 assign roles and permissions to users at on-boarding based on attributes and entitlements that their peers have 
 perform User Behavioral Analysis (UBA) and provide confidence scores per session 
 analyze device intelligence to determine if the sources of access requests are originating from authorized locations, properly patched, free of malware, etc. 
 process the output of UBA, device intel, and other types of threat intelligence to generate risk scores per session. 
 
<p>It is possible that ML detection models can be manipulated (or gamed) to produce both false positives and negatives, and these outcomes can then be exploited by malicious actors. Even though these types of attacks require sophistication, such attacks have migrated from the theoretical to the real world. Vendors and implementers must take knowledge of these scenarios into consideration when performing threat modeling.</p>
 There is a need for standardization in Zero Trust Architectures 
<p>NIST correctly surmises the need for standardization in ZTA, especially in the areas of APIs. Most identity and security products expose APIs for other applications to use, therefore securing these APIs must be a top priority. The proprietary nature of APIs is itself a source of security concern.</p>
<p>In summary, NIST SP 800-207 is a good primer on ZTA which includes some high-level, practical design advice. The authors clearly state that there is no single ZTA solution, and that the road to fully instrumented ZTA is a long one.</p>

					 <p>We’re continuing our COVID-19 blog series interviews with Leah Houston, MD. Leah is an emergency doctor that has practiced medicine across the United States for nearly 10 years. She is currently working on an identity project around physician and later patient identities using <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We asked Leah to share her thoughts on how SSI can not only play a role in the medical industry but also impact the world during COVID-19. Check out the interview below!</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Tells us some more about your company. What is it called? What is its purpose? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>The project is called <a href="https://hpec.io">HPEC</a>. HPEC stands for humanitarian, physicians, empowerment, community. For those of you who’ve been involved in the identity discussion, you understand that it’s all about community, and it’s about connecting with others. Your identity is used to interact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We as physicians have to constantly interact with each other in order to coordinate care for patients. But right now, there’s no way for us to do that in a streamlined way. As with every other form of digital communication, the process is centralized. So if you’re working in a hospital, you only are able to communicate with doctors in that hospital. If you work for an insurance network, you’re only able to send patients to other doctors in that insurance network if you want the patient’s care to be covered. HPEC decentralizes all of that and allows everyone to interact with each other regardless of policy, practice, location, or specialty, so doctors can get their patients the best care.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 How does HPEC use SSI? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>When we document things as physicians, we’re really recording what happened in the patient encounter, so we can call upon the information in the future when needed. If the patient comes back in six months, we can look at the records and answer questions such as: Why did we give that medication, or what surgery did they have and when? But documenting the interaction is also important when communicating with other medical professionals. If I’m sending my private practice patient to an orthopedic surgeon, I want to be able to send the surgeon the patient’s relevant medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, physicians record their documentation on electronic health records (EHRs). And similar to any digital documentation, especially over the internet, we have the same problem where physicians have to choose one EHR, and then the information is all trapped there. The EHRs don’t talk to each other, and there’s no standards for interoperability. So there’s a lot of friction with being able to share that information among physicians and with patients being able to access that information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that we are building a self-sovereign identity solution for the practicing physician, so they can log in, document, and share this information in a streamlined and standardized way.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What was the catalyst for you to begin using SSI technology? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Something happened to me that made me really wake up to this problem and then this potential solution—a hospital that I was previously working for stole my identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were using my professional brand, NPI numbers, and license numbers to bill under my name when I wasn’t even in that hospital anymore. That kind of turned on a light bulb. I had learned about identity (self-sovereign identity was very, very early in that stage), but I had read about identity solutions around voting and around resource allocation, especially in emerging economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realized that SSI would have not only prevented what happened to me but could be used to alleviate a lot of the friction in our current healthcare system.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 In the healthcare industry, what are the COVID-19 related use cases where SSI and verifiable credentials would be most helpful? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity brings privacy, security, and trust to the individual, without the individual having to reveal all of their identifying information. When it comes to COVID-19 and safety in businesses (especially in healthcare facilities like nursing homes), there might be some rules that employers create or that governments start mandating where you might need to have a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to go to work or enter the facility. But do you really need to show a piece of paper that contains a lot of personal information such as your name, phone number, and other lab tests you did that day? No. SSI makes it so you don’t have to.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What do you think it will take for the healthcare industry to begin adopting SSI as a viable solution to combat the risks of COVID-19 in the use cases you mentioned above? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>Well, unfortunately as with everything else, show me the money. It has to demonstrate that it’s going to save money somewhere. If I am not allowed to go to work unless I prove that I’ve had a recent COVID-19 test, and I don’t have a solution for that, then that hits me in my wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if there’s an app that I can easily download, store my negative COVID-19 test result in it as a verifiable credential, and be able to show that to my employer, then we have a solution. So it’s going to have to be public, private partnerships and individuals who demand to use it. Those individuals may be CEOs of companies who want to get people back to work or they may be the individuals who want to be able to go back to work, board an airplane, go on a cruise, go to the movies, or send their children back to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of a leap when it comes to understanding how SSI is a solution, which I think is also somewhat of a barrier, but I think these kinds of conversations are going to help open that up.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What advice would you give to physicians and other healthcare professionals who would like to learn about SSI but don't know where to start? 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 <p>What people really need are developers who can build these platforms and make them user friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if people want to just learn about SSI in general and understand what it means, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSI Meetup</a> has a lot of really good webinars on SSI. The people who’ve been doing this for a long time—Drummond Reed, Kaliyah Young, Christopher Allen, Kim Hamilton Duffy—these individuals have written a lot on the topic. The information and leadership is out there. It just takes a little time to understand it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) software comes in many forms. Some are heavy with software components (the thick client model) while others are leaner (the thin client model). Since we at SSH.COM are firm believers in the thin client model, I wanted to present five solid reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p></p>
 1. No constant cycle of installing, patching and configuring agents 
<p>Thick clients require that you have to install agents on the client - and usually on the server as well. Moreover, you need to ensure that those agents are always up-to-date, patched and compatible with the operating system, and installed on every client necessary.</p>
<p>That’s not only a lot of steps but it’s a process that often requires the help of specialist staff which increases costs. On top of that, when access is no longer valid, you should ensure that the agent is actually removed from the client.</p>
<p>With a thin client, there is no need to install, remove or patch any agents at any point. We prefer a model where access is granted, managed and revoked using a standard browser - the only ‘software agent’ you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Less complexity means easier endpoint security management 
<p>Every piece of software component added to the environment adds complexity to the mix. The installation and configuration needs easily add up when people join the company, switch roles and leave. This is particularly true for 3rd parties whose access needs are often temporary.</p>
<p>Moreover, PAM solutions grant primarily admin-level access. Installing a required PAM agent requires (local) admin rights which in turn are often under the control of other solutions since they are privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Client installations might also require application black or whitelisting – which adds yet another management layer to the equation. In some cases, you might need to give local admin rights to 3rd parties to get them onboarded which might not always be a good idea or even against corporate policies.</p>
<p>All in all, having privileged software agents on clients adds up to surprisingly complex endpoint security management.</p>
<p>With a thin client model, you simply skip the PAM agent installation phase which saves a lot of time, effort and money and makes access management leaner. It also means that you can have an identical installation image for all clients intended for privileged users, and you can manage software and hardware upgrades, security policies, application changes virtually and remotely using that same image.</p>
<p>You can also ensure that the clients have only the bare minimum setup for the required tasks, so there is nothing to steal if the client is compromised.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this model reduces the number of misconfigurations. Since privileged users or 3rd parties don’t need to – and can’t - install anything to use the client, unauthorized software installations or installing viruses becomes unlikely.</p>
<p>Read more about <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/make_remote_work_secure_for_admins">making secure remote work fast &amp; secure for admins, devs and IT subcontractors here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Standard, plugin-free browser for minimized management 
<p>There are access management tools that work using browsers but require plugins for privileged user access to work. This is just points 1 and 2 wrapped inside a browser: are all the plugins up-to-date, who maintains them, who has the rights to install them, are they always compatible with the latest browser versions, is the browser set up correctly per client…</p>
<p>We believe in an approach where your standard browser is your only access management tool that you need to update. The official browser releases are always rigorously tested, and patches are fast and automatic which is not often the case with plugins or other software components. Once again, this model is straightforward and minimizes the number of configurations and reduces complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Thin in bloat, rich in features and usability 
<p>This point is almost ideological: many widely used applications – IT or otherwise - exist in the cloud and are based on thin clients, like Citrix Virtual Apps, Office 365 or Netflix just to name a few. With thin client PAM software, your developers get the same, consistent and secure experience across clients and your admins manage all access through a single pane of glass. Thin can be very rich in features: the features simply exist behind a clean looking UI.</p>
<p>This model is also very fast for onboarding: the developer just logs in to the centralized authority through a UI without anyone having to configure anything on the client. Switching clients becomes effortless. The number of access ticket requests is significantly smaller and training needs are radically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Respect your environment, minimize all changes 
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of immutable infrastructure, here’s a small breakdown of the idea. Once you have a particular environment set up and servers deployed, you don’t make any run-time changes to it. If you change something, you decommission the entire environment and spin up an entirely new instance instead. The benefit is more consistency, predictability and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Again, thin is key. Don’t install anything on the client or the server for that matter. When granting privileged access, you don’t even need to create any one-time passwords or temporary accounts on the server side either. All these processes require constant run-time changes and add unwanted complexity and unnecessary processes. We are suggesting that privileged access can be granted without permanent credentials with what we call <a href="https://www.ssh.com/iam/ephemeral_access/">ephemeral certificates</a>, in a <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/zoom-and-who-data-breaches-prove-need-passwordless-it-solution">passwordless</a> fashion and without making any kind of changes to your environment.</p>
<p>This might sound radical and we are fine with that reaction. Not all PAMs need to be the same: we built ours with a strong focus in the future which is mostly multi-cloud and hybrid driven. The fact that our solution, PrivX, is based on just-in-time authentication without a need for any type of permanent credentials for privileged users was just one of the reasons KuppingerCole credited us with one of the Overall Product Leaders in their <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management/">Leadership Compass 2020: Privileged Access Management</a>, as evidenced by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an innovative approach but one that does bring functional and security advantages – access is faster, onboarding and offboarding of privileged users is quick and there are no passwords to issue or lose, since there are no permanent leave-behind credentials”</p>
</blockquote>

 The merits of Rust for SSI and IAM software 



<p>Security is a top priority for network infrastructure, software solutions, and end-user applications that support interactions involving sensitive user data or personal information about real people and organizations.</p>



<p>Decentralized or not, any system which handles, transports, stores, or serves high value (digital) assets —&nbsp;especially solutions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and Identity and Access Management (IAM) — warrants rigorous scrutiny toward any vulnerability or oversight that may infringe on a user’s rights as a data subject.</p>



<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> really shines: the programming language is distinctive for its comprehensive focus on safety, security, correctness, and efficiency. All of these areas resonate extremely well with the dimensions and properties most important when developing digital identity solutions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the design of the language itself offers crucial advantages for security by effectively addressing a wide range of common, long-standing vulnerabilities affecting code written in other popular languages. To top it off, Rust provides markedly high performance, and opens up possibilities for embedded use cases.</p>



<p>It’s a promising sign, then, to see folks familiar with blockchain and other DLT technologies are showing embrace of Rust in their development work. Already at this early stage of adoption there is a sizeable array of tools and applications written in Rust that could well be implemented in IAM solutions based on SSI. This toolset nicely complements the core set of design-driven advantages for development previously mentioned.</p>



<p>Rust’s security guarantees are proving to be particularly desirable for the implementation of highly secure systems, like those used to manage user identities, access rights, and digital assets. Since SSI infrastructure must be capable of handling complex flows of value, the underlying technical infrastructure must be designed to sustain and secure that value. The distinctive features of Rust are particularly advantageous for these reasons.</p>



 Developing for SSI in Rust 



<p>As the SSI ecosystem is still maturing, only a limited number of production-ready solutions enjoy active deployment in real use cases, and even fewer are implemented in Rust.</p>



<p>That said, here are a couple ways we use Rust at Jolocom:</p>



  Certain core components of <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/wallet-rs">our open source library for SSI-based digital identity management</a> are implemented in Rust (available on GitHub). In particular, we migrated all plaintext private-key operations (e.g. signing, decryption) into Rust code in order to minimize risk posed by malicious dependency attacks in JS runtimes, as well as to provide a safe, portable, consistent, and well-understood set of crypto tools with an easy-to-use API.  



  A Rust implementation of the “KERI” Core Library — KERIOX — is well underway. <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI (“Key Event Receipt Infrastructure”)</a> is an event-based Distributed Key Management Infrastructure which provides the same security and verifiability properties for transactions as a blockchain or distributed ledger, without the overhead of requiring an absolute global ordering of transactions. The system is designed to provide a secure identifier-based “trust spanning layer” for any stack. The open source project is under active development in collaboration with <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF — the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, where we’ve been a member-organization <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-the-next-generation-of-digital-life/">since early 2018</a>.   



<p>With such tremendous potential in cross-industry collaboration, we want to help catalyze and coordinate any opportunities for mutual enrichment and growth by building up the common ground shared by Rust and SSI communities.</p>



<p>In fact, we are actively seeking an experienced software engineer with knowledge in Rust —&nbsp;here’s <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-rust-software-engineer/">more on the open position</a> in case you or someone you know may be interested in joining the Jolocom team!</p>



  



<p>As a 12-person, purpose-driven organization stewarding an open source project to create a common infrastructure for digital identity and rehash our society’s relationship to personal data — we at Jolocom definitely place an emphasis on community engagement as a core value. For that reason we are always looking for ways to contribute back to the people and communities which help make a positive impact on and off the Web.</p>



 That is why for this year’s <a href="https://rustconf.com">RustConf</a>, Jolocom is supporting the conference as an official sponsor! 



<p>We can’t wait to meet more of the community and explore the intersection of Rust and SSI alongside dedicated stakeholders, veterans, and enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Hope to see you on Thursday (Aug. 20) for the virtual conference.</p>



<p>Want to connect, but unable to attend next week? We’re always available to chat on <a href="https://gitter.im/jolocom/home">Gitter</a>.</p>
