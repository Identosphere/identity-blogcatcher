<p>If you’ve ever used a crypto wallet like MetaMask, you’ve used an externally owned account (EOA). It’s a simple pair of keys: a public address that acts as your identity and a private key that proves you own it. This model is powerful but rigid, putting the entire burden of security and complexity on the user. Lose your seed phrase? Your funds are gone forever. Find transactions confusing? The ecosystem has little flexibility to&nbsp;help.</p><p>A new standard is emerging to solve these problems, moving us from rigid key-based wallets to programmable, user-friendly interfaces. The answer is smart accounts.</p> What is a smart&nbsp;account? <p>A smart account (or smart wallet) is not controlled by a single private key. Instead, it is a smart contract that acts as your wallet. This shift from a key-based account to a contract-based account is revolutionary because smart contracts are programmable. They can be designed to manage assets and execute transactions based on customizable logic, enabling features that were previously impossible.</p><p>This transition is powered by account abstraction (AA), a concept that “abstracts away” the rigid requirements of EOAs, allowing smart contracts to initiate transactions. While the idea isn’t new, it recently gained mainstream traction thanks to a pivotal Ethereum standard: EIP-4337.</p> EIP-4337 (the game&nbsp;changer) <p>EIP-4337: Account Abstraction via Entry Point Contract achieved something critical: it brought native smart account capabilities to Ethereum without requiring changes to the core protocol. Instead of a hard fork, it introduced a higher-layer system that operates alongside the main&nbsp;network.</p> Here’s how it&nbsp;works:   UserOperations: You don’t send a traditional transaction. Instead, your smart account creates a UserOperation — a structured message that expresses your&nbsp;intent.  Bundlers: These network participants (such as block builders or validators) collect UserOperation objects, verify their validity, and bundle them into a single transaction.  Entry Point Contract: A single, standardized smart contract acts as a gatekeeper. It validates and executes these bundled operations according to the rules defined in each user’s smart&nbsp;account.  <p>This system is secure, decentralized, and incredibly flexible.</p> Other key proposals (EIP-3074 and EIP-7702) <p>The journey to account abstraction has involved other proposals, each with different approaches.</p>  EIP-3074: This proposal aimed to allow existing EOAs to delegate control to smart contracts (called invokers). While simpler in some ways, it raised security concerns due to the power given to invoker contracts. It has since been&nbsp;paused.  EIP-7702: Proposed by Vitalik Buterin, this upgrade would allow an EOA to temporarily grant transaction permissions to a smart contract. It offers a more elegant and secure model than EIP-3074 and may complement — rather than replace — the infrastructure built around EIP-4337.  <p>For now, EIP-4337 is the live standard that developers and wallets are adopting.</p> Why smart accounts&nbsp;matter <p>The real value of smart accounts lies in the user experience and security improvements they&nbsp;enable.</p>  Gas abstraction: Apps can pay transaction fees for their users or allow payment via credit card, removing a major barrier to&nbsp;entry.  Social recovery: Lose your device? Instead of a single seed phrase, you can assign “guardians” — other devices or trusted contacts — to help you recover&nbsp;access.  Batch transactions: Perform multiple actions in one click. For example, approve a token and swap it in a single transaction instead of&nbsp;two.  Session keys: Grant limited permissions to dApps. A game could perform actions on your behalf without being able to withdraw your&nbsp;assets.  Multi-factor security: Require multiple confirmations for high-value transactions, just like in traditional banking.   The future is programmable <p>Smart accounts represent a fundamental shift in how we interact with blockchains. They replace the “all-or-nothing” key model with programmable, flexible, and user-focused design. Major wallets like Safe, Argent, and Braavos are already leading the way, and infrastructure from providers like Stackup and Biconomy is making it easier for developers to integrate these features.</p><p>We’re moving beyond the era of the seed phrase. The future of Web3 wallets is smart, secure, and designed for everyone.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/how-smart-accounts-are-reinventing-the-web3-wallet-174364b1f038">How Smart Accounts Are Reinventing The Web3 Wallet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why competitive intelligence often fails in messaging 



<p>I’ve seen it firsthand: competitor battlecards stacking up in shared drives, analyst PDFs collecting dust, and persona research tucked into charts that never see daylight. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the noise and unsure where to even start. I’ve been there more times than I’d like to admit. The problem isn’t a lack of data; it’s the ability to digest it and translate it into messaging that actually differentiates. Without that step, teams fall back on the same empty claims: “innovative,” “customer-first,” “the most trusted.” Buyers tune it out. Competitive intelligence only works when it becomes narrative. The raw material exists: persona insights, competitor positioning, feature data – but without the right framework, it collapses into noise. In fact, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2025/04/01/the-evolution-of-b2b-buying-behavior-and-how-the-experience-must-adapt/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">83% of B2B buyers now expect personalization on par with consumer experiences</a>, which means vague promises no longer earn attention.</p>



 The three pillars of messaging that stand out 



 Buyer persona insights 



<p>Great messaging doesn’t start with features; it starts with people. Early on, I wrote messaging as if “the buyer” was a monolith. It fell flat. A CMO trying to differentiate a brand doesn’t think like a sales leader trying to speed up onboarding. Persona-based marketing insights can surface those distinctions, but the job of messaging is to speak to those specific goals and pain points, not to the broadest common denominator.</p>



 Competitor Messaging &amp; Positioning 



<p>Copycat messaging is the silent killer of differentiation. Throw the first stone if you’ve never obsessed over a competitor’s launch while paying too little attention to how they positioned their value. Competitive benchmarking is useful, but not if it leads you to recycle the same message with a “we do it better” twist. The real win comes from understanding where you truly differentiate and telling the story of why that matters in the first place.</p>



 Feature Differentiation That Resonates 



<p>I used to think listing every capability would convince buyers, but it never did. Features only matter when they connect to buyer outcomes that feel tangible. In fraud prevention, that might mean reducing chargeback losses by 40%. In cybersecurity, it might mean cutting breach detection time in half. The point is not to list what your product does but to anchor why it matters in the buyer’s world, and only nerd about the specifics once you’ve already sold them on why it matters.</p>



 Generic vs persona-informed messaging 



<p>To show the difference, here’s a snapshot of how messaging shifts when intelligence is applied. Generic copy focuses on features and broad claims, while persona-informed messaging uses ICP data and persona pain points to connect with specific buyers.</p>



 



DomainGeneric MessagePersona-Informed MessagePersona ExampleFraud Prevention“We help enterprises stop fraud before it happens by detecting suspicious activity, flagging risky transactions, and protecting customer accounts. Our platform is designed to keep your business safe and secure.”<br>“You’re responsible for revenue protection across global sales flows, which means chargebacks and payment fraud land on your desk. Teams like yours cut chargeback losses by 40% with real-time fraud alerts that protect revenue without slowing deals. Buyers expect both outcomes: silent protection and measurable margin impact.”<br>VP of Sales, BDR LeaderFinancial Crimes Compliance (AML/KYC)“We help compliance teams stay audit-ready with AML and KYC tools that reduce risk, cut down on false positives, and keep your business aligned with evolving regulations.”“As Chief Compliance Officer, you know false positives are the hidden tax on your team. Cutting them by 50 percent means analysts focus on true risk while you stay audit-ready against FATF and DOJ scrutiny. Clients report faster SAR filing cycles and stronger exam outcomes that regulators can see.”Chief Compliance OfficerCybersecurity / Threat IntelligenceWe help enterprises stay ahead of account takeover, session hijacking, and phishing attacks with advanced detection and monitoring that safeguard sensitive data and protect customer accounts.”“Your bottleneck probably isn’t a lack of MFA; it’s gaps in mobile session integrity and weak recovery bindings. Leading platforms now combine FIDO2 passkeys, device certificates, runtime attestation, and behavioral biometrics into a single API. Results often show 90–99% reductions in ATO flows and deployments measured in weeks, not quarters, while fitting directly into CI/CD pipelines.”CISOTrust &amp; Safety (Age Assurance, Platform Integrity)“We help platforms create safe online spaces by stopping fake accounts, preventing underage sign-ups, and protecting users from harmful activity. Our solution builds trust across your community.”“You’ve grown marketplaces quickly, but fake accounts and underage signups erode trust as fast as growth builds it. Trust &amp; Safety leaders block fraudulent accounts at scale, improving conversion while lifting NPS. Clients see measurable drops in fake account creation alongside sustained growth.”<br>Head of Trust &amp; Safety<br>Risk Management“We help companies manage third-party risk by identifying potential vulnerabilities, monitoring vendor compliance, and providing visibility across your supply chain.”“Your mandate is to catch vendor risk before it turns into tomorrow’s crisis. Risk leaders using continuous monitoring spot supplier red flags weeks earlier. That foresight prevents compliance failures and costly breaches that would otherwise reach the boardroom.”<br>CRO, Risk Manager



 



<p>This table turns the theory into practice: with competitive intelligence in play, messaging shifts from broad and forgettable to precise and compelling.</p>



<p>The challenge, of course, is scale. Tailoring a handful of persona-informed messages is one thing. Refreshing them continuously across dozens of campaigns, competitors, and markets is another. That’s where <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03Jw8LW0">AI-enhanced intelligence platforms</a> become indispensable. By monitoring live market signals, competitor narratives, and persona insights, AI can help us surface fresh message updates, stress-test positioning, and keep playbooks aligned with the market, so teams never slip back into generic messaging.</p>



 A framework for refreshing messaging without reinventing the wheel 



<p>High-performing teams do not wait for annual off-sites to rethink their messaging. They run refreshes as an ongoing discipline. So, how do we actually keep messaging fresh without burning cycles? Here is a practical process that has worked for us:</p>



 
 Collect signals continuously – competitor launches, persona survey data, market shifts. 



 Map signals to differentiation – identify where buyer priorities intersect with unique strengths. 



 Stress-test narratives – run them through sales conversations, campaign pilots, and post-call analytics. 



 Refresh, don’t rewrite – evolve messaging every few weeks, not every few quarters.<br> 
 



<p>The result is messaging that stays alive, tuned to the market, and sharper than the competition.</p>



 How leading teams operationalize competitive intelligence 



<p>It’s one thing to know the process, another to make it work at scale. The best GTM teams operationalize competitive intelligence through three capabilities:</p>



 1. Always-on market signals 



<p>Static PDFs cannot keep up with dynamic markets. Teams that win track real-time signals like funding rounds, regulatory shifts, competitor campaigns, and feed them straight into campaign planning.</p>



 2. Persona-level insights at scale 



<p>Instead of treating personas as theater, leading teams embed real-time buyer insights into campaigns and sales workflows. Every refresh reflects what buyers are actually thinking now, not last year.</p>



 3. Embedded intelligence in workflows 



<p>Intelligence only works if it lives where teams work: Slack alerts pushing industry shifts in real time, SEO content built on market truth, email campaigns aligned with buyer signals, and sales calls armed with live AI intelligence. Intelligence becomes actionable in the moment, not theoretical.</p>



 The challenge of messaging in niche markets 



<p>As adoption grows, so does the data: companies using competitive intelligence report a 15% boost in revenue growth. Platforms like <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03Jw8LW0">Link</a> are built to deliver these capabilities, from event monitoring and perpetual surveys to dynamic playbooks and post-call analytics. The real challenge is not more data, but the right data — intelligence that is specific enough to your market to make messaging credible and differentiated.</p>



<p>And this is where it gets tricky in niche markets. Sure, we can create a neat competitive battlecard, but what do we actually put on it if I don’t understand how the ICP is behaving in the real world? We can send a well-designed email, but if the target is a cybersecurity leader, they might care more about an upcoming TPRM webinar than a case study from the banking sector. The reality is that without specific, contextual intelligence, even polished campaigns miss the mark without the right segmentation.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, buyers don’t want platitudes; they want proof. In specialized markets, the cost of undifferentiated messaging isn’t just lost deals, it’s lost trust and stalled growth.</p>



 Key Takeaways 



 
 Competitive intelligence fails when it sits in decks and PDFs. It only creates value when it fuels differentiated narratives buyers actually hear. 



 Messaging that stands out comes from three things: persona insights, competitor positioning, and outcomes buyers can measure. 



 Refreshing messaging is not a one-off exercise. The teams that win treat it as an ongoing discipline. 



 Intelligence has to live where teams work: in Slack alerts, sales calls, campaigns, and content, so it becomes actionable in the moment. 



 In niche markets, buyers don’t want platitudes, they want proof. Miss that, and you lose both deals and trust.

<p>“Google recently <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference">gave us</a> something we’ve been waiting on for years: hard numbers on how much energy an AI prompt uses.” </p>



<p>According to their report, the median Gemini prompt consumes just 0.24 watt-hours of electricity — roughly running a microwave for a second — along with a few drops of water for cooling.</p>



<p>On its face, that sounds almost negligible. But the real story isn’t the number itself. It’s about incentives: who benefits, who pays, and how those dynamics shape how we deploy AI.</p>

 A history lesson from the cloud 



<p>To understand how incentives can blindside us, let’s revisit the cloud computing boom. You remember that, right? “Save all the money! Get rid of your datacenter! Cloud computing ftw!”</p>



<p>In 2021, Sarah Wang and Martin Casado of Andreessen Horowitz published “<a href="https://a16z.com/the-cost-of-cloud-a-trillion-dollar-paradox/">The Cost of Cloud: A Trillion-Dollar Paradox</a>.” They showed how cloud services, while indispensable for speed and agility, became a drag on profitability at scale. Dropbox famously repatriated workloads back from public cloud and saved $75 million over two years — a shift that doubled their gross margins from 33% to 67%. CrowdStrike and Zscaler adopted hybrid approaches for similar reasons.</p>



<p>The takeaway: Early incentives reward adoption. But when the bills grow large enough, cost discipline suddenly becomes a board-level issue. By then, inefficiency is already baked into operations.</p>



<p>AI energy use is following the same arc. Vendors and enterprises alike are celebrating adoption, but the hidden costs are waiting to surface.</p>



 The incentives for vendors 



<p>AI vendors want mass adoption, and their incentives reflect that. They’ll emphasize efficiency gains — like Gemini’s 33-fold reduction in energy per query from 2024 to 2025, according to their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/measuring-the-environmental-impact-of-ai-inference">recent report</a> — but those are selective disclosures.</p>



<p>As the MIT Tech Review story “In a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses” pointed out, disclosures become marketing tools without standardized metrics. Vendors reveal what flatters them, not necessarily what helps customers make better choices.</p>



<p>And the race to ship bigger, more capable models only deepens this misalignment. Scale brings revenue. The energy, water, and carbon costs? Those are someone else’s problem.</p>



 The incentives for enterprises 



<p>Enterprises often don’t see the full picture either. A cloud invoice hides the per-prompt costs. IAM and security teams grant permissions to agents, but they don’t own the sustainability budget. Sustainability teams, meanwhile, don’t have visibility into permissions and entitlements.</p>



<p>The result: over-provisioning goes unnoticed. AI agents are allowed to “just run,” and every permissioned action quietly consumes resources. Those costs add up, but they land in someone else’s ledger, often long after the decisions were made.</p>



<p>This is the same organizational mismatch cloud adoption created: IT ops pays the bill, developers get the flexibility, and the CFO finds out later. AI is just the next chapter.</p>



 Incentives and regulation 



<p>Here’s where things start to change. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting isn’t optional anymore; regulators are giving incentives real teeth.</p>



 
 United States: The SEC’s new climate disclosure rule requires large public companies to report greenhouse gas emissions. Failure to comply has already resulted in multimillion-dollar fines for ESG misstatements, like <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/dws-fined-19m-by-sec-over-esg-mis-statements-20230925">Deutsche Bank’s $19M settlement</a>. 



 Europe: The EU’s <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/financial-services-legislation/implementing-and-delegated-acts/corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive_en">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive</a> (CSRD) sets steep penalties. In Germany, fines can reach €10 million or 5% of turnover. In France, executives risk prison time for obstructing disclosures. 



 Australia: Directors must certify sustainability data as part of <a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/for-business-and-companies/companies/company-financial-reports/">financial filings</a>. Failure to comply can trigger civil penalties in the hundreds of millions, with individuals personally liable for up to AUD 1.565 million. 
 



<p>None of this is about fearmongering. (OK, maybe it’s a little bit of fearmongering in the hope of catching your attention.) It’s also a reality. Boards are now directly accountable for climate and resource disclosures. AI usage may feel “small” at the per-prompt level, but at enterprise scale, it becomes part of that regulatory picture.</p>



 Where identity comes in 



<p>So where does identity fit?</p>



<p>Every AI-agent action isn’t just a governance event; it’s also a consumption event. Permissions are no longer just about who can do what. They’re also about what we’re willing to pay, financially and environmentally, for them to do it.</p>



<p>Standing access matters here, too. A human user with unused entitlements is a risk; an AI with broad entitlements is a resource leak. It will happily keep churning until someone tells it to stop — and by then the costs have already piled up.</p>



<p>Imagine if your audit logs evolved to show not just “who accessed what,” but “how much energy and water those actions consumed.” It sounds futuristic, but sustainability reporting is heading in that direction. IAM teams may find themselves pulled into ESG conversations whether they want to be or not.</p>



 Runtime governance as sustainability 



<p>Earlier, I argued that runtime governance is essential when AIs can act faster than human oversight cycles. Here’s the sustainability angle: runtime checks can throttle not just security risks, but waste.</p>



 
 Deny agents the ability to hammer a system with brute-force permutations. 



 Flag actions that consume far more resources than typical queries. 



 Revoke unnecessary entitlements before they become both a risk and an expense. 
 



<p>Governance is shifting from “is this allowed?” to “is this worth it?”</p>



 Bridging past lessons with today’s challenges 



<p>The hidden costs of the cloud were supposed to teach us that efficiency ignored eventually becomes inefficiency entrenched. I’m not convinced people and organizations have learned that lesson, but regardless, AI is repeating that story, with energy, water, and carbon as the currencies.</p>



<p>Like cloud spend, AI resource usage may start small, but it scales faster than oversight cycles. And when regulations demand transparency, boards will want answers.</p>



<p>Identity leaders are uniquely positioned here. Permissions are the gate between an agent’s intent and its actions. Expanding the governance lens to include consumption could help organizations stay ahead of both the bills and the regulators.</p>



 Putting it together 



<p>So let’s put this together:</p>



 
 Vendors are incentivized by adoption and scale, not efficiency. 



 Enterprises have silos that hide true costs. 



 Regulators are introducing real penalties for climate and resource misstatements. 



 Identity teams are sitting at the chokepoint, granting permissions that double as consumption choices. 
 



<p>The shift isn’t about turning identity professionals into sustainability officers. It’s about recognizing that incentives travel with permissions. And when permissions scale through AI, the hidden costs travel with them.</p>



<p>So here’s my question for you: have you seen incentives around AI use in your organization, good or bad? And if so, how did those incentives shape the choices your teams made?</p>



<p>Because incentives aren’t just a policy issue or a compliance box. They’re the difference between governance, which you can explain to your board, and governance, which you only notice when the bill or the fine arrives.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:29] Hi everyone, and welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re going to talk about something that’s only just starting to make the headlines: what happens when AI agents run wild—and who actually ends up footing the bill.</p>



<p>Spoiler alert: it’s probably not the vendors themselves, and it’s probably not who you think inside your own organizations either.</p>



<p>[00:00:53] In this episode, we’ll explore:</p>



 
 The incentives driving AI adoption 



 The role of identity in hidden costs 



 The growing regulatory landscape around sustainability 
 



 



 Setting the Stage 



<p>[00:01:04] What inspired today’s conversation is a recent Google report that finally revealed some long-awaited data: how much energy a single AI prompt consumes.</p>



<p>[00:01:20] Their findings? The median Gemini prompt uses about 0.24 watt hours of electricity.</p>



<p>[00:01:28] To put it in perspective:</p>



 
 That’s like running your microwave for one second, plus a few drops of water for cooling. 



 At first glance, it seems tiny. But at scale, millions of these “drops in the ocean” can eventually flood entire continents. 
 



<p>[00:01:46] The real story isn’t about that single number. Instead, it’s about the incentives behind those numbers—who benefits, who pays, and how those dynamics shape AI deployment.</p>



 



 Lessons from the Cloud 



<p>[00:01:57] To understand today’s AI landscape, let’s rewind to the early days of cloud computing. Remember the pitch? “Save money, get rid of your data center—cloud computing for the win.”</p>



<p>[00:02:20] But by 2021, Sarah Wang and Martin Casado at Andreessen Horowitz highlighted the Trillion Dollar Paradox:</p>



 
 Cloud was amazing for speed and agility. 



 Yet at scale, it dragged on profitability. 
 



<p>[00:02:30] Dropbox learned this firsthand, repatriating workloads from the public cloud and saving $75 million over two years—doubling their margins in the process.</p>



<p>[00:02:51] The key lesson? Early incentives reward adoption. But once costs balloon, discipline becomes a board-level issue.</p>



<p>[00:03:10] AI is following the same arc. We’re in the “woohoo adoption” phase now, but hidden costs are waiting to catch up.</p>



 



 Vendor Incentives 



<p>[00:03:24] Let’s start with the incentives for LLM vendors. These are crystal clear: encourage mass adoption.</p>



<p>[00:03:33] Vendors emphasize efficiency gains. Google bragged about a 33-fold reduction in energy per query between 2024 and 2025.</p>



<p>[00:03:43] Sounds impressive. But disclosures are:</p>



 
 Not standardized 



 Highly selective 



 Designed to flatter the vendor, not inform customers 
 



<p>[00:03:53] Meanwhile, the race for bigger, flashier, more capable models continues. The revenue comes in, but the energy, water, and carbon costs are left as someone else’s problem.</p>



 



 Enterprise Incentives 



<p>[00:04:09] For enterprises, the picture is murkier. Why? Because:</p>



 
 Cloud invoices hide the per prompt cost. 



 IAM and security teams grant permissions but don’t own the sustainability budget. 



 Sustainability teams lack visibility into entitlements. 
 



<p>[00:04:34] The result?</p>



 
 Over-provisioning goes unnoticed. 



 AI agents run unchecked. 



 Bills land on someone’s desk long after the fact—often someone who had no say in granting permissions. 
 



<p>[00:04:58] This is déjà vu from the cloud era. Ops pays the bill, developers enjoy flexibility, and the CFO discovers the hit too late.</p>



 



 Regulators Enter the Chat 



<p>[00:05:03] Unlike the early cloud days, regulators are already watching. ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting is now mandatory in many regions.</p>



<p>[00:05:15] Examples include:</p>



 
 United States: SEC Climate Disclosure Rule, with fines already issued (e.g., Deutsche Bank’s $19M settlement). 



 Europe: Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with penalties up to €10 million or 5% of turnover. 



 France: Executives can face prison time for obstructing disclosures. 



 Australia: Civil penalties can reach hundreds of millions, with directors personally liable. 
 



<p>[00:06:20] This isn’t fearmongering—it’s reality. Boards are accountable, and one AI prompt may seem trivial, but multiplied across millions of queries, it becomes a regulatory reporting item.</p>



 



 Where Identity Comes In 



<p>[00:06:38] Every AI agent action is more than a governance event—it’s also a consumption event.</p>



 
 Permissions = not just who can do what, but what we’re willing to pay financially and environmentally. 



 An unused human entitlement is a risk. An AI with broad entitlements is a resource leak that runs until stopped. 
 



<p>[00:07:15] Imagine if audit logs didn’t just say who accessed what, but also recorded how much energy and water were consumed.</p>



<p>[00:07:24] That may sound futuristic, but sustainability reporting is moving that way. IAM teams could soon be pulled into ESG discussions—whether they feel it’s their role or not.</p>



 



 Governance Shifts 



<p>[00:07:37] Governance isn’t just about security anymore. With AI, it’s about balancing risk and resource consumption.</p>



 
 Runtime checks can throttle wasteful AI actions. 



 Agents can be denied brute-force or high-cost queries. 



 Entitlements can be revoked before they pile up into risks—or expenses. 
 



<p>[00:08:07] Governance now asks not only “Is this allowed?” but also “Is this worth it?”</p>



 



 History Repeats Itself 



<p>[00:08:14] Cloud should have taught us that ignored inefficiency becomes entrenched inefficiency. Once it’s embedded in infrastructure, it’s painfully hard to extract.</p>



<p>[00:08:38] AI is repeating that story—with water, energy, and carbon as the new currencies.</p>



<p>[00:08:54] When regulators demand transparency, boards will expect clear, defensible answers. And that’s where identity leaders can step up.</p>



<p>[00:09:01] Permissions sit at the choke point between agent intent and agent action. Expanding governance to include consumption metrics gives organizations a head start on both the bills and regulatory scrutiny.</p>



 



 Bringing It All Together 



<p>[00:09:16] To recap:</p>



 
 Vendors chase adoption and scale, not efficiency. 



 Enterprises operate in silos that hide true costs. 



 Regulators are introducing significant penalties for ESG misstatements. 



 Identity teams control permissions, which now double as consumption risks. 
 



<p>[00:09:41] IAM professionals don’t need to become sustainability officers. But they must recognize that incentives travel with permissions—and when AI scales, costs scale too.</p>



<p>[00:09:57] So here’s the key question:<br>Have you seen incentives around AI use in your organization—good or bad? And how are those incentives shaping your team’s decisions?</p>



<p>Because incentives aren’t just about compliance checkboxes. They’re the difference between proactive governance, you can explain to your board, and reactive governance, you only notice when the bill—or the fine—lands on your desk.</p>

<p>Thinking about adding Quarden Token to your crypto portfolio? You’re in the right place. This guide is designed for beginners, breaking down the process of buying Quarden Token into simple, manageable steps. We’ll cover everything you need to know, from setting up a secure crypto wallet to making your first purchase, so you can start your journey with confidence.</p>



 What Is Quarden Token? 



<p>Quarden Token (QDT) is the native cryptocurrency of the Quarden platform, an innovative digital marketplace that leverages blockchain technology to facilitate secure and accessible trading for both individuals and businesses. The token plays a central role in the platform’s ecosystem, enabling a range of functionalities, from streamlined transactions to reduced fees. By using the Quarden Token, users can engage in a new era of digital commerce that is efficient, transparent, and secure.</p>









 Step-by-Step Guide to Buying Quarden Token 



<p>Acquiring Quarden Token (QDT) can be done through a few different methods, but the most common for beginners is via a centralized exchange (CEX) or a decentralized exchange (DEX). Here is a general step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process.</p>



 Step 1: Choose a Crypto Exchange 



<p>The first step is to decide where you will buy the token.</p>



 
 Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are platforms like Binance or KuCoin. They are user-friendly, offer a simple interface, and typically allow you to buy crypto with fiat currency (like USD or EUR) via credit/debit card or bank transfer. Check if Quarden Token (QDT) is listed on your preferred exchange. 



 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): These exchanges, like Uniswap, allow you to trade directly from your crypto wallet without an intermediary. This method offers greater privacy but can be more complex for beginners and requires you to first own a base cryptocurrency (like Ethereum or another token on the same blockchain). 
 



 Step 2: Create an account and verify Your Identity 



<p>If you choose a CEX, you’ll need to create an account. This usually involves:</p>



 
 Providing an email address and creating a secure password. 



 Completing a “Know Your Customer” (KYC) verification process, which often requires you to upload a photo of your ID. This is a standard security measure. 
 









 Step 3: Fund Your Account 



<p>Once your account is set up and verified, you need to add funds.</p>



 
 CEX: You can deposit fiat currency using a credit/debit card or a bank transfer. 



 DEX: You will need to first purchase a base cryptocurrency (like ETH) from a CEX or another source and then send it to your crypto wallet. 
 



 Step 4: Buy Quarden Token (QDT) 



<p>Now you’re ready to make your purchase.</p>



 
 On a CEX: Navigate to the trading section of the exchange. Search for the Quarden Token (QDT) trading pair (e.g., QDT/USDT or QDT/ETH). Enter the amount you wish to buy and execute the trade. 



 On a DEX: Connect your crypto wallet to the DEX. Select your base currency and the Quarden Token (QDT). You may need to manually add the token’s contract address to the DEX if it’s not listed by default. Be extremely cautious and always get the official contract address from the Quarden website or a reliable source like CoinMarketCap to avoid scams. Once selected, confirm the swap. 
 



 Step 5: Store Your Quarden Token Securely 



<p>After purchasing, it’s highly recommended to transfer your Quarden Token to a secure, self-custody crypto wallet (like Trust Wallet or MetaMask). Leaving your tokens on an exchange exposes them to potential security risks. “Not your keys, not your coins” is a well-known adage in the crypto world, emphasizing the importance of holding your own private keys.</p>



 Tools and Platforms for Buying Quarden Token 



<p>To buy Quarden Token (QDT), you will need to use a crypto exchange and a secure wallet.() Here are some common platforms and tools you might use in the process:</p>



 Crypto Exchanges 



 
 Centralized Exchanges (CEXs): These are platforms that facilitate trading and are often the most straightforward option for beginners. They act as an intermediary, holding your funds in an account. Some of the most popular CEXs that may support Quarden Token (QDT) or other tokens you can use to buy them include: 



 Binance: One of the world’s largest exchanges, known for a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and a user-friendly interface. 



 KuCoin: A popular exchange with a large selection of altcoins, including new or less-common tokens. 



 Gate.io: A robust platform that often lists new projects and has a wide range of trading pairs. 



 Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): These platforms allow for direct peer-to-peer trading without an intermediary. You connect your personal wallet and swap tokens. DEXs are a key part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. 



 Uniswap: A leading DEX on the Ethereum network, often in the first place new tokens are available for trading. 
 









 Crypto Wallets 



<p>A crypto wallet is essential for securely storing your Quarden Token after you purchase it. Wallets can be categorized as “hot” (connected to the internet) or “cold” (offline).</p>



 
 Software Wallets (Hot Wallets): These are applications you can install on your computer or smartphone. They are convenient for frequent trading. 



 MetaMask: A widely used wallet, particularly for the Ethereum network and its tokens. 



 Trust Wallet: A popular mobile-first wallet known for its security and support for a vast number of cryptocurrencies. 



 Coinbase Wallet: A self-custody wallet that is a separate product from the Coinbase exchange, allowing you to manage your own private keys. 



 Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallets): These are physical devices that store your private keys offline, providing the highest level of security against hacks and malware. 



 Ledger Nano X: A highly-rated hardware wallet that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies. 



 Trezor Model T: Another top-tier hardware wallet known for its security features. 
 









<p>Always verify that the wallet you choose is compatible with the blockchain on which Quarden Token (QDT) operates and that you are downloading the official app or software from a trusted source.</p>



 Tips for Safe Quarden Token Purchases 



<p>As with any cryptocurrency, exercising caution and following best practices is essential for securing your investment in Quarden Token. Crypto space, while full of innovation, is also a target for scams and fraudulent activities.</p>



 
 Verify the Official Contract Address 
 



<p>Before making any transaction on a decentralized exchange (DEX), double-check that you have the correct and official contract address for Quarden Token (QDT). Scammers often create fake tokens with similar names to trick users. Always get the address from the official Quarden website or a trusted, reputable source like CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko.</p>



 
 Use Secure Wallets 
 



<p>After purchasing your tokens, it is strongly recommended to move them off the exchange and into a secure, self-custody wallet. For long-term storage, a hardware wallet (cold storage) offers the highest level of security as it keeps your private keys offline.</p>



 
 Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
 



<p>Always enable 2FA on any exchange account or platform you use. This adds an extra layer of security, making it much more difficult for an unauthorized person to access your account, even if they have your password.</p>









 
 Beware of Phishing and Scams 
 



<p>Be skeptical of unsolicited messages, emails, or social media posts promising giveaways or special investment opportunities related to Quarden Token. These are almost always scams. Never share your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords with anyone.</p>



 
 Do Your Own Research (DYOR) 
 



<p>The most important tip is to conduct thorough research. Understand the project’s whitepaper, its use case, and the team behind it. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose, and be aware of the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Buying Quarden Token (QDT) can be a straightforward process once you understand the key steps involved. By following this guide, from selecting a secure exchange to storing your tokens safely in a crypto wallet, you can confidently add QDT to your portfolio. As with any investment, always prioritize security and conduct your own research to make informed decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Real estate professionals face rising AML scrutiny across markets. This article breaks down identity verification, source of funds, and beneficial ownership rules in the U.S., Canada, UK, EU, and Australia – and shows how iComply helps automate compliance across agents, lawyers, and lenders.</p>
 
 Real estate is a prime target for financial crime. High-value transactions, opaque ownership structures, and limited oversight have made the sector vulnerable to money laundering worldwide. 
<p>From regulators to investigative journalists, scrutiny is intensifying, compliance expectations are evolving. Brokers, lawyers, developers, mortgage professionals, and title companies all have a role to play.</p>
 
 Shifting AML Expectations in Real Estate 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, state real estate commissions 
 Requirements: Geographic targeting orders (GTOs), beneficial ownership reporting (CTA), SARs, and KYC for buyers and entities 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulators: FINTRAC, provincial real estate councils 
 Requirements: KYC, source of funds verification, PEP/sanctions screening, STRs, and compliance program requirements (as reinforced by the Cullen Commission) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: HMRC, FCA (for lenders), SRA (for law firms) 
 Requirements: Client due diligence, UBO checks, transaction monitoring, and compliance under MLR 2017 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National AML authorities under AMLD6 
 Requirements: Risk-based customer due diligence, UBO transparency, STRs, and GDPR-aligned reporting 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC (legislation pending for real estate-specific coverage) 
 Requirements: AML risk management for law firms, lenders, and trust accounts; expected expansion to include property professionals 
 
 
 Real Estate-Specific Risk Factors 
<p>1. Complex Ownership Structures<br>
Use of shell companies, nominees, and trusts can obscure true buyers.</p>
<p>2. Source of Funds Obscurity<br>
Large cash deposits or offshore funding require enhanced scrutiny.</p>
<p>3. Multi-Party Transactions<br>
Buyers, sellers, agents, lawyers, lenders, and developers often use disconnected systems.</p>
<p>4. Regulatory Patchwork<br>
Requirements vary by jurisdiction and professional role.</p>
 
 How iComply Helps Real Estate Professionals Stay Compliant 
<p>iComply enables unified compliance across real estate workflows—from individual onboarding to multi-party coordination.</p>
 1. Identity and Entity Verification 
 
 KYC/KYB onboarding via secure, white-labeled portals 
 Support for 14,000+ ID types in 195 countries 
 UBO discovery and documentation 
 
 2. Source of Funds Checks 
 
 Collect and validate financial statements, employment records, or declarations 
 Risk-based automation of EDD triggers 
 Document retention for regulator inspection 
 
 3. Sanctions and Risk Screening 
 
 Real-time screening of all participants (buyers, sellers, brokers, law firms) 
 Automated refresh cycles and trigger alerts 
 
 4. Cross-Party Case Collaboration 
 
 Connect agents, legal counsel, and lenders in a single audit-ready file 
 Assign roles, track tasks, and escalate within shared dashboards 
 
 5. Data Residency and Privacy Compliance 
 
 Edge computing ensures PII is encrypted before upload 
 Compliant with PIPEDA, GDPR, and U.S. state laws 
 On-premise or cloud deployment options 
 
 
 Case Insight: Vancouver Brokerage 
<p>A Canadian real estate firm used iComply to digitize ID checks and SoF verification for domestic and foreign buyers:</p>
 
 Reduced onboarding time by 65% 
 Flagged two nominee structures linked to offshore trusts 
 Passed a FINTRAC audit with zero deficiencies 
 
 
 Final Take 
<p>Real estate professionals can no longer afford fragmented compliance. With global pressure mounting, smart automation ensures faster onboarding, better oversight, and fewer audit risks.</p>
<p>Talk to iComply to learn how we help brokers, lawyers, and lenders unify AML workflows – without slowing down the deal.</p>

            <p>• The Danish Ministry of Defence has selected SAMP/T NG to strengthen its air defence and ensure interoperability with European and NATO armed forces.</p>
<p>• The SAMP/T NG system is a mobile ground-to-air system designed to intercept and destroy medium range ballistic missiles, aircraft and drones.</p>
<p>• Thales, integrator of the SAMP/T NG system in collaboration with MBDA, also provides the Ground Fire air defence surveillance radar. Produced in series since the beginning of the year 2025, this radar offers revolutionary performance with a range of up to 400 km and panoramic coverage at 360° and 90° elevation.</p>

             <br>
 
 
 
SAMP/T NG (c)eurosam

<p>Initially designed to handle the Aster family’s ammunition (A30 B1 and A30 B1NT), for which Thales provides the seeker, a key element in missile guidance, each Danish section of the SAMP/T NG will rely on Thales's Ground Fire radar, as well as on the Command and Control (Engagement Module New Generation), for which Thales is the design authority, and which is produced by Thales in cooperation with MBDA.</p>
<p>Based on fully digital active electronically scanned antennas (AESA) technology, the Ground Fire radar offers a high level of performance to detect, track and classify numerous targets, including in the most complex environments such as mountainous regions and high-traffic airspace. This radar offers a refresh rate of only 1 second and a surveillance capacity up to 400 km, with panoramic coverage at 360° and 90° elevation. It is capable of detecting drones, as well as ballistic missiles, taking advantage of the mobility of a tactical radar.</p>
<p>The open architecture of the SAMP/T NG system, designed by Thales, facilitates its integration and interoperability with other European systems, thus enhancing the air defence capabilities of the continent. The Ground Fire ensures strategic autonomy, with high operational readiness. Its design allows a high level of mobility, with reduced installation and dismantling times and compact dimensions equivalent to those of an ISO transport container.</p>
<p>The Ground Fire maximizes the performance of the new generation ASTER 30 and positions France among the leaders in air defence and medium-range antimissile defence.</p>
<p>The SAMP/T NG programme is overseen by the Organisation Conjointe de Coopération en matière d'Armement (OCCAR). Eurosam, a joint-venture between Thales and MBDA, is the lead contractor for the entire system.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales is honoured by the choice made by the Danish authorities. With Eurosam and MBDA, we sincerely thank our client for their trust. The Danish armed forces will benefit from a state-of-the-art system to guarantee the protection of their airspace and contribute to the defence of European countries and NATO.” said Hervé Dammann, Executive Vice-President, Land and Air Systems, Thales. </p></blockquote>
<p>Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies for the Defence, Aerospace, and Cyber &amp; Digital sectors. Its portfolio of innovative products and services addresses several major challenges: sovereignty, security, sustainability and inclusion.</p>
<p>The Group invests more than €4 billion per year in Research &amp; Development in key areas, particularly for critical environments, such as Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity, quantum and cloud technologies. Thales has more than 83,000 employees in 68 countries. In 2024, the Group generated sales of €20.6 billion.</p>

<p>New guidance from the Wolfsberg Group - a collection of twelve major global banks that sets industry guidelines for financial crime risk management - offers a blueprint for banks that wish to offer services to stablecoin issuers in a safe and sound manner.&nbsp;<br><br>The Wolfsberg Group’s <a href="https://wolfsberg-group.org/resources/204/">guidance</a> on the provision of banking services to stablecoin issuers, published on September 8, comes at a time when a growing number of banks are exploring opportunities to innovate through digital assets and stablecoins. In addition to launching their own stablecoins, a growing number of banks are exploring how they can offer services - such as reserve management, operating accounts, and others - to stablecoin issuers.&nbsp;<br><br>New regulatory requirements on stablecoins coming into effect around the world from the US, <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/mica-stablecoin-provisions-live-with-circle-first-issuer-to-obtain-full-approval">European Union</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfsberg-group.org/resources/204/"> Asia-Pacific </a>(APAC), and elsewhere require that stablecoin issuers maintain full backing of their token with adequate reserves held at a supervised financial institution. As such, the banking industry stands to play an important role in the rapidly growing stablecoin ecosystem - and providing services to issuers has the potential to serve as a <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/five-profitable-ways-banks-can-engage-with-stablecoins">new and attractive revenue stream for banks</a> that can do so in a compliant manner.&nbsp;<br><br>Doing so, of course, requires that banks take steps to manage risks associated with stablecoin issuer relationships they establish - and the Wolfsberg Guidance establishes several principles that banks should follow. Importantly, the guidance rests on the notion that banks should be able to leverage existing anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risk management principles and frameworks that they already apply in their broader compliance and government arrangements, without having to reinvent the wheel.&nbsp;<br><br>In particular, the Wolfsberg guidance encourages banks to draw on correspondent banking standards when conducting AML/CFT due diligence on stablecoin issuers they service. Thus, at onboarding and on an ongoing basis, a bank should apply a risk-based approach to evaluating the risk associated with issuers. This should include taking account of the nature of the relationship, the issuer’s regulatory status, the sufficiency of its own AML/CFT arrangements, and information about the nature and purpose of its underlying stablecoin ecosystem.&nbsp;<br><br>On this last point, Wolfsberg advises that a bank’s compliance team should assess whether the issuer has an understanding of financial crime risks inherent in its stablecoin ecosystem, and the nature of controls - including blockchain analytics solutions - that the issuer uses to ensure that it operates in a manner consistent with its own risk appetite.&nbsp;<br><br>When it comes to monitoring the stablecoin issuer’s banking activity, Wolfsberg further advises that the bank should focus on risk based monitoring arrangements that allow the bank to assess whether the issuer is adhering to its stated risk appetite. Using a risk-based approach, a bank’s compliance team may opt to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/solutions/issuer-due-diligence">leverage blockchain analytics solutions</a> that allow the bank to verify its due diligence on the issuer and identify any significant changes to the issuer’s risk profile.&nbsp;<br><br>The Wolfberg Guidance is an important step forward in enabling banks to engage with the stablecoin space in a manner consistent with long-standing AML/CFT risk management principles - and will help to bolster the nascent regulatory regimes that offer a foundation for the growth and increasing adoption of stablecoins.<br><br>To learn more about the Wolfsberg guidance on banking stablecoin issuers and its implications for on-chain monitoring arrangements, read our full analysis <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-wolfsberg-groups-guidance-on-banking-stablecoin-issuers-harnessing-on-chain-insights-to-assess-risk">here</a>. &nbsp;</p>

Expanding our view toward six guiding principles for regenerative practice. Image: Dark Matter Labs. Adapted from <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/us/en/insights/insights-blog/moving-beyond-carbon-tunnel-vision-with-a-sustainability-data-strategy-codex7121">Jan Konietzko</a>, ‘Carbon Tunnel&nbsp;Vision’. Possibilities for the Built Environment, part 1 of&nbsp;3 <p>This is the first in a series of three provocations, which mark the cumulation of a collaborative effort between Dark Matter Labs and <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/">Bauhaus Earth</a> to consider a regenerative future for the built environment as part of the <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt</a>&nbsp;project.</p><p>In this publication, we lay out the historical, professional and theoretical context for the contemporary push toward regenerative practice, and offer six guiding principles for a regenerative built environment, looking beyond profit tunnel-vision. In the second and third pieces, we propose pathways, configurations and indicators of the transformation our team envisions.</p> What isn’t regenerative? Debunking a misconception <p>When it was completed in 2014, Bosco Verticale, a pair of 40-story residential towers on Milan’s outskirts, was celebrated as an example of leading-edge regenerative building design for the 800 or so trees cascading from its balconies. In describing the project, its architect Stefano Boeri sketches the figure of the “<a href="https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/buildings/bosco-verticale-by-stefano%E2%80%86boeri-architetti">biological architect</a>”, who is driven by biophilia and prizes sustainability above other design concerns. Praise for Bosco Verticale, in the architectural press and beyond, implies that the development’s vegetal adornments represent a meaningful substitution of traditional building materials with bio-based ones, and further that measures supporting biodiversity constitute climate-positive architecture.</p><p>The list of green credentials associated with the project ignores other characteristics of Bosco Verticale that don’t align with this vision. The steel-reinforced concrete structure was designed with unusually substantial <a href="https://store.ctbuh.org/index.php?controller=attachment&amp;id_attachment=32">28cm deep slabs</a> to support the vegetation’s weight (which totals an estimated 675 metric tons) and associated dynamic loads. Considering that this slab depth is about twice that of comparable buildings without the green facade, the embodied carbon associated with the project’s 30,000m² floor slabs alone is approximately double that of a standard building.</p><p>In tandem, an existing workspace for local artists and artisans based in a former industrial building was demolished to make space for the premium residential units accessible only to the few. Although a replacement workspace was eventually built nearby, the structure’s regenerative aspirations are weighed down by profound contradictions beneath the leafy&nbsp;surface.</p><p>Certainly, Bosco Verticale is significant as an exceptional investment in urban greening on the part of the developer, and as a leading-edge demonstration of innovations that enhance the multiple benefits of green infrastructure. Bosco Verticale contributed to the viability of future developments that extend the geographic reach of urban greening discourse into new geographies: copy-cat schemes have been built in East Asia and elsewhere. However, it’s clear that Bosco Verticale fails to stand up to a holistic consideration of what regenerative building looks like. Many voices overlooked the social and material impacts of the project, instead dazzled by the urban greening.</p> Puzzle pieces of the regenerative <p>In recent years, societies worldwide have become familiar with weather events and political shifts that were unprecedented or previously unthinkable. Six of the nine planetary boundaries that demarcate the safe operating space for humanity were crossed as of 2023. There is now a strong case for the idea that our entangled human and planetary systems exist in a state of <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/polycrisis-adam-tooze-historian-explains/">polycrisis</a>. Bearing this in mind, what do we mean when we refer to a built environment that is regenerative?</p><p>This piece aims to add nuance and system-scale perspective to our working definitions. As examples like Bosco Verticale show, it’s possible to be green in the public eye while counteracting what is regenerative. Perhaps we need new methods to help us understand:</p>  How long a building will&nbsp;last,  How its materials will be stewarded,  Whether it is built in a context that enables low-carbon living,  And what its end of life might&nbsp;involve.  <p>System-scale perspective is needed because the built environment cannot be disentangled from systemic needs like the demand for affordable housing and the reality of physical, material constraints. Although we do need initial demonstrations to spark change, a single, locally-sourced timber building constructed with ethical labour does not define wholly regenerative practice in&nbsp;itself.</p> What is regenerative? <p>Regenerative is the term of the moment, yet it remains loosely defined in public discourse: we rely on examples, implicit understandings, and theoretical frameworks to give it meaning. How, then, is it used in particular contexts?</p> Beyond ‘green’ <p>Regeneration refers to approaches that seek to balance human and natural systems, allowing for coexistence, repair and self-regulation over&nbsp;time.</p><p>The regenerative paradigm seeks to look beyond what’s merely ‘green’, and to do net good. A broader lineage of thinking around the term spans agriculture, biology and ecology, medicine, urbanism and design: disciplines and industries that connect to the health and wellbeing of biomes, bodies and buildings. Variation in definition can be observed in different contexts, sectors and&nbsp;aims.</p><blockquote>‘Regenerative’: a brief history of the&nbsp;term</blockquote><blockquote>The term regenerative began to gain traction in fields including agriculture and development to outline a new paradigm from the 1980s. The US’ <a href="https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/organic-basics/regenerative-organic-agriculture/">Rodale Institute</a> popularised the term ‘regenerative agriculture’ to describe farming systems that go beyond sustainability by improving soil, biodiversity and ecosystem health. The practices invoked are ancient, with precedents across the globe, and rooted in Indigenous land management. However, this specific application of the term ‘regenerative’ articulated an emergent attitude in this period that focused on renewal and improvement of ecological and social systems. The Rodale Institute advanced this concept through research, advocacy, farmer training, publications and consumer education geared toward regenerative organic agriculture, laying the groundwork for its integration into mainstream agricultural discourse and integration into other disciplines.</blockquote><blockquote>From the early 2000s, the <a href="https://regenesisgroup.com/resources/">work</a> of Bill Reed and the Regenesis Institute for Regenerative Practice has anchored the application of regeneration to design fields and the built environment in particular. With a focus on ecosystem renewal and coevolution of human and natural systems, Reed’s framework implies that regenerative design goes beyond sustainability by restoring and renewing ecosystems, integrating humans and nature in a symbiotic relationship. Expanding this idea beyond ecology, many architects and urbanists have adapted Reed’s model to their own corners of their fields, looking for design that doesn’t simply do less harm, but does more good. Bauhaus Earth maps Reed’s familiar bowtie-shaped diagram onto four basic categories for the built environment: from conventional, to green, to restorative and finally regenerative–that which has the greatest positive environmental and social&nbsp;impact.</blockquote><blockquote>Across applications, several elements of a core meaning of what is regenerative exist: a focus on supporting systems of different scales to recover from loss, to take on new life, to grow responsively. The evocative nature of this idea, easily applied across different disciplines, has inspired a range of permutations and schools of&nbsp;thought.</blockquote><blockquote>Other key references on the regenerative:</blockquote><blockquote>1 <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119149699">Regenerative Development</a>, Regenesis Group,&nbsp;2016.</blockquote><blockquote>2 <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273379786_Regenerative_Development_and_Design">Regenerative Development and Design</a>, Bill Reed and Pamela Mang,&nbsp;2012.</blockquote><blockquote>3 <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09613210701475753">Shifting from ‘sustainability’ to regeneration</a>, Bill Reed,&nbsp;2007.</blockquote><blockquote>4 <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.628548">Towards a regenerative paradigm for the built environment</a>, Chrisna du Plessis,&nbsp;2011.</blockquote><blockquote>5 <a href="https://www.home.earth/doughnut">Doughnut for Urban Development</a>, Home.Earth, 2023.</blockquote><blockquote>6 <a href="https://constructivist.co.uk/the-regenerative-design-reading-list/">The Regenerative Design Reading List</a>, Constructivist, 2024.</blockquote>Image: Bauhaus Earth, adapted from Bill Reed’s ‘Trajectory of Ecological Design’<p>The term’s uses have gained traction and proliferated within the particular historical context of the last half-century, during which concepts like the anthropocene and the full extent of human impact on the planet have been evidenced. As technology has enabled our understanding of the ways in which humanity has degraded our environments — at scales from the cellular to whole earth systems — to grow, so too has our desire for models that point to possible ways to repair this damage. Conceptualising the regenerative across scales and disciplines opens the door to alternative futures in which planetary demise at the hands of humans is not inevitable. The application of the core elements of regenerative theory to fields like architecture has spurred a range of generative and planet-benefitting practices. However, these individual actions, and even the rise of the sustainability paradigm across design fields, cannot override the prevailing limitations of capitalism that continue to increase rates of extraction, social inequality and environmental degradation. As it stands, regenerative approaches continue to be exceptions working against the&nbsp;odds.</p> The main limitation: political economy <p>These frameworks were written within academic and industrial contexts, largely from a Western, wealthy nations’ perspective. While regenerative thinking has inspired thinkers across the planet and across fields, attempts to translate these concepts into a global, political economic scale fails to account for deep-seated inequalities. We are limited by the systems and power imbalances in which we’re working. Capitalism, in particular, compounds these blindspots, limiting attempts to translate regenerative thinking into other spaces such as the built environment. As such, while trailblazing organisations, communities and individuals are offering proofs of possibilities in regenerative infrastructure and urbanism, these are currently exceptional cases. It is not yet evident how these ideas can be instantiated at scale to benefit all people and meaningfully address systemic inequalities.</p> The role for and responsibilities of professionals <p>The interconnected challenges of this moment invoke new layers of complexity. But if professionals can’t understand or deploy the idea of regeneration, then it won’t guide their decisions and&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Extractive activities led by the industrialised global North continue to irreversibly alter our planet at pace, while the transition to renewable energy will involve even higher rates of extraction of critical minerals than those of today. As such, the earth’s systems’ ability to regenerate is stressed more than ever. The built environment, with its outsized responsibility for global carbon emissions associated with construction, building operations and demolition, must admit these impacts and face up to its epoch-defining responsibility. So how do we get off the one-way road of identifying problems without solutions?</p><p>There is a separation between perceived responsibility and power in today’s professional landscape. This moment necessitates a shift from individual to collective agency in taking on advocacy for the regenerative potential of the built environment.</p><p>Imagine this: you are an architect today, trying to answer the client’s brief by maximising the use of responsibly-sourced bio-based materials, embedding social justice in your design processes and objectives, and considering carbon-storage potential and place stewardship for future generations, while accepting that your brief is to create market-rate apartments. This is nearly impossible in the context of today’s imperative to maximise profits and commodify housing. Architects in the current professional environment are profoundly limited in means to meaningfully address these intersecting priorities, whether one at a time or in concert. Our current economic system simply does not position architects to be the core innovators, as much as Stefano Boeri’s reflections on the Bosco Verticale boast otherwise.</p><p>These professional limitations are an indirect signal of the political economy of real estate development and the power relations underpinning the construction industry. Only a systemic shift can address the limitations facing individuals operating within a design scope. To genuinely take on the intersections of ecology, social justice and the built environment, architects need to see their work for all its entanglement with the broader political, economic and social forces, using the tools of the profession and connections, bolstered by connections with aligned collaborators, and their collective power to dismantle the systems of power that limit transformation at across&nbsp;scales.</p><p>We’re orienting ourselves toward a future in which there is more latitude for these crucial priorities to be addressed. This future will hold an altered scope for decisions made by architects and other built environment professionals in the course of development processes, and a transition to a regenerative built environment driven by collective commitment.</p> A growing field: precedents and trailblazers <p>A range of contemporary initiatives, programmes and projects aim to establish frameworks to define the idea of a regenerative built environment. Drawing on advancements in <a href="https://climatepromise.undp.org/news-and-stories/what-is-circular-economy-and-how-it-helps-fight-climate-change">circular economic thinking</a>, increasing recognition of the significance of <a href="https://ukgbc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/operational-and-embodied-carbon-1.pdf">embodied carbon</a> in addition to operational carbon in buildings, and as the industry’s understanding of indicators like biodiversity and water use that are tied to planetary boundaries <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html">grows</a>, these programmes help experts and the general public to move beyond misconceptions.</p><p>Bauhaus Earth emerged in 2021 as an initiative around the use of timber and other bio-based materials for construction and their ability to store carbon. Today, Bauhaus Earth is a research and advocacy organization dedicated to transforming the built environment into a regenerative force for ecological restoration. It brings together experts from architecture, planning, arts, science, governance, and industry to promote systemic change in construction practices.</p><p>Index of aligned enquiries</p><blockquote>A global range of community-led and grassroots organisations focusing on the work and needs of underserved groups receive grant funding from and can be discovered via the <a href="https://www.rearc.institute/grants">Re:arc Institute</a>.</blockquote><blockquote>Non-Extractive Architecture(s)’ <a href="https://directory.nonextractivearchitecture.org/directory">directory</a> gathers a global index of projects that rethink the relationship between human and natural landscapes, alongside questions about the role of technology and politics in future material economies. The directory is an ongoing project&nbsp;itself.</blockquote><blockquote>A range of related organisations and initiatives in the working ecosystem of Europe can be found in the table below. The range in types of these enquiries represents the broad coalition of stakeholders and types of activity that will be required to activate transformation toward a regenerative built environment.</blockquote>Index of related initiatives in Europe. For links, see the end of this&nbsp;post.<blockquote>Bio-based building materials are an important nexus of social and material relations. These materials, which bridge human and earth-based capacities for creation, urge an expanded view of stewardship. Understanding this will enable us to move past a paradigmatic dichotomy between the human and the natural, which enables humans to exploit planetary resources. Bio-based building materials were humans’ first building materials, and over millennia the practices, most notably agricultural and indigenous ones, that created the materials we work with today, have developed in concert with human civilisations and material realities. Holding these strands together, it’s evident why a maintained focus upon bioregionally-sourced and bio-based materiality is crucial for a regenerative future.</blockquote><blockquote>For a contemporary design and research practice that focuses on this intersection of agendas, see <a href="https://materialcultures.org/">Material Cultures</a>.</blockquote> Regeneration across time horizons: shortsightedness and the Capitalocene <p>As Reed’s Trajectory of Ecological Design diagram and the examples above indicate, regeneration of ecosystems and societies are continuous, open-ended processes that occur over time, at scales from the cellular, to the neighbourhood, and to the planetary. As the repair and balancing of regenerative processes have occurred in many contexts across eons, we need to understand regeneration across multiple accordant time horizons. Within this complex and extensive landscape, time horizons can act as organising units that help make sense of interconnections and nested scales of&nbsp;action.</p><p>In construction, key processes take place across different timescales. These range from time needed for a regenerative resource such as a forest to grow, to the lifespan of a building, to the longer time periods associated with meaningful carbon sequestration. In each of these cases, regenerative interventions involving acts of maintenance and design directly modulate the temporal register of the built environment. For example, extending a building’s lifespan through processes of care and preventing demolition impacts the future form of its locale and pushes back against the conceptualisation of buildings strictly as sources of profit within capitalist logic–that is, viewing buildings primarily in terms of their capacity to generate immediate economic returns through cycles of development, exploitation and obsolescence. By this means, it is within the medium of time that a regenerative lens on the built environment can be most revealing.</p><p>Regeneration in <a href="https://anthropocene.univie.ac.at/resources/deep-time/">deep time</a> and at the timescale of ecosystems has been disrupted by human processes. We are accustomed to the idea of the Anthropocene, in which an epoch defined by human activity has become the dominant influence on climate and the environment, which was initiated by the industrial revolution. However, recent discussions by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2016.1235036">Jason W Moore</a>, <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/135-fossil-capital">Andreas Malm</a> and others offer a critique of this concept in making the case for the Capitalocene as a more precise term. Rather than treating humanity as a homogenous force as Anthropocene theory does, the Capitalocene examines how differences in responsibility, power and agency within societies have been compounded in the context of the capitalist system, and how this system has driven ecological crisis. Rather than humanity as a whole, Moore argues that we should examine how the social, economic and political processes that have shaped recent centuries, and which reach back to the early modern period, provide a better basis for understanding the relationship between human activity and planetary wellbeing, and how this dynamic produces ecological crises. Using this focus on the un-natural and political origins of the crisis we face today, it’s possible to see how shifting senses of responsibility, agency and relationships, operating against capitalist logics, are essential for developing effective pathways toward planetary regeneration. In the predominant logic of the Capitalocene, short-term profits, increases in productivity, and optimisation around flawed ideas of efficiency are necessitated–and regeneration could be mistaken for a loss, an indicator of inefficacy, a concession to the ineffable–and as such, unwarranted. This is the systemic logic that must be resisted.</p><p>The prevalence of demolition today is one example of how this systemic short-sightedness is bad for people and the planet. The UK is now facing the consequences of the prevalent use of <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9917/">reinforced aerated autoclave concrete</a> (‘RAAC’), in municipal buildings nationwide during the 1980s. With a material lifespan of only 30 years, many hospitals and schools built of RAAC are now being demolished. Indeed, the lifespan of many of the structures that are most viable in our current urban development models are steadily decreasing in spite of increasing awareness of the embodied carbon impacts of demolition.</p><p>We would do well, in looking toward a regenerative future for the built environment, to retune our time horizons. This might involve syncing carbon sequestration time with lifecycles for construction that create value over time, taking into account things like municipal land leases and emerging whole life carbon regulations. What if we had a way to see the long-term impact of decisions made&nbsp;today?</p><p>In this effort to hold more timescales in mind when we consider processes of regeneration, we can learn a great deal from indigenous cultures from across the world, many of whom have developed, over the course of millennia, methods and ideologies supporting the human ability to connect with scales of time beyond our species-specific and news-cycle dependent parameters. Some of these examples are evidenced in the above Index of enquiries.</p> Theoretical underpinnings: what constitutes a regenerative built environment? <p>The built environment is both a physical and a social construct: it’s not fitting in this moment of polycrisis to continue to abstract the physical materials that shelter us from the labour that built them, the livelihoods that maintain them, the design processes that make them fit for purpose, and the policies or decisions that keep them standing.</p><p>To identify ways to directly address the injustices to people and the planet engendered by the Capitalocene, we need to look to historical and political decisions that have driven the crises in housing affordability and race-based inequality that are defining features of cities today. In recent years, there has been a greater focus on how the built environment can benefit from the application of lenses that focus on the distribution of power and agency within societies, including critical theory and urban political ecology. These approaches can help us to articulate how the built environment and natural resources can be viewed in the context of human struggles to meet their needs in the context of today’s critical conditions.</p><p>David Harvey, most notably in <a href="https://www.udg.org.uk/publications/udlibrary/social-justice-and-city">Social Justice and the City</a>, points to how a purely quantitative or spatial design-based approach to understanding urban space consistently fails to engage socioeconomic phenomena like inequality and urban poverty, while arguing for the necessity of approaches that integrate the spatial with the social. Harvey’s reading, grounded in radical geography, makes clear how spatial development processes are driven by financial capital, which keeps governments, civil society, communities and individuals in predetermined roles, ill-equipped to resist the calcification of capitalised space. Recently, <a href="https://journal-buildingscities.org/articles/10.5334/bc.65">climate justice movements</a> like the <a href="https://climatejusticealliance.org/">Climate Justice Alliance</a> (on the grassroots side) have formed alliances with decision-makers and activists in the built environment around causes like health and buildings, retrofit poverty and feminist approaches to building, under banners like a <a href="https://www.c40.org/what-we-do/building-a-movement/global-green-new-deal/">Global Green New Deal</a>, in which a spatialised social justice lens can be directly&nbsp;applied.</p><p>Harvey’s work is a key influence on urban political ecology approaches, which assist us in understanding of how cities are hybrids of natural and social processes, rejecting a dichotomy between people and nature. Similarly, Marxist political economic thinkers like <a href="https://raymondwilliams.co.uk/2020/09/02/part-three-from-production-to-livelihood-raymond-williams-on-ecosocialism/">Raymond Williams</a> have pointed to how capitalism organises space and produces environmental inequalities, as analysed using multiscalar analysis, among other techniques. Through a political ecology lens, we see that developers and investors, not communities or ecological needs, shape the built environment, often through speculative real estate practices that exploit labour and resources. These critiques of the built environment emphasise that urban development is driven primarily by capitalist interests, prioritising profit over social and environmental well-being, leading to inequality, displacement, and environmental degradation. Theory can support an analysis of exclusion in planning, and advocacy for participatory processes that could support socially regenerative places.</p><p>In sum, focusing exclusively on buildings misses the point that cities are fluid, open, contested multivocal landscapes. At scales from the individual building, to the neighbourhood, including infrastructure like street systems, as well as cities and regions, the built environment is a negotiation between matter, human behaviour and social systems over&nbsp;time.</p><p>As we look to the future, how will our urban environments be produced? Who will benefit from them? And how can we challenge the environmental injustices inherent to the systems we live&nbsp;in?</p> Guiding principles for regenerative practice  Six layered principles for a regenerative built environment <p>Expanding our definition of what’s regenerative in the built environment calls for clear ways to speak to the material, economic and social dimensions of cities. We need ways of accessing and assessing regeneration that cut across disciplinary boundaries, invite broader participation in these conversations, and account for future risks and technological developments.</p><p>What layers and principles might expand and deepen our understanding of systemic interactions as we work toward more holistic indicators? Below are six suggestions to focus our&nbsp;gaze.</p> Time horizons and generational preparedness <p>Future indicators of a regenerative built environment must take a long-term view. If the built environment is to form a matrix in support of human life for generations to come, it should fundamentally be building material preparedness for the future. This means the way we measure and quantify what the built environment does ought to speak to this extended time horizon, for example by considering how much carbon is stored for three generations to come, how much of our timber is sourced in a way that will allow for replanted trees that will mature over decades, or how much of a building’s material stock can be disassembled and reused within the same settlement.</p><p>Today we have standard metrics like Floor Area Ratio (FAR) that are aligned with present development models and profit-driven logics requiring maximum saleable use of space, fundamentally constraining possibilities for the built environment. Foregrounding time horizons for change enables retooling of these ways of measuring cities, focusing not on short-term, singular profits and benefits, but rather on the future generations and our planetary resources.</p> Geopolitical resilience and&nbsp;security <p>Future indicators for a regenerative built environment should address the geopolitical stakes of decisions.This is especially relevant now in Europe, with regard to geopolitical dynamics within and between the US, Russia and China, in light of multipolarity and the EU Strategic Autonomy conversation. Can we refashion the socioeconomic and material dependencies in cities so that they are resilient to the crises that may face future generations, while supporting enhanced responses to geopolitical dangers? We should look to modes of resilience that address the political and economic systems that exacerbate geopolitical precarity, such as the extractive nature of global trade, and the ongoing influence of multinational corporations in shaping environments across scales. The status quo propositions toward resilience often fall short of addressing geopolitical power structures.</p> Place-based and planetary approaches <p>Future policies and indicators should adopt a multiscalar view that takes into account the unique local context to which it’s applied, as well as the transformative potential and influence interventions may leverage across scales (e.g. throughout the value chain). Contextual specificity is associated with direct impact in regenerative efforts, but these must be connected to transformative change that fundamentally alters the properties and functions of&nbsp;systems.</p> Living systems&nbsp;approach <p>Actions should help to shift thinking towards more holistic and ecocentric worldviews, in which non-capitalistic, nature-centred systems of values are given primacy. This layer considers interventions as part of dynamic social-ecological systems rather than isolated components. It is crucial to see these social-ecological systems for their complex adaptive qualities, in which people and nature are inextricably linked.</p><p>A living systems approach supports biogenerative thinking, in which processes, systems, or designs that actively promote, support, and regenerate life — both biological and ecological — create conditions for continuous growth, renewal, and self-sustaining ecosystems.</p> Co-evolutionary and community-led <p>Interventions should structurally empower communities to act and evolve in line with their ecosystems. Structural empowerment means building systems and resources to make communities stronger and self-sufficient and allowing nature to flourish in tandem. This approach foregrounds the utility of feedback mechanisms from nature, like soil health indicators, phenological changes, and biodiversity and species presence, to support the co-evolution and improvement of social-ecological systems.</p> Supporting holistic value&nbsp;creation <p>A regenerative built environment should operate on the basis of a broad definition of value, from economic, to ecological and social. As the theoretical approaches discussed previously indicate, the built environment is a hybrid of natural and social processes occurring in the constraints of systems that thrive on extraction and inequality. A holistic approach that combines material, interpersonal and spatial integrators to consider what is regenerative generates cascading value across multiple&nbsp;scales.</p><blockquote>“Measuring the impact of regenerative practices on living systems must therefore recognise entangled systemic value flows. Current economic approaches fail to account for this complexity.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Dark Matter Labs, <a href="http://A%20New%20Economy%20for%20Europe’s%20Built%20Environment%20White%20paper">A New Economy for Europe’s Built Environment,</a> white paper,&nbsp;2024</blockquote> Conclusion <p>In the context of the polycrisis, we need to move beyond notions of sustainability, toward, as Bill Reed’s diagram suggests, creating healthy, counter-extractive communities and bioregions that can scale from exceptions to define new&nbsp;norms.</p><p>Embracing a broadened definition of regenerative practice — one which is informed by the historical and contemporary context of such practices — will evidence the potential contradictions and tensions in the current system. Deploying multimodal metrics and indicators, of the type that the principles introduced in this piece imply, will enable new thinking for net-regenerative outcomes in our cities. Without redirecting our points of orientation toward these six principles, even motivated actors will be limited by today’s system, which allows only for shifting of blame and incremental, localised improvements in the status quo. We will never reach a regenerative built environment without transformational change.</p><p>Further pieces in this series will explore in more detail the systemic shifts we envision, pathways toward regenerative practice, and possible indicators for recognising progress.</p><p>This publication is part of the project <a href="https://www.bauhauserde.org/projects/rebuilt-transformation-pathways">ReBuilt “Transformation Pathways Toward a Regenerative Built Environment</a> — Übergangspfade zu einer regenerativen gebauten Umwelt” and is funded by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) on the basis of a resolution of the German Bundestag.</p><p>This piece represents the views of its authors, including, from Bauhaus Earth, Gediminas Lesutis and Georg Hubmann, and from Dark Matter Labs, Emma Pfeiffer and Aleksander Nowak.</p> Additional links:   <a href="https://builtbn.org/">Built By&nbsp;Nature</a>  <a href="https://materialcultures.org/">Material Cultures</a>  <a href="https://ecococon.eu/">Ecococon</a>  <a href="https://www.luma.org/en/arles/about-us/parc-des-ateliers/le-magasin-electrique.html">LUMA Arles / Le Magasin Électrique</a>  <a href="https://www.houseeurope.eu/">HouseEurope!</a>  <a href="https://rotordb.org/en">Rotor</a>  <a href="https://www.miesarch.com/work/4301">Gleis 21</a>  <a href="https://www.uia-initiative.eu/en/uia-cities/lyon-metropole">Home Silk&nbsp;Road</a>  <a href="https://www.kalkbreite.net/en/">Kalkbreite</a>  <a href="https://www.re-dwell.eu/case-library/la-borda">La Borda</a>  <a href="https://www.livingforfuture.org/index.php/ueber-das-wohnprojekt/unsere-vision#wersindwir">Living for&nbsp;Future</a>  <a href="https://habitat.pl/energy-inefficient-housing/">Habitat for Humanity&nbsp;Poland</a>   <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/whats-guiding-our-regenerative-futures-e34e0ab21c06">What’s guiding our Regenerative Futures?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We spoke with Kai Stuebane, Managing Director for DACH at Docusign, to explore how secure digital identity verification is transforming digital signing amid Germany’s evolving regulatory landscape.  



 



<p>From navigating increasing compliance demands to delivering seamless user experiences, we discussed why eID (Electronic Identification) is becoming a strategic priority for faster, more secure, and legally compliant digital signatures – and how Docusign’s partnership with IDnow is empowering enterprises to stay ahead with secure, scalable and user-centric digital workflows.</p>



 Why now: Perfect conditions for eID to scale 



 In today’s rapidly evolving regulatory landscape, particularly in Germany but also across Europe, digital identity is becoming increasingly significant. From Docusign’s perspective, what factors are driving the growing importance of secure digital identity solutions in the enterprise environment?&nbsp; 



<p>First, regulatory compliance is a major driver. Regional laws such as eIDAS, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/eidas-2-0-simple-update-fundamental-change/">the impending eIDAS 2.0 in the EU </a>are enhancing the need for digital authentication solutions across the region by introducing initiatives such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity Wallets</a> (EUDI). In Germany, the focus on digital trust services, enforced by institutions such as BaFin and regulations like GwG, demand robust, verifiable digital identity solutions. Enterprises must meet strict requirements for customer identification and authentication when signing or executing agreements electronically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, security concerns and fraud prevention are top priorities. According to a recent Docusign global survey into the identity verification landscape, 70% of organisations agree that identity fraud attempts are on the rise, as remote and hybrid work models become the norm and businesses continue digitising their operations. As a result, companies require robust authentication solutions that ensure document integrity and signer identity across borders and devices.</p>



<p>A third major driver is that user expectations have shifted. Both customers and employees now expect seamless, secure digital experiences, with 50% of organisations actually prioritising customer experience over fraud prevention, given its perceived importance. Organisations like Docusign enable enterprises to deliver this through a frictionless signing experience while maintaining high standards of security and trust. For example Grenke who, in addition to offering IDnow’s videoident process through Docusign, decided to also add the new eID capability in order to offer more convenience to their customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, digital transformation continues to accelerate. Enterprises are modernising legacy workflows at an exponential rate, and secure digital identity is foundational to automating agreement processes end-to-end. Digital-first solutions empower businesses to operate faster, more efficiently, and with greater legal certainty – particularly in highly regulated markets like Germany.</p>



 As Germany advances its digital transformation initiatives, how do you anticipate electronic identification (eID) solutions will reshape document signing processes for both enterprises and consumers in the German market? 



<p>There is an overall shift within the identity verification and authentication landscape&nbsp; where organisations are actively seeking-out solutions that enable them to maintain security and compliance, without impacting the user experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For enterprises, eID solutions will help streamline identity verification, enabling faster onboarding, contract execution, and compliance with stringent regulatory requirements such as eIDAS and Germany’s Trust Services Act. Again, take Grenke as an example, the ability to integrate German eID schemes into their existing signing workflow – especially for digital signatures – means they can ensure the highest level of legal validity while reducing manual processes and streamlining the customer experience.</p>



<p>For consumers, eID will offer a more seamless and familiar experience whilst maintaining security – something we pride ourselves on delivering here at Docusign. With familiar national identity methods integrated into digital transactions, users will be able to verify their identity and complete agreements with confidence and ease. This not only enhances trust but also accelerates adoption in regulated sectors like finance, insurance, and real estate.</p>



<p>Through our partnership with IDnow, Docusign is committed to supporting the German market by leaning into evolving regulations and integrating eID solutions into its portfolio, meeting local regulatory needs while delivering the trusted experience that users expect.</p>



 The eID advantage: Seamless UX meets compliance 



 How can Germany unlock and accelerate the full potential of eID? 



<p>Based on our experience, accelerating eID adoption in Germany hinges on three key factors: user experience, awareness, and interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First, simplifying the user experience is critical. For individuals to embrace eID for digital agreement completion, the process must be intuitive, fast, and secure. Reducing friction, such as removing lengthy registration steps or complex verification methods, can significantly increase user adoption. By leveraging the familiar eID methods, this will streamline this experience while maintaining high levels of identity assurance.</p>



<p>Second, education and awareness are essential. Many individuals are unaware that their national eID can be used as part of the digital agreement process. Promoting the benefits (legal validity, security, and convenience, etc.) will help build trust and drive usage across different age and user groups.</p>



<p>Third, ensuring broad interoperability with public and private identity schemes is key. Businesses need confidence that the eID solutions they implement will work across sectors and meet local (GwG) and regional (eIDAS) regulatory standards.</p>



 In what ways has Docusign enhanced its signing workflows by incorporating eID with other IDnow-powered verification solutions? 



<p>Docusign has a long-standing partnership with IDnow. The evolution of this partnership to now include IDnow’s eID capabilities enhances the security and user experience of its joint offering in the following ways:</p>



  Automation: Customers can make the most of an Identification method that simply relies on&nbsp; the electronic identification (eID) function of the German national identity card.&nbsp;  



  Security: Two factors of authentication for additional security:&nbsp;  



  PIN entry&nbsp;  Scanning of the near field communication (NFC) chip contained within German eIDs&nbsp;  



  Familiarity and ease of use: not only are eIDs increasingly adopted across Germany, but the fact we leverage new technology such as NFC provides an additional element of ease of use.  



 Real-world application: GRENKE’s eID-first transformation 



 For businesses that already use Docusign but haven’t yet implemented eID-based signing, what are the key benefits they might be missing out on? 



<p>Ultimately, we can distill the key benefits to:&nbsp;</p>



  Increased completion rates, driven through familiarity: enable customers to use their German eID for straightforward, intuitive identity verification that supports compliance obligations.&nbsp;  



  Secure, simplified signing:&nbsp; built-in security enhancements (i.e. use of PIN, scanning of NFC, etc.) mean that SMS re-authentication and live video interactions are no longer required, resulting in an even faster identification process for signers.  



  Storage and centralisation of key identity information: continue to download or easily access required signer identity information through Docusign and IDnow, to demonstrate compliance with BaFin GwG requirements&nbsp;  



 Can you share a real-world example of how a customer of Docusign is using eID to improve efficiency and achieve measurable business outcomes? 



<p>A strong example is our long-standing collaboration with Grenke, a leading provider of leasing and financing services. For several years, Grenke has enabled customers and dealers to digitally sign contracts using Docusign eSignature, with IDnow’s VideoIdent solution supporting identity verification.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/grenkegroup_grenke-eid-activity-7338524460192325633-9QWT/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAuHOgEBAK4x3WS4ifsdWyoRBZ5v0rWuco">Grenke enhanced this process by integrating IDnow’s eID solution</a> as an alternative verification method. The impact has been clear: the introduction of eID has helped Grenke accelerate contract turnaround times, reduce reliance on physical materials, and improve the overall user experience. This has translated into greater operational efficiency, enhanced customer satisfaction, and measurable progress toward the company’s digital and sustainability goals.</p>



 What’s next: Looking beyond legal requirements 



 As we anticipate the implementation of eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity framework in the coming months, how do you envision these regulatory advancements shaping the evolution of electronic identification and digital signature solutions across Germany and the broader European market? 



<p>These regulatory advancements will establish a unified, interoperable framework for digital identity across EU member states, enabling individuals and businesses to authenticate and complete digital agreements securely and seamlessly across borders. For Germany, this means greater alignment with a pan-European standard that facilitates trust, legal certainty, and smoother cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>eIDAS 2.0 introduces the concept of the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDI), which empowers citizens to manage, store and share verified identity attributes as they wish. This will significantly enhance user control, reduce onboarding friction, and boost adoption of high-assurance digital signatures, particularly Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). At Docusign our stated ambition is to become an federator of identities, where all EUDI wallets are available through our platform .&nbsp;</p>



<p>For businesses, these changes will reduce complexity in managing multiple identity systems while improving compliance and scalability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited for what’s to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Face ID search technology has rapidly evolved, becoming a standard feature in smartphones. In 2025, its capabilities are expected to expand even further, offering a seamless, secure, and personalized experience for users. This blog explores the future of Face ID search in smartphones, how it integrates with existing technology, and the potential benefits and challenges of this advancement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Face ID Search? 
<p>It is a technology that uses facial recognition to unlock smartphones and enable various features such as security, payments, and app access. Unlike traditional password systems, it allows users to unlock their devices by simply looking at them, using the unique features of their faces as identification.</p>
<p>This technology has come a long way since its inception and continues to evolve with advancements in 3D facial recognition and other biometrics. By 2025, Face ID will likely be even more accurate, efficient, and secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Facial ID Recognition Works 
<p>It relies on advanced facial recognition algorithms and hardware, such as depth sensors, infrared cameras, and AI-powered software. It captures the unique features of a person’s face, including the distance between their eyes, nose, mouth, and other defining characteristics.</p>
<p>In the case of smartphones, Face ID works by:</p>
 
 Scanning your face using a 3D depth sensor to create a detailed map of your features. 
 Comparing the scanned data to the stored template to confirm your identity. 
 Unlocking the device or allowing access to apps, payment systems, and more once the match is confirmed. 
 
<p>This process is both fast and secure, offering a more convenient method of authentication compared to traditional PIN codes or passwords.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Face ID Search in Smartphones (2025) 
<p>As we look toward the future of smartphones, Face recognition is set to play an even more central role. Here are some expected advancements:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Improved Accuracy with 3D Facial Recognition 
<p>Currently, Face ID systems rely on 2D mapping and some 3D depth sensors for better security. However, by 2025, 3D facial recognition will likely become the standard for even more accurate and precise identification. With the integration of advanced 3D facial recognition, your smartphone will be able to detect your face from multiple angles, providing enhanced security and reducing the risk of errors in recognition.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. More Personalized User Experience 
<p>It will move beyond just unlocking your phone. By 2025, smartphones will likely offer a personalized user experience based on facial recognition. For instance, Face ID search could automatically:</p>
 
 Adjust screen brightness or display settings based on your face. 
 Personalize app suggestions or content based on your past preferences. 
 Unlock specific apps and features automatically when the phone detects that you are looking at it. 
 
<p>This level of personalization can enhance user engagement and make smartphone interactions more intuitive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Facial Recognition for Payments and Secure Transactions 
<p>Already, smartphones with Face ID capabilities allow users to make payments through mobile wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay. By 2025, face unlock for payments will become even more common and secure. We may see Face ID search systems that can perform secure transactions, even without the need for an additional password or PIN. This will make financial transactions quicker and more secure for users.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) 
<p>Augmented reality is quickly gaining popularity, and Face ID search will likely integrate seamlessly with AR experiences. Imagine using your smartphone’s facial recognition to control AR experiences unlocking virtual environments, personalizing characters, and interacting with digital content. 3D facial recognition will provide accurate data to ensure a more immersive experience, enabling personalized AR interactions based on your facial features.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Enhanced Privacy and Security Features 
<p>With the growing concern over digital privacy, the future of Face ID search will focus on enhancing security measures. Face unlock technology will be enhanced to ensure that it is more difficult for people to bypass the system. Expect additional layers of security such as liveness detection, where the phone can determine if it’s looking at a real face (not a photo or video), or multi-factor authentication (combining face recognition with voice or fingerprint authentication).</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Its Impact on the Smartphone Industry 
<p>The introduction of Face ID is already changing the way we interact with our smartphones. By 2025, it will likely have a profound impact on various industries:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Mobile Payments and E-Commerce 
<p>As smartphones adopt Face ID search technology, mobile payment and e-commerce platforms will see an uptick in secure transactions. Users will no longer need to fumble with passwords, credit cards, or PINs. Just a glance at their phone will be enough to authorize payments, making online shopping and in-store purchases more efficient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Smartphone Security 
<p>Smartphone security will continue to evolve. With improved facial recognition technology, phone manufacturers will likely be able to deliver a much higher level of security. This could reduce the likelihood of data theft and unauthorized access, making smartphones much more secure.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Privacy Concerns 
<p>As Face ID search becomes more widespread, privacy concerns are likely to rise. Many people worry about the potential for their facial data to be stored and misused. The smartphone industry will need to address these concerns by implementing stronger encryption and giving users control over their data.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges and Concerns in the Future of Face ID Search 
<p>While Face ID search has many advantages, it does come with its challenges:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Privacy and Security Risks 
<p>Storing and using facial data raises privacy concerns. If this data is hacked or stolen, it could lead to identity theft. To combat these risks, manufacturers will need to adopt robust encryption and make sure that personal data is stored securely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Facial Recognition Accuracy 
<p>While facial recognition technology has improved, it’s still not flawless. Factors such as lighting, aging, or facial hair changes can affect recognition. As we move toward 2025, more accurate 3D facial recognition systems will likely emerge to minimize these issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Increased Dependency on Facial Recognition 
<p>As more tasks are tied to Face ID search, users may become overly reliant on facial recognition for security. This could present issues if the system fails or the user’s facial features change significantly due to injury or surgery.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The future of Face ID search in smartphones looks promising. By 2025, it will be more accurate, secure, and integrated with other technologies, enhancing the user experience and providing improved functionality.

  Nonprofits face growing AML obligations. This guide explains how to verify donors, partners, and grantees while maintaining trust and operational focus using iComply.

<p>Nonprofits are under growing pressure to vet grantees, partners, and donors to meet global AML standards. This article outlines key KYC and KYB expectations in the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, and Australia – and shows how iComply enables automated risk screening without disrupting trust or operations.</p>
 
 Nonprofits and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are mission-driven – but increasingly, they’re also AML-obligated. Regulators, donors, and banking partners now expect them to verify counterparties, conduct due diligence on sub-recipients, and track risk exposure across jurisdictions. 
<p>Global AML rules are expanding—and nonprofits must ensure their programs and funds are not diverted for criminal or terrorist use.</p>
 
 Emerging AML Obligations for Nonprofits 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, IRS, Department of State 
 Requirements: Due diligence on foreign grantees, donor vetting, sanctions screening, and enhanced scrutiny of transactions involving high-risk countries 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: Charity Commission, HMRC 
 Requirements: Financial controls, PEP and sanctions screening, and governance reviews for organizations handling overseas grants 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National charity bodies, AML authorities 
 Requirements: UBO transparency, transaction monitoring, GDPR-compliant due diligence, and STR obligations 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: CRA, FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Anti-terrorist financing controls, donor due diligence, reporting obligations, and foreign activity reviews 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: ACNC, AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance for overseas programs, sanctions compliance, and source-of-funds transparency 
 
 
 Challenges Nonprofits Face 
<p>1. Resource Constraints<br>
Small compliance teams, tight budgets, and limited infrastructure</p>
<p>2. Complex Grant Networks<br>
Sub-grantees, international affiliates, and in-country partners with limited transparency</p>
<p>3. Donor Sensitivity<br>
Trust and confidentiality must be preserved during verification</p>
<p>4. High-Risk Regions<br>
Operations often focus on areas with elevated AML or sanctions risk</p>
 
 iComply: Mission-Aligned AML Tools for Nonprofits 
<p>iComply offers a lightweight, privacy-respecting AML platform that supports risk screening and verification across the nonprofit ecosystem.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB for Partners and Grantees 
 
 Verify local nonprofits, vendors, and individuals with document and registry checks 
 Onboard stakeholders using multilingual, mobile-ready portals 
 Collect declarations, signatures, and supporting documentation securely 
 
 2. Sanctions and Risk Screening 
 
 Screen partners and donors against OFAC, EU, UN, and national sanctions lists 
 Apply configurable thresholds and refresh cycles 
 Automate PEP/adverse media checks without storing unnecessary PII 
 
 3. Privacy-First Infrastructure 
 
 Data processed on-device before transmission 
 Full compliance with PIPEDA, GDPR, and local privacy laws 
 Configurable consent workflows and retention schedules 
 
 4. Case Management and Reporting 
 
 Assign compliance reviews and track escalations 
 Export audit logs for internal governance or third-party funders 
 Maintain a defensible trail of due diligence 
 
 
 Case Insight: Charitable Gifting Platform 
<p>A Canadian-registered charitable gifting platform operating across North America adopted iComply to manage grantee and partner due diligence. Results:</p>
 
 Screened 60+ partners in under 4 weeks 
 Flagged one entity with prior sanction exposure 
 Increased trust with a major foundation through automated compliance 
 
 
 The Bottom Line 
<p>Doing good doesn’t exempt you from doing due diligence. Nonprofits that integrate smart, mission-aligned compliance tools can:</p>
 
 Meet funder and regulatory expectations 
 Maintain operational focus 
 Build donor and partner trust 
 
<p>Talk to iComply to learn how we help nonprofits automate global AML screening – without sacrificing impact or transparency.</p>

<p>Crypto exchanges are no longer content with just being marketplaces. Increasingly, they are launching their own networks. On the surface, this appears to be a bid to reduce costs or capture transaction fees. But the real agenda is bigger: to become the&nbsp;gateway.</p> The Strategic Position of Exchanges <p>Exchanges already sit at the most valuable chokepoints in&nbsp;crypto:</p>  They own the user&nbsp;funnels.  They aggregate liquidity.  They provide fiat on/off&nbsp;ramps.  They hold the keys to KYC and AML compliance, giving them regulatory leverage and privileged access to the intersection of traditional finance and&nbsp;crypto.  <p>By creating their own blockchains, exchanges extend this power. They no longer just host trading. They design the rails on which trading, applications, and interactions take place. In doing so, they secure the single sign-on (SSO) layer for Web3 and&nbsp;dApps.</p> A Familiar Playbook: Enterprises and Stablecoins <p>This strategy mirrors what is happening in traditional finance. Top enterprises and financial institutions are increasingly launching their own stablecoins, not because they want to compete with Bitcoin or Ethereum directly, but because they see stablecoins as the gateway to the digital financial system. Whoever owns the stablecoin rails owns the access point to payments, settlements, and capital&nbsp;flows.</p><p>In both cases — exchanges with blockchains and enterprises with stablecoins — the logic is the same: secure the gateway, and you secure the&nbsp;market.</p> Lessons from the&nbsp;Internet <p>We’ve seen this dynamic before. In the early days of the web, Facebook dominated single sign-on (SSO) by making “Login with Facebook” the default across apps and websites. Today, that role has largely shifted to Google, which owns identity and access at internet&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Exchanges are now attempting to replicate this playbook for Web3. By pushing users and developers onto their own chains, they position themselves as the default login layer of the crypto economy. Meanwhile, enterprises aim to achieve the same goal in finance through stablecoins, thereby creating a default settlement layer for the digital&nbsp;economy.</p> The Bigger&nbsp;Picture <p>What looks like fragmented innovation is in fact the same strategic move: to own the gateway layer of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Exchanges are building a crypto SSO for decentralized apps.<br>Enterprises are building a financial SSO for digital payments.</p><p>Both are racing to become the indispensable entry point to their respective domains.</p><p>And yet, there is a third frontier emerging: the gateway for AI-native infrastructure. That story belongs to HPP, and it’s one we’ll explore in the next&nbsp;article.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/bc-101-6-why-exchanges-are-building-their-own-blockchains-6b6f56e23670">BC 101 #6: Why Exchanges Are Building Their Own Blockchains</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Thales and BAE Systems announce new phase of collaboration to deliver next-generation submarine sonar capability for the UK
prezly

Thu, 09/11/2025 - 16:15


            <p>DSEI, London, 11 September 2025: BAE Systems and Thales today announced a new phase in their long-standing collaboration on submarine sonar capability, marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). </p>
<p>In support of the MoU, BAE Systems proposes the appointment of Thales as the pan-flotilla Main Sonar Design Authority and Integrator (MSDA&amp;I).&nbsp; </p>
<p>This role recognises Thales’s deep expertise and ensures that the evolution of the submarine sonar enterprise remains centred on delivering enhanced capability to the armed forces.</p>
<p>Building on more than two decades of close collaboration, BAE Systems and Thales have developed a streamlined delivery construct that accelerates the deployment of advanced sonar solutions. Sonar products and components will continue to be sourced from across the UK sonar enterprise on a “best athlete” basis, reinforcing the sector’s sovereign strength and industrial resilience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The underwater battlespace is one of the most complex and unforgiving environments in defence, where threats are often unseen but always present. By combining the complementary strengths of Thales and BAE Systems, we are bringing together world-class innovation and proven expertise to deliver cutting-edge sovereign capability for the UK to maintain decisive advantage at sea.” Paul Armstrong, Managing Director for Underwater Systems, Thales in the UK.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"BAE Systems is delighted to sign this MoU with Thales and build upon our long standing, successful and collaborative relationship working to deliver operational advantage to the Royal Navy. This MoU unlocks the opportunity to further improve how we work together across all of our submarine programmes and provides a clear and joint focus in delivering the UK sovereign sonar capability of the future. This collaborative relationship will continue to ensure that we deliver world leading technologies and capabilities to the Royal Navy." Henry Parker, BAE Systems Integrated Combat Systems Programme Director.</p></blockquote>

             <br>

<p>The UAE’s crypto story has often been framed as a race to innovate. But Q3 2025 marks a turning point: regulators aren’t just experimenting anymore — they’re enforcing. Across Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and the mainland, five authorities pushed new rules that will reshape how stablecoins, tokenized assets, and payment tokens operate in one of the world’s most ambitious digital-asset hubs.</p> Stablecoins and RWAs Step Into the Spotlight <p>Dubai’s VARA made its Virtual Asset Issuance Rulebook effective this June, locking in disclosure duties, reserve requirements, and full licensing for fiat-referenced (FRVA) and asset-referenced (ARVA) tokens. Translation? If you want to issue a stablecoin or tokenize real-world assets in Dubai, you’re now playing by institutional-grade rules — and VARA is already testing the waters with enforcement.</p> Securities Meet Sukuk on&nbsp;Chain <p>The SCA introduced a new framework for Security and Commodity Tokens, bringing digital contracts under existing securities law. At the same time, it consulted on tokenized sukuk, hinting at a future where Islamic finance and blockchain converge. If realised, that could be a global first — making sukuk more accessible and liquid through fractionalisation.</p> ADGM: Innovation With Guardrails <p>In Abu Dhabi, the FSRA updated its digital-asset guidance, streamlined approvals, and drew a hard line against privacy coins and algorithmic stablecoins. It also opened consultation on fiat-referenced tokens — expanding oversight to custody, payments, and intermediation. The message is clear: ADGM wants to attract serious players, but only those willing to play inside the guardrails.</p> Payments Tighten Under the Central&nbsp;Bank <p>The CBUAE officially ended its transition period for Payment Token Services. From now on, general retail payments onshore can only be made with licensed, dirham-pegged stablecoins. For merchants and PSPs, that narrows the rails to CBUAE-approved tokens — a major nudge toward a domestic stablecoin ecosystem.</p> Real Estate Goes On-Chain — And Sells&nbsp;Out <p>Perhaps the most headline-grabbing news came from the Dubai Land Department (DLD). Its property-title tokenization pilots sold out instantly, drawing hundreds of investors from dozens of countries. With the launch of the DIFC PropTech Hub, the UAE is building a sandbox-to-scale pipeline for tokenized real estate. In a country where property is king, this is a glimpse of the&nbsp;future.</p> The Quiet Challenge: Data &amp; the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Behind all these flashy pilots and frameworks lies a less visible, but equally crucial shift: compliance with the FATF Travel Rule. VASPs must now share user data across borders, creating new privacy risks and operational headaches. This is where tools like Shyft Veriscope come in — offering a frictionless, peer-to-peer way to comply without parking sensitive data in centralised databases. For firms in the UAE, that could be the difference between regulatory success and privacy&nbsp;failure.</p> Why This Quarter&nbsp;Matters <p>The UAE is moving from regulatory ambition to execution. Stablecoins are regulated, tokenized assets have clear pathways, and payments are narrowing to licensed rails. At the same time, real estate tokenization is proving there’s real demand beyond&nbsp;theory.</p><p>For founders, issuers, and investors, the signal is clear: the UAE isn’t just a crypto playground anymore — it’s becoming a serious, rules-based market. Those who embrace compliance as part of their strategy, rather than a burden, will be best placed to ride the next wave of&nbsp;growth.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our website and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact">contact</a> our team for a discussion.

<p>The 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant for Identity Verification report offers compelling insights and underscores a critical reality: identity verification sits at the core of cybersecurity. This annual report—departing from the usual bi-annual cycle—highlights the escalating threat of identity-based attacks and the rapid technological evolution needed to counter them.</p>
<p>The report emphasizes growing concerns about identity fraud in critical business operations. In logistics and transportation, for example, false identity credentials create significant operational and liability risks. When unverified, untrained, or uninsured individuals operate commercial vehicles, companies face regulatory violations, safety incidents, and supply chain disruptions.</p>
<p>Recent headlines about <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/08/scattered-spider-cybercrime-hackers">Scattered Spider</a> social engineering attacks and an <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250723-4">FBI warning about North Korean operatives</a> targeting American businesses through hiring fraud illuminate the current threat landscape. These incidents demonstrate that traditional identity verification processes are failing under modern attack methods.</p>
 Our Journey to Leader in Workforce Identity in One Year 
<p>Last year, 1Kosmos was selected from numerous competitors to join the Magic Quadrant alongside a handful of other vendors. Twelve months later—after tripling our annual recurring revenue (ARR) and securing $57 million in venture backing—we’ve emerged as the sole solution provider in the Challenger quadrant.</p>
<p>More significantly, 1Kosmos ranked Highest for Workforce Use Cases in the <a>2025 Gartner® Critical Capabilities for Identity Verification</a> report. This recognition validates our core principle: securing the person, not just the credential, forms the foundation of modern enterprise security.</p>
<p></p>
 What Sets 1Kosmos Apart: The Trifecta of Trust 
<p>Gartner’s analysis highlighted three core strengths that differentiate 1Kosmos:</p>
 1. FedRAMP High Authorization 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform has achieved <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/FR2334936522">FedRAMP High Authorization</a> —the highest security compliance level under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program. 1Kosmos is the only vendor holding this authorization while also being a Kantara-certified full-service Credential Service Provider (CSP). Since we offer the same platform to commercial customers, these organizations benefit from an identity verification solution that has passed rigorous testing against over 420 separate security controls.</p>
 2. Comprehensive Integration Ecosystem 
<p>While many identity verification vendors struggle with basic workforce integrations, 1Kosmos provides deep, prebuilt connectors across the identity and access management stack. We integrate seamlessly with Active Directory, Ping, CyberArk, Okta, Microsoft Entra ID, and emerging tools for recruitment and IT service management.</p>
 3. Advanced Biometric Authentication 
<p>Our extensive face biometrics experience extends beyond one-time verification. We enable continuous, adaptive authentication that detects and responds to threats in real-time, creating a persistent security layer that evolves with your risk profile. No other vendor offers this comprehensive support for both identity verification and a reusable identity wallet for biometric authentication.</p>
 Innovation That Drives Results 
<p>Our privacy-by-design architecture represents more than marketing messaging—it’s a fundamental <a>architectural advantage</a>. By combining identity verification, passwordless authentication, and a distributed ledger for user-managed privacy, we’ve created a platform that rapidly adapts to new threats and requirements.</p>
<p>This approach recently earned recognition from KuppingerCole, who ranked 1Kosmos highest in innovation among identity verification vendors in their <a>2025 Leadership Compass for Identity Verification</a> report. When two leading analyst firms independently validate your technical approach, it signals you’re solving problems correctly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results demonstrate our platform’s effectiveness: customers have reduced identity fraud by more than 40% within six months of deployment, while our global platform processes over one billion daily authentications for 75+ million users.</p>
 Solving Real Business Problems 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform defends against stolen and fake identities daily at some of the world’s largest organizations, whether addressing in-person or online identity fraud.</p>
<p>We protect major retailers from identity fraud at point-of-sale and equipment rental locations. We secure logins for one of the largest global business process outsourcing firms and support one of the world’s largest FIDO2 deployments.</p>
<p>Our solutions protect healthcare workers and secure patient information for medical service providers, while enabling workforce logins at major financial services firms worldwide.</p>
 The 1Kosmos Difference: Complete Digital Identity 
<p>Combining identity verification, passwordless authentication, and user-controlled privacy in a single platform that supports both customers and workers delivers concrete business value.</p>
<p>This approach provides more than enhanced security against hiring fraud and social engineering attacks on IT service desks—it improves user experience. When employees can securely access all work applications through a single, verified digital identity, productivity increases while security risk decreases.</p>
<p>We’re the only company providing users with a digital identity wallet they control, enabling convenient and secure access to enterprise applications like Microsoft, Saviynt, ServiceNow, and Epic.</p>
<p>For privileged access management, our platform ensures that access to mission-critical systems remains tied to verified, identity-backed biometrics.</p>
 Speed of Deployment, Strength of Security 
<p>For enterprise decision-makers, 1Kosmos delivers these capabilities through rapidly deployable cloud services. While point solutions can require weeks or months to implement, our platform typically deploys in hours to days. In a threat environment where speed matters, this deployment advantage can mean the difference between preventing an attack and becoming a headline.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>Gartner’s recognition validates our approach while reinforcing our responsibility to continue pushing boundaries and exploring new possibilities in identity security. As threats evolve, our defenses must evolve accordingly. The criminals behind Scattered Spider and similar operations are sophisticated and well-funded—our response must be equally sophisticated and agile.</p>
<p>We’re building more than improved identity verification; we’re constructing the foundation for a more secure digital economy where trust is verifiable, privacy is preserved, and organizations can confidently embrace digital transformation without compromising security or convenience.</p>
<p>The future of enterprise security begins with identity. And identity security starts with verified trust.</p>

  DSEI 2025: Thales wins with Malaysia its first export contract for its land-based High-Frequency XL radio systems
prezly

Wed, 09/10/2025 - 14:30


             
 Malaysia becomes the first international customer to adopt Thales’ new generation of resilient high-data-rate High Frequency (HF) XL radio stations. 
 The contract covers over 100 complete vehicle-mounted stations. 
 Thales holds a leading position in tactical radio communications in Malaysia, having delivered more than 10,000 radios to the Malaysian Army over the last 25 years. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 
The contract was signed by Lt. Col Shane Chin, Director of Business Development, ADS, and Olivier Achard, Vice-President Export Sales, Secure Communication &amp; Information Systems, ​ Thales.

<p>On the first day of DSEI 2025, Thales and local Malaysian partner Advanced Defence Systems (“ADS”) Sdn. Bhd. sign a contract for the delivery of HF XL TRC 3900 complete vehicle-mounted radio stations, including radios, amplifiers and antennas. </p>
<p>With this contract, Malaysia becomes the first country in Asia to benefit from innovative HF XL <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/defence-and-security/press_release/thales-unveils-new-range-tactical-wideband-high">technology</a>, first unveiled at Eurosatory 2024. HF XL provides ten times the data rate of current HF systems and ensures resilient long-range communications in constrained environments, perfectly suited to Malaysia’s tropical terrain. This solution provides the full advantages of HF, including secure transmissions, low operating costs and long-range coverage in remote areas or environments poorly served by satellite. It enhances resilience against jamming and enables the transfer of large data files such as images and video streaming.</p>
<p>The complete range of TRC 3900 HF XL radio stations also includes 20W manpack solutions for long-range mobile autonomous force needs up to 1000km, as well as 400&nbsp;W &amp; 1KW radio solutions, that enable deployed command posts to communicate with command headquarters and ​ with other units in remote areas of the theatre of operations, over distances of up to 5,000 km.</p>
<p>Thales deep expertise in tactical and sovereign communications in Malaysia is undisputed, with more than 10,000 radios delivered to the Malaysian Army to-date. The HF XL radios will be fully interoperable with existing radios in the Army’s inventory, positioning Thales as a key partner to Malaysia in secure communications. ​ This position is reinforced with the support of ADS, an established Malaysian champion in the defence and security sectors, with both parties committed towards strengthening long-term support and services to the Malaysian Defence Forces.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This first export success confirms the relevance of HF XL in meeting the needs of armed forces operating in constrained environments. By combining innovation with interoperability with existing fleets, Thales provides its customers with a robust, high-performance and future-ready solution.” said Christophe Groshenry, Vice President Business Line Radiocommunications Products, Thales.</p></blockquote>

 Are you ready for the future of Gaming? Prepared for the industry’s upcoming fraud and compliance challenges? IDnow’s identity verification experts will be on hand to answer all your IDV-related questions at Booth E405.&nbsp; 



 



<p>We will be attending <a href="https://sbcevents.com/sbc-summit/?promo=sbcmrktng--OawKYL0X&amp;utm_source=google%20&amp;utm_medium=cpc%20&amp;utm_campaign=sbcs-25&amp;utm_content=search-branded-ad3&amp;tr=true&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22426452479&amp;gbraid=0AAAAABJMA8uR9ESczJmVRW8tfw96VADSr&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjww4TGBhCKARIsAFLXndQOq6_bvKt1zGJoMQzF3XL8dc6PxjVqJ07j20slJlPSvHzxOa1VaSoaAoAUEALw_wcB">SBC Summit</a> in Lisbon from September 16-18 to share actionable insights on how to onboard players in seconds, remain compliant throughout Europe, and block fraud before it impacts the customer experience. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As one of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">first companies in Europe</a> to receive certification under the latest ETSI standard for remote identity proofing (a key requirement for eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI Wallet compliance), IDnow is well equipped to assess how prepared and future-ready businesses are for upcoming regulatory challenges. The team can be found at Booth E405 in Hall 4 and will be demonstrating how its wide range of automated and expert-led identity verification solutions can unlock safer and more secure gaming experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gaming operators are also invited to swing by to check out some of IDnow’s latest product developments, from its expanded fraud prevention technology to its NFC-enabled offering, which provides a seamless and streamlined experience, from document tap to trusted onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At midday on September 18, don’t forget to head over to Stage 3 – Technology &amp; Compliance to attend the ‘AML 2.0: Getting Serious about Fraud’ panel.</p>



<p>This will be a great opportunity to hear from Edouard Baussier, Solution Sales Director at IDnow, who, alongside other industry leaders and insiders, will explore how AI, real-time data, and regulations are transforming AML efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>Traditional AML strategies are often too rule-based and reactive; focusing more on catching yesterday’s fraud than tomorrow’s. I look forward to joining my peers from the gaming and gambling space to explore how AI, data enrichment and behavioral analytics could be used to shape the future of AML.</p>Edouard Baussier, Solution Sales Director at IDnow</blockquote>



 Hoping for the treble.&nbsp; 



<p>IDnow will also be hoping history repeats itself at this year’s SBC Awards (taking place on the final day of SBC Summit Lisbon on September 18,) as it has once again been nominated for the ‘Fraud and Compliance Solution of the Year’ award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having won the award in both 2023 and 2024, the Munich-headquartered identity verification platform provider will be hoping to win the prestigious award for three years in a row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From opening a bank account to approving a mortgage or executing a cross-border payment, trust in a person’s digital identity is what keeps the financial system running smoothly. But in Europe, the digital identity landscape has long been fragmented with each country relying on its own tools, trust schemes, and identity providers. For financial services providers operating across borders, that means rising compliance costs, customer friction, and missed growth opportunities. The EU’s eIDAS 2.0 regulation is about to change all that, and for banks, insurers, and fintechs, the implications are massive.</p>

<p>At Bluesky, we’re working to drive large-scale adoption of technologies for open
and decentralized public conversation. We built our app to provide you with
better choices when it comes to privacy, expression, and safety. That’s why we
give people options for how content moderation works, on top of our baseline
policies.</p>
<p>We recognize that promoting safety for young people is a shared responsibility,
and we support the idea of collective action to protect children from online
risks. We also recognize that governments may have strong, often conflicting,
views on these issues and how to weigh competing priorities. In this rapidly
evolving regulatory environment, our goal is to respect the law while balancing
safety, free expression, and user privacy to serve the greater good of our
community. Responding to new laws and regulations will require pragmatism and
flexibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/07-10-2025-age-assurance">In the UK</a>, we
complied with a new law that requires platforms to restrict children from
accessing adult content. <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/08-22-2025-mississippi-hb1126">In
Mississippi</a>, the
law requires us to restrict access to the site for every unverified user. To
implement this change, we would have had to invest substantial resources in a
solution that we believe limits free speech and disproportionately harms smaller
platforms. We chose not to offer our service there at this time while legal
challenges continue.</p>
<p>South Dakota and Wyoming have also passed online safety laws that impose
requirements on services like ours. These are very similar to the requirements
of the UK Online Safety Act. So, as we did in the UK, we’ll enable <a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/services/age-verification">Kids Web
Services’ (KWS)</a> age verification
solution for users in these states. Through KWS, Bluesky users in South Dakota
and Wyoming can choose from multiple methods to verify their age. We believe
this approach currently strikes the right balance. Bluesky will remain available
to users in these states, and we will not
need to restrict the app for everyone.</p>
<p>We’re committed to keeping our community informed as we navigate these new
regulations. As more states and countries adopt similar requirements, we will
update this blog post accordingly.</p>

				  With leading research company Juniper predicting a “fraud tidal wave,” Indicio’s authenticated biometric credential solution is a simple, powerful, cost effective defense against synthetic identity fraud and deepfakes while also streamlining account access, mobile, and cross-border payments.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Juniper Research <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/18/3134696/0/en/Fraud-to-Cost-Financial-Institutions-58-3-Billion-by-2030-Globally-as-Synthetic-Identities-Threaten-Fraud-Tidal-Wave.html">predicts</a> fraud will cost financial institutions $58.3 billion dollars, globally, by 2030 —&nbsp;and the bill is coming from synthetic identity fraud, where real, stolen, and fake information is combined to trick institutions into opening accounts and granting credit.</p>
<p>Add this to bots, phishing attacks, account takeovers, and AI being used to accelerate attacks, and generate deepfakes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demand for seamless, fast, mobile banking and payments has only increased. Juniper also forecasts that mobile payments will grow to over $8 trillion dollars by 2028.</p>
 Money 20/20 — Indicio is “poised to transform the world of money” 
<p>We’re doing this with authenticated biometric credentials, a simple, cost-effective solution to these authentication and KYC problems that can scale from the smallest SME to the corporations and countries.</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven software, any government issued identity document containing an image can be bound to the person who rightfully owns it — through a combination of face-mapping and liveness checking. And through our partnership with Regula, thousands of official identity documents from all over the world can be validated as authentic.</p>
<p>The result is a Verifiable Credential that contains an authenticated biometric — a combination of personal identity data and a biometric image that can be presented anywhere for instant verification — no centralized storage of personal or biometric data needed.</p>
<p>What makes this so powerful is that the issuer of the credential —&nbsp;a bank, a brokerage, a financial institution — can be cryptographically proven, along with the integrity of the data.</p>
<p>And this authentication takes place before any data is shared.</p>
<p>So if you trust the bank, you can trust the information in the credential —&nbsp;plus, you can automatically compare a live image of the person with a tamper-proof copy of their biometrics, a simple way to identify deepfakes.</p>
<p>The result is the most powerful digital identity in the global marketplace — one that can be created in minutes and verified with simple mobile software anywhere.</p>
<p>Bonus — with Indicio Proven, your authenticated biometric credential is globally interoperable, meaning it can work with the European Union’s new Digital Identity Wallet.</p>
 Indicio —&nbsp;the IDV disruptors 
<p>We first created this solution to enable seamless border crossing with the world’s first digital passport credential based on international standards. We won awards. But more importantly, we saw how this could transform identity verification for everyone and meet the emerging challenges of synthetic identity fraud.</p>
<p>Our software enables anyone to hold an authenticated biometric of themselves and instantly share it anywhere as the ultimate proof of identity in a world of fakery. And we also make it easy to verify anywhere, even offline.</p>
<p>It’s simple to implement —&nbsp;it will work with your existing systems. It’s simple to use —&nbsp;generate or scan a QR code; integrate with existing biometric infrastructure. And it is significantly less expensive than traditional IDV — but you’ll have to contact us to find out by how much.</p>
<p>The question is, in a world where synthetic identities and deepfakes threaten the financial security of your company, can you afford not to ask for a Proven biometric?</p>
 Getting Started 
<p>To get a better understanding of the technologies involved, you can visit our <a href="https://indicio.tech/banking-and-finance/">banking and finance page.</a> To discuss specifics or learn how you can start integrating this solution into your systems today, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team</a> and we will be happy to answer any questions or set up a time for a free consultation.</p>

   We’ve been talking about identity and access for people for decades (millennia if you think outside tech). Policies, role assignments, reviews, zero trust — these are familiar tools.

<p>“We’ve been talking about identity and access for people for decades (well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password#History">millennia</a> if you think outside the tech box). Policies, role assignments, reviews, zero trust — these are familiar tools. The assumptions that go into them, however, don’t quite work when the “user” is no longer a person.”</p>



<p>Enter in the AI Agent.</p>



<p>An AI doesn’t log in, perform a task, and then head off to lunch. It doesn’t get tired, second-guess itself, or stop at the boundaries we assume people understand. Instead, it keeps going (was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energizer_Bunny">Energizer Bunny</a> an early AI? Hmmmm) at a scale no human can match. That difference matters. The way we’ve designed permissions for humans has always relied on certain constraints: limited speed, bounded intent, and oversight cycles that can reasonably keep up.</p>



<p>When the actor is an AI, those constraints are gone. What we’re left with is a gap between the pace at which machines can act and the pace at which human-designed governance can respond. Unfortunately, I don’t think that the gap can be smoothed over with existing tools.</p>



<p>This post looks at three of those cracks: how policy enforcement differs for people and AIs, why runtime governance becomes essential, and what zero trust does (and doesn’t) offer when roles blur.</p>

<p>With humans, policies usually align with job functions: a role grants access, and reviews catch drift over time. Even if people sometimes work around the edges of a policy, they’re bounded by human limits: a person can only click so fast, submit so many forms, or request so many resources. Enforcement mechanisms are tuned to those limits.</p>



<p>With AI, those assumptions evaporate. One executive at a very large enterprise told me — and asked me not to name them publicly — that they’d watched their own AI agents behave exactly like an attacker. The agents weren’t malicious; they were just single-minded. When faced with a roadblock, they tried every possible permutation of the request until something went through. From the agent’s point of view, this was just persistence in solving a problem. From a security team’s perspective, it looked indistinguishable from a brute-force attack.</p>



<p>That story captures the core difference: enforcing policies on humans is about constraining intent, while enforcing policies on AIs is about constraining behavior patterns that can unfold at machine speed.</p>



 Why runtime governance matters more 



<p>Oversight loops designed for quarterly certifications or annual audits simply don’t scale when an AI can run thousands of actions in seconds. Quarterly access reviews, audit reports, entitlement certifications: these are slow, deliberate checks designed for slow, deliberate actors. That’s why governance is shifting toward runtime validation. NIST’s <a href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/ai-research/nists-ai-standards-zero-drafts-pilot-project-accelerate">AI Standards “Zero Drafts” Pilot Project</a> makes a similar point in its early work on Testing, Evaluation, Verification, and Validation (TEVV): evaluation results are time-bound and must be re-established in live contexts as systems and environments change.</p>



<p>But an AI agent can spin through thousands of transactions in seconds. If one of those transactions violates policy, you don’t have three months to catch it. By the time the audit report lands, the damage is done.</p>



<p>That’s why runtime governance matters more in an AI world. Instead of periodic reviews, you need ongoing checks that validate each action in real time against business state, risk scores, and context. Governance has to run in the same tight loops as the systems it’s meant to protect. The consequences here aren’t theoretical. Weak runtime governance shows up directly in compliance failures, operational risks, and security exposures. If your audit assumes human pacing but your agents act at machine speed, that mismatch can quickly become costly.</p>



<p>This isn’t a radical departure from what we already know, but it is definitely a sidestep. It’s the same shift we’ve been making with zero-trust networking when verifying every access, every time. But with AIs, the volume and unpredictability make runtime enforcement non-negotiable.</p>



 Zero trust and blurred roles 



<p>Zero trust, in human terms, is simple enough: don’t assume trust based on location or role; verify every request.</p>



<p>But what does that look like when an AI agent is simultaneously:</p>



 
 Acting as a customer service rep, 



 Writing new code modules, 



 Spinning up cloud infrastructure, and 



 Querying internal HR data? 
 



<p>With people, those roles are clearly separated. With an AI, the boundaries collapse. The same system may be acting across functions at once, not because of malice but because it was asked to “just get the job done.”</p>



<p>Zero trust principles such as least privilege, continuous verification, and minimizing standing access still apply, but they need a new level of granularity. Instead of asking “Does this role have permission to access this system?”, the question becomes “Does this pattern of behavior still look acceptable, given what this agent is trying to achieve?”</p>



<p>And that’s not a static answer. It has to be recalculated in real-time because the roles themselves blur when machines act faster than our ability to categorize them.</p>



 What really changes? 



<p>For humans, permissions are about who can do what. For AIs, permissions are about what actions are acceptable, in what sequence, at what speed, and with what guardrails.</p>



<p>The shift is from assigning access to governing behavior, from periodic reviews to runtime enforcement, static roles to dynamic patterns. It’s not that the old tools are obsolete. Roles, reviews, and zero trust still matter, but they’re no longer sufficient on their own. When your “users” are tireless, literal, and unimaginably fast, you need governance that matches that pace.</p>



<p>The enterprise anecdote I mentioned earlier — of an AI acting like an attacker just to finish its assigned task — is a preview. It’s what happens when yesterday’s assumptions about permission models meet today’s machine-driven reality.</p>



<p>In my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/08/12/agentic-ai-and-open-standards/">earlier post</a> on Agentic AI in the open standards community, I mentioned that standardization work is starting to grapple with these questions, too. Whether it’s NIST’s early TEVV guidance or W3C and IETF discussions on agent behavior, there’s a growing recognition that machine permissions as much a governance challenge as they are a technical one. </p>



 Closing thought 



<p>The real change isn’t in the idea of permissions itself. It’s in the urgency of treating permissions as living, runtime checks rather than dusty entitlements waiting for an audit.</p>



<p>So here’s my question to you: Are your permissions models built for human pace or machine pace? If you’ve already run into this problem in your deployments, I’d love to hear what you saw and how you dealt with it.</p>

 Permissions in the Age of AI Agents 



<p>[00:00:30] Hi everyone, and welcome back.</p>



<p>[00:00:32] Today I want to talk about something that sounds deceptively familiar: permissions. Specifically—who is allowed to access what, when, where, why, and how?</p>



<p>[00:00:42] The tech space has been dealing with identity and access for decades. It’s a core concept not only for cybersecurity, but also for how businesses function.</p>



<p>[00:00:50] And honestly, if you zoom out far enough, humanity has been grappling with this concept for millennia—whether priests deciding who can enter a temple, or sysadmins deciding who can SSH into a server.</p>



 



 Policy Enforcement in a Human vs. AI World 



 



<p>[00:01:02] My very first tech job was in the 90s as a Galacticom BBS operator. My primary function was to create accounts, group users, and ban them when needed. In other words, managing who could and couldn’t access certain spaces.</p>



<p>[00:01:30] Enter stage left: the AI agent.</p>



<p>[00:01:34] Unlike humans, AI agents don’t self-limit. People get tired, bored, or notice they’re pushing too far. They can only click so fast or request so many resources before fatigue sets in.</p>



<p>[00:01:52] AI does not have those limits. It doesn’t need a coffee break. It doesn’t get bored. And it doesn’t stop at the guardrails we assume humans understand.</p>



 
 Humans → bounded by natural constraints 



 AI → tireless, literal, and unimaginably fast 
 



<p>[00:02:07] That difference matters. For years, permissions assumed humans were the actors—even bad actors. Governance cycles, reviews, and controls were tuned to human pace and intent.</p>



<p>[00:02:29] But when the actor is an AI, those assumptions fall apart. What we’re left with is a widening gap between machine speed and human-designed governance.</p>



 



 Governance at Machine Speed 



 



<p>[00:02:46] In this episode, I want to dig into three challenges:</p>



 
 How policy enforcement differs for people and AIs 



 Why runtime governance becomes essential 



 What zero trust really gives us when roles blur 
 



<p>[00:03:00] Let’s start with policy enforcement.</p>



<p>[00:03:03] With humans, policies align with job functions. Roles grant access, and reviews catch drift. Sure, people sometimes find workarounds, but their intent and ability are still bounded.</p>



<p>[00:03:20] With AI, those assumptions evaporate.</p>



<p>[00:03:37] I spoke with an executive at a large enterprise who shared a telling story. Their AI agents behaved almost exactly like attackers—not because they were malicious, but because they were single-minded.</p>



 
 The AI hit a roadblock 



 Instead of asking for new permissions, it tried every possible permutation until something worked 



 To the AI, that was persistence. To the security team, it looked like brute force 
 



<p>[00:04:10] Here’s the difference:</p>



 
 With humans → enforcing policies means constraining intent 



 With AI → enforcing policies means constraining behavior at machine speeds 
 



 



 Why Runtime Governance Matters 



 



<p>[00:04:25] Oversight cycles work for people: quarterly reviews, annual audits, entitlement certifications.</p>



<p>[00:04:42] But AI agents can execute thousands of transactions in seconds. If just one violates policy, waiting months for an audit report is far too late.</p>



<p>[00:04:56] This mismatch shows up in:</p>



 
 Failed audits 



 Blown budgets 



 Security incidents no one saw coming 
 



<p>[00:05:16] This is why runtime governance matters more in an AI world. Instead of periodic reviews, we need continuous validation:</p>



 
 Every action checked in real time 



 Risk scores recalculated constantly 



 Context updated dynamically 
 



<p>[00:05:29] NIST is already moving in this direction with the AI Standards Zero Drafts. One key theme: evaluation results are time-bound.</p>



<p>[00:05:52] AI permissions can’t be static entitlements waiting for audits. They must be living checks, recalculated as conditions shift.</p>



 



 Rethinking Zero Trust 



 



<p>[00:06:23] Let’s talk about zero trust.</p>



<p>[00:06:25] For humans, the principle is simple: don’t assume trust based on network location or job role. Verify every request.</p>



<p>[00:06:42] But what happens when the “user” is an AI agent?</p>



<p>[00:06:53] Unlike humans, who work within distinct roles, an AI might simultaneously:</p>



 
 Act as a customer service rep 



 Write new code modules 



 Spin up cloud infrastructure 



 Query HR data 
 



<p>[00:06:59] No human does all of that at once. But for AI, boundaries collapse.</p>



<p>[00:07:17] Zero trust still applies—least privilege, continuous verification, minimizing standing access. But it must go further.</p>



<p>[00:07:23] The real question isn’t does this role have access? It’s:</p>



 
 Does this behavior pattern look acceptable given the AI’s task? 
 



<p>[00:07:30] And those patterns aren’t static. They must be recalculated in real time because roles blur faster than we can categorize them.</p>



 



 From Permissions to Governance 



 



<p>[00:07:40] So what really changes when the user is an AI?</p>



 
 For humans → permissions define who can do what 



 For AIs → permissions define what actions are acceptable, in what sequence, at what speed, under which guardrails 
 



<p>[00:07:53] This represents a fundamental shift:</p>



 
 From assigning access → to governing behavior 



 From periodic reviews → to runtime enforcement 



 From static roles → to dynamic patterns 
 



<p>[00:08:18] Roles, reviews, and zero trust still matter. But on their own, they’re no longer enough when users act tirelessly and unimaginably fast.</p>



<p>[00:08:31] The anecdote I shared earlier of an AI acting like an attacker? That’s what happens when yesterday’s permission models collide with today’s machine-driven reality.</p>



 



 The Urgency of Machine-Ready Permissions 



 



<p>[00:08:47] This isn’t just happening inside one enterprise. Standards bodies like W3C and IETF are also recognizing that permissions for machines are more than just a technical detail.</p>



<p>[00:09:05] The real shift isn’t only about permissions—it’s about urgency. Permissions can’t sit as dusty entitlements waiting for audits. They must become runtime checks, recalibrated constantly for actors without human limits.</p>



<p>[00:09:22] So here’s a question for you: Are your permission models built for human pace, or for machine pace?</p>



<p>[00:09:33] If you’ve already seen cracks—your AI systems bumping up against the edges of human-centric permission models—I’d love to hear your stories. Maybe they’ll even make it into a future post.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts

<p>Money service businesses (MSBs)—including remittance providers, currency exchanges, and prepaid platforms – face some of the strictest AML expectations globally. This article breaks down key KYC, KYB, KYT, and AML requirements in the U.S., UK, EU, Canada, Australia, and Singapore – and how iComply helps automate screening and reporting across borders.</p>
 
 Money service businesses (MSBs) operate in high-risk zones for financial crime, often processing large volumes of low-margin transactions across borders. As a result, regulators expect MSBs to maintain exceptional AML programs – on par with traditional banks. 
<p>With sanctions enforcement, PEP exposure, and transaction monitoring under scrutiny, MSBs need real-time, automated tools to meet growing global expectations.</p>
 
 AML Requirements for MSBs by Jurisdiction 
 United States 
 
 Regulator: FinCEN 
 Requirements: MSB registration, SARs, Travel Rule compliance, OFAC screening, and AML program implementation 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: AML registration, customer due diligence (CDD), sanctions/PEP screening, and transaction monitoring 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National AML authorities (under AMLD6) 
 Requirements: CDD, UBO verification, risk-based monitoring, and suspicious transaction reporting (STR) 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: MSB registration, client identification, sanctions list checks, STRs, and transaction recordkeeping 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance, customer verification, risk assessment, sanctions screening, and SMRs 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: AML licensing, KYC/EDD procedures, real-time screening, Travel Rule compliance, and robust recordkeeping 
 
 
 Top Compliance Challenges for MSBs 
<p>1. High Volume, Low Margin<br>
Manual processes are unsustainable at scale.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Jurisdictional Risk<br>
Global MSBs must satisfy overlapping and sometimes contradictory AML obligations.</p>
<p>3. Sanctions Exposure<br>
Real-time OFAC, UN, EU, and national list screening is mandatory—and changing daily.</p>
<p>4. Complex Workflows<br>
Onboarding, transaction monitoring, and alert handling often happen in siloed tools.</p>
 
 How iComply Supports Global MSBs 
<p>iComply offers MSBs a fully integrated platform to manage end-to-end AML workflows—designed to scale with global growth.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB with Edge Security

<p>Ready to get your heart racing? Dive into our top scariest movies of all time. From timeless classics that defined the genre to the new horror films of 2025 that will keep you up all night, we’ve got your next scream-filled movie marathon covered.</p>



 What Makes a Movie Truly Scary? 



 The Anatomy of a Scream 



<p>The most terrifying movies aren’t just about gore; they are masterclasses in psychological manipulation. Suspense is the slow burn, the creeping dread that something is just out of sight, making you anticipate the horror. Jump scares are the sudden, explosive release of that tension, designed to jolt you out of your seat. A great atmosphere uses sound, lighting, and setting to create a world that feels inherently wrong and unsettling. Finally, powerful storytelling makes you care about the characters and their fate, making the scares hit on a deeper, more emotional level.</p>









 Why the Classics Endure 



<p>Classic horror films like Psycho and The Exorcist are legendary for a reason. They perfected the art of suspense and atmosphere, often relying on what you don’t see to create terror. Instead of cheap tricks, they used masterful cinematography, sound design, and psychological depth to build a feeling of inescapable dread. These films prove that true horror comes from within, showing us our deepest fears reflected on screen.</p>



 The NewWave of 2025 



<p>This year’s releases are pushing the boundaries of what horror can be. The best new movies of 2025 are blending genres, from psychological thrillers and social commentary to sci-fi and survival horror. They tap into modern anxieties about technology, surveillance, and mental health, making the scares feel more personal and relevant than ever before. With innovative techniques and A-list talent, these films prove that horror is more than just a genre. It’s a reflection of our current fears.</p>



 Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>Before we get to the new releases of 2025, let’s revisit the horror films that defined the genre and continue to haunt audiences today. These classics are a must-see for any true fan of fright.</p>



 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – The Exorcist (1973): More than a movie, this is an experience of psychological and visceral horror. Its terrifying power comes from a chillingly realistic portrayal of demonic possession, complete with groundbreaking practical effects and an unrelenting sense of dread that challenges your sense of reality. 
 









 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – Psycho (1960): Alfred Hitchcock’s masterpiece changed horror forever. It’s not about jump scares but about the terror of a true human monster. The iconic shower scene is just one part of a film that masterfully builds suspense and a chilling atmosphere, making you fear the seemingly normal person next door. 
 




Top Scariest Movies of All Time – Psycho (1960)




 
 Top Scariest Movies of All Time – The Shining (1980): Stanley Kubrick’s film is a slow, methodical descent into madness. Its genius lies in its unsettling atmosphere, haunting score, and masterful use of space to create a feeling of claustrophobia and inescapable dread. The horror here is both supernatural and deeply psychological, exploring how isolation can break a person’s mind. 
 









<p>You can often find these timeless classics on popular streaming platforms like Netflix and HBO Max. Remember to browse safely with Herond Browser for a seamless and secure streaming experience.</p>



 Top Scariest Movies to Watch in 2025 



<p>Horror is constantly evolving, and 2025 is a testament to that, with filmmakers pushing boundaries and tapping into our deepest, most modern fears. This year’s releases are bringing fresh takes on classic terror and introducing new forms of dread.</p>



 
 M3GAN 2.0: The killer AI doll is back! The sequel to the viral hit M3GAN dives deeper into our anxieties about technology and artificial intelligence. This film promises to explore what happens when our digital companions become a little too intelligent, and a lot more malicious. 
 









 
 28 Years Later: The legacy of the rage virus continues with this highly anticipated sequel. Directed by Danny Boyle, this film is set to deliver the relentless, visceral horror of the original while exploring the long-term consequences of a world ravaged by a fast-moving, terrifying plague. 
 









 
 The Conjuring: Last Rites: This is set to be the final chapter in the core Conjuring series, bringing back paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren for one last, terrifying case. Fans of supernatural horror and jump scares can expect a chilling conclusion to be one of the most successful horror franchises of all time. 
 









 Tips for Watching Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>For a scream-worthy movie night without the risk, stick to these trusted platforms.</p>



 
 Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+: These are industry leaders with robust security measures, including data encryption and anti-malware protection. They offer a huge library of content and ensure a safe, high-quality streaming experience. 
 









 
 Amazon Prime Video: A secure and reliable option, Amazon Prime Video provides a vast selection of movies and TV shows, with a strong focus on user data protection. 



 Reputable Free Services: If you’re looking for free options, stick to well-known, ad-supported platforms like Tubi, Pluto TV, and Crackle. These are run by legitimate companies and are much safer than obscure, illegal streaming sites. 
 



 How to Choose the Right Platform for Top Scariest Movies of All Time 



<p>To pick the perfect platform for your horror binge, consider your viewing habits and budget. While a major service like Netflix offers a wide variety of genres, a niche platform like Shudder is a true haven for horror fanatics.</p>









 
 Netflix: With plans ranging from $7.99 to $24.99 per month, Netflix is a one-stop shop for everything from original horror films to classic thrillers. It supports 4K Ultra HD streaming on its Premium plan and is compatible with nearly every device, from smart TVs and game consoles to laptops and mobile phones. 



 Shudder: For the serious horror fan, Shudder is a must-have. Priced at a more affordable $6.99 per month, it focuses exclusively on horror, thriller, and supernatural content. You’ll find a curated collection of classics, indie gems, and exclusive originals you can’t get anywhere else. Shudder is compatible with major devices like Roku, Apple TV, and Xbox. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Whether you’re a seasoned horror veteran or a newcomer looking for a good fright, the world of scary movies has something for everyone. The classics show us that true terror lies in psychological suspense and chilling atmosphere, proving that a great story is timeless. Meanwhile, the new releases of 2025 are pushing the genre forward, using modern anxieties to deliver fresh, terrifying experiences. To get the most out of your movie marathon, remember to use secure and trusted streaming platforms like Netflix and Shudder, and for a truly worry-free experience.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to send an email but first having to manually configure SMTP servers, manage encryption keys, and pay postage fees in a specific currency you don’t own. This is essentially what Web3 feels like today. Account Abstraction (AA) promises to change that, making blockchain interactions as seamless as using&nbsp;Gmail.</p> The Current Problem: Web3’s User Experience Crisis <p>Today’s Ethereum wallets rely on Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) accounts controlled by a single private key. While groundbreaking for decentralization, EOAs create massive friction:</p>  Gas Token Dependency: You must hold ETH to pay fees, even for simple token transfers  Single Point of Failure: Lose your seed phrase, lose everything forever  Complex Interactions: Each transaction requires manual approval and gas estimation  Poor Recovery: No built-in way to recover lost&nbsp;accounts  <p>These limitations explain why Web3 remains challenging for mainstream users. Account Abstraction addresses these pain points by reimagining how accounts work entirely.</p> What is Account Abstraction? <p>Account Abstraction transforms user accounts from simple private key wallets into programmable smart contracts. Instead of being bound by EOA limitations, Account Abstraction allows accounts to define custom logic for authentication, fee payment, and transaction execution.</p><p>Think of it as upgrading from a flip phone to a smartphone, the core functionality remains, but possibilities expand dramatically.</p> How Account Abstraction Works  Smart Contract&nbsp;Wallets <p>Instead of being tied to a private key, Account Abstraction uses a smart contract that acts as your account. This smart contract holds your tokens and assets while containing custom logic for managing the&nbsp;account.</p> ERC-4337: The Technical Foundation <p>The primary technical implementation of Account Abstraction comes through <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337">EIP-4337</a>, which enables Account Abstraction without changing Ethereum’s core protocol. Here’s the simplified flow:</p>  UserOperations: Users create “UserOperations” containing their intended actions like token transfers.  Bundlers: Special actors collect UserOperations and submit them in&nbsp;bundles.  EntryPoint Contract: A singleton contract that validates and executes operations.  Smart Wallets: Execute the actual transactions based on their programmed logic.  <p>An in-depth explanation on the abstraction process can be found on this <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337?ref=blog.quicknode.com#the-useroperation-structure">Proposal</a>.</p> Paymasters: The Game&nbsp;Changer <p><a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337?ref=blog.quicknode.com#extension-paymasters">Paymasters</a> are entities that can sponsor transaction fees, enabling gasless transactions. A dApp can pay your gas fees, or you can pay in USDC instead of&nbsp;ETH.</p> Key Benefits of Account Abstraction for&nbsp;Users  Gasless Transactions   Enables users to pay fees in any token (USDC, DAI, etc.)via paymaster.  dApps can sponsor your transaction costs.  No need to hold ETH for every interaction.   Social Recovery <p>Set up recovery procedures with trusted contacts or services. Lost your keys? Your designated recovery guardians can help restore access, no more permanent fund&nbsp;loss.</p> Customized Security   Multi-signature requirements  Spending limits for large transactions  Time delays for high-value transfers  Biometric authentication (Face ID, Touch&nbsp;ID)   Improved User Experience   Session Keys: Authorize games to make small purchases automatically.  Transaction Bundling: Execute multiple operations in one confirmation.  Automated Execution: Set up recurring payments or trading strategies.  One-Click Onboarding: Start using Web3 without seed&nbsp;phrases.

  Face identity search is a method that uses AI-powered facial matching instead of IDs or passwords. A system compares key features like eye spacing or cheek shape to a stored faceprint. It’s fast, contactless, and often more accurate than manual checks. People use it in banks, airports, and healthcare settings. Structurally, it works like this:...

<p>Face identity search is a method that uses AI-powered facial matching instead of IDs or passwords. A system compares key features like eye spacing or cheek shape to a stored faceprint. It’s fast, contactless, and often more accurate than manual checks.</p>
<p>People use it in banks, airports, and healthcare settings. Structurally, it works like this:</p>
 
 Captures a face image
<p></p> 
 Extracts meaningful facial points
<p></p> 
 Creates and compares a faceprint
<p></p> 
 Outputs a match or no-match result
<p></p> 
 
<p>This technology offers quick and secure identity checks without needing physical tokens. You can even explore open-source projects like<a href="https://github.com/recognito-vision"> Recognito’s GitHub repository</a> to see how developers are building practical tools with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Modern Systems Depend on AI-Driven Face Matching 
<p>Passwords and IDs can be lost or stolen. That’s why many systems now rely on biometric verification for better security, speed, and ease of use.</p>
<p>Benefits include:</p>
 
 Fast identity checks for crowds or busy queues
<p></p> 
 Higher accuracy than visual or document-based ID
<p></p> 
 Hands-free operation—no scanning or swiping cards
<p></p> 
 Scalable systems for millions of users
<p></p> 
 
<p>Studies show biometric tech is growing fast, with accuracy and adoption soaring across industries. Independent evaluations, such as the<a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Face Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT)</a>, confirm which systems are the most reliable in real-world conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Independent Testing Sets the Gold Standard 
<p>Governments and businesses lean on NIST’s FRVT program to judge performance, fairness, and accuracy. This ongoing benchmark evaluates algorithms on speed, bias, and resilience to poor image quality. Full results are published openly, like in<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> NIST’s FRVT 1:1 reports</a>, which compare one-to-one verification across different vendors.</p>
<p>By using such public benchmarks, companies can pick technologies that are not only fast but also proven to be fair and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Everyday Applications 
<p>This technology is no longer confined to research labs. It’s already part of daily life:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Security and Policing 
<p>Authorities use it to identify suspects in public areas. London’s police reported dozens of arrests in a single week of trial deployments.</p>
 Financial Services 
<p>Banks now let users unlock apps or approve payments by simply looking into the camera, improving both speed and trust.</p>
 Travel and Border Control 
<p>Airports in Singapore and the US speed up boarding by replacing paper tickets with biometric gates.</p>
 Healthcare 
<p>Hospitals deploy it to verify patient identities and reduce fraud in insurance systems.</p>
 Business and Retail 
<p>Companies use it for employee access, while retailers are testing it to create personalized shopping experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Strengths and Weaknesses 
<p>Advantages</p>
 
 Quick and seamless compared to ID cards
<p></p> 
 Helps prevent fraud and identity theft
<p></p> 
 Improves user experience
<p></p> 
 Works at scale for large organizations
<p></p> 
 
<p>Challenges</p>
 
 Raises privacy concerns if misused
<p></p> 
 Accuracy can drop with poor image quality
<p></p> 
 Bias risk if systems aren’t trained on diverse datasets
<p></p> 
 Sensitive databases may attract hackers
<p></p> 
 
<p>The good news is that testing programs like FRVT are pushing the industry to improve. For example, error rates have fallen drastically as vendors adapt their algorithms to meet those standards.</p>
<p></p>
 The Future of Face Identity Search 
<p>Looking ahead, we’ll see this technology combining with other biometrics like voice and fingerprint for multi-factor security. Processing will also move to local devices using edge computing, making systems faster and less dependent on cloud storage.</p>
<p>Smart cities may integrate it for public safety, while businesses will use it to enhance customer experiences. As the technology matures, issues like bias and privacy will need strict regulation, but the potential is too strong to ignore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Face identity search is reshaping how people prove who they are. From faster airport boarding to secure banking apps, it blends convenience with stronger protection. Independent testing programs, such as the FRVT run by NIST, ensure that the systems are fair, accurate, and ready for real-world use. The road ahead includes both challenges and opportunities, but its role in the future of digital identity is undeniable.</p>

 Infostructure patterns 
<p>One of the hottest topics in the digital economy has for some time been data sharing. Many proposals are evolving in Open Banking and Open Data, alongside digital identity frameworks and more specific digital credentialling. I’m seeing verifiable credentials methods and thinking leaning towards verified data.</p>
<p>“Infostructure” is a term for the orchestrated systems of policies, standards, rules, technologies and architecture that help control the use of important information.</p>
<p>Strikingly similar patterns are evident in the infostructures that have emerged in digital identity, open banking, card payments and digital credentialing. These patterns can help us solve the scaling problems that held back acceptance of digital IDs, and streamline the way we architect a number of important programs. It turns out that many of these programs are variations on a common theme.</p>
 The Standard Model of Digital Identity 
<p>The digital identity field has been dominated for twenty years by a supply-and-demand model featuring three types of participant: Subjects, Identity Providers (IdPs) and Relying Parties (RPs).</p>
<p>Technical standards, government policy, industry associations, businesses, and legislation have all been structured around this Three-Party model in which digital identities are “issued”, “held”, “presented”, “exchanged”, “used” and/or “consumed” as if these are a type of good.</p>
<p>The Standard Model <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/market-failure-of-digital-identity">has not gone well</a> but we can look to a much older canonical data sharing model for help.</p>
 What’s holding back the digital identity market? 
<p>One huge historical challenge has been apportioning liability and allocating reasonable fees for digital identity services.&nbsp; It’s never been really a clear in the standard three-party model of Digital Identity which parties gain the most economic benefit from assured qualities of the data they consume, and how do fees get fairly levied for these assurances.</p>
<p>This problem was solved over sixty years ago with the network business model of the credit card schemes. They realise a two-sided market of payment card issuers and merchants.&nbsp; These are just special cases of ID Issuers and Relying Parties.</p>
<p>Credit card networks have one core job: distribute and verify customer IDs so that merchants can extend credit to customers without needing to know them, and moreover, without knowing the customers’ banks either.&nbsp; That is, the networks join the credit providers (customers’ banks) to merchants without the merchants needing to make their own bilateral arrangements.</p>
 Don’t make this personal! 
<p>Another problem with traditional approaches to digital identity is they tend to over-complicate the problem, by framing it in terms of solving for “who someone is”.</p>
<p>Personal identity is complicated, hard to define, and impossible to standardise. In real life, “identity” means different things to different people. In transactional settings (where digital identity matters) each party needs to know different things about their counterparties, so a singular answer to “who you are” is fundamentally elusive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we reframe the digital identification problem around as What Do You Need To Know about a counterparty, and if we expect to address that question in different ways according to context, then the possible solutions look rather different from the traditional three-party model.</p>
<p>That is, let’s recognise digital identity as a special case of verified data sharing — and keep the personal out of it.</p>
 Generalising from Three Parties to Four 
<p>Lockstep has been working on a four-party <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/dvp/">data verification platform</a> (DVP) architecture inspired by the credit card network model. &nbsp;The DVP augments the traditional three players with a new fourth party that intermediates between Relying Parties and Issuers.</p>
<p>As I look at it, the awkward failures of Federated Identity (despite it seeming like such a great idea) shows that digital identity is not what we thought it was. But the tools and infrastructure that we’ve developed along the way can be repurposed.</p>
<p>It will be far more useful (and far less complicated) if we generalise digital identity frameworks from WHO to WHAT.</p>
<p>We should be issuing third party verifiable credentials to non-human Subjects (IoT devices, virtual agents, even AI algorithms themselves) to prove all the qualities and properties of interest. And to make these assertions legible and acceptable at scale, we need a new type of fourth party to intermediate between data sources and data receivers when these are at arm’s length from each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The fourth party onboards data receivers (just like acquiring banks onboard merchants into the card systems), executes a standard form of contract with them, and supports them with metadata (credential descriptors, accreditation information, public keys etc.).</p>
<p>The fourth party is the missing link in scalable systems of verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials cannot verify themselves. That is, the verification step requires essential metadata which need to be distributed to relying parties. &nbsp;This metadata includes the public keys needed to cryptographically confirm the signatures on credentials and presentations. It also includes the names and target values of such things as credential issuers, credential types, accreditations etc. These are the critical details needed for relying party software to make programmatic decisions to accept or reject the data that it’s being presented with.</p>
 Comparing Three Party and Four Party models 
<p>The following tables compare several paragons of the two types of model.</p>

<p>Every year <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-ai">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) is doing more, delivering better, and becoming faster. <a href="https://au.pcmag.com/ai/112426/apple-ceo-ai-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-the-internet-smartphones">Apple</a> says the AI revolution is “as big or bigger” than the internet, smartphones, cloud computing, and apps. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/6-ai-trends-youll-see-more-of-in-2025/">Microsoft</a> says AI technology will change every part of our lives. But our <a href="https://cybernews.com/ai-news/how-your-personal-information-is-training-ai/">personal information is fuelling the AI revolution</a>—and that presents massive AI privacy risks.</p>



<p>Without our consent, companies are scraping our personal information from across the internet and using it to train AI systems—and that’s just one way AI threatens personal privacy. Here we look at the long laundry list of AI privacy threats in 2025 and the tools you need to fight back.</p>



 12 AI privacy threats—and counting &nbsp; 



<p>Everything we do generates data—and AI systems scrape, link together, and thrive off that data.</p>



<p>AI uses our information to both understand what we want from it and to perform its tasks. We give AI our data intentionally (e.g. by writing prompts containing personal details) and unintentionally (e.g. by being near facial recognition technology such as a Ring doorbell).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But AI privacy and security threats don’t only stem from what we share with AI but also from how AI can analyze, infer, and act on that information without permission.<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">Academics</a> have identified at least <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">12 privacy risks from AI</a>:</p>



 
 AI collects massive amounts of data from everywhere, increasing risks of surveillance. AI can harvest phone numbers, emails, and personal information and images from websites, social media, and public records. 



 AI automatically links identity information across various data sources, increasing risk of personal identity exposure. Using pattern recognition, AI can match and correlate scraped data from scattered sources and readily knit it together into a clear profile of a person. 



 When AI combines data about a person, it makes inferences from it, boosting the risks of privacy invasion. 



 AI infers personality or social attributes from physical characteristics, potentially leading to bias and discrimination. 



 AI repurposes data beyond its original intended use, further eroding user control. 



 AI has opaque data practices which fail to inform and give users control over how their data is used. 



 AI storage practices and data requirements risk data leaks and improper access. 



 AI can reveal sensitive information, such as through generative AI techniques. 



 AI’s ability to generate realistic but fake content makes it easier to spread false or misleading information. 



 AI can cause improper sharing of data when it infers additional sensitive information from raw data. 



 AI makes sensitive information more accessible to a wider audience than intended. 



 AI technologies invade personal space or solitude, often through surveillance measures. 
 



<p></p>



<p>One rapidly growing impact of AI data gathering is targeted scams and phishing. AI makes fraud more convincing by using readily available personal data to tailor attacks. AI-generated <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">voice deepfakes</a>, and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/beware-ai-generated-deepfake-texts-emails-and-websites-this-holiday-season/">deepfake</a> texts, emails and web sites promoting fake products, deals and giveaways are part of the highest reported form of scam, according to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">FTC</a>.</p>



 Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ultimate data broker 



<p>If you think about it, AI is the ultimate <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data broker</a>.</p>



<p>Data brokers are companies that harvest, manipulate and even misrepresent consumer data and sell it to companies, usually for marketing. Data brokers are legitimate but unregulated businesses, there are about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">4,000</a>&nbsp;of them worldwide,&nbsp;and their&nbsp;industry is worth about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">US $200 billion</a>&nbsp;annually.&nbsp;The largest data brokers, such as Acxiom, <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">have tens of thousands of servers</a> collecting and analyzing thousands of data points per person from <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/internet/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">hundreds of millions of consumers</a> globally.</p>



<p>AI systems basically do the same thing—and in turn data brokers are using AI to boost their success rate and profit margins. According to the <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-05-22/how-your-data-ends-up-in-ai-training-sets">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, “a rapidly growing industry has also sprung up to broker training data to AI companies with more niche requirements. Some of the datasets you can buy on this marketplace include images of conflict, protest crowds, adult content, audio datasets of recorded phone conversations on various topics, and social media posts classified by the sentiment they express.”</p>



 Auto opt-in to AI training is a big issue 



<p>A recent deep dive into how to stop AI from getting its bots on your personal data by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">The Guardian</a> says default opt-ins are an industry-wide issue. It says a recent report by the FTC on the data practices of nine social media and streaming platforms including WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and Amazon “found that nearly all of them fed people’s personal information into automated systems with no comprehensive or transparent way for users to opt out.” The article gives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">instructions</a> for opting out of the major platforms but warns it’s not easy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">Wired</a> ran a similar article on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">how to opt out of AI training</a> and covered more platforms including Figma, Adobe, Grammarly, Google Gemini, LinkedIn and loads more.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-05-22/how-your-data-ends-up-in-ai-training-sets">article</a> also has instructions but warns consumers to be realistic about the fact that the horse has already bolted.</p>



<p>“Any companies building AI have already scraped the web, so anything you’ve posted is probably already in their systems. Companies are also secretive about what they have actually scraped, purchased, or used to train their systems,” the Wired guide notes.</p>



 How to protect your personal information from AI 



<p>You can use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/15/x-ai-gmail-meta-privacy-settings">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-stop-your-data-from-being-used-to-train-ai/">Wired’s</a> instructions for removing your data from AI training on all the major platforms, but there’s an easier strategy going forward: don’t expose your personal information in the first place. How do you do that? Use <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">MySudo Reclaim</a>, and the rest of the <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo suite</a>.

If you use one for online shopping, another for dating apps, and another for networking, for example, AI scrapers can’t easily link them together and build a profile on you. 



 Limit your exposure: Instead of sharing your real phone number and email all over the internet, you share your alternative Sudo details, which breaks your data trail. 



 Offer strong security: You can use a dedicated Sudo number for 2FA and account recovery, keeping your real number out of the databases that AI systems analyze. 
 



<p></p>



<p>What’s more, MySudo is an immediate safeguard for you and your family against voice deep fakes like the popular <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-to-use-mysudo-to-save-loved-ones-from-voice-deep-fake-scams/">grandparent scam</a>. To protect yourself:</p>



 
 Set up a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;and assign it a&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-6-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;that you&nbsp;only ever give out to your closest family and friends. 



 Be diligent about only giving out the number to your loved ones so that you build and protect a&nbsp;trusted communication channel with your inner circle. 



 If you have only carefully shared the Sudo number with those you trust, then you’ll know if that number rings, it’s a legitimate communication from within your circle and not a deepfake scammer impersonating you or your loved ones. If you’ve been diligent in protecting your safe Sudo number, it is very unlikely a criminal would have it. 



 <a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">Invite your family and friends</a>&nbsp;to use MySudo and use the app’s phone numbers or&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handle</a>-based&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">end-to-end encrypted</a>&nbsp;calling to communicate with each other.

<p>The MySudo suite includes the MySudo app’s companion product, <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">MySudo Reclaim</a>, which helps you take back your personal data that AI systems mine (and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">bad actors can use for scams</a> with or without AI).</p>



<p>MySudo Reclaim helps by:</p>



 
 Helping you to identity where your data is being held. 



 Monitoring continuously to make sure your details don’t reappear or pop up anywhere else. 



 Reducing the raw material AI can use to track, profile, or impersonate you. 
 



<p></p>



<p>By cutting your data off at the source, MySudo Reclaim ensures there’s less for AI—and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">bad actors</a>—to exploit.</p>



 Why you need both MySudo and MySudo Reclaim to protect against AI privacy risks 



<p>Together, MySudo and MySudo Reclaim provide a two-pronged defense against AI-driven privacy risks:</p>



 
 MySudo prevents new exposure of your information by giving you secure, alternative phone numbers, email addresses, and virtual cards, which you can <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">compartmentalize</a> by Sudo (e.g. one for shopping, dating, networking, travel etc.), breaking your data trail and making it difficult to profile you. 



 MySudo Reclaim cleans up your existing digital footprint by removing personal data from public access. 
 



<p></p>



<p>The result? Less exposure, less linkage, and more control over how your personal data exists in an AI-driven world. The horse might have bolted for AI data use, but you can have a <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-sudos-can-give-you-a-second-chance-at-digital-privacy/">second chance at digital privacy</a> with <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">MySudo Reclaim</a>.</p>

<p>Self-service password reset (SSPR) and self-service account recovery (SSAR) are essential for reducing IT workload and empowering users. However, these solutions, if not implemented securely, can become an organization's biggest security hole. Up to 50% of all IT help desk tickets are for password resets, costing approximately $70 each. While SSPR and SSAR aim to solve this, traditional methods are often fundamentally broken, leaving organizations vulnerable to costly account takeovers.</p>  
 What Are SSPR and SSAR?  
<p>SSPR and SSAR are self-service features that allow users to reset their passwords or recover access to their accounts without needing help from an IT professional. While this can drastically cut operational costs and reduce help desk tickets, it introduces a significant security issue.</p> 
<p>Definitions and Business Use Cases:</p> 
  
  SSPR (Self-Service Password Reset): Allows users to reset a forgotten password without IT intervention.  
  SSAR (Self-Service Account Recovery): Enables users to regain access to a locked or compromised account on their own.  
  
 The Risk of Traditional Recovery Methods  
<p>Traditional SSPR and SSAR solutions rely on methods that are easily exploited by attackers, turning a convenience into a major security vulnerability. These gaps leave organizations open to account takeover (ATO) and social engineering.</p> 
  
  Security questions: Easily guessed or found online through social engineering, making them a weak form of authentication.  
  SMS/email OTPs: Susceptible to phishing and SIM swaps, where attackers can intercept the codes sent to a user's device.  
  Authenticator apps: Can be bypassed with "push bombing" attacks or rendered useless if a user loses or replaces their device.  
  
 Why Identity Verification Is Critical  
<p>Verifying a user's identity before granting access is the only way to ensure security during password resets or recovery. Modern solutions use a multi-factor identity verification (IDV) process that combines document scanning with liveness detection to confirm that a real, present person is requesting access.</p> 
 The Modern SSPR Challenge: Uniting Security and Simplicity  
<p>Effective account recovery presents a difficult challenge: how do you balance the need for absolute security with the user's demand for a fast, simple experience? Traditional methods often fail this test. A lengthy call to a help desk might be secure, but it creates frustration and high operational costs. Conversely, a simple security question is easy for the user but offers almost no real protection against a determined attacker.</p> 
<p>The ideal solution is an intelligent, adaptive flow that can orchestrate multiple signals of identity. It should be able to create a recovery path that is appropriate for the level of risk, making the process frictionless for legitimate users while presenting insurmountable barriers for fraudsters.</p> 
<p>This modern approach moves beyond simple checks to a holistic verification of a user's identity, ensuring that convenience and security are no longer a trade-off.</p> 
 The HYPR Affirm SSPR/SSAR&nbsp;Flow  
<p>HYPR Affirm is a secure, self-service solution that solves the paradox of traditional SSPR and SSAR. It eliminates the vulnerabilities of legacy methods by using a robust, multi-layered identity verification process.</p> 
<p>Here’s how Affirm verifies the user at each step:</p> 
  
  User Initiates SSPR/SSAR: The process begins when the user requests a password reset or account recovery from the login screen or a dedicated service portal.  
  Phone number, Location Check: This includes phone number verification to confirm possession, along with checks on geographic location to identify anomalies.  
  ID Document Scan and&nbsp;Selfie Liveness Check: The user is prompted to scan a government-issued photo ID (like a driver's license or passport). HYPR then performs a certified liveness check with a selfie to confirm the user is physically present, preventing deepfake and presentation attacks in compliance with NIST&nbsp;standards.  
  Automated Verification &amp; Intelligent Escalation: The system instantly cross-references all identity data points to make a verification decision. If the evidence is conclusive, the user is approved. If the risk signals are uncertain, the flow can be automatically escalated to a secure manager or help desk agent chat or a live video call for final, human-assisted verification.  
  Phishing-Resistant Credential Reset: Once fully verified, the user securely completes their password reset or account recovery, establishing a new, phishing-resistant credential for safe, ongoing access.  
  
<p></p> 
 Conclusion  
  
  Traditional SSPR/SSAR methods are not secure and can lead to costly account takeovers.  
  Multi-factor identity verification is the most effective way to secure the recovery process.  
  HYPR Affirm replaces vulnerable methods with a seamless, secure flow that cuts costs and reduces risk.  
  
 FAQs  
<p>Q: How does HYPR Affirm prevent deepfake attacks? A: HYPR Affirm uses a certified liveness check that analyzes the user's selfie in real-time to ensure they are a physically present person, not a deepfake or a static photo.</p> 
<p>Q: Can HYPR Affirm be used with different types of IDs? A: Yes, HYPR Affirm is designed to work with various government-issued photo IDs, such as driver's licenses and passports.</p> 
<p>Q: What is the cost benefit of using HYPR Affirm? A: By reducing help desk tickets for password resets and account recovery by up to 95%, HYPR Affirm can drastically cut operational costs for organizations.</p>

				  Identity Week is the place to learn about the latest in identity technology. Whether you are attending on behalf of a large enterprise, government agency, or small business, this is your chance to see what others are doing and what is coming next in the industry. Here are just a few sessions that Indicio is most excited about.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
 The Startup Pitch Competition (Day 2, Seminar Theater A, 12:50 – 2:50) 
<p>The startup pitch competition brings together 10 startups that have impressed the judges with their applications and technologies. This is your chance to evaluate up and comers in the space and ask questions about their products and services. With each competitor having only seven minutes to pitch and three&nbsp; minutes for questions, this session moves fast and keeps things lively as you get a sneak peek at tomorrow’s tech. Be sure not to miss Indicio’s CEO Heather Dahl as she takes the stage at 1:25 to pitch Indicio and explain how our authenticated biometrics and verifiable credentials solution will save the world!</p>
 Digital IDs at a national scale (Day 1, Seminar Theater B, 3:00) 
<p>Mohamed Al Kuwaiti, Head of Cybersecurity, Cyber Security Council<br>David Almirol, Undersecretary for e-Government, Department of Information and Communication Technology<br>Moderator:<br>Scott Rea, Chief Operating Officer, CertiNext<br></p>
<p>The most important identity that most of us have is the one issued to us by our government, usually through a physical document like a driver’s license or passport. This panel brings together leaders from the United Arab Emirates and the Philippines who have both implemented digital national identities to learn more about their experiences and what the rest of the world can learn from their solutions. Our team is particularly interested in hearing about the benefits their citizens have realized, each government’s strategy for building trust and privacy, and their future plans for interoperability between their national systems and other countries.</p>
 Digital identity at the border: What it means for you, me, and global travel (Day 2, Theater 1, 11:50) 
<p>Michael Zureik, Head of Ecosystem Partnerships – Digital Travel, SITA</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials containing authenticated biometrics enable “government-grade” digital identities. These can be used for preauthorized travel and seamless border crossing, transforming international travel. SITA’s Michael Zuriek explains the evolution of this technology, how it’s needed to meet the current and projected growth in international travel, how it benefits airlines, airports, governments, and travelers —&nbsp;and how crossing the border is only the start of the traveler’s digital identity journey.</p>
 Fighting fraud: Assessing the state of play across the fraud landscape (Day 1, Theater 3, 2:20) 
<p>Chris Skowronek, Dr. Solutions Engineering, Vonage<br>Raphael Tsow, Sr. Director, Identity and Risk Engineering, Ebay<br>Christian Guirnalda, Senior Director Network API Innovation, Verizon<br>Jon Prisby, Lead Biometric and Identity Technology Center, DHS S&amp;T<br>Moderator:<br>Maria Karamalis, CEO/President, Karamalis Consulting LLC<br></p>
<p>Fraud is surging with identity-based attacks displacing malware as the critical vector of attack. Boosted by brute force attacks using AI tools and by the rise of sophisticated&nbsp; generative AI deepfakes, it has never been easier to steal or impersonate someone’s identity. This session will discuss the most promising&nbsp; strategies to combat fraud, how AI innovations are both enabling and preventing fraud, and how to better educate and protect the public. Our team is interested in hearing their thoughts as Indicio’s recent combination of authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials presents a powerful way to prevent <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/how-verifiable-credentials-disrupt-online-fraud-phishing-and-identity-theft/">account phishing</a> and synthetic identity fraud and <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/how-verifiable-credentials-can-handle-the-threat-of-deepfakes-in-kyc/">bypass deepfakes.</a></p>
 Human-centered, business-ready: AI for smarter identity decisions (Day 2, Seminar Theater B, 1:30) 
<p>Arif Mamedov, CEO, Regula Forensics Inc.</p>
<p>Here’s the pitch from Regula Forensics CEO Arif Mamedov: “AI is transforming identity verification, but it is not magic. When used without context or proper control, even advanced systems can mislead. This session explores what makes AI truly effective in high-stakes identity workflows, from airports to banking. Drawing on Regula’s decades of forensic expertise, we will share how explainable logic, human-in-the-loop design, and well-defined boundaries lead to reliable, scalable business results – without relying only on automation.”&nbsp; Count us interested!</p>

 Building Trust In The Decentralized Era <p>In a world that is rapidly moving towards decentralization, one question continues to dominate the conversation: how do we build trust when intermediaries disappear? This is the challenge that gave birth to Ontology Network a high performance, open source blockchain designed not just for speed or scalability, but for trust, identity, and data sovereignty.</p><p>The Problem: Trust in the Digital&nbsp;Age</p><p>The internet has connected billions, yet it has also created a paradox while information flows freely, trust remains scarce. Every time we log in, share data, or engage in digital transactions, we are forced to rely on centralized platforms. These platforms act as the gatekeepers of identity, data, and reputation.</p><p>But this centralization comes at a&nbsp;cost:</p><p>Data exploitation by corporations who monetize personal information.</p><p>Single points of failure that expose users to breaches, hacks, and censorship.</p><p>Lack of digital sovereignty, where individuals cannot truly own or control their digital identities.</p><p>Clearly, the digital future requires a new framework one that puts people, not platforms, at the&nbsp;center.</p><p>The Vision of&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>Ontology Network was created to answer this need. Its existence is grounded in one simple but transformative idea: trust should be decentralized, verifiable, and user&nbsp;owned.</p><p>By combining high-speed blockchain infrastructure with decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions, Ontology gives individuals and enterprises the ability&nbsp;to:</p><p>Own their identities across multiple platforms without relying on a central authority.</p><p>Control their data and decide who can access it, when, and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p><p>Transact securely and transparently, with trust anchored in cryptography rather than third&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Why The Ontology Network&nbsp;Exists</p><p>Ontology exists because the future of the internet demands more than just financial decentralization. While many blockchains focus primarily on tokenization and DeFi, Ontology focuses on the foundations of digital society: who we are, how we prove it, and how we interact.</p><p>Here’s what sets Ontology&nbsp;apart:</p><p>1. Decentralized Identity (ONT ID): A framework where individuals own their identity credentials and can use them anywhere.</p><p>2. Data Sovereignty: Instead of handing over your data to corporations, you control, share, and even monetize it on your own&nbsp;terms.</p><p>3. Enterprise Ready Infrastructure: Ontology provides the scalability and tools businesses need to integrate blockchain trust into their services.</p><p>4. Interoperability: Ontology is designed to work across chains, ensuring that identity and data can move freely across the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>The Bigger&nbsp;Picture</p><p>Ontology doesn’t just exist to solve today’s problems. It exists to shape tomorrow’s digital world a world&nbsp;where:</p><p>Healthcare records belong to patients, not hospitals.</p><p>Educational achievements are verified and portable across&nbsp;borders.</p><p>Financial inclusion becomes a reality, as people without banks can still build verifiable reputations.</p><p>Communities thrive on trust that is algorithmically provable, not institutionally enforced.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>The Ontology Network exists because trust is the currency of the future, and the way we build and verify that trust must evolve. By enabling decentralized identity, data sovereignty, and interoperable trust frameworks, Ontology is laying the foundation for a digital world that is more secure, transparent, and human&nbsp;centric.</p><p>The internet of the past belonged to corporations.<br>The internet of the future belongs to us.<br>And Ontology is here to make that future possible.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/why-the-ontology-network-exists-f8f102a37602">WHY THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK EXISTS</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Commercial lenders face heightened global AML expectations, especially around KYB, UBO verification, and ongoing monitoring. This article outlines key obligations across the U.S., UK, Canada, EU, and Australia—and how iComply helps automate compliance for business loan onboarding and risk management.</p>
 
 Commercial lenders – from banks to fintech platforms to leasing companies – are under increasing pressure to validate the legitimacy of the businesses they serve. Regulators worldwide now expect lenders to implement robust know-your-business (KYB) procedures, identify beneficial owners (UBOs), and monitor ongoing risk across their business lending portfolios. 
<p>With varying standards across borders and complex corporate structures at play, automation is no longer optional – it’s essential.</p>
 
 AML and KYB Expectations for Lenders 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, OCC, FDIC, state banking departments 
 Requirements: BOI reporting under the Corporate Transparency Act, CDD Rule compliance, SAR filings, and sanctions screening 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA, PRA 
 Requirements: KYB, UBO verification, transaction monitoring, and enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk entities 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Business client verification, beneficial ownership discovery, ongoing monitoring, and STRs for suspicious transactions 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National regulators under AMLD6 framework 
 Requirements: KYB and UBO collection, EDD for complex structures, and real-time transaction tracking 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF compliance for non-bank lenders, UBO transparency, and reporting obligations for high-value transactions 
 
 
 Lending-Specific Risk Factors 
<p>1. Opaque Business Structures<br>
LLCs, trusts, and holding companies often obscure real ownership.</p>
<p>2. High Application Volume<br>
Manual KYB checks don’t scale with demand.</p>
<p>3. Evolving Regulatory Standards<br>
CTA in the U.S., EU AMLA rollout, and FATF alignment create shifting expectations.</p>
<p>4. Loan Fraud and Misuse of Funds<br>
Inadequate checks can lead to reputational damage, defaults, and penalties.</p>
 
 How iComply Supports AML in Lending 
<p>iComply provides a configurable platform that simplifies KYB, UBO discovery, and AML monitoring for commercial lenders.</p>
 1. Streamlined KYB Onboarding 
 
 Verify legal entities through registry and document checks 
 Identify directors, shareholders, and authorized signatories 
 Localized workflows and multilingual support 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Mapping 
 
 Visual UBO trees across jurisdictions 
 Automated detection of nominee owners and shell structures 
 Apply configurable thresholds for deeper review 
 
 3. AML and Sanctions Screening 
 
 Real-time screening of businesses and individuals against global watchlists 
 Continuous monitoring with refresh cycles and trigger-based reviews 
 Risk scoring by industry, geography, and transaction patterns 
 
 4. Case Management and Reporting 
 
 Unified dashboard for all onboarding and screening activity 
 Audit-ready logs and regulatory export templates (FinCEN, FCA, AUSTRAC, etc.) 
 Track escalations, reviews, and resolution timelines 
 
 
 Case Insight: SME Lender in the UK 
<p>A UK-based lender adopted iComply to digitize business borrower onboarding. Within 6 weeks:</p>
 
 Cut average application processing time by 45% 
 Flagged 3 UBO anomalies across high-value applicants 
 Passed an FCA review of UBO verification procedures and audit trails 
 
 
 Final Word 
<p>Commercial lenders must scale responsibly. Those who embrace KYB automation now can:</p>
 
 Reduce onboarding friction 
 Improve risk visibility 
 Meet cross-border AML expectations with confidence 
 
<p>Talk to iComply to see how we help lenders automate 90% of compliance tasks—so your team can focus on building relationships, not chasing paperwork.</p>

<p>Ransomware prevention is no longer about defense alone. It’s a Monday morning at a global consumer bank. Customers logging into online banking suddenly can’t access their accounts. Behind the scenes, ransomware has encrypted core systems and stolen millions of customer records. The attackers aren’t only demanding payment to restore access, they’re also threatening to release personally identifiable information (PII), exposing customers to fraud and the bank to severe regulatory penalties. This isn’t a nightmare scenario, but the reality that many financial institutions are already facing. According to the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GT9kP0">Link Index for Ransomware Prevention (2025)</a>, ransomware incidents are rising year-over-year in the financial services sector, with projected damages exceeding $30 billion annually by 2026. The Link Index echoes findings from Cybersecurity Ventures, which identify ransomware as one of the fastest-growing forms of cybercrime worldwide, with a new attack occurring every two seconds as perpetrators refine their malware payloads and extortion tactics.</p>



 







 



 What is Ransomware? 



<p>The Link Index defines ransomware as malicious software that encrypts or steals an organization’s data and demands payment for its return or release. Once considered a technical nuisance, ransomware has become a systemic cyber risk impacting industries from financial services to healthcare.</p>



 Types of Ransomware Attacks 



 
 Encryption-based ransomware: Locks critical systems until ransom is paid. 



 Double extortion: Combines encryption with data theft, threatening to publish sensitive data if payment is refused. 



 AI-enabled ransomware: Accelerates the threat further, mutating payloads faster than defenders can respond. 
 



 Why Traditional Defenses Fail 



<p>The Link Index highlights a persistent reliance on backups, endpoint detection (EDR), and extended detection and response (XDR) that are proving inadequate:</p>



 
 Backups no longer guarantee resilience, since stolen data can still be weaponized for extortion. 



 EDR/XDR tools overwhelm analysts, with over 40% of ransomware alerts flagged as false positives in some enterprises. 
 



<p>These findings are reinforced by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach">IBM and Ponemon Institute</a>, which identify alert fatigue as one of the costliest inefficiencies for enterprise security teams. The U.S. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> echoes this challenge, noting in its #StopRansomware Guide that traditional defenses often fail against modern double extortion and data destruction tactics.Perhaps most concerning: defenses can’t keep up with the speed of ransomware evolution. By the time a signature is written, AI-enabled ransomware variants like LockBit 3.0 and BlackCat have already mutated, leaving enterprises one step behind.</p>



 The Stakes Are Rising 



<p>According to Liminal’s research, the top drivers of enterprise adoption for ransomware prevention solutions are regulatory pressure, insurance mandates, and operational continuity. These forces are intensifying across global markets.</p>



 



 



Top buyer adoption drivers for ransomware prevention solutions



 
 Regulatory Pressure: In the U.S., the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023-139">SEC</a> now requires public companies to disclose material cyber incidents on Form 8-K. In Europe, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">EU NIS2 Directive</a> enforces similarly strict resilience standards. 



 Insurance Mandates: The Link Index found that insurance mandates rank among the top three adoption drivers, with industry leaders like <a href="https://www.marsh.com/en/services/cyber-risk/insights.html">Marsh</a> confirming stricter underwriting standards. 



 Operational Continuity: Downtime remains one of the most critical financial risks. Studies show a single day of ransomware downtime can cost enterprises $1M per day (ITIC via ransomware.org). 
 



<p>For broader strategies around managing supplier and insurer demands, see the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GTskf0">Link Index for Cybersecurity Third-party Risk Management</a>.</p>



 



<p>“We’re seeing ransomware shift from being an IT headache to a full-blown business crisis. The data shows damages climbing past $30B by 2026, and the old playbook of backups and detection just isn’t enough anymore. Enterprises need intelligence-first prevention to stay ahead.”— Jonathan Gergis, Insights Team Lead, Liminal</p>



 



<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p></p>

</blockquote>



 The Solution: How Intelligence-Driven Ransomware Prevention Works 



<p>The Link Index identifies a decisive shift toward intelligence-driven prevention as the new enterprise standard. Rather than waiting for alerts, enterprises are adopting solutions that:</p>



 
 Correlate weak signals across endpoints, cloud, and networks. 



 Apply behavioral analytics to detect credential abuse and lateral movement. 



 Provide real-time business context to analysts for decisive action. 
 



<p>This shift is visible in the market. Vendors are retooling product roadmaps to deliver ransomware-specific intelligence capable of detecting advanced variants like LockBit and BlackCat. Importantly, 63% of CISOs surveyed in the Link Index now rank intelligence-first ransomware prevention above legacy tool upgrades. This trend is echoed by Gartner, which emphasizes that behavioral detection and intelligence-driven strategies must replace signature-based tools.</p>



<p>Leading security vendors are already pivoting toward this model:</p>



 
 Microsoft has embedded ransomware-specific intelligence into its Defender platform. 



 CrowdStrike has expanded its Falcon platform to correlate signals across endpoints and cloud. 



 Palo Alto Networks is retooling its Cortex suite to emphasize prevention through behavioral analytics and automated response. 
 



<p>These shifts reflect a broader industry recognition that traditional defenses cannot keep pace with AI-enabled ransomware variants.</p>



<p>For broader strategies around managing AI Data Governance, see the <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03GTmL00">AI Data Governance Link Index</a>.</p>



 What CISOs Should Do Now 



<p>CISOs looking to strengthen resilience against ransomware should prioritize intelligence-first strategies. Key actions include:</p>



 
 Build cross-platform intelligence pipelines to unify data across endpoints, cloud, and network environments. 



 Validate vendor claims by demanding proof of real-time ransomware variant detection, not just signature-based defenses. 



 Update incident response playbooks to address modern double extortion scenarios. 



 Align prevention strategies with regulations like the SEC’s cyber disclosure rules and the EU’s NIS2 Directive, ensuring compliance and insurer coverage. 



 Invest across five prevention categories from the Ransomware Prevention Link Index: endpoint protection, backup and recovery, identity security, detection and response, and email/web security. 
 



<p>By embedding these practices into a unified, intelligence-driven prevention framework, enterprises can reduce reliance on reactive defenses and build resilience that meets both regulatory scrutiny and insurance mandates.</p>



 Key Takeaways 



 
 $30B in annual ransomware damages by 2026 (Link Index). 



 Traditional defenses fail against AI-enabled ransomware like LockBit 3.0 and BlackCat; false positives drain analyst resources. 



 Intelligence-driven prevention is the new enterprise standard: signal correlation, behavioral analytics, and real-time context. 



 Regulatory, insurance, and financial pressures SEC, EU NIS2, and leaders like Marsh, are accelerating adoption. 



 CISOs must act now: align strategies with regulations and insurance standards while investing in intelligence-led prevention.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including mature economies like Singapore and Malaysia, and high-growth markets like Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines, as well as in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), the future of finance is being written in real time. From Jakarta to Sydney, Bangkok to Wellington, financial institutions are embracing rapid digitization. Regulatory reform, fintech competition, rising fraud threats, and shifting consumer expectations are all pushing the industry to evolve rapidly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in this rush to innovate, success is no longer just about launching the next digital wallet, cashless payment option, or open banking Application Programming Interfaces (API). It’s about trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To grow and scale in today’s connected economy, financial services organizations must continuously prove who a customer is, whether a transaction is safe, and how data should be shared. That’s where digital identity, or identity and access management (IAM) comes in. Digital identity is not simply a technical enabler - it’s the connective tissue between trust, innovation, security, and scale. And across ASEAN and ANZ, it’s increasingly being recognized as the foundational capability that determines how, and how fast, financial services can evolve.</p>

 Your diploma, on your phone: a student-first guide to secure digital credentials 
<p>Who this is for: students (and anyone helping students—career services, program leads, registrars)<br>
Promise: zero paper chase, faster opportunities, more privacy—without you learning any tech.</p>
 TL;DR (read this if you’re between classes) 
 
 Show proof in seconds. Instead of digging for PDFs or waiting on office emails, you share a secure link or QR from your phone. Employers, scholarships, other schools—everyone gets a clear yes/no instantly. 
 You control your info. Share only what’s needed (e.g., “enrolled this term” or “degree awarded”). No oversharing, no surprises. 
 Built for real life. Lost your phone? Credentials can be re-issued. Name spelled wrong? They can revoke and fix fast, and verifiers always see the latest version. 
 AI-first for safety. Extrimian uses AI to protect your identity and speed up university workflows—not to snoop on you or cut corners. 
 
<p>Why should you care (today, not “someday”)?</p>
<p>Scholarships and benefits need status now, not next week. Many proofs are simple: “Is this student currently enrolled?” Your enrollment credential answers that without dumping your full transcript. Fewer forms; faster yeses.</p>
<p>Study abroad and transfers are smoother. Another school can confirm a course completion or degree without emailing five offices. You share once; they verify independently; your application keeps moving.</p>
<p>Privacy actually improves. You don’t have to forward ancient PDFs that reveal way too much. With a digital credential, you show the minimum required—and only when you choose.</p>
<p>You always have it with you. Your phone already holds tickets, payments, and boarding passes. Your diploma and key proofs belong there too—secure, portable, ready when opportunity calls.</p>
 How it works—without the nerd talk 
<p>Think of each credential (your diploma, enrollment status, course badge) as a sealed envelope with your university’s unique stamp.</p>
 
 If someone opens it and changes even a line, the stamp breaks, and the checker immediately says Not valid. 
 Extrimian provides the stamp (digital signature), the envelope (the credential in your wallet), and the counter window (the university’s one-page verification site) where anyone can check it—no emails, no guessing. 
 
<p>You don’t manage keys, blockchains, or any of that. You just receive, store, and share—and it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real moments you’ll use it (and how it feels) 
 1) “Can you prove you actually graduated?” 
<p>You tap Share diploma, send a link or show a QR. The recruiter scans and sees: Valid — Degree: [Your Degree], Issuer: [Your University], Date: [Month/Year]. Done. No PDF edits, no “I’ll pass it to my manager,” no waiting.</p>
 2) “We need proof you’re enrolled for this semester.” 
<p>You share Enrollment: Current Term. It shows exactly that—and nothing else. If your status changes, the old credential is revoked and anyone who checks it sees that it’s no longer valid.</p>
 3) “Upload a course completion for credit transfer.” 
<p>You share a verifiable course credential that confirms you passed the class. The other school verifies it themselves and moves on to the next step. Less paperwork, fewer delays.</p>
 4) “Student discount—show ID?” 
<p>You present a student ID credential. The vendor or campus service scans and gets a simple Yes without seeing your grades, address, or anything personal they don’t need.</p>
 5) “Oh no, I lost my phone…” 
<p>If you lose your device, you tell the university. They revoke the old credentials and re-issue to your new device after confirming it’s you. The verification page always shows the latest truth, so you’re covered.</p>
 6) “There’s a typo on my diploma.” 
<p>It happens. The registrar revokes the old one and re-issues a corrected credential. Anyone who checks the old link sees “Revoked,” and the new link shows your accurate details. No awkward explanations.</p>
 Your data, your call (how privacy works in plain language) 
 
 Share the minimum. Many checks only need a yes/no on a specific fact (enrolled, degree awarded, course completed). Your credential can provide just that. 
 You choose when to share. Nothing leaves your wallet until you decide to present it. You’re in the driver’s seat. 
 It’s obvious if someone tampers. If a file is altered, the verification fails immediately. You don’t have to argue; the page tells the truth. 
 Clean history for you. When a credential is revoked and re-issued (e.g., to fix a typo), everyone sees the updated version at the same link. No “which PDF is the latest?” chaos. 
 
 Get started in 3 easy steps (what you’ll actually do) 
 
 Receive your credential.<br>
 When your university turns this on, you’ll get instructions to add a wallet (mobile or web) and receive your diploma/enrollment credentials securely. 
 Keep it safe.<br>
 Set a PIN or biometric lock for the digital identity wallet (Face ID, fingerprint). If you change phones, you’ll have a simple way to recover or re-issue with university support. 
 Share when needed.<br>
 For scholarships, or transfers: open the wallet → Share → send link or show QR. The other side gets a clear answer in seconds, and you keep control.

<p></p>
<p>University Secure Identity &amp; Data</p>
 
 FAQ about verified digital diplomas: 
 Can I still get a paper diploma? 
<p>Yes, if your university offers it. The digital version is the official way to prove authenticity online—and you can even print a QR on the paper diploma that points back to it.</p>
 Do I need the internet to show it?<br>
 
<p>You can open your wallet and show the QR; the verifier needs a connection to check the status. If you’re somewhere with poor signal, you can share the link later. Many events now have scanners or staff with connectivity.</p>
 What if I don’t want to share my grades?<br>
 
<p>You don’t have to. Most checks only need a degree or enrollment. Share the minimum required for the situation.</p>
 What if something’s wrong on my credential? 
<p>Ask the registrar to revoke and re-issue. You’ll get the corrected one quickly, and anyone using the old link will see it’s no longer valid. No awkward “ignore my last attachment” moments.</p>
 <br>
Which benefits this tech offers to student &amp; clubs 
 
 Club badges and event passes: your university may issue digital badges for roles or events. They’re easy to share with sponsors or include in portfolios. 
 Volunteering &amp; labs: log verified hours or lab competencies as mini-credentials you can show to research programs or NGOs. 
 Community trust: a simple Valid check reduces ticket fraud and line headaches at big events. 
 
<p>(Availability depends on what your university enables—ask your student affairs office what’s planned.)</p>
 What this means for your university 
<p>With Extrimian, the university issues tamper-proof digital credentials, offers one official page to verify them in seconds, and uses AI internally to spot risk and speed corrections. Students get control and privacy; employers get instant answers; staff spend less time on inbox ping-pong. It’s security and simplicity, together.</p>
 Ready when you are 
<p>When your university enables Extrimian credentials, you’ll receive a message with simple steps to get your wallet and your first credentials. Until then, save this page, tell your career office what you’d love to see first (diploma, enrollment, course badges), and get ready to retire the messy PDF folder.</p>

<p>On September 3, 2025, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)<a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20250903">sanctioned</a> Guangzhou Tengyue Chemical Co., Ltd., a Chinese company, along with two company representatives, Huang Xiaojun and Huang Zhanpeng. The only cryptocurrency address sanctioned today was associated with Huang Xiaojun.<br><br>According to OFAC’s <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0235">press release</a>, Guangzhou Tengyue Chemical is “a chemical company operating in China that is involved in the manufacture and sale of synthetic opioids to Americans. In addition to opioids, Guangzhou Tengyue has also sold dangerous analgesic chemicals often used as cutting agents that are mixed with synthetic opioids and other illicit drugs.” Both individuals mentioned above are “representatives of Guangzhou Tengyue” who OFAC says “were directly involved in coordinating the shipments of these illicit drugs and cutting agents to the United States.”<br><br>Huang Zhanpeng is the executive director and 50 percent shareholder of Guangzhou Tengyue. He also is listed as the company’s legal representative. Huang Xiaojun is the owner of the bitcoin account the company used to sell controlled substances in 2023 to a U.S. buyer.<br><br>The designations reflect wider US efforts against the drug trade within and into the United States, particularly where Chinese <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/disrupting-the-fentanyl-trade-how-blockchain-analytics-is-empowering-agencies-to-stamp-out-flows">fentanyl</a> producers and cartels, namely from Mexico and Columbia, import and sell illicit drugs in US cities and launder their funds in the United States using local professional money laundering organizations (PMLO). In this context, in addition to OFAC’s designations, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) is also announcing a federal criminal indictment against the abovementioned and other individuals and companies “for their roles in facilitating the flow of illicit drugs… The charged defendants include three individuals in the United States and approximately 22 individuals and businesses based in China. The indictment is based upon a joint investigation by [the] FBI and DEA, which commenced in January 2024.”<br><br>For context, “Opioid overdose remains the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. Since 2021, more than 70 percent of all reported drug overdose deaths have involved synthetic opioids, with fentanyl being the primary synthetic opioid driving this crisis.&nbsp; China-based chemical manufacturing companies remain the primary source of fentanyl precursor chemicals and other illicit opioids entering the United States,” the press release states. Elliptic has conducted extensive research on the use of crypto in the <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/resources/elliptic-report-crypto-and-the-global-fentanyl-trade-0">trafficking of fentanyl and related synthetic opioids</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>As noted, OFAC listed one crypto address associated with Huang Xiaojun. Elliptic’s data shows that this address has received funds directly from multiple known Fentanyl precursor vendors we have labelled in our dataset. It has also sent funds directly to multiple known stolen credit card data vendors, thieves, and scams.&nbsp;</p>

				  Through its partnership with SITA, Indicio will advance government-issued digital travel credentials in this two-year digital identity wallet trial, building on its success as the first to implement biometric-enabled credentials for international travel and border crossing.

<p>APTITUDE, one of the newest Large Scale Pilots backed by the European Commission, has officially launched, marking a major milestone in the EU’s drive to equip 80% of residents with a digital identity wallet by 2026 and setting out to prove how digital wallets can transform travel and payments across Europe.</p>
 What is APTITUDE? 
<p>APTITUDE is a groundbreaking €20 million cross-border initiative coordinated by the French government that brings together 118 partners from 11 EU Member States and Ukraine to analyze, integrate, and pilot real-world use cases for travel and payment within the European Digital Identity Framework (EUDI).</p>
<p>Backed by funding under the €8.1 billion <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/programmes/digital">Digital Europe Programme</a>, APTITUDE is part of the EU’s broader effort to drive digital transformation and operationalize the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/spaces/EUDIGITALIDENTITYWALLET/pages/694487738/EU+Digital+Identity+Wallet+Home">European Digital Identity Wallet</a> by demonstrating its value across critical industries.</p>
<p>The scale of APTITUDE reflects the importance of digital identity in enabling secure, efficient, and interoperable services across borders. The project is a milestone in the global movement to make digital identity secure, interoperable, and practical at scale. Uniting governments, technology providers, and industry leaders, APTITUDE will test and validate solutions that meet EU standards and deliver practical benefits to citizens and businesses.</p>
 The digital transformation of travel 
<p>Travel and payments are critical touchpoints between people, governments, and businesses.

  <p>Secure access with enterprise IT oversight between independent applications that communicate with each other is a recognized gap in <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/oauth-openid/">OAuth 2.0</a>. Enterprises can’t effectively regulate cross-app communication, as OAuth 2.0 consent screens rely on users granting access to their individual accounts. Now, with the advent of AI agents that communicate across systems, the need to solve the gap is even greater – especially given the growing importance of enterprise AI security in protecting sensitive data flows.</p>

 What is Cross App Access (XAA)? 

<p>Cross App Access (XAA) is a new protocol that lets integrators enable secure agent-to-app and app-to-app access. Instead of scattered integrations and repeated logins, enterprise IT admins gain centralized control: they can decide what connects, enforce security policies, and see exactly what’s being accessed. This unlocks seamless, scalable integrations across apps — whether it’s just two like Google Calendar and Zoom, or hundreds across the enterprise. Read more about Cross App Access in this post:</p>

<p>Or watch the video about Cross App Access:</p>

 
            
         

<p>In this post, we’ll go hands-on with Cross App Access. Using Todo0 (the Resource App) and Agent0 (the Requesting App) as our sample applications, and Okta as the enterprise Identity Provider (IdP), we’ll show you how to set up trust, exchange tokens, and enable secure API calls between apps that enable enterprise IT oversight. By the end, you’ll not only understand how the protocol works but also have a working example you can adapt to your own integrations.</p>

 Prerequisites to set up the AI agent to app connections using Cross App Access (XAA) 

<p>To set up secure agent-to-app connections with Cross App Access (XAA), you’ll need the following:</p>

 
   Okta Developer Account (Integrator Free Plan): You’ll need an Okta Developer Account with the Integrator Free Plan. This account will act as your Identity Provider (IdP) for setting up Cross App Access.
     
       If you don’t already have an account, sign up for a new one here: <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">Okta Integrator Free Plan</a> 
       Once created, sign in to your new org 
     
   
   AWS Credentials: You’ll need an AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key
     
       The IAM user or role associated with these credentials must have access to Amazon Bedrock, specifically the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, enabled 
       If you don’t know how to obtain the credentials, <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-cross-app-access-mcp/blob/main/guide/aws-bedrock.md">follow this guide</a> 
     
   
   Developer Tools: These tools are essential for cloning, editing, building, and running your demo applications
     
       <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> – to clone and manage the repository 
       <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download">VS Code</a> – for reading and modifying the sample source code 
       <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers">Dev Containers Extension (VS Code)</a> – recommended, as it automatically configures dependencies and environments when you open the project 
       <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/">Docker</a> – required by the Dev Container to build and run the sample applications in isolated environments

 Use Okta to secure AI applications with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Before we dive into the code, we need to register our apps with Okta. In this demo:</p>

 
   Agent0: the AI agent requesting app (makes the API call on behalf of the user) 
   Todo0: the resource app (owns the protected API) 
   Managed connection: the trust relationship between the two apps, created in Okta 
 

<p>We’ll create both apps in your Okta Integrator Free Plan account, grab their client credentials, and then connect them.</p>

 Enable Cross App Access in your Okta org 

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: Cross App Access is currently a self-service Early Access (EA) feature. It must be enabled through the Admin Console before the apps appear in the catalog. If you don’t see the option right away, refresh and confirm you have the necessary admin permissions. Learn more in the <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/security/manage-ea-and-beta-features.htm">Okta documentation on managing EA and beta features</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

 
   Sign in to your Okta Integrator Free plan account 
   In the Okta Admin Console, select Settings &gt; Features 
   Navigate to Early access 
   Find Cross App Access and select Turn on (enable the toggle) 
   Refresh the Admin Console 
 

<p></p>

 Create the resource app (Todo0) 

 
   In the Okta Admin console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Select Browse App Catalog 
   Search for Todo0 - Cross App Access (XAA) Sample Resource App, and select it 
   Select Add Integration 
   Enter “Todo0” in the Application label field and click Done 
   Click the Sign On tab to view the Client ID and Client secret. These are required to include in your <code>.env.todo</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Create the requesting app (Agent0) 

 
   Go back to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Select Browse App Catalog 
   Search for Agent0 - Cross App Access (XAA) Sample Requesting App, and select it 
   Select Add Integration 
   Enter Agent0 in the Application label field and click Done 
   Click the Sign On tab to view the Client ID and Client secret. These are required to be included in your <code>.env.agent</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Establishing connections between Todo0 &amp; AI agent (Agent0) 

 
   From the Applications page, select the Agent0 app 
   Go to the Manage Connections tab 
   Under App granted consent, select Add requesting apps, select Todo0, then Save 
   Under Apps providing consent, select Add resource apps, select Todo0, then Save 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now Agent0 and Todo0 are connected. If you check the Manage Connection tab for either app, you’ll see that the connection has been established.</p>

 Set up a test user in Okta org 

<p>Now that the apps are in place, we need a test user who will sign in and trigger the Cross App Access flow.</p>

 Create the test user 

 
   In the Okta Admin Console, go to Directory &gt; People 
   Select Add Person 
   Fill in the details:
     
       First name: Bob 
       Last name: Tables 
       Username / Email: <code>bob@tables.fake</code> 
     
   
   Under Activations, select Activate now, mark ☑️ I will set password, and create a temporary password 
   Optional: You can mark ☑️ User must change password on first login 
   Select Save (If you don’t see the new user right away, refresh the page) 
 

<p></p>

 Assign the Okta applications to the test user 

 
   Open the Bob Tables user profile 
   Select Assign Applications 
   Assign both Agent0 (requesting app) and Todo0 (resource app) to Bob 
 

<p></p>

<p>This ensures Bob can sign in to Agent0, and Agent0 can securely request access to Todo0 on his behalf.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: Bob will be the identity we use throughout this guide to demonstrate how Agent0 accesses Todo0’s API through Cross App Access.</p>
</blockquote>

 Configure the Node.js Cross App Access project 

<p>With your Okta environment (apps and user) ready, let’s set up the local project. Before we dive into configs, here’s a quick look at what you’ll be working with.</p>

 
   
    <p>Clone the repository:</p>

       <code> git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-cross-app-access-mcp
</code>       
   
   
    <p>Change into the project directory:</p>

       <code> cd okta-cross-app-access-mcp
</code>       
   
   
    <p>Open VS Code Command Palette and run “Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container”<br>
To open Command Palette, select View &gt; Command Palette…, MacOS keyboard shortcut <code>Cmd+Shift+P</code>, or Windows keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+Shift+P</code></p>
   
 

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note: This sets up all dependencies, including Node, Redis, Prisma ORM, and Yarn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

└─ tsconfig.json
</code>   

 Configure OAuth 2.0 and AI foundation models environment files 

<p>At this point, you have:</p>

 
   Client IDs and Client Secrets for both Agent0 and Todo0 (from the Okta Admin Console) 
   
    <p>Your Okta org URL, visible in the Okta Admin Console profile menu of the Admin Console. It usually looks like</p>

       <code>  https://integrator-123456.okta.com
</code>       
   
 

<p>This URL will be your IdP issuer URL and is shared across both apps.</p>

 Generate OIDC configuration and access token files 

<p>From the project root, run:</p>

   <code>yarn setup:env
</code>   

<p>This scaffolds the following files:</p>

 
   <code>packages/authorization-server/.env.todo</code> 
   <code>packages/authorization-server/.env.agent</code> 
   <code>packages/agent0/.env</code> 
 

 Configure AI and resource application connection values 

<p>Open each file and update the placeholder with your org-specific values:</p>

<p><code>authorization-server/.env.todo</code></p>

   <code>CUSTOMER1_EMAIL_DOMAIN=tables.fake
CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER=&lt;Your integrator account URL&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_ID=&lt;Todo0 client id&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;Todo0 client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>authorization-server/.env.agent</code></p>

   <code>CUSTOMER1_EMAIL_DOMAIN=tables.fake
CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER=&lt;Your integrator account URL&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_ID=&lt;Agent0 client id&gt;
CUSTOMER1_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;Agent0 client secret&gt;
</code>   

<p><code>agent0/.env</code></p>

   <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;your AWS access key id&gt;
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your AWS secret access key&gt;
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Note:</p>
   
     The issuer URL (<code>CUSTOMER1_AUTH_ISSUER</code>) is the same in both <code>.env.todo</code> and <code>.env.agent</code> 
     The Client ID/Client secret values differ because they come from the respective apps you created 
     AWS credentials are required only for Agent0 (requesting app) 
   
</blockquote>

 Register OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs for both apps 

<p>Finally, we need to tell Okta where to send the authentication response for each app.</p>

<p>For Agent0:</p>

 
   From your Okta Admin Console, navigate to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Open the Agent0 app 
   Navigate to the Sign On tab 
   In the Settings section, select Edit 
   
    <p>In the Redirect URIs field, add</p>

       <code> http://localhost:5000/openid/callback/customer1
</code>       
   
   Select Save 
 

<p>Repeat the same steps for Todo0:</p>

 
   Open the Todo0 app 
   Go to the Sign On tab &gt; Settings &gt; Edit 
   
    <p>In the Redirect URIs field, add:</p>

       <code> http://localhost:5001/openid/callback/customer1
</code>       
   
   Select Save 
 

<p>Now both apps know where to redirect after authentication.</p>

 Initialize the database and run the project 

<p>With the apps and environment configuration in place, the next step is to prepare the local project, set up its databases, and bring both applications online.</p>

 Bootstrap the project 

<p>From the root of the repo, install all workspaces and initialize the databases:</p>

   <code>yarn bootstrap
</code>   

<p>Since this is your first run, you’ll be asked whether to reset the database. Type “<code>y</code>” for both Todo0 and Agent0.</p>

 Run and access the apps in your browser 

<p>Once the bootstrap is complete, start both apps (and their authorization servers) with:</p>

   <code>yarn start
</code>   

<p>Open the following ports in your Chrome browser’s tab:</p>

 
   Todo0 (Resource App): <a href="http://localhost:3001">http://localhost:3001</a> 
   Agent0 (Requesting App): <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> 
 

<p>At this point, both apps should be live and connected through Okta. 🎉</p>

 Testing the XAA flow: From Bob to Agent0 to Todo0 

<p>With everything configured, it’s time to see Cross App Access in action.</p>

 Interact with Todo0, the XAA resource app, by creating tasks 

 
   In the Work Email field, enter: <code>bob@tables.fake</code>, and select Continue
 
   You’ll be redirected to the Okta Login page. Sign in with the test user credentials:
     
       Username: <code>bob@tables.fake</code> 
       Password: the temporary password you created earlier 
     
   
   The first time you sign in, you’ll be prompted to:
     
       Set a new password 
       Enroll in <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/mobile/okta-verify-overview.htm">Okta Verify</a> for MFA 
     
   
   Once logged in, add several tasks to your to-do list 
   Select one of the tasks and mark it as complete to verify that the application updates the status accurately
 
 

 Let the AI agent, the requesting app, access your todos 

 
   Open the Agent0 app in your browser
 
   Select Initialize to set up the AWS Bedrock client. Once connected, you’ll see the following message:<br>
<code>✅ Successfully connected to AWS Bedrock! You can now start chatting.</code> 
   Select the Connect to IdP button
     
       Behind the scenes, Agent0 requests an identity assertion from Okta and exchanges it for an access token to Todo0 
       If everything is configured correctly, you’ll see the following message<br>
<code>Authentication completed successfully! Welcome back.</code>
 
     
   
   To confirm that Agent0 is actually receiving tokens from Okta:
     
       Open a new browser tab and navigate to: <code>http://localhost:3000/api/tokens</code> 
       You should see a JSON payload containing: <code>accessToken</code>, <code>jagToken</code>, and <code>idToken</code> This verifies that Agent0 successfully authenticated through Okta and obtained the tokens needed to call Todo0
 
     
   
   Now interact with Agent0 using natural prompts. For example: write this prompt
       <code> What's on my plate in my to-do list?
</code>       
    <blockquote>
      <p>⚠️ Note: Agent0 will call the Todo0 API using the access token and return your pending tasks
</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Let’s try some more prompts
     
       Ask Agent0 to add a new task 
       Ask it to mark an existing task complete 
       Refresh the Todo0 app — you’ll see the changes reflected instantly
 
     
   
 

 Behind the scenes: the OAuth 2.0 Identity Assertion Authorization Grant 

<p>✅ Bob Tables logs in once with Okta<br>
⏩ Agent0 (requesting app) gets an identity assertion from Okta<br>
🔄 Okta vouches for Bob and exchanges that assertion for an access token<br>
👋 Agent0 uses that token to securely call the Todo0 (resource app) API</p>

<p></p>

   We don’t spend much time thinking about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or dumps us somewhere we didn’t mean to be. Identity in the age of agentic AI? Same deal. It’s infrastructure. Like a good road, it needs to be ready for traffic we can’t imagine.

<p>“We don’t spend much time thinking about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or dumps us somewhere we didn’t mean to be.”</p>



<p> Identity in the age of agentic AI? Same deal. It’s infrastructure. And just like a good road system, it needs to be engineered with care, built on solid standards, and ready for traffic we can’t even imagine yet.</p>



<p>Right now, autonomous agents are already taking actions on behalf of people and businesses—booking meetings, writing and summarizing emails, pushing code, moving money. Which means we should probably stop and ask: how are those identity and access decisions getting made? Are they secure? Reviewed? Built to best practices? Or are we flooring it across an uninspected bridge, hoping the potholes aren’t too deep?</p>



<p>The protocols making this possible—things like the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">Model Context Protocol</a> (MCP) and Google’s <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/">Agent2Agent</a> (A2A)—are still wet cement. If we want to go from today’s cow paths (cow poop included) to tomorrow’s superhighways, we can’t just slap on more lanes later. We need a strong identity layer poured in from the start.</p>



<p>This post is based on a keynote I gave recently at a large corporate event, where the audience was asking the right questions. If you’re building or maintaining systems that will eventually include autonomous agents, or you’re already there, this is for you.</p>

 What I mean by identity, identity infrastructure, and agentic AI 



<p>“Identity” and “identity infrastructure” can mean different things depending on who you ask. (Get a hundred IAM professionals in a room and you’ll get a thousand definitions.) Since this is my blog post, here’s how I’m using the terms:</p>



 
 Identity – a persistent, verifiable representation of an entity—human or non-human—that other systems can use to decide what it can do, when, for what purpose, and under what conditions. 



 Identity infrastructure – the shared, stable, and standards-based systems, protocols, and governance that make those identities usable across teams, organizations, and technologies, securely, interoperably, and at scale. 



 Agentic AI – borrowing <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-agentic-ai/">NVIDIA’s phrasing</a>, an AI system (often powered by large language models) with sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning that can autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. The key word here is autonomous. Generative AI creates content; agentic AI takes action. 
 



<p>Without grounding in these definitions, it’s easy to talk past each other. With them, we can focus on the real issue: building identity infrastructure that works across both human and non-human actors, especially when those non-humans are making decisions at machine speed.</p>



 AI’s upside is real, but it’s missing a foundation 



<p>When most people talk about AI, we talk about the upside:</p>



 
 Faster iteration cycles 



 Smart automation 



 Real productivity gains 



 Code generation 



 Helpful chatbots that can field questions at scale 
 



<p>GitHub’s <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/">Octoverse</a> report showed a 59% surge in contributions to generative AI projects and a 98% increase in the number of projects overall. Many contributions came from India, Germany, Japan, and Singapore. Interestingly, they also reported that AI hasn’t flooded open source with low-quality junk—if anything, it’s drawing more people into development. (I’m not sure I believe their assertion about the junk. That doesn’t match what I’m hearing anecdotally, but then again, that’s why there are actual studies to balance perception with facts.)</p>



<p>That’s all impressive, even when the results aren’t perfect. These tools are still young, evolving fast, and unlocking new creativity across the stack.</p>



<p>But there’s a missing question in all this excitement: who is acting? On whose behalf? And with what authority?</p>



<p>That’s the identity layer. Without it, all this innovation becomes harder to govern, harder to scale, and harder to trust.</p>



 Agents are already in your systems 



<p>This isn’t hypothetical. Agents are in your tools, updating dependencies, answering tickets, creating calendar invites, summarizing documents, pushing code, and talking to customers.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s 2025 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born">Work Trend Index</a> reports that global leaders rank customer service, marketing, and product development as the top three areas for accelerated AI investment in the next 12–18 months. Seventy-three percent of leading-edge companies will use AI for marketing. Sixty-six percent for customer success. Even internal communications sees 68% adoption.</p>



<p>That’s a lot of automation acting in our name. Without clear identity controls, there is also a lot of potential for AI “marketing fails” or, worse, high-stakes errors.</p>



<p>A few examples:</p>



 
 <a href="https://fastforward.boldstart.vc/when-ai-goes-wrong/">A rogue AI coding assistant</a> wiped out a startup’s production database. 



 <a href="https://www.staffingindustry.com/editorial/cws-30-contingent-workforce-strategies/tutoring-firm-settles-eeocs-first-ai-hiring-bias">AI-powered recruiting software</a> rejected qualified applicants based purely on age and gender, landing the company in court with the EEOC. 
 



<p>These tools are powerful and fast—but oversight around identity and accountability hasn’t kept up.</p>



 Identity isn’t just a login box 



<p>Identity is infrastructure. And infrastructure is more than a username and password. When humans act, we typically have an audit trail: who did what, when, and why. We rely on login sessions, logs, access controls, and behavioral patterns.</p>



<p>But when AI agents act, especially ones with high autonomy, we need something more durable. We need fine-grained delegation models, audit trails tied to machine-driven decisions, and identity primitives that work across humans and non-humans alike.</p>



 
 Identity systems that recognize both human and non-human actors 



 Delegation models that can express “who can do what, for whom, under what conditions” 



 Clear provenance: who authorized the action, and is it appropriate in this context? 



 Verifiability—so we can prove what happened, after the fact 
 



<p>Without that infrastructure, the entire agentic AI ecosystem risks becoming a black box. And for security teams, DevOps leads, and auditors, that’s a non-starter.</p>



 The right questions lead to better systems 



<p>If an agent makes a change, you should be able to answer: Was it authorized? Who delegated the authority? What policy applied?</p>



<p>Microsoft’s report hints at this by asking leaders: how many agents are needed for which roles and tasks, and how many humans to guide them? Those are good but very surface-level questions.</p>



<p>We can push further:</p>



 
 Do you have enough data to clearly scope the role for an AI? 



 Can you give it only the access it needs, when it needs it, for the specific task at hand? 
 



<p>These questions aren’t just risk management. They’re a chance to improve system hygiene and clarity across the board.</p>



 Protocols are evolving but identity hasn’t caught up 



<p>You might be thinking: okay, so what’s out there to support this?</p>



<p>Protocols like the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview">Multi-Agent Communication Protocol</a> (MCP) and <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability/">Agent2Agent</a> (A2A) messaging are <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/17/the-mcp-bandwagon/">early candidates</a>. They enable agents to communicate and coordinate in powerful ways. But they were designed to simplify agents’ communication with agents; they weren’t designed with identity in mind.</p>



<p>Even folks who helped shape OAuth are wrestling with how traditional delegation models fit—or don’t fit—into this space. The communication protocols aren’t broken, they’re just early. Identity hasn’t caught up yet.</p>



<p>And if we don’t make faster progress on these issues, we’ll be forever retrofitting trust into systems that were never built to handle it.</p>



 Why this can’t be proprietary 



<p>You might be tempted to solve this in-house. Build your own delegation model, your own trust chain, your own method for agentic AI authorization. This scenario freaks me out. If every organization invents its own approach to agent identity, we’ll end up right back where we started, in a world of fragile integrations, inconsistent assumptions, and big gaps in accountability.</p>



<p>We’ve ALL seen this before, and the result is always the same:</p>



 
 Fragile integrations 



 Misaligned assumptions between systems 



 Gaps in visibility and accountability 



 Security holes you can drive a nation-state through 
 



<p>That’s why <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/24/digital-identity-open-standards/">open standards</a> matter, not as a checkbox, but as the only viable way to scale trust across systems, companies, and industries.</p>



<p>And to be clear, “open” doesn’t just mean “you can download the spec.” It means:</p>



 
 Shared governance 



 Transparent development 



 Real-world applicability 



 Participation from a broad mix of stakeholders, including security, product, legal, and compliance 
 



<p>This isn’t easy work. But it’s the work that makes the rest possible. And when it works, we get something better than “compliant.” We get trustworthy infrastructure that scales.</p>



 What to do now—before the collapse 



<p>So where does that leave us?</p>



<p>If you’re building agentic AI capabilities into your platform, or even just experimenting with automation, you’re already laying infrastructure. The question is whether that infrastructure will support accountability, or collapse under the weight of delegation you can’t verify. Either we bolt identity onto agentic systems after the fact, or we treat identity like the infrastructure it is, and build it into the foundation.</p>



<p>You don’t need to have all the answers today. But you do need to start asking better questions:</p>



 
 Is identity part of the design, or bolted on later? 



 Are we modeling trust relationships clearly, or making assumptions? 



 Will our logs stand up in an audit, or are we relying on magic? 
 



<p>Start there.</p>



<p>And if you’re in a position to influence the broader direction of the industry, join a standards group. Challenge assumptions in product reviews. Push for interoperability, not lock-in. Make identity part of the foundation, not just a feature.</p>



<p>We don’t have to wait for things to fall apart. We can build roads we actually want to drive on.</p>

 Transcript 



 Roads as a Metaphor 



<p>[00:00:29] Welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re going to talk about roads. Yes, roads. They’re an amazing metaphor, and I’m just going to drive this one all night long.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] We usually don’t think about the roads we drive on—until one cracks, collapses, or leaves us stranded somewhere we never meant to be.</p>



<p>[00:00:49] Identity in the age of agentic AI works the same way. It is infrastructure. And like any good road system, it must be:</p>



 
 Engineered with care 



 Built on solid standards 



 Ready for traffic we can’t even imagine yet 
 



 



 The Rise of Autonomous Agents 



<p>[00:01:04] Autonomous agents are already taking actions on behalf of people and businesses. They’re:</p>



 
 Booking meetings 



 Writing and summarizing emails 



 Pushing code 



 Moving money 
 



<p>[00:01:14] Which raises the key question: how are identity and access management decisions being made for those actions?</p>



<p>Are they secure? Reviewed? Designed according to best practices? Or are we flooring it across an uninspected bridge, hoping the potholes aren’t too deep?</p>



 



 Protocols in Wet Cement 



<p>[00:01:34] Many of the protocols enabling this—such as Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google’s Agent-to-Agent (A2A)—are still wet cement.</p>



<p>[00:01:44] If we want to move from today’s cow paths (cow poop included) to tomorrow’s superhighways, we can’t just slap on more lanes later. We need a strong identity layer poured in from the start.</p>



 



 Defining Identity and Agentic AI 



<p>[00:02:19] Let’s pause and define a few key terms. Because “identity” can mean wildly different things depending on who you ask.</p>



 
 Identity → A persistent, verifiable representation of an entity (person or machine) that other systems use to decide what it can do, when, and under what conditions. 



 Identity Infrastructure → Shared, stable, standards-based systems and governance that make identity portable, interoperable, and reliable at scale. 



 Agentic AI → Borrowing from Nvidia: AI, usually powered by large language models, that doesn’t just generate code but plans and reasons through complex multi-step problems on its own. 
 



<p>[00:03:46] Generative AI writes things.<br>[00:03:52] Agentic AI acts on things.</p>



<p>And that difference matters.</p>



 



 Productivity Gains vs. Identity Risks 



<p>[00:04:11] Conversations around agentic AI often emphasize upsides:</p>



 
 Faster iteration cycles 



 Smarter automation 



 Productivity gains 



 Code generation 



 Scalable chatbots 
 



<p>[00:04:25] GitHub’s Octoverse report shows:</p>



 
 59% surge in contributions to generative AI projects 



 98% increase in overall projects 



 Growth driven by developers in India, Germany, Japan, Singapore, and Latin America 
 



<p>[00:05:15] But what’s often missing is the question: who or what is acting on whose behalf, and with what authority? Without identity, this innovation becomes harder to govern, scale, and trust.</p>



 



 Real-World Consequences 



<p>[00:06:19] Consider these examples:</p>



 
 An AI coding assistant that wiped out a startup’s production database. 



 AI-powered recruiting software that rejected qualified applicants based on age and gender, resulting in lawsuits. 
 



<p>[00:06:47] These tools are fast and powerful—but oversight around identity and accountability has not caught up.</p>



 



 Why Identity Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:06:59] Infrastructure is more than usernames and passwords. When humans act, we leave audit trails.</p>



<p>[00:07:15] But when AI agents act at machine speed, we need more durable systems:</p>



 
 Identity recognition for both human and non-human actors 



 Delegation models clarifying who can do what for whom 



 Provenance signals to confirm authorization 



 Verifiability to prove what happened 
 



<p>[00:07:42] Without this infrastructure, agentic AI becomes a black box—and that’s a nonstarter for security teams, DevOps leads, and auditors.</p>



 



 Open Standards, Not DIY 



<p>[00:09:34] You may be tempted to build your own delegation models and trust chains.</p>



<p>[00:09:42] Please don’t.</p>



<p>Doing so leads to:</p>



 
 Fragile integrations 



 Misaligned assumptions 



 Gaps in visibility and accountability 



 Security holes you could drive a nation-state through 
 



<p>[00:09:56] That’s why open standards matter—not as a compliance checkbox, but as the only viable way to create scalable trust across companies and industries.</p>



 



 Building Roads That Last 



<p>[00:10:27] If you’re building agentic AI capabilities, you’re already laying down infrastructure. The question is:</p>



 
 Will your road support accountability? 



 Or will it collapse under unverifiable delegation? 
 



<p>[00:10:49] Ask yourself:</p>



 
 Is identity part of the design—or bolted on later? 



 Are trust relationships clearly modeled—or just assumed? 



 Will logs stand up in an audit—or are you relying on magic? 
 



<p>[00:11:03] If you want to shape the standards of the future, join standards groups, challenge assumptions in product reviews, and push for interoperability—not lock-in.</p>



<p>[00:11:21] We don’t need to wait for the bridge to collapse. We can build roads we actually want to drive on.</p>

<p>Law firms face rising global AML expectations, especially for client onboarding, source of funds checks, and beneficial ownership verification. This article explores evolving KYC and KYB rules across Canada, the UK, the U.S., Australia, and the EU – and how iComply automates compliance without compromising client confidentiality.</p>
 
 For legal professionals, client trust is everything. But across key jurisdictions, law firms are being asked to do more: verify client identity, trace beneficial ownership, and flag suspicious behaviour—all while protecting solicitor-client privilege and meeting strict privacy laws. 
<p>In Canada, the U.S., UK, and beyond, anti-money laundering regulations are evolving quickly. Firms must now demonstrate that they not only follow procedures – but that their systems can withstand audits and adapt to new threats.</p>
 
 AML Obligations for Law Firms by Jurisdiction 
 Canada 
 
 Regulators: Law societies, FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Client Identification Procedures (CIP), ongoing monitoring, beneficial ownership checks, privacy compliance (PIPEDA) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: SRA (Solicitors Regulation Authority) 
 Requirements: AML risk assessment, KYC for clients, source of funds/source of wealth checks, SARs, and recordkeeping under MLR 2017 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: ABA model rules, BOI reporting (Corporate Transparency Act) 
 Expectations: Evolving best practices for law firm AML controls, especially in real estate and corporate formation 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: Legal Services Commissions, AUSTRAC guidance 
 Requirements: Identification and verification for clients in regulated transactions; alignment with AML/CTF Act for high-risk sectors 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National bar associations, 6AMLD 
 Requirements: Client due diligence, UBO transparency, suspicious transaction reporting, GDPR compliance 
 
 
 Common Challenges in Legal Compliance 
<p>1. Confidentiality vs. Transparency<br>
Law firms must balance their duty to clients with the obligation to detect and report suspicious activity.</p>
<p>2. Manual and Fragmented Workflows<br>
Paper forms, email, and disconnected tools result in audit gaps and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>3. Complex Entity Structures<br>
Client organizations often involve trusts, layers of ownership, or offshore nominees.</p>
<p>4. Jurisdictional Conflicts<br>
Global clients mean law firms must harmonize privacy, AML, and risk obligations across borders.</p>
 
 iComply: Legal-Grade KYC and AML for Modern Firms 
<p>iComply offers a configurable platform designed to help law firms automate AML compliance while preserving client confidentiality.</p>
 1. Secure Client Onboarding (KYC/KYB) 
 
 Edge-based identity and document verification 
 No raw PII leaves the client device unencrypted 
 Supports Canadian, U.S., UK, EU, and Australian standards 
 
 2. Beneficial Ownership Mapping 
 
 Automatically uncover UBOs across jurisdictions 
 Flag nominee structures and offshore shell patterns 
 Enable configurable thresholds for review and escalation 
 
 3. Risk-Based Screening and Case Management 
 
 Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media checks 
 Centralized dashboard for audits, escalations, and decision documentation 
 Secure retention policies to meet legal recordkeeping duties 
 
 4. Privacy and Privilege Safeguards 
 
 Local hosting or on-prem options for law firm control 
 Full audit logs without exposing client communications 
 Compliance with GDPR, PIPEDA, and solicitor-client privilege standards 
 
 
 Case Insight: Canadian Corporate Law Firm 
<p>A Toronto-based firm specializing in incorporations and M&amp;A deals implemented iComply to digitize its CIP and UBO review processes. Results:</p>
 
 Reduced due diligence time by 70% 
 Flagged two nominee structures with high-risk SOEs in a single case 
 Expanded ability to engage directors, officers, and key stakeholders anywhere in the world 
 
 
 Final Word 
<p>Legal compliance is evolving fast. Law firms that modernize with purpose-built, privacy-first tools can stay ahead of audits, reduce admin burden, and build deeper client trust.</p>
<p>Schedule a walkthrough with iComply to see how we help law firms automate AML obligations – without sacrificing discretion or control.</p>

 Ontology’s DIDs as a Solution for Global Financial Security <p>The recent <a href="https://ont.io/news/revolut-s-fraud-dilemma-why-decentralized-identity-is-the-real-answer/">massive leaks of banking data</a> have highlighted the vulnerability of centralized financial systems and the urgent need to rethink the security of personal information. In an increasingly digital world, where cyberattacks are commonplace, users’ trust in financial institutions has been shaken. In the face of this crisis of confidence, Decentralized Identities (DIDs), offered by platforms like <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a>, are emerging as a promising solution to strengthen global financial security. This article will explore how <a href="http://ont.id">Ontology’s DIDs</a>, by returning control of data to users, can transform the financial security landscape and prevent future scandals.</p> The Achilles Heel of Centralized Systems: Banking Data&nbsp;Leaks <p>Traditional banking systems rely on a centralized model where clients’ personal and financial information is stored in vast databases managed by institutions. Although these systems are protected by sophisticated security measures, they remain prime targets for cybercriminals. Each year, millions if not billions of customer records are compromised in data breaches, leading to significant financial losses, identity theft, and the erosion of public&nbsp;trust.</p><p>These incidents underline a fundamental weakness: the concentration of data creates a single point of failure. Once an attacker breaches an institution’s defenses, they potentially gain access to a goldmine of sensitive information. Moreover, the fact that data is managed by third parties means users have little to no control over how their information is stored, used, or shared. This lack of sovereignty over data is at the heart of today’s security&nbsp;issues.</p> ONT ID: Ontology’s Decentralized Identity&nbsp;Solution <p>Ontology offers a radically different approach to identity and data management through its decentralized identity framework, ONT ID. Based on W3C recommendations for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), ONT ID enables individuals and organizations to create and control their own digital identities. Unlike centralized systems, where data is held by third parties, ONT ID restores data sovereignty to the&nbsp;user.</p><p>With ONT ID, users can generate unique, self-sovereign identifiers that are not tied to any central entity. They can then collect verifiable credentials (e.g., diplomas, driver’s licenses, proof of residence) from trusted issuers and store them securely in their digital wallet. The crucial aspect is that the user decides when and with whom to share this information, and only the necessary data. For instance, to prove their age, a user would not need to reveal their exact date of birth, but only a verifiable proof that they are over 18. This approach minimizes the exposure of sensitive data and drastically reduces the attack surface for cybercriminals.</p> How DIDs Improve Global Financial Security <p>The integration of DIDs, and specifically ONT ID, into the financial sector provides several key advantages for security:</p>  Reduced risk of massive data leaks: By decentralizing the storage of identity data and allowing users to control their information, DIDs eliminate the single point of failure represented by centralized databases. Even if a system is compromised, attackers would only access pseudonymous identifiers rather than full personal&nbsp;data.  Stronger, passwordless authentication: DIDs enable more robust authentication methods than traditional passwords, which are frequent targets of hacking. DID-based authentication can leverage cryptographic keys, making phishing and identity theft attempts far more difficult.  Improved regulatory compliance with privacy protection: DIDs allow for more effective and privacy-preserving KYC/AML compliance. Financial institutions can verify necessary credentials without storing full copies of clients’ documents. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), often associated with DIDs, enable proving possession of an attribute (e.g., being of legal age) without disclosing the attribute itself.  Fraud and identity theft prevention: By ensuring the authenticity of digital identities and making it harder to create fake ones, DIDs can significantly reduce financial fraud and identity theft. Each transaction or interaction can be tied to a verifiable identity, without revealing the real identity to all&nbsp;parties.  Enhanced auditability and traceability: DID-related transactions are recorded on a blockchain, providing an immutable and transparent audit trail. This facilitates the detection of suspicious activities and the tracing of funds in case of fraud, while protecting legitimate users’ privacy through pseudonymization.   Challenges and Future&nbsp;Outlook <p>Despite their revolutionary potential, widespread adoption of DIDs in the financial sector is not without challenges. Interoperability between different DID implementations, raising awareness and educating both users and institutions, and achieving global regulatory harmonization are all crucial steps. Governments and regulators will need to collaborate with decentralized technology developers to create frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.</p><p>Ontology, with its commitment to W3C standards and its growing ecosystem, is well-positioned to play a leading role in this transition. By continuing to develop user-friendly tools and forging strategic partnerships, Ontology can help bridge the gap between blockchain technology and the needs of the traditional financial sector paving the way for a future where banking data security is inherently tied to digital identity sovereignty.</p> Conclusion <p>Banking data leak scandals are a stark reminder of the fragility of centralized systems and the urgent need to adopt more resilient solutions. Decentralized Identities (DIDs), and especially Ontology’s ONT ID, offer a promising path to redefining financial security. By empowering individuals to regain control of their data, strengthening authentication, enabling privacy-preserving compliance, and reducing fraud, DIDs can radically transform how we interact with our finances.</p><p>The future of global financial security no longer lies in reinforcing centralized fortresses but in distributing the power and responsibility of digital identity to the users themselves. Ontology is at the forefront of this revolution, providing the necessary tools to build a safer, fairer, and more resilient financial ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/after-the-banking-data-leak-scandal-67ee6bca3fcb">After the Banking Data Leak Scandal</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 $300m&nbsp;of hedge funds go on-chain for always-on services 
<p>In less than a month after the launch, SkyBridge Capital, founded by Anthony Scaramucci, a believer of bitcoin and former White House Communications Director, is moving $300m of its flagship hedge funds on-chain through Apex Digital 3.0.</p>
<p>Hedge funds are now open to invest in cryptocurrencies. These assets are designed to settle instantly, without friction. However, investors in those funds face the opposite reality as they are distributed on traditional rails.</p>
<p>It causes slow subscription, redemptions, and transfers due to fragmented settlements, as a transfer often has to pass through multiple layers of middlemen. It results in high transactional costs and delays, which in turn limit liquidity.</p>
<p>That’s why SkyBridge is moving on-chain to eliminate fragmentation and deliver real-time services. By tokenising its hedge funds, subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers can run 24/7 with full transparency. The result is lower costs, faster operations, and an investor experience that finally matches the always-on expectations of today’s markets.</p>
 Tokenisation market&nbsp;challenges 
<p>For years, tokenisation struggled to take off. Most early projects weren’t true tokenisation but digitalisation experiments. The problem wasn’t legal, but operational.</p>
<p>The key actors, including transfer agents, custodians, and asset managers, simply weren’t ready. They could put the asset on-chain, but struggled to manage subscriptions, redemptions, and custody on-chain. As a result, many institutional projects ended up with assets merely represented on the blockchain, while the servicing processes remained off-chain.</p>
<p>The market has been maturing, service providers have built the capabilities, custodians can hold tokenised assets, more people are equipped and accepting self-custody wallets, and regulators have set clearer frameworks. But integration remains critical and without it tokenisation risks becoming another silo.</p>
 On-chain finance adoption accelerates for real 
<p>That’s why we built Apex Digital 3.0. For too long, firms were promised “end-to-end” tokenisation, only to discover critical gaps. No legal structuring, no compliance support, no custody of the underlying assets, and no real distribution. The result was complexity, with issuers forced to juggle multiple providers and still falling short of scale.</p>
<p>Apex Digital 3.0 changes that. It brings everything together: legal setup, compliance advisory, issuance, custody, servicing, and cross-platform distribution in one infrastructure. Clients who want a complete 0-to-1 solution rely on us without the headache of managing separate partners. And, for those who already have preferred tools, our open architecture makes integration seamless.</p>
<p>With 22 years of proven trust and $3.5 trillion of assets under administration, Apex Group is the trusted bridge to on-chain finance, giving institutions the confidence to move massively.</p>
<p>SkyBridge’s $300m project is a live example, with more in the pipeline. This time, institutional adoption at scale is real.</p>

<p>As markets oscillate between euphoria and despair, investors are left asking the timeless question: What do I own, and what do I trade? Yet in today’s world of TradingView charts, Twitter threads, Telegram calls, Medium deep-dives, and endless newsletters, the real challenge is not just deciding between BTC, ETH, or the next altcoin. It is cutting through the noise. Everyone has an opinion, and consuming them all takes enormous energy. Finding a strategy that actually fits your needs is harder than&nbsp;ever.</p><p>And even if you manage to find the right answer, that is only half the battle. Implementing it in your portfolio means identifying the best yield models, deciding between staking and re-staking, and continually rebalancing across different chains and platforms. For most, this becomes a full-time job.</p><p>That reality is about to change. DeFAI (Decentralized Finance + AI) is poised to unlock possibilities that many investors were previously unaware of. Intelligent systems can filter the noise, craft strategies tailored to your goals, and execute them automatically across chains. Instead of waking up at 3 AM to react to volatility, DeFAI agents will monitor, rebalance, and compound for you while you&nbsp;sleep.</p> ArenAI: The Investor’s Edge <p>For investors, ArenAI offers a straightforward way to access sophisticated strategies without requiring coding or tracking every market tick. You can browse models created by experts, select those that fit your goals, and let them work on your behalf in real time. Whether you want a conservative ETH staking strategy, an aggressive momentum trader, or a balanced multi-chain allocator, ArenAI lets you plug into ready-made intelligence that adapts as conditions change.</p> From Consumer to&nbsp;Creator <p>But ArenAI does not stop at consumption. If you have an investment thesis or a trading style that works, you can turn it into a model and offer it to others on a subscription basis. Your trading perspective becomes more than just a personal experiment. It becomes a product that others can use and pay for, creating an entirely new revenue stream. Instead of being lost in a sea of opinions, you can build, implement, and monetize your own&nbsp;edge.</p> Ready to cut through the noise and find your edge?

<p>Tracking attendance has evolved significantly from the old methods of paper registers and punch cards. Today, organizations are increasingly adopting facial recognition attendance systems to streamline tracking, improve security, and save time. These systems combine advanced face detection attendance system technology with AI to ensure accurate and hassle-free employee management.</p>
<p>With workplaces getting more tech-driven, integrating an AI attendance system not only improves efficiency but also reduces human errors associated with traditional attendance methods. This technology ensures that attendance is accurate, instantaneous, and tamper-proof, offering a significant upgrade over legacy systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is a Facial Recognition System for Attendance 
<p>A facial recognition system for attendance uses biometric technology to identify individuals based on their unique facial features. Unlike cards or fingerprint scanners, face recognition offers touch-free verification, making it quicker and more sanitary.</p>
<p>These systems capture the user’s face using cameras and match it against a stored database. The system analyzes unique facial features, such as eye spacing, nose structure, and jaw contours, to confirm a person’s identity. Modern AI-powered systems even adapt to changes in lighting, angle, and facial accessories like glasses or masks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Features of a Facial Recognition System for Attendance 
 
 Contactless Verification: Reduces physical touchpoints, improving hygiene.
<p></p> 
 High Accuracy: Advanced algorithms minimize false positives and negatives.
<p></p> 
 Real-Time Tracking: Attendance logs update instantly.
<p></p> 
 Integration with Payroll: Automatically syncs attendance data with payroll systems.
<p></p> 
 Multi-Device Support: Works on cameras, smartphones, and tablets.
<p></p> 
 
<p>A study by <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/face-recognition-vendor-test-frvt">NIST FRVT</a> highlights the high accuracy rates of modern facial recognition algorithms, proving their reliability in real-world applications. For detailed technical insights, you can check their<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> Face Recognition Technology Evaluation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Using a Face Detection Attendance System 
<p>Switching to a face detection attendance system offers several benefits for organizations, large or small:</p>
 
 Time Efficiency: Employees no longer wait in lines to clock in. Attendance is recorded within seconds.
<p></p> 
 Reduced Buddy Punching: Eliminates the risk of proxy attendance since the system identifies each individual uniquely.
<p></p> 
 Enhanced Security: Only authorized personnel can gain access to the premises.
<p></p> 
 Data Analytics: Offers detailed insights into attendance trends, overtime, and staff punctuality.
<p></p> 
 Cost Savings: Cuts down administrative work and prevents errors in manual attendance management. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 AI-Based Face Recognition Attendance System in Modern Workplaces 
<p>The rise of AI has transformed traditional face recognition systems into AI-based face recognition attendance systems. These solutions not only identify faces but also analyze patterns, detect anomalies, and prevent fraud.</p>
<p>For instance, AI algorithms can detect if someone is trying to spoof the system using a photo or video. This adds an extra layer of security that older systems lacked. Additionally, AI models continuously learn from new data, improving their accuracy over time.</p>
<p>Companies implementing AI attendance systems have reported up to 30% reduction in payroll errors and significant improvements in attendance management efficiency.</p>

<p>Playing doodle football is a fantastic way to pass the time with a simple and fun browser game. With its charming style and straightforward gameplay, it’s no wonder that countless versions have popped up online since the original became a viral sensation. If you’re looking for the best places to play, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve compiled a list of the top doodle football games you can start playing right now, all from the convenience of your browser.</p>



 What Are Doodle Football Games? 



<p>Doodle football games are a popular genre of browser-based soccer games, often recognized for their charming, cartoon-style graphics and simple mechanics that are easy for anyone to pick up and play. Inspired by the viral success of Google’s own <a href="https://doodlecricket.github.io/doodle-football">interactive doodles</a>, their main appeal lies in their incredible accessibility. Because they require no downloads or installations, these games are perfect for casual gamers looking for a quick, fun session with simple controls on any device.</p>









 Top 5 Doodle Football Games to Play Now 



<p>Google Doodle Soccer 2012 (sites.google.com)</p>



<p>The Google Doodle Soccer 2012 is a classic example, originally released for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. This simple yet addictive game, often found on <code>sites.google.com</code> and other archives, challenges players to control a team of stick-figure characters. The controls are incredibly straightforward: players use simple mouse clicks to move their team and score goals, making it a perfect, nostalgic browser game for a quick session.</p>









<p>Doodle Soccer (doodlecricket.github.io)</p>



<p>Found at <code>doodlecricket.github.io</code>, this version of doodle football offers a unique twist on the classic game: you play as a goalkeeper. With charming hand-drawn graphics, the game’s objective is to block incoming shots from the AI using only your arrow keys. This simple but engaging challenge makes for a fun, quick-play experience that focuses on reflexes and defense rather than offense, perfect for a short break.</p>









<p>Doodle Football (arcadespot.com)</p>



<p>The appeal of Doodle Football comes from its mix of strategy and creativity. Instead of traditional football gameplay, you use your imagination to outsmart tricky level designs and keep the ball rolling toward victory.

Its unique drawing-based gameplay makes it stand out among online arcade and puzzle games.</p>

Designed as a two-player game, it challenges you and a friend to a chaotic physics-based match.

 How to Play Doodle Football Games Safely 



 Avoid Unverified Websites 



<p>The first rule of thumb is to avoid unverified gaming sites. Many unofficial versions of <a href="https://blog.herond.org/best-football-streaming-sites/">doodle football are hosted on websites</a> that harbor malware and intrusive pop-up ads. Sticking to well-known or trusted platforms is the easiest way to keep your personal information and device secure.</p>



 Use a Secure Browser 



<p>To truly protect yourself, use a browser with built-in security features. Herond Browser is designed to keep you safe with its powerful ad-blocker and anti-phishing features. This is especially important on sites like <code>doodlecricket.github.io</code> or <code>arcadespot.com</code> where you can play doodle football without worrying about security risks.</p>









 Trust the Community 



<p>If you’re looking for new or unblocked versions of the game, check community reviews on platforms like X. Players often share links to safe and trusted versions of doodle football and quickly flag any malicious content or scams. It’s a great way to find the game you want while minimizing risk.</p>



 Tips and Tricks for Mastering Doodle Football Games 



 Master Your Timing 



<p>Success in doodle football hinges on perfect timing. In games like the classic Google Doodle Soccer 2012, learning when to take a precise shot or make a well-timed save is crucial. Instead of just pressing a button, focus on the moment the ball is in the perfect position to ensure your moves are accurate.</p>



 Use Simple Controls Effectively 



<p>Don’t let simple controls fool you; they can be used to outsmart any opponent. In doodle football, mastering the basics, like using your arrow keys and the spacebar effectively, can give you a huge advantage. Practice quick, strategic movements to fake out opponents, whether you’re facing a challenging AI or a friend.</p>







 Plan Your Path in Puzzle Games 



<p>If you’re playing a puzzle-based version of doodle football, your strategy should shift from reflexes to planning. These games often require you to draw a path or use the environment to guide the ball to the goal. Take a moment to analyze the obstacles and plan a precise route to ensure a successful shot.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>So there you have it – a guide to some of the best doodle football games available right now. Each game offers its own unique twist on the simple, fun genre, whether you prefer classic arcade action, physics-based chaos, or multiplayer competition. No matter your style, these browser-based gems are the perfect way to enjoy a quick, fun game without any downloads. All you have to do is pick your favorite, and start playing!</p>

  Insurers face growing global AML scrutiny. This guide shows how to simplify compliance, monitor brokers, and meet multi-jurisdictional requirements using iComply.

<p>Insurance firms face increasing AML scrutiny across jurisdictions—from onboarding to broker due diligence. This article explores key KYB, KYC, and AML obligations in Australia, Canada, the U.S., UK, and Singapore—and how iComply simplifies compliance workflows with edge-secure automation.</p>
 
 Insurers are no longer flying under the AML radar. Regulatory bodies from AUSTRAC to the FCA are sharpening expectations for identity verification, beneficial ownership checks, transaction monitoring, and third-party oversight—particularly for insurers operating across regions or managing delegated broker networks. 
<p>In this increasingly complex environment, manual compliance approaches can’t scale. The solution? Intelligent, flexible, and automated AML tools tailored to insurance workflows.</p>
 
 Global AML Standards for Insurers 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF program, CDD/EDD on policyholders and beneficiaries, broker monitoring, and suspicious matter reporting 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC + OSFI 
 Requirements: Identification of policyholders, UBO checks for corporate accounts, source of funds verification, and transaction monitoring 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: State DOIs, FinCEN, NAIC guidance 
 Requirements: Customer identification programs (CIP), sanctions/PEP screening, and STRs for high-value or suspicious policies 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: CDD for life insurance clients, ongoing monitoring of brokers, sanctions screening, and AML risk assessments under MLR 2017 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: AML/CFT policyholder and intermediary due diligence, transaction reviews, and suspicious transaction reporting (STR) 
 
 
 Unique Insurance-Specific Risks 
<p>1. Broker and MGA Delegation<br>
Insurers rely on brokers and MGAs to onboard and service clients—creating compliance gaps without centralized oversight.</p>
<p>2. Long-Term Policies and Beneficiaries<br>
Life insurance, annuities, and trusts require deeper due diligence due to multiple parties and beneficiary changes over time.</p>
<p>3. Geographic Expansion<br>
Insurers expanding across jurisdictions must manage overlapping and conflicting compliance frameworks.</p>
<p>4. High-Value Transactions<br>
Single-premium life insurance or corporate policies may attract financial crime risk, especially when funded through offshore accounts or third parties.</p>
 
 How iComply Helps Insurance Firms Stay Ahead 
<p>iComply provides modular tools designed for real-world insurance compliance—covering policyholder, broker, and partner workflows with full auditability.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB for Policyholders and Brokers 
 
 Onboard individuals and legal entities via branded portals 
 Edge-based identity checks support secure document and biometric verification 
 Automate UBO discovery and documentation 
 
 2. AML Monitoring + Screening 
 
 Screen policyholders, brokers, and payees against sanctions, PEP, and adverse media 
 Monitor payments and claim patterns using configurable risk models 
 Trigger alerts based on policy type, geography, or source of funds 
 
 3. Broker Oversight Tools 
 
 Centralized broker verification and periodic review cycles 
 Assign compliance ownership and flag issues within shared dashboards 
 
 4. Privacy-First Architecture 
 
 Deploy on-prem or in region to support data residency needs 
 Encrypt personal data before transit; manage user consent 
 
 5. Audit-Ready Case Management 
 
 Maintain logs of onboarding decisions, escalations, and communications 
 Generate compliance reports for internal audits or regulator reviews 
 
 
 Case Insight: Commercial Insurer in Australia 
<p>A national property and casualty insurer used iComply to centralize onboarding and screening for commercial policyholders and their brokers. Key results:</p>
 
 50% reduction in business client onboarding time 
 Improved detection of shell companies and nominee directors 
 Passed AUSTRAC inspection with full audit traceability and no findings 
 
 
 Final Take 
<p>Insurers that rely on outdated compliance processes are exposed—not just to enforcement, but to inefficiencies and missed risk signals.</p>
<p>Connect with iComply to learn how our platform helps insurance providers simplify AML tasks, reduce broker risk, and stay compliant—across borders and business lines.</p>

<p>The Central Bank of the UAE has drawn a line in the sand. <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/uae-central-bank-tells-fis-to-drop-sms-otp-authentication-a-28589">By March 2026, the era of the SMS and One-Time Passwords will be over for the nation's financial institutions.</a></p> 
<p>This is not a minor policy tweak. It's a seismic shift.</p> 
<p>For years, the SMS/OTP has been the default security blanket for digital banking. A familiar, but flawed, solution. But the CBUAE's directive acknowledges a harsh reality: in the face of sophisticated phishing, SIM-swapping, and social engineering attacks, this legacy method has become a critical liability. It creates unacceptable financial and reputational risk.</p> 
<p>For the C-suite in the UAE's banking sector, it's easy to view this as another compliance burden. Another costly, complex project to manage. But that’s a limited view. The leaders who will win the next decade of digital banking will see this mandate for what it truly is: a strategic inflection point. This is your opportunity to leapfrog the competition by building a digital experience that is not only radically more secure, but also profoundly simpler for your customers.</p>  
 Phishing-Resistant Passkeys: The Secure Alternative to SMS OTP  
<p>The CBUAE recommends a move toward robust, risk-based authentication. The golden standard that unequivocally answers this call is passkeys.</p> 
<p>Passkeys are not just an incremental improvement. They represent a fundamental change in authentication technology, offering a rare combination of superior security and a user experience that is genuinely effortless. Built on FIDO standards, passkeys replace passwords and OTPs entirely. They use the biometrics already built into your customers' devices, like Face ID or a fingerprint, to create a login experience that is fast, familiar, and frictionless.</p> 
<p>So, why are passkeys the definitive solution to the CBUAE mandate?</p> 
  
  They are Inherently Phishing-Resistant. A passkey is cryptographically bound to your bank's specific website or app. There is no password to steal, no code to intercept. The primary attack vector for financial fraud is neutralized at its source, directly protecting your customers and your firm’s bottom line.  
  They Create a World-Class Customer Experience. No more waiting for delayed SMS messages. No more frustrated calls to the help desk. A frictionless, biometric login increases digital channel adoption, boosts customer satisfaction, and builds loyalty in a fiercely competitive market.  
  They Lower Your Operational Costs. The business case is undeniable. You can immediately eradicate the significant and rising costs of SMS delivery. More importantly, passwordless authentication slashes password-related help desk inquiries, lowering your total cost of ownership (TCO) and freeing up valuable IT resources to focus on innovation, not resets.  
  
 From Onboarding to Transactions: A CIAM Approach to Customer Identity  
<p>True digital leadership isn't just about a secure login. It’s about securing the entire customer relationship. This is where HYPR’s Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) solution extends the power of passkeys across the entire user journey.</p> 
<p>Our unified framework allows you to:</p> 
  
  Onboard Customers with Trust: Securely register new customers and establish confidence from the very first interaction, accelerating their transition into high-value digital clients.  
  Deliver Effortless Authentication: Provide a consistent, best-in-class login experience across all your digital properties, reinforcing your brand’s commitment to innovation and security.  
  Protect High-Value Transactions: Implement seamless, biometric step-up authentication for sensitive actions, preventing fraud without adding frustrating friction for your legitimate customers.  
  
 The HYPR Advantage: Proven Results and Accelerated Time-to-Market  
<p>Navigating this transition requires more than just new technology; it requires a proven, globally-deployed partner.</p> 
<p>HYPR is not a startup testing a new theory. We are the trusted identity partner to the world's most demanding financial institutions, including two of the four largest US banks. Our FIDO-certified solutions are architected for the scale, reliability, and security your institution demands. And with our flexible SDKs and APIs, we enable rapid integration with your existing infrastructure, ensuring you lead the market in this transition, not follow it.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>The CBUAE’s SMS OTP ban is far more than a compliance requirement — it’s a turning point for the UAE’s financial sector. Institutions that treat it as a checkbox exercise will fall behind, while those that embrace phishing-resistant passkeys will gain a lasting competitive edge.<br><br>Now is the time to act. With the March 2026 deadline fast approaching, early movers will be the ones to set the standard for secure, passwordless digital banking in the region.<br></p>

<p>Hiring fraud is in the news. Google recently announced it’s <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/topstories/google-brings-back-in-person-job-interviews-as-ceo-sundar-pichai-cracks-down-on-ai-cheating/ar-AA1LdLeV">bringing back in-person job interviews</a>, citing concerns about AI cheating during technical assessments. But there’s a bigger issue lurking beneath the surface: how do companies verify that the identity of the person who applied, interviewed remotely, and got hired is actually the same and is who they claim to be?</p>
<p>This identity verification challenge has created an opening that sophisticated fraud networks and state-sponsored actors are actively exploiting. The US government <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-coordinated-nationwide-actions-combat-north-korean-remote">has recognized the serious issue</a> of North Korean operatives successfully impersonating American tech workers, securing remote positions and gaining access to sensitive corporate systems.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/03/top-scams-2024">Federal Trade Commission</a>, financial losses from job and employment scams have exploded from $90 million in 2020 to more than $501 million in 2024, a staggering 456% increase that signals the emergence of hiring fraud as a major profit center for organized criminal networks.</p>
<p>These financial losses, while significant, represent only the measurable impact. The broader concern is operational disruption, intellectual property theft, and potential access to sensitive systems that could compromise business operations or customer data.</p>
 How Modern Hiring Fraud Works 
<p>Today’s hiring fraud has evolved beyond simple resume padding. We’re witnessing the emergence of “synthetic identities,” completely fabricated personas backed by AI-generated credentials, deepfake technology, and sophisticated social engineering.</p>
 AI-Powered Identity Fabrication 
<p>Modern fraud networks deploy AI tools that can generate convincing resumes and cover letters in minutes. More concerning, they’re using deepfake technology to mask fraudsters’ appearances and voices during video interviews, creating personas that can pass human scrutiny while bypassing traditional verification methods.</p>
<p>These aren’t isolated incidents. According to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat">Google’s Mandiant threat intelligence team</a>, one American facilitator working with North Korean IT workers “compromised more than 60 identities of U.S. persons, impacted more than 300 U.S. companies, and resulted in at least $6.8 million of revenue” over just three years. The report notes it’s “not uncommon for a DPRK IT worker to be working multiple jobs at once, pulling in multiple salaries on a monthly basis.”</p>
 The Challenges with Current Hiring Processes 
<p>The very technologies designed to streamline hiring (automated applicant screening, virtual interviews, and rapid onboarding) have become tools that sophisticated adversaries exploit at unprecedented scale.</p>
<p>The traditional hiring trust model, built on static documents, phone interviews, and the assumption that remote workers are who they claim to be, has proven insufficient in an era of AI-enabled deception.</p>
 Moving Beyond Point Solutions: The Identity Assurance Approach 
<p>Most cybersecurity vendors are approaching hiring fraud with the same mindset they apply to email phishing or malware detection as a point-in-time problem requiring better filters. But hiring fraud isn’t just a detection problem; it’s an identity assurance challenge.</p>
<p>Current solutions fall into two categories: applicant filters that optimize recruitment by culling suspicious applications, and breach prevention tools that try to catch infiltrators before they access sensitive systems. Both approaches treat symptoms while ignoring the root cause: the absence of a verifiable, persistent digital identity foundation.</p>
 How 1Kosmos Addresses Identity Assurance 
<p>1Kosmos has developed a different approach to this challenge, one that establishes verified identity proofing at the very first interaction and maintains that assurance throughout the entire employee lifecycle.</p>
<p>Our platform’s LiveID technology performs real-time liveness detection while cross-referencing live biometrics with verified government-issued credentials from issuing authorities. This creates a triangulation of identity claims that is exponentially more difficult for synthetic identities or deepfakes to spoof than traditional document-plus-selfie verification methods.</p>
 Continuous Identity Assurance Beyond Hiring 
<p>The value of true identity assurance extends beyond initial hiring decisions. Once an employee’s digital identity is established through the 1Kosmos platform, it becomes the foundation for every subsequent authentication, access request, and sensitive transaction throughout their tenure.</p>
<p>While point solutions focus exclusively on the hiring moment, 1Kosmos provides continuous identity-backed security. This addresses an important gap in most security strategies: the reality that threats don’t end once someone is hired. Account takeovers, insider threats, and credential compromise can still occur unless there’s a persistent, biometrically-backed identity foundation preventing them.</p>
 Building the Identity Foundation for Modern Workforce Security 
<p>The hiring fraud challenge represents more than a cybersecurity issue. It’s a trust challenge that requires organizations to rethink how they establish and maintain confidence in their workforce’s identity.</p>
<p>Companies can no longer afford to treat identity as a point-in-time checkbox in their security strategy. In an environment where sophisticated adversaries can manufacture convincing digital personas and nation-state actors are actively infiltrating American businesses through fraudulent hiring, identity assurance must become the foundational layer upon which all other security measures are built.</p>
<p>1Kosmos addresses hiring fraud by:</p>
 
 Establishing Trust on First Use: Securely onboarding new hires with high-assurance, government-verified identity proofing 
 Maintaining Trust Continuously: Providing continuous monitoring and persistent identity assurance for every login, access request, and sensitive operation 
 Empowering User Control: Making employees partners in their own security by giving them control over their identity data 
 Future-Proofing the Enterprise: Creating a zero-trust foundation that protects against the full spectrum of identity-based threats 
 
 Looking Forward: Evolution in Identity Security 
<p>As AI-powered deception capabilities continue to advance and organized fraud networks become increasingly sophisticated, companies face an important choice: evolve their identity assurance strategies or remain vulnerable to an escalating threat.</p>
<p>The companies that recognize identity as the new security perimeter and invest in platforms that provide verified identity assurance rather than point-in-time fraud detection will gain a significant advantage in both security and talent acquisition.<br>
The question isn’t whether your organization will encounter hiring fraud. The question is whether you’ll detect it before it impacts your business, or better yet, prevent it entirely by building your workforce on a foundation of verified, persistent digital identity.</p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently released a new white paper, <a href="https://go.updates.iata.org/unlocking-the-future">Unlocking the Future – The Passenger’s Journey Toward a Seamless and Contactless Experience</a> which highlights the pressing challenges facing aviation: growing passenger volumes, repeated identity checks, and the burden of manual document verification at every stage of the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From baggage drop to security,&nbsp; lounge access to boarding, and crossing international borders, travelers are asked to present documents again and again. This creates bottlenecks, frustrates passengers, consumes staff resources, and creates long queues that overwhelm airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>With air travel numbers growing each year and expected to reach eight billion by 2041, IATA argues that it is imperative to shift identity and admissibility checks as quickly as possible into a seamless, contactless system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what Indicio’s decentralized identity technology makes possible.</p>
<p>Indicio was the first to successfully develop and deploy Digital Passport Credentials following the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) specification&nbsp; for Digital Travel Credentials (DTC) to allow travelers to cross borders in seconds.</p>
<p>Indicio was also the first to implement IATA’s OneID for seamless check in, lounge access, and boarding —&nbsp;and show how it could be combined with a Digital Passport Credential for international travel in a simple, single workflow for a traveler.</p>
<p>And Indicio will be the first to deploy a Digital Passport Credential issued by governments by the end of the year — and will use its expertise to help develop these credentials for issuance by European governments as part of the APTITUDE Large Scale Pilot project.</p>
 Streamline the traveler experience with reusable digital identity 
<p>Airlines, airports, and border agencies all need to confirm passenger identity. This means repeating the same check multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven® turns these manual checks into automated, seamless experiences&nbsp; by creating “government-grade” digital identities that combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are tamper-proof digital credentials held in a digital wallet on a mobile device. They can be cryptographically verified — which is instantaneous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Digital Passport Credentials, travelers&nbsp; scan the electronic chips in their passports. Indicio’s software ingests the data and then checks the electronic image of the person against a liveness check to make sure that the person doing the scan is the same as the person the passport belongs to. The passport data is then cryptographically verified to make sure it was issued by a legitimate passport office, upon which the traveler receives a Digital Passport Credential. This credential follows the ICAO specifications for a DTC-1.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Digital Passport Credential is issued directly by the passport office as a counterpart to a traveler’s physical passport. This credential follows the ICAO specifications for DTC-2.</p>
<p>The result is that travelers have digital identities that can be seamlessly authenticated, either through a face scan or a contactless corridor.</p>
<p>In effect, the traveler’s face becomes their boarding pass. Airlines, airports, and border authorities can trust that the person cleared at the start is the same person moving through each step, without requiring the passenger to repeatedly present paper documents or plastic cards.</p>
 Meeting immigration and transit requirements 
<p>IATA’s white paper also notes the strain on airlines from needing to confirm that every international traveler has been approved for entry. Manual checks slow down processing and errors can lead to costly delays and fines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio solves this by making it possible to verify a passenger’s immigration status before they even arrive at the airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Credentials that prove visa status or travel authorization can be issued and shared as Verifiable Credentials, and instantly authenticated by the airline and immigration control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Airlines now have a secure way to stop inadmissible travelers from boarding and ensure smooth operations for carriers.</p>
 Why Indicio is the right partner 
<p>IATA’s call for an interoperable, end-to-end solution that transforms the passenger journey isn’t something in the distant future, it’s here today at Indicio with technology already in use by airports and governments worldwide.</p>
<p>Our technology gives travelers a consistent, reliable experience anywhere, while providing authorities and airlines the assurance they need everywhere.</p>
<p>The future of aviation depends on removing bottlenecks and maintaining security. Indicio Proven® makes that future possible today.</p>

<p>For many insurers, identity insurance is still framed as a safety net. It’s only there if something goes wrong. For customers, that means help only arrives after fraud has already caused real problems. For insurers, it means bigger payouts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This old way of doing things is expensive, and it’s quickly losing relevance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The better way: Add proactive protection to your offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What is a proactive identity protection suite?&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>A proactive identity protection suite has privacy and security tools that actively prevent fraud before it happens. These solutions work continuously, blocking threats in the background and seamlessly integrating safer tools into your customers’ daily lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key capabilities include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Credit freezes prevent criminals from opening fraudulent accounts.&nbsp; 



 Dark-web monitoring scans hacker forums for exposed data such as SSN and credit card details.&nbsp; 



 Personal data removal finds sensitive information from people-search and data broker sites.&nbsp; 



 Phishing and malware defense protect users with secure email and browser tools that block scams at the source.&nbsp; 



 Password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every account, preventing credential theft and account takeover.&nbsp; 



 Private browser blocks ads, trackers, and cookies while keeping browsing history fully encrypted, ensuring no one can follow users online.&nbsp; 



 VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts internet connections on any network, protecting data and activity from hackers, snoops, or unsafe Wi-Fi.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



 Why prevention works&nbsp; 



<p>Credit monitoring, real-time alerts, and dark-web scanning allow insurers and customers to spot threats early. Stopping fraud at the source not only saves customers from stress but also reduces costly claims for insurers. The result is greater peace of mind for policyholders and stronger retention for providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By catching suspicious activity quickly, these solutions prevent minor issues from turning into significant losses. Customers see the benefit every day, which keeps them engaged and feeling secure. And for insurers, that proactive approach means fewer claims to cover, lower costs, and stronger long-term relationships with policyholders.&nbsp;</p>



 The dual benefit of proactive insurance&nbsp; 



<p>Proactive identity protection turns a one-time claim process into a continuous service that builds trust and engagement. Better yet, this trust becomes a business advantage:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customer retention matters. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers">Improving retention by just 5%</a> can boost insurer profits by 25% to 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the insurance sector, offering seamless digital engagement and proactive protection can significantly increase customer loyalty, resulting in more renewals and upsell opportunities.&nbsp;</p>



 Prevention pays (literally)&nbsp; 



<p>For insurers, prevention benefits customers and helps the bottom line. Every fraudulent incident avoided is a claim you don’t have to pay. At scale, that translates into substantial savings. Add in the fact that subscription-based identity protection creates recurring, high-margin revenue, and the business case becomes clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A proactive model lowers overall risk exposure while generating consistent income, all while positioning your brand as a leader in trust and innovation. The end result is stronger financial performance and stronger customer relationships.&nbsp;</p>



 Protect your customers and your bottom line&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>The old way of handling identity theft, waiting until fraud happens and then covering the losses, isn’t enough anymore. Customers don’t just want reimbursement, they want protection. Proactive tools turn identity insurance into something customers use every day, not just in a crisis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The benefits flow both ways:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Customers avoid the stress and frustration of fraud before it ever impacts their lives.&nbsp; 



 Insurers cut down on claim payouts, reduce operating costs, and strengthen long-term loyalty.&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>With Anonyome Labs’ Digital Identity Protection suite, insurers can deliver these proactive tools under their own brand. It’s a simple way to move from reactive payouts to daily, trust-building protection by creating a win for both policyholders and your bottom line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

These designations also build on several other actions OFAC has taken in the last several months to stop the DPRK’s IT worker schemes, including sanctions on <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0190">July 8</a> and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0205">July 24</a>.<br><br>Andreyev is the only designated person who was associated with a crypto address in today’s action. However, OFAC also designated Kim Ung Sun, who is believed to have facilitated “multiple financial transfers worth a total of nearly $600,000, by converting cryptocurrency to cash in U.S. dollars.”&nbsp;<br><br>As noted in the press release, North Korea continues to embed IT workers in overseas companies, especially crypto and Web3 companies. These workers use curated fake identities–many of which are reused–and take advantage of the predominantly remote working culture among these companies. The workers provide legitimate services for the companies, sending their pay back to North Korea to support the regime’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. At the same time, the IT workers remain on the lookout for ways their employer could be exploited in the future, either for financial gain or to steal sensitive data.<br><br>Andreyev is said to be linked to <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1498#:~:text=DPRK%2Dbased%20Chinyong%20Information%20Technology%20Cooperation%20Company%20(Chinyong)&amp;text=The%20power%20and%20integrity%20of%20OFAC%20sanctions%20derive%20not%20only%20from%20OFAC's">Chinyong Information Technology Cooperation Company</a>, a North Korean employer of IT workers that operate in Russia and Laos. Two other companies that were sanctioned today are Shenyang Geumpungri Network Technology, “a Chinese front company for Chinyong” and Korea Sinjin Trading Corporation. OFAC assesses that “since 2021, Shenyang Geumpungri’s delegation of DPRK IT workers has earned over $1 million in profits for Chinyong and Korea Sinjin Trading Corporation”. Korea Sinjin Trading Corporation operates under the Ministry of People’s Armed Forces General Political Bureau, which was <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0099">sanctioned by OFAC</a> in June 2017.<br><br>OFAC only listed a single address associated with today’s designations. However, Elliptic has several additional addresses labelled in our dataset associated with DPRK IT workers.<br><br>Elliptic’s data shows that today’s sanctioned Bitcoin address has received over $600,000 of payments and has source exposure back to the Atomic Wallet exploit of June 2023, itself attributed to the DPRK (Lazarus Group). Other addresses along the path of funds take part in cross-chain bridging, which is very much in keeping with favoured North Korean actor obfuscation tactics.<br><br><br><br><br>How we can help</p>

How can compliance teams meet evolving expectations if they can’t assess the behavior of the wallets they’re indirectly supporting?<br><br>Elliptic is solving that challenge, and today, we are proud to introduce Issuer Due Diligence: the first fit-for-purpose solution enabling banks and other financial institutions to assess issuer wallet risk before holding stablecoin reserves.</p>

				  Don’t settle for basic when you can get portable, fraud-proof mDLs biometrically bound to the holder.<br>  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are digital credentials that replace physical, plastic driver’s licenses. You hold them on your phone and present them for instant identity authentication. Many states in the U.S. have begun issuing them, but <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/make-mobile-drivers-licenses-work-everywhere-easily-with-indicio-proven/">they don’t always make them easy to verify</a>, which inhibits adoption. The European Union has made mDL adoption a goal of its digital identity and digital wallet rollout.</p>
<p>Still, the promise is strong. What makes an mDL useful is the ability to verify it and confirm that the person presenting it is the rightful holder — and other useful information, such as their age.</p>
<p>But in an age of increasing biometric fraud, mDLs already need an upgrade —&nbsp;authenticated biometrics.</p>
<p>By authenticating the image of the person on the license as the person holding the license and then binding both to their device, an mDL becomes a much more powerful form of digital identity —&nbsp;capable of defense against biometric identity fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a>, you have the power to authenticate biometrics using facemapping and liveness checks, validate official documents and the information they contain, and bind them to their rightful owner by issuing a Verifiable Credential.</p>
<p>This is the process used to <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">create Digital Passport Credentials </a>(DTCs)—&nbsp;”government-grade” digital identities for crossing a border seamlessly — and a similar process can be used to create mDLs with <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/portable-authenticated-biometrics-101/">authenticated biometric benefits</a>.</p>
 Advanced mDL verification 
<p>With authenticated biometrics, mDLs are much more powerful. For businesses, this level of assurance opens the door to workflows that were previously too risky or too expensive to conduct remotely. Businesses and government services can confirm a person’s identity at a distance with confidence. This saves money and reduces fraud by eliminating duplicate verification steps and cutting back on time consuming and faulty manual processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, a bank can onboard a customer remotely, knowing that the individual on the other side of the screen is the same person to whom the mDL was issued. This cuts the cost of in-branch visits, prevents fraud, and accelerates account openings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A healthcare provider can verify a patient’s identity before a telemedicine appointment, reducing the risk of errors or misuse of insurance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employers can complete I-9 or age-verification processes remotely, without waiting for physical documents.</p>
<p>In travel, an mDL with authenticated biometrics can streamline every stage of domestic travel. Airlines can verify identity at booking, security, and boarding without requiring multiple checks of physical documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TSA can process travelers more efficiently, confident that the person presenting the mDL matches the credential issued to them. The result is a smoother passenger experience and stronger security at the same time.</p>
<p>Every successful mDL verification builds trust and adoption, creating an ecosystem where identity works as seamlessly as swiping a card, but with stronger security and privacy.</p>
 The bigger mDL picture 
<p>The long-term value is clear. An mDL that is biometrically bound to its holder moves across use cases and industries for faster, simpler, and more secure experiences. For the governments that have invested in issuing mDLs, adoption means their investment in mDLs is paying off.</p>

<p>As campuses gear up for another academic year, a quieter — but equally damaging — threat is draining university budgets: direct deposit fraud.</p>
<p>This isn’t ransomware that makes headlines by shutting down networks. Instead, it slips through unnoticed. Fraudsters steal credentials, log in like a legitimate user, and quietly reroute paychecks, stipends, and refunds to their own accounts. By the time faculty or students realize a payment is missing, the money is long gone.</p>
 Why Universities Are Prime Targets 
<p>Universities process millions in payments every semester:</p>
 
 Faculty and staff payroll 
 Student worker wages 
 Research and graduate stipends 
 Tuition refunds and financial aid 
 
<p>The attack surface is huge. Thousands of new students and employees join each term, many with limited cybersecurity awareness. Add in multiple disconnected systems (HR, payroll, bursar) and self-service portals that let users update bank info with little verification, and it’s a fraudster’s dream.</p>
 Anatomy of a Campus Heist 
<p>The playbook is simple:</p>
 
 Compromise credentials – via phishing or stolen logins. 
 Access payroll/portal – log in as the user. 
 Change direct deposit info – update bank details to a mule account. 
 Wait for payday – the next paycheck or refund flows to the fraudster. 
 No malware. No alarms. Just stolen wages. 
 
 The True Cost 
<p>Beyond the missing funds, universities are left scrambling:</p>
 
 Covering replacement paychecks 
 Hours of admin and IT investigation 
 Damaged credit and financial stress for victims 
 Reputational hits that erode trust with faculty and students 
 
<p>Worse, once a fraudster succeeds at one campus, the same playbook spreads quickly to others.</p>
 The Identity Gap 
<p>The weakness isn’t the technology — it’s the assumption. Most systems trust that if you know the password, you must be the rightful owner. In today’s world of credential compromise, that assumption is broken.</p>
 How to Stop It: Three Layers of Protection 
<p>Universities can close the gap by verifying more than just passwords:</p>
 
 Verify the person 
 Step-up identity checks at the moment of a bank account change — government ID scan + selfie match, or biometric re-authentication. 
 
 
 Verify the account 
 Use services like Plaid to confirm the bank account is actually owned by the verified user, not a money mule. 
 
 
 Verify the risk 
 Apply risk-based rules: if the request comes from a new device or unusual location, enforce stronger checks before approving changes. 
 
<p>Together, these controls stop fraudsters cold, even if they’ve stolen valid credentials.</p>
 The Path Forward 
<p>Direct deposit fraud may not make headlines, but it’s quietly siphoning millions from universities. The fix is both available and practical: add identity verification at the exact point where sensitive changes happen.</p>
<p>For faculty and students, it’s 30 seconds of extra security. For universities, it’s the difference between a secure paycheck and a stolen one.</p>

 IAM Demo Day 2025: What Buyers Need to Know 



<p>When we set out to <a href="https://liminal.co/demo-day/evolving-identity-access-management/">host the IAM Demo Day</a>, the goal was not just to showcase products. It was to answer a bigger question: what does the future of identity access management actually look like in practice? On August 20, 12 leading vendors gave us their answer. From adaptive authentication and orchestration layers to access governance and Zero Trust enforcement, what became clear is that IAM is no longer a background IT function. It has become the connective tissue between security, compliance, and user experience.</p>



 







 



<p>For buyers such as CISOs under pressure to reduce risk, product leaders balancing login friction with conversion, and compliance officers navigating new regulatory regimes, the demos were a reminder that vendor selection in IAM is not about comparing feature checklists, but choosing the architecture your organization will be living with for the next decade.</p>



 1. Adaptive Authentication Is the New Baseline 



<p>The age of static passwords and “MFA everywhere” is over. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/66d9e945e15a047f3fa5d137">Nearly 90% of enterprises experienced an account takeover attempt last year</a>, and the vendors on stage were unanimous: authentication must adapt dynamically to context. Device, location, behavioral signals — these are the new inputs to trust.</p>



<p>As Joe Palmer, CIO at iProov, explained: “Not all biometrics are equal. Device biometrics like Face ID prioritize convenience over security. Cloud biometrics, tied to a trusted ID, are what stop deepfakes.”</p>



<p>He then added, “You don’t need to force a face scan on every login. Zero Trust means you always authenticate, but when risk is high, that’s when biometrics shine.”</p>



<p>The takeaway is clear: if your authentication system treats a suspicious login attempt the same way it treats a low-risk returning user, you are already behind. And for product leaders, the stakes are even higher. Every unnecessary prompt is a drop in conversion, every extra click a lost customer. Adaptive authentication is parting away from being just a security control, and it’s becoming a growth strategy.</p>



 2. Identity Orchestration Is Becoming the Control Layer 



<p>If authentication is the frontline, orchestration is the command center. Time and again, vendors showcased orchestration layers that knit together logins, consent flows, and user data across disparate systems. Why? Because <a href="https://hubs.la/Q03FrF_b0">74% of organizations still cite fragmented identity data as their biggest challenge</a>.</p>



<p>Think about that. For all the talk of digital transformation, most enterprises are still piecing together identity flows that do not talk to each other. Orchestration platforms promise to end that.</p>



<p>As David Mahdi, CIO at Transmit Security, explained: “You bring in all these third-party solutions… it adds to the complexity. And frankly, attackers love this. That’s where orchestration comes in as the baseline — to unify identity and give you a single confident view of the user.”</p>



<p>Orchestration becomes the difference between weeks of custom integration and a few clicks. It ensures that consent and access policies are enforced consistently, no matter whether a customer logs in through an app, a website, or a third-party service.</p>



<p>But as orchestration stitches systems together, it also shines a light on the next pressing question: who has access, and can you prove it?</p>



 3. Access Governance Moves to the Forefront 



<p>Once upon a time, access governance was the unglamorous corner of IAM, more a compliance checkbox than a competitive differentiator. Not anymore. Workforce IAM demos leaned heavily on role-based access, privileged account management, and Zero Trust enforcement. The subtext was clear: governance is now make-or-break.</p>



<p>As Filip Verley, our CIO, reminded the audience:&nbsp; “Zero Trust isn’t just about denying access, it’s about proving the right access. And proving it again and again, in ways that regulators can see.”</p>



<p>Least privilege is not a nice-to-have; it is the only defensible posture in a regulatory audit. The burden of proof is now squarely on the enterprise, and as governance rises in importance for the workforce, a parallel trend is reshaping the customer side of IAM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If IAM is splintering into so many dimensions, then buyers themselves must become more specific about what success looks like.</p>



 4. Customer IAM Is Becoming the Source of Truth 



<p>If there was one forward-looking theme cutting across the demos, it was the push for customer IAM to become the authoritative record of identity. Liminal research shows that <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/670541bb29cd74c93639c834">91% of businesses want CIAM solutions that integrate with MDM</a>, and while vendors didn’t use the term “MDM,” they clearly pointed in that direction. Several positioned themselves not just as login providers, but as the backbone for a unified, trustworthy customer record.</p>



<p>As Brook Lovatt, CPO at SecureAuth, explained: “Identity is more than just people; it’s about agents, APIs, and systems that act on behalf of people. If you don’t extend IAM guardrails to them, you’re blind to half your attack surface.”</p>



<p>Why does this matter? Because fragmented identity data is more than a compliance risk; it is a drag on the business. Personalization fails when profiles are scattered, silos expand the attack surface, and regulators will not accept “we couldn’t reconcile the data” as an excuse. The takeaway is clear: IAM is evolving into the system of record for identity, spanning both human and non-human users.</p>



 5. Buyer Priorities Are Becoming Role-Specific 



<p>The final, and perhaps most important, takeaway is that IAM is no longer one market with one buyer. The demos underscored how fragmented the buyer landscape has become. CISOs want measurable threat reduction. Product leaders demand orchestration that accelerates, not slows, development. Compliance executives expect governance to be mapped cleanly to regulatory frameworks.</p>



<p>In other words, IAM vendors cannot win with generic pitches anymore. They have to prove value to each buyer persona on their terms. And for buyers, the lesson is just as stark: do not settle for “good enough across the board.” Choose the vendor that solves your highest-stakes problem, because IAM is now a competitive differentiator, not a background system.</p>

<p>Not all bots are bad, but they all cost someone something. Until we fix the incentives for identifying and managing automated traffic, we’ll keep having the same tired fight: block all bots and break useful functionality, or get overrun by them and save our content and services.</p>

 What do we mean by “bot”? 



<p>Let’s clarify the terminology. “Bot” is a term that covers everything from benign automation to outright criminal activity. For the purposes of this post, we’re talking about non-human actors who interact with web services, some with permission and some without.</p>



<p>That includes:</p>



 
 Helpful bots: search crawlers, accessibility checkers, uptime monitors 



 AI agents: tools that retrieve or generate content, often hitting your site through a third-party interface 



 Enterprise automation: scripts and services performing integrations across APIs 



 Malicious bots: scrapers, credential-stuffers, spam engines, DDoS zombies 
 



<p>Some are essential, some annoying, and some outright hostile. According to the <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/ppc/application-security/bad-bot-report">2025 Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, automated traffic now makes up 51% of all web traffic, with 37% of that classified as malicious. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/from-googlebot-to-gptbot-whos-crawling-your-site-in-2025">Cloudflare Radar</a> data has its own stats that indicate bots account for approximately 30% of global web traffic.</p>



<p>Regardless of the type of bot, they all generate load at a rate faster than humans can manage on their own. And that’s where things get tricky.</p>



 Identity is only the first step 



<p>There’s been a lot of work recently on figuring out how bots can identify themselves in a standardized, trustworthy way. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/">Web Bot Authentication</a> discussion at the IETF is a good example. More and more content and service providers are demanding the ability to identify and/or differentiate bot traffic from human. Fewer (but not zero) bot developers are eager to support that goal. A handful want to be good actors, to say clearly, “Hey, I’m not a human, but I’m not here to cause trouble either.”</p>



<p>It probably goes without saying (but I’m going to say it anyway): If you’re building a polite, well-behaved bot, the last thing you want is to be lumped in with attackers. But the other side of the equation is the cost to the site your bot is connecting to. Knowing a bot’s identity doesn’t change the fact that other organizations’ infrastructures are paying the price; they may want to block you to protect themselves.</p>



<p>Even a verified, well-meaning AI agent scraping a site to summarize its content for someone’s personalized feed still hits that site’s CDN, database, and cloud compute budget.</p>



<p>And if they’re not charging for that access—if there’s no business model that connects bot traffic to revenue—then the only thing that providing some form of identity to a bot does is to give that polite visitor a name tag before they raid the pantry.</p>



 Why incentives matter 



<p>The developers building these bots often say, “We just want access. Don’t block us.” And the site operators reply, “We just want you not to break our infrastructure.”</p>



<p>That’s not a disagreement. That’s a misaligned incentive.</p>



<p>From the bot developer’s perspective:</p>



 
 Self-identifying should reduce the risk of being blocked (though, for the moment, it doesn’t) 



 A clear spec helps them integrate in good faith (if they can figure out where the spec is being developed) 



 They’d rather focus on product, not evasion tactics (who wouldn’t rather make real progress than jump through hoops?) 
 



<p>From the service provider’s perspective:</p>



 
 Every request has a cost 



 Authentication doesn’t offset bandwidth 



 Good behavior still eats resources 
 



<p>Even well-behaved bots can DDoS you by accident. You can’t fix that with certificates or signatures.</p>



 Emerging ideas from the Web Bot Auth conversation 



<p>The <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/web-bot-auth/Ouc9xB6ORaMZjUItntb4mJyjyHo/">Web Bot Auth mailing list</a> had some smart commentary recently on what incentives actually look like:</p>



 
 Reputation and differentiation: Bot operators don’t want impostors ruining their good name. Self-identification helps create reputational trust. 



 Better treatment through transparency: Authenticated bots could be treated as “allowed by default” rather than punished by default, which would flip the current anti-abuse script. 



 Load management: Many sites are being overloaded, not just attacked. Infrastructure strain is forcing even friendly sites to take defensive measures. This opens the door to load-based incentives: service operators could offer higher rate limits or more reliable access to bots that self-identify and follow documented behavior guidelines. Rather than treating all automation as abusive, a tiered system could encourage cooperative bots to behave responsibly in exchange for stable access. 
 



<p>All of that leads to an observation: identity is useful, but it doesn’t answer the real question. Who decides if the bot is worth the load it brings? That’s a value judgment that falls outside the scope of identity systems. What it does highlight is that services can’t ignore that automated traffic is hitting their infrastructure, and they need tools, not just blind faith, to manage it.</p>



 What could a better system look like? 



<p>Imagine a world where bots:</p>



 
 Register and authenticate using open standards 



 Earn a reputation score over time 



 Get tiered access based on usage patterns and benefit to the service 



 Pay—or pass value back—in proportion to their impact 
 



<p>This isn’t a fantasy. We already do this for humans via OAuth scopes, rate limiting, and usage tiers. The challenge is applying it to non-human actors in a way that scales.</p>



<p>(As an aside here, there are two people I recommend you follow if you’d like to dig into the gory, gory details of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7347897976654041089/">NHI taxonomy</a> and the practical realities of NHI: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-wahlstr%C3%B6m-98bba117/">Erik Wahlstöm</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-kasselman-0259862/">Pieter Kasselman</a>.)</p>



 What you can do today 



<p>If you’re a product manager or DevOps lead, this doesn’t have to wait on a new IETF spec. You can start with:</p>



 
 Separate metrics for bot vs. human traffic – Understand where your resources are going and whether that automation is helping or hurting. This won’t be perfect. If it were, we wouldn’t need to figure out how to differentiate the traffic in the first place. But you can get a gross approximation to start, using things like user-agent parsing, request behavior patterns, or identity-aware proxies. That can help you make smarter decisions about rate limits, caching strategies, or whether to even allow certain types of traffic at all. 



 Bot policy transparency – If you expect bots to authenticate, say so. If you want them to throttle, document it, ideally in machine-readable formats. That could include published API docs, robots.txt extensions, or structured metadata in your OpenAPI spec. You could also express bot policies via HTTP headers, usage dashboards, or identity-aware gateways. Don’t hide the rules in your EULA; bots don’t read fine print, but their developers might parse structured access guidance. 



 Selective encouragement – Are there bots that drive value? Give them the green light, but with boundaries. Tools like API gateways (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway, Apigee) already support rate limiting and tiered access policies that can help enforce those boundaries. Standards such as OAuth 2.0 and mutual TLS (mTLS) can be used to verify identity and scope access. Emerging efforts like the Web Bot Authentication discussions and SPIFFE/SPIRE for workload identity also offer structured ways to manage and audit bot and automation access without resorting to total denial or blanket approval. 
 



<p>And if you’re building a bot:</p>



 
 Respect the load you place on services. 



 Identify yourself if you want a long-term relationship. 



 Assume you’re not entitled to the same treatment as a human user unless you bring similar value. 
 



 Final thought 



<p>This isn’t about punishing bots or yelling at them to get off your lawn. Automation is here to stay. But if we want to coexist, we have to stop pretending that identification alone is the solution.</p>



<p>Identity without incentives is just surveillance.</p>



<p>Incentives without constraints are just spam.</p>



<p>Let’s aim for something better than either.</p>

 Transcript 



 Bots, Incentives, and Identity 



<p>Hi, welcome back to A Digital Identity Digest. I’m Heather Flanagan, and today we’re talking about bots.</p>



<p>[00:00:36] Speaker A: Not the horror stories, not the buzzwords, but the real, practical tension that comes up when your system starts to feel the weight of automated traffic.</p>



<p>If you’re a product manager, DevOps lead, or identity architect managing automated requests—or even a bot developer or AI agent creator—this episode has insights for you.</p>



<p>Because here’s the challenge:</p>



 
 Not all bots are bad. 



 But all bots cost someone something. 
 



 



 What We Mean When We Say Bot 



<p>Bots cover a wide spectrum of activity. They can mean:</p>



 
 Helpful automation: search engine crawlers, uptime checkers, accessibility tools 



 AI agents: fetching, generating, or summarizing content 



 Enterprise scripts: internal automation and integrations 



 Malicious actors: scrapers, spam bots, credential stuffers 
 



<p>Some are essential, some are annoying, and some are harmful. But regardless of intent, they all place a burden on infrastructure—and that cost usually lands on the target system.</p>



 



 Identity Is Only the First Step 



<p>Identity is one of my favorite topics, but identity alone doesn’t solve the bot challenge.</p>



<p>There is growing interest in creating standardized, trustworthy ways for bots to identify themselves. For example:</p>



 
 Efforts like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) are exploring bot authentication. 



 Bots could say, I’m not human, but I’m not here to cause trouble either. 



 Some providers welcome this—they want visibility into what’s hitting their sites. 
 



<p>However, many bot developers aren’t eager to adopt these practices because:</p>



 
 Self-identification doesn’t currently bring them benefits. 



 Even when they do identify, site operators still pay the cost in bandwidth, compute, and storage. 
 



<p>So the tension remains: without incentives for both sides, we’re stuck in the cycle of block everything or get overrun.</p>



 



 Why Incentives Matter 



<p>Bot developers want access without being mistaken for abusers.<br>Site operators want reliable service for their human users.</p>



<p>This isn’t pure conflict—it’s misalignment.</p>



 
 Developers want recognition as ecosystem contributors. 



 Operators need to judge whether a bot’s value is worth its load. 
 



<p>Identity management can’t make that judgment. It requires a value framework.</p>



 



 Emerging Ideas for Bot Incentives 



<p>Public discussions around bot authentication highlight some promising concepts:</p>



 
 Legitimate bots want protection from imposters who could damage their reputation. 



 Self-identification and adherence to published guidelines could be rewarded. 



 Smaller site operators are overwhelmed and often default to blocking—even when bots aren’t malicious. 
 



<p>This points toward load-aware incentives. Imagine:</p>



 
 Anonymous bots: limited access 



 Known bots: more access 



 Trusted, valuable bots: highest access 
 



<p>In other words, an API-style approach with access tiers.</p>



 



 Designing a Smarter System 



<p>We already use systems like OAuth scopes, rate limits, and usage quotas for humans. Why not for bots?</p>



<p>A smarter system could include:</p>



 
 Open standards for bot registration and authentication 



 Tiered access based on reputation, utility, and resource use 



 Machine-readable policies that clearly define what’s allowed 



 Monetization or resource-sharing models for high-impact bots 
 



<p>Companies like Cloudflare are already experimenting in this space, and it’s worth tracking their efforts.</p>



 



 What You Can Do Today 



<p>You don’t have to wait for global standards. There are steps you can implement right now:</p>



 
 Measure traffic: Separate bot and human activity with user agent parsing, behavioral analysis, or identity-aware proxies. 



 Be transparent: Publish expectations in API specifications, robots.txt, or OpenAPI metadata. Avoid hiding them in user agreements. 



 Encourage good bots: Support bots that drive value (like discoverability or user support) through API gateways, OAuth scopes, or mTLS. 
 



<p>By doing this, you’re not punishing automation—you’re designing for it, while keeping your infrastructure sustainable.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts 



<p>At the end of the day:</p>



 
 Identity without incentives is just surveillance. 



 Incentives without constraints are just spam. 
 



<p>The goal is something more useful—balanced systems where automation and infrastructure coexist productively.</p>

<p>Fintechs are reshaping finance—but AML expectations are intensifying. This article covers KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML requirements across the U.S., UK, EU, Australia, and Singapore, and shows how iComply helps automate compliance without sacrificing speed, security, or user experience.</p>
 
 Speed, scale, and seamless UX have defined the fintech revolution. But in 2024 and beyond, compliance is just as critical. Regulators worldwide are tightening scrutiny of digital finance—from embedded lending to neobanking, payments, crypto apps, and B2B platforms. 
<p>For fintechs serving global users, managing AML obligations across jurisdictions can become a scaling bottleneck—unless you have the right tools.</p>
 
 Changing AML Expectations for Fintechs by Jurisdiction 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, CFPB, OCC, state authorities 
 Requirements: MSB licensing, BOI reporting, CDD rule compliance, SAR filing, and sanctions/PEP screening 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: AML registration, customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, and data protection (UK GDPR) 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: National authorities + EU-wide AMLA 
 Requirements: 6AMLD, MiCA (for tokenization), data privacy (GDPR), UBO transparency, and secure onboarding 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF program, customer ID checks, PEP/sanctions screening, SMR reporting, and risk-based onboarding 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: AML risk assessments, transaction monitoring, UBO identification, and Travel Rule compliance for crypto 
 
 
 Compliance Challenges for Fintechs 
<p>1. Velocity vs. Verification<br>
Users expect real-time onboarding—regulators require thorough checks.</p>
<p>2. Multi-jurisdictional Complexity<br>
Serving global clients means navigating overlapping, sometimes conflicting compliance rules.</p>
<p>3. Developer Disruption<br>
Fragmented vendor stacks burden product teams and delay launches.</p>
<p>4. Trust and Brand Risk<br>
Poor compliance not only invites fines but erodes customer confidence.</p>
 
 iComply: AML Infrastructure for Fast-Moving Fintechs 
<p>iComply offers a modular, developer-friendly platform that gives fintechs the power to build, scale, and prove compliance without slowing down.</p>
 1. KYC + KYB with Edge Security 
 
 On-device ID and biometric checks for individuals 
 KYB and UBO verification with registry and document data 
 Reduce friction while protecting user privacy (PIPEDA, GDPR, etc.) 
 
 2. AML + KYT for Risk Monitoring 
 
 Real-time transaction scoring, behaviour detection, and alerting 
 Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening 
 Automated SAR/STR triggers with full case traceability 
 
 3. Localization and Data Governance 
 
 Support for 140+ languages and 14,000+ global ID types 
 Localized workflows and data residency for U.S., UK, EU, AUS, and SG 
 
 4. API-First Integration 
 
 REST APIs and developer docs 
 SDKs and white-label options for fintech UX teams 
 Webhooks and cloud/on-prem deployment options 
 
 5. Audit-Ready Case Management 
 
 Centralized review, escalation, and reporting interface 
 Export logs for regulators, banks, or investors 
 Satisfy compliance diligence during fundraising or partnerships 
 
 
 Case Insight: Embedded Finance Startup 
<p>A U.S.-based embedded payments app integrated iComply’s KYC and AML stack. In 90 days:</p>
 
 Onboarding speed improved by 40% 
 KYC verification success rate increased to 93% 
 Passed SOC2 and FinCEN diligence with full audit traceability 
 
 
 Final Take 
<p>Compliance doesn’t need to compete with UX or product speed. Fintechs that embed smart AML tools can:</p>
 
 Scale faster across regulated markets 
 Build trust with users and partners 
 Avoid fines, audits, and reputational harm 
 
<p>Schedule a call with iComply to learn how we help fintechs move fast and stay compliant – without the trade-offs.</p>

 The Blockchain That Could Reshape Global&nbsp;Finance <p>The global financial system is at a turning point. For decades, centralized banking, legacy infrastructure, and opaque financial intermediaries have defined how money flows across borders. But the rise of blockchain technology is rewriting the rules, and among the networks leading this transformation is Ontology&nbsp;(ONT).</p><p>Ontology is more than just another blockchain project it is an ecosystem designed to bring trust, identity, and data solutions to real world financial systems. Its potential to reshape the way we interact with money, identity, and institutions cannot be overstated.</p> 1. Trust Without Middlemen <p>Traditional finance relies heavily on intermediaries like banks, brokers, and clearinghouses. These entities provide trust but at a cost slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited access for billions of people worldwide.</p><p>Ontology introduces decentralized identity (DID) and data attestation, enabling users to prove their identity and ownership without relying on centralized authorities. In practice, this means that financial transactions can be conducted directly between individuals or institutions, reducing friction and costs while maintaining security.</p> 2. Financial Inclusion for the Underserved <p>According to the World Bank, nearly 1.4 billion adults remain unbanked. Traditional banking systems often exclude people due to lack of documentation, geographical barriers, or high account maintenance fees.</p><p>Ontology’s DID system empowers individuals to create and control their digital identity, opening the doors to financial services such as lending, insurance, and cross border payments. By cutting down on paperwork and enabling trustless verification, Ontology can help bring billions of people into the global financial ecosystem.</p> 3. Secure Data Sharing in&nbsp;Finance <p>Data is the new oil, and in finance, it determines everything from creditworthiness to fraud detection. Unfortunately, the way data is currently managed is fragmented and prone to abuse. Customers often have little control over their personal financial information.</p><p>Ontology enables secure, decentralized data sharing where users maintain ownership of their data and grant access selectively. This ensures both compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR) and better efficiency for financial institutions. Imagine a world where you can share your verified credit history instantly with a lender without exposing sensitive details unnecessarily.</p> 4. Cross Border Transactions and DeFi&nbsp;Growth <p>Global remittances are projected to surpass $700 billion annually, yet fees remain painfully high, with an average of 6–8% per transaction. Ontology’s blockchain can cut down these costs drastically while ensuring instant settlement.</p><p>Moreover, Ontology supports DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications that provide alternatives to traditional banking products loans, yield farming, staking, and more. This opens up new opportunities for individuals and businesses to grow wealth without being tied to centralized institutions.</p> 5. A More Transparent Financial System <p>Trust in financial institutions has been eroded by crises, scandals, and mismanagement. Ontology’s transparent, tamper proof ledger ensures accountability, auditability, and fairness. Regulators and institutions alike can benefit from greater visibility into transactions without compromising user&nbsp;privacy.</p> Conclusion: Ontology’s Financial Revolution <p>The Ontology Network is positioning itself as a cornerstone of the new financial era one that is inclusive, secure, transparent, and globally accessible. By integrating decentralized identity, trusted data, and efficient transaction systems, Ontology could fundamentally reshape how money and trust move across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In the next five years, we may see Ontology not just as a blockchain project, but as a key infrastructure layer for global finance, bridging the gap between traditional banking and the decentralized economy.</p><p>The world is moving toward a trustless, borderless, and more equitable financial system and Ontology is paving the&nbsp;way.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-network-dc37dc587cca">THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We’re proud to share that 1Kosmos has been recognized in the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/6875366">2025 Gartner Magic Quadrant</a> as a Challenger and for Identity Verification (IDV) — and we’ve earned the #1 Product Score for Workforce based on the Critical capability Matrix.</p>
<p>This recognition reinforces what we’ve believed from the beginning: workforce identity isn’t just a productivity concern. It’s a frontline security imperative.</p>
 The Reality of Workforce Identity Today 
<p>Workforce identity isn’t just inefficient — it’s under active attack.</p>
<p>Employees still wrestle with <a>password resets.</a> Security teams drown in manual reviews. HR leaders lose valuable time onboarding talent. But the stakes have escalated far beyond productivity.</p>
<p>Groups like <a>Scattered Spider</a> and state-sponsored impersonators from North Korea are exploiting weak workforce identity systems with alarming success. According to recent reports, 1 in 5 organizations have already raised concerns about deepfake-driven fraud, synthetic identities, and credential-based attacks targeting their workforce.</p>
<p>This isn’t merely an optimization issue anymore. It’s a frontline security challenge. And without robust identity verification at the core of the workforce experience, enterprises remain exposed to attackers who can impersonate employees as easily as they once stole passwords.</p>
<p>We’ve seen the impact firsthand. A large Fortune 100 organization recently shared that they were struggling with impersonation attempts during onboarding, where fraudulent applicants were slipping past legacy checks. In one case, attackers even used synthetic identities to try and gain employee-level access.</p>
<p>After deploying 1Kosmos, the organization was able to verify identities in real time, flagging suspicious patterns and blocking bad actors before they entered the workforce. At the same time, legitimate new hires were onboarded in under 30 minutes instead of days, giving HR confidence in security without sacrificing speed.<br>
That’s the impact we’re most proud of.</p>
 Proof Points from the Field 
<p>What sets 1Kosmos apart is that we don’t just verify identity once — we make that verification persistent and reusable through LiveID.</p>
<p>LiveID is our biometric credential recovery solution. Once an employee has been verified, they never need to go through repeated document checks or manual identity proofing again. If they forget a password, lose a device, or need to reset credentials, they can simply look into any camera — laptop, mobile, or kiosk — and recover access instantly. No helpdesk calls. No new onboarding cycles. And critically, no opportunity for attackers to impersonate them with stolen credentials.</p>
<p>Our customers are already seeing this difference:</p>
 
 Eliminated the need for repeat ID verification during credential resets at a global enterprise, saving IT teams thousands of hours per year. 
 Cut helpdesk password reset requests by over 60%, thanks to employees recovering access through LiveID without intervention. 
 Prevented synthetic identity attacks during onboarding at a financial services customer — LiveID established a trusted baseline and stopped fraudulent applicants before they got inside. 
 Blocked impersonation attempts from advanced threat groups, including Scattered Spider-style social engineering, because attackers couldn’t replicate a live biometric identity check. 
 
<p>With LiveID, identity proofing becomes an always-on assurance mechanism. Employees are empowered with seamless recovery, and enterprises gain a durable defense against the most sophisticated impersonation threats.</p>
 Where We’re Heading Next 
<p>Recognition in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant is an important milestone. But our roadmap makes clear: we’re just getting started.</p>
 
 Smarter fraud detection – We’re piloting AI-driven pattern recognition with select customers today, helping them spot anomalies before they turn into incidents. 
  Defending against deepfakes and synthetic IDs – Our liveness and biometric verification is evolving with AI to stay ahead of attackers who are weaponizing generative media. 
 Natural language queries for identity data – Imagine asking, “Show me anomalies in remote access logins over the last 24 hours” and getting real-time insights. Early prototypes are already in testing. 
 Developer-first flexibility – Our newest SDK release enables customers to customize verification workflows within minutes, making it easier to adapt identity flows to their unique business processes. 
 
<p>These aren’t aspirations — they’re real initiatives already underway with customers who are shaping the next generation of workforce identity with us.</p>
 Industry Context: Why Now 
<p>The stakes for workforce identity have never been higher. Attackers are outpacing legacy solutions, weaponizing AI to impersonate employees and create synthetic identities at scale. Passwords, static credentials, and bolt-on MFA simply don’t stand a chance.</p>
<p>Enterprises need more than incremental fixes. They need a frontline security control that delivers continuous verification, privacy by design, and frictionless usability at enterprise scale.</p>
<p>That’s where 1Kosmos stands apart. With innovations like <a>LiveID</a>, we’ve redefined workforce identity proofing into a durable, reusable assurance mechanism that blocks impersonation threats while empowering employees with effortless access.</p>
<p>That’s why Gartner’s recognition matters. Ranking 1Kosmos #1 in Workforce Product Score validates what the market is already demanding: a shift away from fragmented, outdated tools to an integrated identity platform that makes workforce verification both secure and seamless.</p>
<p>Our recognition in the Gartner Magic Quadrant isn’t just about us. It’s about the customers and partners who have trusted us to protect their workforce identities. Together, we are proving that identity can be more than a checkpoint. It can be a foundation of trust, resilience, and innovation across the enterprise.</p>

<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and mobile identity documents (mDocs) are rapidly moving from pilot projects to mainstream adoption. With more than five million mDLs already in circulation and half of U.S. states announcing plans to issue them, the identity community is asking an important question: what do these standards really mean for privacy, interoperability, and real-world implementation?</p><p>To explore these issues, we hosted a live podcast featuring two leading experts. Andrew Hughes, VP of Global Standards at FaceTec, has spent more than a decade shaping international ISO standards for digital identity, credentials, and biometrics. Ryan Williams, Program Manager of Digital Credentialing at the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA), leads the subcommittee responsible for translating ISO standards into North American implementation guidelines.</p><p>Moderated by Richard Esplin, Head of Product at Dock Labs, the conversation offered a rare opportunity to connect the dots between how the ISO standards are written, how they are being interpreted in practice, and what identity practitioners need to know as mDLs roll out worldwide.</p>

 The Early Days: A Security Obsession 
<p>I’ve always been a security geek. Back before Information Security was a thing, I was figuring out ways to get into systems or keep people out. This goes all the way back to the days of dial-up modems, bulletin boards, and online services like CompuServe and AOL.</p>
<p>A large portion of my security career was spent building the Information Security program at Lehman Brothers. During that 12-year run, the focus was on perimeter security, endpoint protection, and network monitoring – the first forms of intrusion detection/prevention. We wrote our own tools to do what Splunk and CyberArk do today.</p>
 The Convergence Vision 
<p>I was not only engrossed in information security but also in physical security. I spent the last few years of my career at Lehman Brothers, before their bankruptcy, managing physical security technology. My vision was to someday position myself as a CISO who would manage both worlds, as there was considerable discussion back then about the unification of those two disciplines.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize at the time was that the missing piece in my security toolkit wasn’t physical security but a verifiable digital identity. The issue was that it didn’t exist yet. Of course, we had usernames and passwords, which don’t confirm someone’s identity but only offer a guess or hope about who they are. I deployed the company’s first SecureID server with hardware tokens sometime in the late ’90s, adding more layers but not necessarily increasing the certainty of identity. We also had PKI, PGP, and other acronyms.</p>
 The Pivot to Startups 
<p>My aspirations of becoming a leader in physical and information security shifted after Lehman’s bankruptcy, prompting me to explore the venture-backed startup world. I partnered with Chris Rouland (former ISS, EndGame, Bastille, Phosphorous) on a journey at Bastille Networks. After Bastille’s successful launch and securing a total of $100 million in VC funding, I saw an opportunity to begin the process of founding 1Kosmos. While raising VC money isn’t a guarantee of ultimate success, it indicates a certain level of traction and confidence in our value proposition.</p>
 The Genesis Moment – 1Kosmos 
<p>But I’m here today to talk about digital identity and the genesis of 1Kosmos, and what led us down the path of creating the world’s first unified digital identity platform. For starters, there is the name: 1Kosmos. Kosmos means “universe” in Greek. I partnered with the</p>
<p>serial entrepreneur Hemen Vimadalal (Vaau, Simeio, Brinqa, Securonix, Saviynt, etc.) to launch the company. The idea we were kicking around was that someday you would own your own identity and be able to use it anywhere on the internet (or in the Cosmos!). Imagine a digital wallet that doesn’t just hold your credit cards, but your key identity information.</p>
<p>After early traction, we partnered with ForgePoint Capital for a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/15-million-in-series-a-funding-forgepoint-capital/">Series A</a>, and again with ForgePoint and now Oquirrh Ventures in our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B.</a></p>
<p>I got really excited about identity when we first started 1Kosmos. Our CTO and fellow co-founder, Rohan Pinto, showed me how decentralized identity could be a real game-changer back in 2018.</p>
<p>I quickly realized, after only a few months of trying to tell this story, that the world wasn’t ready for this approach because of the classic chicken-and-egg problem with digital wallets: you need widespread adoption for it to be useful, but you also need it to be helpful to get widespread adoption. Without a major platform provider like Google, Apple, or perhaps a government player pushing it into the market, you won’t see broad-scale adoption from or for individual users.</p>
 The Strategic Pivot 
<p>So, we pivoted. The core principles of the product and decentralized identity stayed the same, but our go-to-market strategy changed. We became the first to combine verified digital identity with phishing-resistant, passwordless access, using the same proof that defines a digital wallet. When paired with biometrics, it provides a great user experience and significantly boosts security.</p>
<p>We didn’t realize at the time that this would become a key aspect of zero trust: knowing exactly who is accessing the data or service.</p>
 The Power of Decentralized Architecture 
<p>Because we are built on a decentralized identity model (and still operate on it), the user always controls their own identity and authentication. This allows us to offer employers, businesses, and governments a much better way to verify and demonstrate their users’ identities.</p>
 Market Validation and Evolution 
<p>As I refined the story in the early days of the company, I tested the solution with my friends in the industry, who are now CISOs of Fortune 100 companies. In those early days, it wasn’t</p>
<p>a top priority because there was so much else to focus on, with everyone concentrating on cloud and other hot topics of the moment.</p>
<p>But one thing they all agreed on was that passwords had to be eliminated. The methods to accomplish this would evolve over the years, but the core principles remained the same. They also agreed that verifying a user’s identity was vital for key access points into their organizations, such as calls to the service desk and confirming the identity of new hires.</p>
 The Perfect Storm 
<p>When the <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/stopping-scattered-spider-at-the-identity-layer-protecting-airlines-from-identity-based-cyberattacks/">Scattered Spider</a> attacks began, we were well positioned to capitalize on the increased focus on digital identity. Our competitors in the industry were only concentrating on passwordless solutions without verified identities, leaving them with ineffective, patchwork solutions. The surge in security incidents and breaches motivated us to go to market and test the waters for a Series B raise. This belief was shared by our entire team.</p>
 Betting on Our Vision: The Series B 
<p>When we secured our $57 million Series B funding, my leadership team and I invested a substantial portion of our own personal wealth. As I mentioned at the time, “We’re not just confident in our pitch deck and customer base. We’re betting our personal wealth on our vision.”</p>
<p>We are addressing the core flaw in traditional identity and access management. By linking biometrics to a verified identity, we are re-confirming a user’s identity at every login, not just verifying a credential. We are truly transforming authentication from being about “something you have” to “who you are.”</p>
 The AI Challenge and Opportunity 
<p>As we look ahead, the threat landscape continues to evolve. The next major challenge for every CISO is how AI will change business operations, attacks, and defenses. We’re observing AI being weaponized, but also leveraged for defensive opportunities.</p>
<p>Once again, we were lucky to be in the right place at the right time regarding how we verify human identities. We’ve been using deepfake mitigation tools for years and continuously improving them. Once again, we are years ahead of our competitors, and this will be our key to winning the AI arms race. I am confident in our ability to deliver this high level of assurance, which will be our main differentiator between leading and lagging identity platforms.</p>
 Coming Full Circle: The Decentralized Future 
<p>But returning to what Rohan showed me in 2018 with decentralized identity and verifiable credentials: I see this not as a competing technology because it’s been integrated into the platform from the start. Instead, I view it as the ultimate realization of the 1Kosmos vision—getting this form of identity into the hands of every person.</p>
<p>The original idea might have been years too early, but having this capability in the platform will be the fourth “right time at the right place” moment for 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>To recap, our four key timing moments have been:</p>
<p>1. Verified identity</p>
<p>2. Passwordless access</p>
<p>3. Unifying those two principles by linking them to a biometric</p>
<p>4. And now, decentralized identity is coming of age</p>
 Reflection 
<p>My journey from CISO to company founder has been truly remarkable. I’m very fortunate to be surrounded by great fellow founders, and I couldn’t be more excited about our journey and the path we’re creating for our customers.</p>

<p>I was delighted and honoured to be invited by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katina-michael-103177/">Professor Katina Michael</a> to provide input to the <a href="https://www.socialcyber.co/">Social Cyber Institute</a> Australia-India consultation on Technology Impact Assessment (TIA).</p>
<p>Katina and I had a wide-ranging discussion about technology, data protection and digital transformation. A video recording is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEOUGKk5Aa0">posted on YouTube</a> and I am writing a few blogs to consolidate some of the topics we had fun traversing.</p>
<p>This first blog concerns the untapped potential of applying public health principles to cyber security.</p>
 In praise of public health 
<p>I have come to understand a little and appreciate a lot about public health through my extraordinary life partner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-denney-wilson-13419410/">Dr Elizabeth (Lizzie) Denney-Wilson</a>, a leading researcher in preventive health and <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/elizabeth-denney-wilson.html">Professor of Nursing at the University of Sydney</a>. Through a bit of home office serendipity, Lizzie happened to meet Katina as we were warming up to record the TIA interview. This prompted me to share a few reflections on the differences I’ve observed between public health and cyber security professionals when it comes to human factors.</p>
<p>The thing is, people make bad decisions. People smoke and gamble; they eat too much but don’t exercise enough.</p>
<p>Human error is notoriously blamed for most cyber security problems. But in contrast to epidemiologists, information technologists have little sympathy for regular people and their bad decisions. We can’t fathom why users clicked on links and got phished. Or why they reused the same password across multiple sites. Or why people choose such stupid passwords to begin with!</p>
<p>In contrast, public health professionals long ago stopped blaming people for making harmful choices. “Bad decisions” isn’t even part of their frame of reference. Instead, preventive health researchers focus on human behaviour and working out the pathways to changing behaviour.</p>
<p>We need to stop the victim-blaming in cyber security. Regular folks are lumbered with complex, brittle, unforgiving Internet systems, designed by engineers, most often for engineers.</p>
 Security need not be difficult by design 
<p>Lizzie taught me the public health policy maxim, Make the best choice the easy choice.</p>
<p>Think about passwords. It’s not the users’ fault that they need passwords!</p>
<p>The password is a relic of 1960s computing, where it suited highly technical network administrators. In the good old days before global public networks, computers were only accessible from inside secure buildings, so single factor passwords were perfectly adequate.</p>
<p>The password must be the only piece of IT where effectiveness is inversely proportional to ease of use. That is, the harder a password is to use, the better it is! Technicians in data centres can deal with that, but the general public cannot, while they have come to use modern pocket-sized supercomputers for everything from home security to grocery shopping.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/fido-and-ambient-cryptography/">FIDO Alliance</a> launched <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">Passkeys</a> that regular users’ easy choice of authenticator became the best choice.</p>

  Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are reshaping how businesses interact with customers by reducing friction, building trust, and creating seamless digital experiences.

<p>Every business strives to provide its customers with the best possible experience. A significant challenge, however, is identity friction. This issue does not stem from a lack of effort but rather from the fact that traditional identity systems were not designed for today’s digital-first environment.</p><p>There is encouraging news. Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are already helping organizations create seamless customer experiences. Below is an overview of how VDCs are addressing long-standing challenges and enabling business success.</p> Understanding the Customer Experience Challenge <p>Research consistently shows that identity friction is one of the largest barriers to customer satisfaction in the digital age. 70%&nbsp;of global shoppers abandon their online carts across the board, but when forced to create an account,&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/blog/identity-the-critical-link-in-retail-and-hospitalitys-digital-future?ref=blog.spruceid.com">26% of U.S. shoppers&nbsp;specifically drop off</a> due to that friction point. When businesses fail to reduce barriers at critical moments like onboarding, checkout, or account recovery, they risk not only losing immediate sales but also eroding long-term customer trust and loyalty. This is where verifiable digital credentials can make a measurable difference.</p> How VDCs Are Creating Better Customer Experiences <p>Verifiable digital credentials provide a fundamentally different approach to identity management. Instead of requiring users to repeatedly prove who they are, VDCs enable a single credential that can be used across services. This allows for instant verification without friction while giving users complete control over the information they share.</p><p>The <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/whats-the-difference-between-a-physical-id-card-and-a-verifiable-digital-credential/">technology behind VDCs</a> offers cryptographic security for assurance, real-time verification capabilities, and interoperability across systems. Most importantly, VDCs are designed with user-friendly interfaces that make advanced security processes seamless and unobtrusive for end users.</p> How are VDCs Being Used in the Wild? <p>Age Verification at Checkout<br>When a shopper adds an age-restricted product to their cart, the system can instantly request proof of age via a verifiable digital credential. Instead of uploading an ID or typing in sensitive details, the customer shares only a simple confirmation - “Over 18” or “Over 21.” The purchase moves forward without unnecessary exposure of birthdate or address, keeping checkout fast and private.</p><p>Ticket and Booking Confirmation<br>During checkout for flights, concerts, or sporting events, customers can present a digital credential linked to their booking. At entry, that same credential confirms validity in seconds, no paper tickets or manual lookups needed. This reduces fraud, shortens wait times, and makes the overall customer flow smoother.</p><p>Insurance or Payment Eligibility<br>In a healthcare checkout or appointment booking flow, a patient can present a digital credential that proves both identity and insurance eligibility. This replaces lengthy form-filling and card uploads, allowing check-in and payment confirmation to happen in one click. The result: less administrative friction, faster processing, and a better overall experience.</p> The Customer Experience Transformation <p>These use cases highlight key areas where VDCs generate significant business value. </p>  First, they eliminate friction through one-click authentication processes that replace password reset frustrations with instant verification.   Second, VDCs build trust by ensuring security and empowering users with control over their data.   Third, they increase conversion by reducing abandonment and accelerating onboarding, leading to higher completion rates and improved engagement.   Finally, VDCs lower operational costs by reducing support overhead and automating verification, freeing resources for company growth initiatives.   Explore VDCs for Your Brand <p>The customer experience opportunity is not only about fixing inefficiencies, but about unlocking new possibilities. VDCs improve security while enabling businesses to deliver seamless, trustworthy experiences that meet modern customer expectations.</p><p>The key question is not whether businesses can afford to implement VDCs, but how VDCs can strengthen customer experience and drive long-term success. Organizations that adopt VDCs are not simply solving technical challenges. They are building competitive advantages that will define the future of digital engagement.</p><p>If your organization is ready to explore how VDCs can transform customer experience and create opportunities for growth, SpruceID can help design and deploy systems that enhance customers' interactions with your brand.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Crypto platforms must comply with tightening AML laws worldwide—from MiCA in the EU to Travel Rule enforcement in the U.S., UK, Singapore, and UAE. This article explores global KYT, KYC, and AML expectations for VASPs and how iComply helps automate screening, verification, and cross-chain compliance.</p>
 
 The crypto industry has grown from fringe innovation to a core component of global finance – but with that growth comes regulation. In every major market, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are now expected to meet traditional financial crime standards. For crypto exchanges, custodians, token issuers, and wallets, this means embracing full-spectrum AML compliance: from real-time identity verification to transaction monitoring and data sharing protocols. 
 
 The Global AML Landscape for Crypto 
 European Union 
 
 Frameworks: MiCA, AMLD6, and Travel Rule compliance 
 Expectations: KYC for all users, KYB for corporate clients, transaction monitoring (KYT), and cross-border data sharing via TRP (Travel Rule Protocol) 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, state regulators 
 Requirements: MSB licensing, Travel Rule compliance, sanctions screening (OFAC), suspicious activity reporting (SARs), and BOI reporting for corporate accounts 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: Registration, AML risk assessment, PEP and sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and Travel Rule data transfer 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: VASP licensing, CDD/EDD, KYT, and secure data transfer of originator/beneficiary details under the Travel Rule 
 
 United Arab Emirates 
 
 Regulators: VARA (Dubai), SCA (federal) 
 Requirements: KYC, transaction monitoring, UBO reporting, and Travel Rule compliance for all virtual asset transfers 
 
 
 Core Compliance Responsibilities for Crypto Firms 
 
 KYC/KYB: Identity verification of users and business clients 
 KYT: Monitoring of blockchain transactions for anomalies, structuring, and prohibited counterparties 
 Sanctions + PEP Screening: Ongoing checks of users, addresses, and counterparties 
 Travel Rule: Transmitting originator and beneficiary information securely and in real time 
 Audit-Ready Documentation: Logging all decisions, escalations, and screening events 
 
 
 Why Compliance Is Harder in Crypto 
<p>1. Pseudonymity: Wallet addresses lack inherent identity linkage</p>
<p>2. Cross-border complexity: Differing enforcement timelines and data localization laws</p>
<p>3. Fragmented tooling: Most tools only cover part of the AML process</p>
<p>4. User drop-off risk: Friction-heavy verification drives away users if poorly implemented</p>
 
 How iComply Helps VASPs Stay Compliant and Competitive 
<p>iComply delivers a modular, API-friendly platform tailored to VASPs across jurisdictions:</p>
 1. Edge-Based KYC + KYB 
 
 Verify individuals and businesses using local devices before encryption 
 Avoid transmitting raw PII or breaching GDPR or UAE data rules 
 Supports 14,000+ global ID types in 140+ languages 
 
 2. KYT: Smart Blockchain Monitoring 
 
 Monitor wallet behaviour and transaction patterns 
 Score and escalate suspicious flows (e.g., tumblers, DEX swaps, sanctions exposure) 
 Correlate blockchain data with user risk profiles 
 
 3. Travel Rule Compliance 
 
 Integrate with TRISA, OpenVASP, or TRP 
 Securely send and receive originator/beneficiary info 
 Log data sharing and counterparty responses for audits 
 
 4. Sanctions + PEP Screening 
 
 Screen individuals, addresses, and corporate entities 
 Configure alerting thresholds and refresh cycles 
 
 5. Unified Case Management 
 
 Assign investigators, log decisions, and export regulatory reports 
 Full traceability across onboarding, transactions, and disposition 
 
 
 Case Insight: US Crypto Exchange 
<p>A mid-sized US exchange adopted iComply’s full-stack compliance suite. Results:</p>
 
 Reduced onboarding drop-off by 35% 
 Achieved KYB, KYC and Travel Rule readiness in under 60 days 
 Improved screening accuracy and reduced processing time 
 
 
<p>Crypto compliance isn’t just about checking a box – it’s about building trust, enabling scale, and staying ahead of regulators. VASPs that embed KYT, KYC, and AML at the infrastructure level are best positioned for global growth.</p>

<p>The soon-to-be-released <a href="https://portal.hpp.io/">HPP Migration Portal</a> and the Bridge will serve as the official gateways for transitioning from legacy tokens (AERGO and AQT) into the new HPP economy. Through the portal, holders will be able to seamlessly convert their tokens into the unified HPP Token, while the bridge guarantees integrity and security across&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Both the portal and bridge will be rolled out progressively as the migration advances, ensuring a smooth and reliable transition for all participants.</p><p>The following is a preview of how the migration will be carried out, outlining the two-step process required to complete the transition into the HPP ecosystem.</p><a href="https://portal.hpp.io/">https://portal.hpp.io/</a> Migration Steps <p>Step 1: Swap AERGO / AQT → HPP(Ethereum)</p>  AERGO(both native and ERC-20) and AQT(ERC-20) are converted into HPP(Ethereum).  Ratios: 1 AERGO = 1 HPP 1 AQT = 7.43026 HPP (only the whole number will be converted; decimal remainders will not carry&nbsp;over)  <p>Why this step is&nbsp;required</p><p>Ethereum is the most liquid and interoperable base layer. Converting legacy tokens into HPP (Ethereum) ensures:</p>  A unified token supply across&nbsp;chains  Compatibility with existing exchange infrastructure  Secure accounting and custody before moving into the new Layer&nbsp;2  <p>Step 2: Finalize HPP(Ethereum) → HPP(Mainnet)</p>  Convert your HPP(Ethereum) to HPP(Mainnet) through the official&nbsp;portal.  HPP(Mainnet) is for Exchange listings, DAO governance &amp; rewards, and Ecosystem utilities  <p>Why this step is&nbsp;required</p><p>HPP(Mainnet) is the execution layer optimized for AI-native workloads. To participate in governance, earn rewards, and access dApps, tokens must reside on the HPP Mainnet. Keeping Ethereum as an intermediate layer ensures smooth bridging, liquidity routing, and compliance.</p> Key Notes   Both the portal and bridge will be rolled out as the migration advances.  A detailed, step-by-step migration guide will be released concurrently with the launch of the&nbsp;portal.  To fully participate in the HPP ecosystem, including governance, staking, rewards, and trading, it is essential to complete both steps of the migration.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/official-path-to-hpp-portal-and-bridge-opening-soon-df0e5e2b0318">Official Path to HPP: Portal and Bridge Opening Soon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A new Mississippi law requires us to block full access to Bluesky unless all users complete age checks. We have concerns about this law’s implementation.

<p>Keeping children safe online is a core priority for Bluesky. We’ve invested a lot of time and resources building moderation tools and other infrastructure to protect the youngest members of our community. We’re also aware of the tradeoffs that come with managing an online platform. Our mission is to build an open and decentralized protocol for public conversation, and we believe in empowering users with more choices and control over their experience. We work with regulators around the world on child safety—for example, Bluesky follows the UK's Online Safety Act, where age checks are required only for specific content and features.</p>
<p>Mississippi's approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky. The Supreme Court’s recent <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf">decision</a> leaves us facing a hard reality: comply with Mississippi’s age assurance <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">law</a>—and make every Mississippi Bluesky user hand over sensitive personal information and undergo age checks to access the site—or risk massive fines. The law would also require us to identify and track which users are children, unlike our approach in other regions. We think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Unlike tech giants with vast resources, we’re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control. Age verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring — costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.</p>
<p>We believe effective child safety policies should be carefully tailored to address real harms, without creating huge obstacles for smaller providers and resulting in negative consequences for free expression. That’s why until legal challenges to this law are resolved, we’ve made the difficult decision to block access from Mississippi IP addresses. We know this is disappointing for our users in Mississippi, but we believe this is a necessary measure while the courts review the legal arguments.</p>
<p>Here’s more on our decision and what comes next.</p>
 Why We’re Doing This 
<p>Mississippi’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">HB1126</a> requires platforms to implement age verification for all users before they can access services like Bluesky. That means, under the law, we would need to verify every user’s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The potential penalties for non-compliance are substantial — up to $10,000 per user. Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law's broad scope and privacy implications.</p>
 Our Concerns About Mississippi’s Approach 
<p>While we share the goal of protecting young people online, we have concerns about this law’s implementation:</p>
 
 Broad scope: The law requires age verification for all users, not just those accessing age-restricted content, which affects the ability of everyone in Mississippi to use Bluesky. 
 Barriers to innovation: The compliance requirements disadvantage newer and smaller platforms like Bluesky, which do not have the luxury of big teams to build the necessary tooling. The law makes it harder for people to engage in free expression and chills the opportunity to communicate in new ways. 
 Privacy implications: The law requires collecting and storing sensitive personal information from all users, including detailed tracking of minors. 
 
 What We’re Doing 
<p>Starting today, if you access Bluesky from a Mississippi IP address, you’ll see a message explaining why the app isn’t available. This block will remain in place while the courts decide whether the law will stand.</p>
 How This Differs From Our Approach in Other Places 
<p>Mississippi’s new law and the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) are very different. Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/07-10-2025-age-assurance">follows</a> the OSA in the UK. There, Bluesky is still accessible for everyone, age checks are required only for accessing certain content and features, and Bluesky does not know and does not track which UK users are under 18. Mississippi’s law, by contrast, would block everyone from accessing the site—teens and adults—unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.</p>
 Other Apps on the Protocol 
<p>This decision applies only to the Bluesky app, which is one service built on the AT Protocol. Other apps and services may choose to respond differently. We believe this flexibility is one of the strengths of decentralized systems—different providers can make decisions that align with their values and capabilities, especially during periods of regulatory uncertainty. We remain committed to building a protocol that enables openness and choice.</p>
 What’s Next 
<p>We do not take this decision lightly. Child safety is a core priority, and in this evolving regulatory landscape, we remain committed to building an open social ecosystem that protects users while preserving choice and innovation. We’ll keep you updated as this situation develops.</p>

<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">gaining traction worldwide</a> as governments look for secure, digital alternatives to physical identity documents. The promise is clear: residents and citizens can carry a government-issued license on their phone, verify their identity, keep their privacy, and reduce reliance on physical cards.</p>
<p>But there’s a challenge to adoption. While it’s easy to issue an mDLs, verifying one across different systems, borders, and industries is not. Without an easy way to verify an mDL, its usefulness is limited.</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a> solves. Proven makes mDL verification simple, mobile, and cost-effective. With Proven, an mDL can be used and trusted at banks, airports, and businesses.</p>
 Closing the mDL verification gap 
<p>Proven bridges the verification gap in two ways.</p>
<p>For organizations that want integration at the system level, Proven provides APIs that can be embedded into existing workflows.</p>
<p>And for those who want to verify quickly, without system integrations, Proven provides a mobile verifier, downloadable as an app that is simple to use and cost-effective to adopt.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to verify an mDL:&nbsp;at a government agency, at a retailer for proof of age — anywhere, anyone needs to prove who they are.</p>
 Interoperability by design 
<p>With Proven, you have a system for digital identity that scales to your needs and meets the requirements for verifiable digital identity around the world. Proven enables you to issue, verify, and combine with <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">Digital Travel Credentials (DTC)</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicios-support-for-the-w3c-did-specification-and-its-path-to-standardization/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/implement-digital-identity-in-europe-with-sd-jwt-vcs-from-indicio-proven/">SD-JWT VC</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">AnonCreds</a>, and interoperate with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/destination-europe-unlock-markets-create-seamless-services-with-indicio-provens-eudi-wallet-integration/">European Digital Identity Wallet.</a> (EUDI).</p>
<p>Proven also allows you to combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials to provide the highest level of digital identity assurance and mitigate the threats of biometric identity fraud and AI-generated deepfakes.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/regula-and-indicio-partner-to-transform-identity-verification-with-verifiable-credentials/">our partnership with Regula,</a> Proven now provides access to document validation for 250-plus countries and territories — all of which can be combined with biometric authentication.</p>
<p>This breadth of options in Proven provides enterprises and governments with a range of innovative, easy-to-implement solutions that meet current and future document and identity authentication needs — all with the assurance of interoperability, privacy-by-design, and open-standard robustness.</p>
 Lower cost, increase revenue 
<p>Indicio Proven isn’t just about saving you on identity verification, fraud, and security costs, it provides a way to monetize verification. Very small fees for verification are imperceptible to users but soon add up when your solution scales. It’s a boon for government infrastructure — rapid deployment, user simplicity, immediate revenue.</p>
<p>No other digital identity technology offers this benefit trifecta.</p>

<p>Identity has become one of the most vulnerable parts of the digital world. Every week, we see headlines about new attacks: deepfakes tricking people into wiring money, social engineering scams bypassing help desks, and stolen credentials fueling large-scale breaches. Groups like<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/stopping-scattered-spider-at-the-identity-layer-protecting-airlines-from-identity-based-cyberattacks/"> Scattered Spider</a> and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/why-the-fortune-500-keeps-getting-duped-by-deepfake-job-applicants-and-how-to-stop-it/">North Korea’s “shadow IT” workers</a> have shown just how easily attackers can manipulate outdated processes. These incidents reveal a simple truth: the old ways of handling identity are no longer enough.</p>
 Why Traditional Identity Falls Short 
<p>Most identity systems were built decades ago, around usernames, passwords, and static credentials stored in centralized databases. At the time, it made sense. But in today’s environment, this approach creates more risk than protection. Centralized stores are tempting targets, and when they fall, millions of records go with them. Meanwhile, adversaries are using AI to generate fake voices and faces, harvest credentials in real time, and run scams that outpace static security controls.</p>
<p>The human impact is also clear. People are asked to hand over personal information to countless organizations without knowing how it is stored or shared. They have almost no control, and when regulations tighten, enterprises end up scrambling to catch up.</p>
 Putting People Back in Control 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe the answer is not to add more layers to a broken model, but to rethink identity from the ground up. That is why we are building privacy-first, decentralized identity solutions that shift control back to the user.</p>
<p>The heart of this approach is the digital wallet. Instead of credentials living in a central database, they are stored securely on a person’s device. That means an individual can carry verified credentials, like a driver’s license, proof of employment, or a biometric factor, and choose exactly when and with whom to share them. Organizations, in turn, can instantly verify authenticity without holding sensitive data themselves.</p>
<p>The result is stronger privacy, reduced risk of mass breaches, and a much better experience. No more resets. No more risks. No more roadblocks. We’re already seeing the impact of this approach. Enterprises using 1Kosmos have cut fraud loss, reduced fraud losses by 90% and eliminated millions of password resets. For employees and customers, it means faster access, fewer frustrations, and stronger trust in every interaction.</p>
 Fueling the Shift with $57 Million 
<p>We’re already seeing strong traction with enterprises and governments embracing a privacy-first identity model. Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B funding</a> is the catalyst to move even faster—expanding innovation, integrations, and global reach. The investment validates the market’s urgent need for identity modernization and accelerates our ability to deliver it.</p>
<p>With this funding, we are advancing AI-powered defenses against deepfakes and impersonation attempts, expanding enterprise-ready digital wallets, and strengthening integrations with IAM, CIAM, PAM, and zero-trust platforms. We are also growing our reach into new markets across North America, EMEA, and APAC.</p>
<p>These steps build on the momentum we have already achieved, including becoming the only full-service Kantara-certified credential service provider with FedRAMP High authorization, and winning a 10-year, $194.5 million Login.gov agreement to supply next-generation identity proofing.</p>
 Where We Go From Here 
<p>For too long, identity has been the weakest link. We see it as the foundation of trust—and the key to better digital experiences when built on privacy and user control.</p>
<p>That is the vision we are pursuing at 1Kosmos. By combining verified identity proofing, passwordless authentication, and blockchain-based privacy, we are giving organizations the tools to stop impersonation attacks before they start, while giving individuals more control over their digital lives.</p>
<p>The stakes have never been higher, but neither have the opportunities. With our Series B investment, we are moving faster toward a world where identity is no longer the first step in the kill chain, but the first line of defense.</p>

<p>Decentralized systems have been in vogue at least since the rise of Web3, particularly in Europe. Unlike in the USA or China, where centralized structures prevail, Europe consists of many comparatively small democratic nations that must coordinate in all areas of life to provide their citizens with a high quality of life. </p>
<p>Similar to participants in decentralized Web3 networks, individual citizens in Europe enjoy a high degree of autonomy, freedom, and self-determination. While this autonomy is inherently embedded in the software code of Web3, in Europe, national governments create the legal frameworks. Examples like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Crypto/guideline_self-sovereign_identities.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">Self-sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) establish EU-wide standards that enable secure cross-border digital transactions.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we have actively participated in decentralized systems through our projects, most recently in the <a href="https://gaia-x.eu">GAIA-X</a> funding project <a href="https://moveid.org">moveID</a>. The experiences gained lead to two key conclusions: The values and benefits of decentralized systems are recognizable and measurable, offering flexibility and innovation in dynamic environments. However, decentralized systems are not feasible or value-creating without a direct connection to centralized elements. This may sound contradictory at first, but it is not.</p>
<p>The Necessity of Centralized Elements in Decentralized Systems</p>
<p>Decentralized systems do not develop from within themselves; they always require a central idea or organization as the initial spark. Furthermore, a central entity must permanently handle tasks in governance, administration, and management. Without this, decentralized systems tend toward apathy or inactivity, as current incentive models do not ensure long-term constructive activity. A decentralized system remains active only as long as central functions provide the necessary incentives. Additionally, basic infrastructure must be created and operated – a task typically handled centrally, with costs distributed among participants.</p>
<p>From the perspective of organization theory, this aligns with contingency theory: There is no universally best structure; the choice between central and decentralized depends on the environment. In stable contexts, centralized systems provide efficiency and control, while decentralized ones promote agility in volatile markets. <a href="https://mintzberg.org">Henry Mintzberg</a> describes in his organizational models that centralized structures (e.g., Machine Bureaucracy) are suitable for standardization, whereas decentralized ones (e.g., Adhocracy) foster innovations. Disadvantages of centralized systems include the lack of flexibility, while decentralized systems can lead to coordination issues. </p>
<p>Symbiosis as the Path to Success</p>
<p>In short, decentralized and centralized systems can form a beneficial symbiosis that compensates for the drawbacks of monolithic approaches and generates more prosperity for all participants. Hybrid models, as recommended in organization theory, combine stability with agility and are exceptionally sensitive in complex environments. </p>
<p>A necessary prerequisite for this symbiotic interplay is the ability and willingness of participants to understand the advantages and limitations of each system, along with the commitment to contribute to governance constructively. Only then do the positive outcomes emerge. Participants who see only the benefits of a monolithic structure should be excluded to maintain integrity.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we apply these insights in our data-driven solutions for health and sustainability, developing hybrid systems that link autonomy with reliable governance. </p>

 How ONT ID Can Restore Trust in the Face of Manipulative AI <p>The rise of generative artificial intelligence has opened unprecedented technological horizons, but it has also raised a fundamental question: how can we distinguish truth from falsehood in a world where content text, images, videos, audio can be manipulated or entirely created by algorithms? AI-generated deepfakes and fake news threaten to undermine trust in the media, institutions, and even human interactions. In the face of this digital truth crisis, innovative solutions are needed. This article explores how ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, can serve as a robust verification mechanism to authenticate content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem.</p> The Trust Challenge in the Age of Generative AI <p>Generative AI, capable of producing text, images, sounds, and videos with striking realism, has transformed the content creation landscape. However, this capability comes with a major downside: the ease with which it can be used to generate misleading or outright false information. Deepfakes of public figures, AI-generated news articles spreading misinformation, and automated online comments manipulating public opinion have become tangible&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The problem goes beyond the technical detection of manipulated content, which is an endless race between creators and AI detectors. The real issue is the erosion of trust. If users can no longer distinguish authentic content from synthetic content, the value of information itself diminishes. This has profound implications for democracy, commerce, education, and social relationships. Developing mechanisms to prove the origin and integrity of content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem has become imperative.</p> ONT ID: An Anchor of Trust in a Sea of&nbsp;Content <p>This is where ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, comes into play. Built on blockchain technology and adhering to W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), ONT ID provides a robust framework to establish the provenance and authenticity of digital content. Instead of relying on centralized platforms that can be compromised or manipulated, ONT ID allows content creators to digitally sign their work with their decentralized identity.</p><p>Imagine a content creator whether a journalist, artist, or researcher using their ONT ID to cryptographically link their identity to each piece of content they produce. This digital signature, recorded on the blockchain, becomes immutable proof of the content’s origin. Any consumer can then verify this signature using an ONT ID-compatible tool, confirming that the content genuinely comes from the claimed source and has not been altered since its creation.</p><p>Moreover, ONT ID can be used to attest to the nature of the content. For example, a creator could label content as “AI-generated” or “human-verified.” This transparency allows users to make informed decisions about the credibility and nature of the content they consume. By providing a verifiable and decentralized anchor of trust, ONT ID offers a powerful means to combat misinformation and restore confidence in the digital ecosystem.</p> Practical Implementation and&nbsp;Benefits <p>Applying ONT ID for content verification can take several&nbsp;forms:</p>  Digital content signatures: Content creation platforms (news outlets, press agencies, digital art studios) could integrate ONT ID to allow authors and artists to digitally sign their work. These signatures would be visible and verifiable by the public, adding a layer of&nbsp;trust.  Marking AI-generated content: Generative AI tools could be required to integrate ONT ID to indelibly mark the content they produce as AI-generated. This allows consumers to immediately know whether they are interacting with human or synthetic content.  Source identity verification: In journalism and research, ONT ID could be used to verify the identity of information sources, ensuring that the information comes from legitimate people or organizations rather than bots or malicious entities.  Digital reputation and credibility: Over time, content creators who regularly sign their work with ONT ID and are recognized for the reliability of their information could build a verifiable digital reputation on the blockchain. This would encourage the production of authentic, high-quality content.  <p>The advantages of this approach are manifold: a significant reduction in misinformation, restoration of public trust in media and online information, increased protection against fraud and identity theft, and a more transparent and accountable digital ecosystem. By shifting the burden from detection to proof of authenticity, ONT ID offers a proactive and sustainable solution to the trust challenge in the AI&nbsp;era.</p> Conclusion <p>The rise of generative AI has created a digital landscape where truth is increasingly difficult to discern. In the face of proliferating manipulated content and deepfakes, restoring trust has become a top priority. Ontology’s ONT ID provides a powerful, decentralized solution to this challenge. By enabling creators to digitally sign their content and providing consumers with tools to verify authenticity and provenance, ONT ID can serve as an essential anchor of trust in the digital ecosystem.</p><p>By adopting decentralized identity technologies like ONT ID, we can not only fight misinformation but also build a more transparent, secure, and trustworthy digital future one in which truth can once again flourish.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-age-of-digital-distrust-21c796608581">The Age of Digital Distrust</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series on building the Many-to-Many System. In our first two posts, we explored the project’s origins, the challenge of structuring our complex knowledge, and the human pace required to do it well. We left off discussing the need to create a digital “guide” to help people navigate the deep and interconnected learnings from our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past three months, that abstract idea has become a tangible reality. We have been working in parallel on two major outputs: a linear, narrative-driven Field Guide and a modular, interactive website. These two pieces have been in constant conversation, shaping each other as they evolve. In this post, we, Arianna, Gurden, and Michelle, share our reflections on bringing this part of the system to life, the power of a good design process, and what it feels like to see emergence in&nbsp;action.</p><p>Arianna: Maybe I can start. The last three months have been a back-and-forth conversation between our two major outputs: the Field Guide and the website. We were working on them in parallel, so every new page or piece of content for the Field Guide would influence the website, and the website would influence the Field Guide. A really interesting part was categorising all the tools. For you too, Michelle, I imagine writing in the Field Guide and then seeing the first draft of the website that Gurden built really helped clarify what should remain in a linear format and what could become an interactive element.</p>Working on copy and storytelling on the website, it’s not easy to go from the Field Guide which has 80+ pages to a 3 paragraphs maximum&nbsp;format.<p>This double narration is key. The Field Guide is linear, so people can follow page by page, and we’ve put a lot of effort into diagrams that synthesise and distinguish each section clearly. On the website, we’re trying to simplify the experience with shortcuts and modular recalls so that everything is interconnected. That has been our core challenge and focus these last&nbsp;months.</p>Our two ways to discover and learn about the Many-to-Many System.<p>Gurden: Yeah, listening to you, Arianna, it’s really cool to watch this flow of content between the Field Guide and the website. We made these structural decisions months ago, sitting in a park during our workshop, and it’s a great feeling to see them validated now. We were a bit unsure at the time because we’re dealing with so much complexity: many, many, many things, as the name suggests! But we made a conscious decision to have both a linear and an interactive flow, and the process has proven that was the right&nbsp;call.</p>The Field Guide is not simply a PDF report, it has guiding elements, small interactive buttons, guiding diagrams, and visual elements to help navigate complexity.<p>As the Field Guide grew, the website structure grew with it. To make sure the website is structurally sound, I set up a skeleton database in Notion for the main content. To be honest, my expectations were a bit low when I asked Michelle and Annette to fill it, but big shoutout to Annette, her mind works just so quickly. She immediately got the object-oriented structure and filled it up, making the connections brilliantly. That gave me a distilled version of the content to populate our website via the Content Management System.</p>Screenshot from Sanity, our content management system, showing linkages between&nbsp;data.<p>I’m glad we didn’t try to perfect everything at once. We moved fast, built a rough first version, and brought it to life, which is now live internally. We’ve already done a few quick user tests. If we had just stayed in Figma, we’d still be there six months from&nbsp;now.</p><p>Michelle: I have so little to add because you’ve both covered most of it! My main addition is to highlight how everything has informed everything else. You’ve talked about the Field Guide and website, but they, in turn, provided enough structure for the database so Annette could go in and finish it. That process gave all of us a deeper understanding of our tools, examples, case studies and other assets we needed to&nbsp;create.</p><p>It’s a good example of real emergence. A lot of people talk about emergence when they’re really just describing chaos without enough boundaries. But here, we had pieces that genuinely formed the next piece, that formed the next piece. What was supposed to come out and what would be useful for other people was illuminated by going through this process. It gave birth to key assets we hadn’t yet imagined, like Angela’s “Experimenter’s Logbook”, which will be available soon on the website. I’m not sure that would have been conceived in the same way without this interplay. It’s a testament to what a good design process does, and even though we didn’t invent the design process, it was nice to be part of one that was so fruitful.</p>Index preview of the Field Guide, which will be avilable&nbsp;soon.<p>Gurden: I agree. The process exists, but I’ve seen so many teams not follow it well. And credit to you, Arianna, the interconnected diagrams you created are now coming to life. When you navigate the website, you see a problem and the related tools linked directly to it. These interlinkages are what make it a living system, not just a static&nbsp;page.</p><p>Of course, that’s also our next challenge: making sure the user experience works, that people don’t get lost. A website is a living organism, and new ideas will constantly come in. The hard part now is making conscious decisions about what we need to fix before launch versus what can wait for the next&nbsp;version.</p><p>Arianna: That brings me to another point: how we are all holding many hats. We aren’t a typical product team where each person has one defined role. The core team is tiny, and each of us holds three or four different roles. This has positives, we can communicate rapidly, and as designers and coders, we are deeply embedded in the content, thanks to the time Michelle and Annette took to teach us. But on the other side, by holding many roles, we have to compromise. We can’t excel at everything. So, for this first version, we might focus less on perfecting accessibility, for example, because our goal is to launch an alpha or beta version. When we have more time to focus, we can scale it and do it&nbsp;better.</p><p>Michelle: That’s a super good reflection on the human side of the process. So, to wrap up, we’ve now asked a set of close collaborators to give us feedback over the next month. Our hope is that the website, the core tools, and the Field Guide will be ready to share more widely in late September or mid-October. Then we’ll put it out into the world, get a wider set of feedback, and see what people&nbsp;think.</p><p>Our next step is to incorporate feedback from our close network before sharing it with all of&nbsp;you.</p><p>Thanks for following our journey.

 The certification reinforces IDnow’s role as a trusted, future-proof partner for regulated businesses and ensures that IDnow’s core solutions are fully aligned with current and upcoming EU compliance requirements, including EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp; 



 



<p>IDnow has become one of the first companies in Europe to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">receive certification under the latest ETSI</a> standard for remote identity proofing, which is a key requirement for eIDAS 2.0 compliance and EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This milestone cements IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof partner for regulated industries and ensures its solutions are aligned with both current and upcoming EU compliance frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



 Certified for the future of European Digital Identity&nbsp; 



<p>The certification, developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and officially endorsed by the European Commission, confirms that several of IDnow’s core products meet the strict biometric integrity, security, and assurance levels required for digital onboarding in highly regulated sectors. These solutions are now certified as compliant with eIDAS 2.0 at the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) – the highest level defined under the revised regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The certified identity verification methods include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-introduces-nfc-based-verification-for-digital-ids/">NFC-based ID verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID (electronic ID) verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet verification</a>&nbsp;  



 Why ETSI standards are so important for remote identity verification&nbsp; 



<p>In achieving certification, IDnow demonstrated compliance with the following ETSI standards:&nbsp;</p>



  ETSI TS 119 461 V2.1.1 – Identity proofing component requirements&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 401 V3.1.1 – General policy requirements for Trust Service Providers&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-1 V1.5.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-2 V2.6.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-2 V2.3.1 – Certificate profiles for legal persons&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-5 V2.4.1 – Certificate profiles for identity proofing&nbsp;  



 Addressing rising fraud with certified security&nbsp; 



<p>With AI-powered fraud tactics like deepfakes and injection attacks growing rapidly in both sophistication and scale, IDnow’s certification arrives at a critical moment for digital security. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pindrops-2025-voice-intelligence--security-report-reveals-1-300-surge-in-deepfake-fraud-302479482.html">2025 report by Pindrop</a>, deepfake fraud attempts have surged urged by over 1300% in 2024, escalating from an average of one per month to seven per day. This alarming increase underscores the growing sophistication and frequency of AI-driven fraud, particularly targeting financial services and contact centers. The report also forecasts a <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/article/deepfake-fraud-could-surge/">162% rise in deepfake-related fraud in 2025</a>, highlighting the urgent need for robust verification solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ETSI TS 119 461 standard provides essential safeguards through its strict requirements for features such as presentation attack detection (PAD), injection attack detection (IAD), biometric integrity assurance, and real-time fraud prevention – offering businesses and users protection at the highest level of assurance.&nbsp;</p>



 Built for Europe’s regulatory future&nbsp; 



<p>This certification reinforces IDnow’s commitment to providing secure, flexible and scalable identity verification solutions across Europe. The platform is uniquely positioned to support evolving compliance needs, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0&nbsp;</a>  



  Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD6</a>)&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet readiness&nbsp;</a>  



<p>“This latest certification confirms IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof technology partner for regulated businesses across Europe,” says Armin Berghaus, founder and Managing Director at IDnow. “It represents our intention for IDnow to continue to provide the most flexible and future-proof identity verification and fraud prevention platform for businesses navigating complex European compliance and customer experience demands.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2027, all banks operating in the EU will be required to work with providers certified under ETSI TS 119 461. This gives IDnow customers the confidence that their identity verification processes are not only secure and compliant today, but also ready for what’s next.&nbsp;</p>

 Use Okta for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>The first step is registering your app in Okta as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) client using Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE), the most secure and mobile-friendly OAuth 2.0 flow. PKCE is a best practice for mobile apps to prevent authorization code interception attacks.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Native Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback</code> 
       Post Logout Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/</code>
 (where <code>{yourOktaDomain}.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device. 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level

<p>NOTE: When using a custom authorization server, you need to set up authorization policies. Complete these additional steps:</p>

 
   In the Admin Console, go to Security &gt; API &gt; Authorization Servers 
   Select your custom authorization server (<code>default</code>) 
   On the Access Policies tab, ensure you have at least one policy:
     
       If no policies exist, click Add New Access Policy 
       Give it a name like “Default Policy” 
       Set Assign to to “All clients” 
       Click Create Policy 
     
   
   For your policy, ensure you have at least one rule:
     
       Click Add Rule if no rules exist 
       
        <p>Give it a name like “Default Rule”</p>
       
       
        <p>Set Grant type is to “Authorization Code”</p>
       
       Set User is to “Any user assigned the app” 
       Set Scopes requested to “Any scopes” 
       Click Create Rule

  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Native App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain.</p>

 Prefer phishing-resistant authentication factors 

<p>Every new Integrator Free Plan admin account must use the Okta Verify app by default to set up MFA (multi-factor authentication). We’ll retain the default settings for this project, but you can tailor the authentication policy for your organization’s needs. We recommend phishing-resistant factors, such as Okta Verify with biometrics and FIDO2 with WebAuthn. These configurations help defend against credential theft and phishing and align with Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment, standards like NIST SP 800-63, and industry regulations like SOC 2 or HIPAA.</p>
 
   Prefer MFA or phishing-resistant factors for real users 
   Tailor policies based on risk level, environment (dev vs prod), and user behavior 
 

<p>Thoughtfully configuring your <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/policies/modify-first-party-app-policies.htm">authentication policies</a> protects your users while maintaining a seamless login experience.</p>

 Create an iOS project with Okta’s mobile libraries for authentication 

<p>Before diving into integration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:.</p>

 
   Xcode version 15.0 or later. This guide assumes you’re comfortable working in Xcode and building iOS apps in Swift. 
   Swift - This guide uses Swift 5+ features. 
   Swift Package Manager (SPM) - We’ll use Swift Package Manager for managing dependencies. Ensure it’s available in Xcode. 
   Node and npm installed locally to run the backend server 
 

 Creating your Xcode project 

<p>If you are starting from scratch, create a new iOS app:</p>

 
   Open Xcode 
   Go to File -&gt; New -&gt; Project 
   Select iOS App and select Next 
   Enter the name of the project 
   Set the Interface to SwiftUI or UIKit, depending on your preference
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this post, we will be using SwiftUI</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Select Next and save your project locally 
 

<p>You’re now ready to add Okta’s SDK into your project.</p>

 Authenticate your iOS app using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 with Okta 

<p>To integrate the Okta SDK into your iOS app, follow these detailed steps using Swift Package Manager (SPM), the recommended and modern way to manage dependencies in Xcode.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>
 
   Open the project if it’s not already open 
   Select File → Add Package Dependencies 
   In the search bar at the top right of the window that appears, add the <code>https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift</code> repository and select Enter. Xcode will fetch the package details. 
   Choose the latest version available (recommended) or the version you prefer. 
   When prompted to choose the products to add, make sure to select your project next to <code>BrowserSignin</code> in the Add to Target column 
   Select Add Package 
 

<p>This package provides the full login UI experience and token handling utilities for OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. It’s the core component for authentication in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Once added, you’ll see the Okta SDK listed under your project’s Package Dependencies.</p>

 Add the OIDC configuration to your iOS app 

<p>To use the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> flow, initialize the shared client with your specific app credentials.</p>

<p>The cleanest and most scalable way to manage configuration is to use a property list file for Okta stored in your app bundle.</p>

<p>Create the property list for your OIDC and app config by following these steps:</p>
 
   Right-click on the root folder of the project 
   Select New File from Template (New File in legacy Xcode versions) 
   Ensure you have iOS selected on the top picker 
   Select Property List template and select Next 
   Name the template <code>Okta</code> and select Create to create a <code>Okta.plist</code> file 
 

<p>You can edit the file in XML format by right-clicking and selecting Open As -&gt; Source Code. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;scopes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;openid profile offline_access&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;redirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;clientId&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourClientID}&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;issuer&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;logoutRedirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} and {yourClientID} with the values from your Okta org.</p>

<p>If you use something like this now in code, you can directly access the <code>BrowserSignin</code> shared object, which will already be allocated and ready for use.</p>

 Manage authentication actions for your iOS app using the Okta Swift SDK 

<p>We’ll build the core authentication layer for our app, the <code>AuthService</code>. This service handles login, logout, token refresh, and user info retrieval using the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> module.</p>

<p>Create a new folder named <code>Auth</code> under your project’s folder structure. We’ll use this folder to organize our authentication code. Inside that folder, create a new Swift file named <code>AuthService.swift</code> and define the protocol and class:</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
    var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
    var idToken: String? { get }
    
    func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
    func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
    func signIn() async throws
    func signOut() async throws
    func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
}
final class AuthService: AuthServiceProtocol {
    // Implementation will go here
}
</code>   

<p>After doing this, you will get an error message saying that the <code>AuthService</code> does not conform to protocol <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code> because we haven’t implemented the functions yet. We will implement the functions as we progress.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>Models</code> inside the <code>Auth</code> folder. Within the <code>Models</code> folder, create a new file named <code>TokenInfo.swift</code>, and add the code shown:</p>

   <code>struct TokenInfo {
    // we will add properties in the next section
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we will add the <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods inside the <code>AuthService</code> class.
With the Okta Swift SDK, handling user authentication is straightforward and secure – thanks to the built-in <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods in the <code>BrowserSignin</code> client. Let’s break down how to build these methods in your <code>AuthService</code>.</p>

 The <code>signIn</code> method 

<p>The <code>signIn</code> method redirects the user to authenticate using Okta, handles the PKCE flow, and retrieves the authentication tokens upon successful login. Open the <code>AuthService</code> class, find the comment <code>Implementation will go here</code>, replace the comment with the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signIn() async throws {
    BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true
    let tokens = try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signIn()
    if let tokens {
      _ = try? Credential.store(tokens)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s unpack this:</p>

<p><code>BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true</code></p>

<p>This property controls the type of browser session used for authentication:</p>
 
   If set to true, it forces an ephemeral browser session, meaning no cookies or session state will persist across authentication attempts. It’s like opening a private/incognito window for each login attempt. 
   If set to false, it shares the browser state with the system browser, allowing Okta to remember the user’s login state across sessions (for example, for single sign-on across apps). 
 

<p>In our demo, we set <code>ephemeralSession = true</code> to treat each login as a fresh authentication, which is ideal for testing.</p>
 
   <code>signIn(from: window)</code>
  This function launches the Okta-hosted sign-in page.
  The window parameter provides context for where to present the login UI, typically your app’s current window if building in UIKit. 
   <code>Credential.store(tokens)</code>
  After login, we store the tokens securely (e.g., access token, ID token, and refresh token) using Okta’s built-in Credential storage helper. 
 

 The <code>signOut</code> method 

<p>Signing out is also straightforward. We will proceed by adding it immediately below the <code>signIn</code> method in the <code>AuthService</code> class:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signOut() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signOut(token: credential.token)
  try? credential.remove()
}
</code>   

<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
 
   We check if there’s a current credential by calling <code>Credential.default</code>. 
   We call <code>signOut</code> on the shared <code>BrowserSignIn</code> instance, passing the current token for session revocation. 
   After a successful logout, we remove the credential from secure storage. 
 

<p>This ensures the user’s session is entirely revoked and cleared from the app and Okta’s backend.</p>

 Add handling for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC tokens and the authenticated session 

<p>Once we’ve set up authentication flows, we must handle token management and session state. This step ensures that your app knows when the user is authenticated, how to access their tokens, and how to refresh tokens when needed.</p>

<p>The protocol requires implementing two computed variables and three functions to help us manage the tokens and the session.</p>

<p>Add the following code in the implementation of the <code>AuthService</code> class right above the <code>signIn</code> method:</p>

   <code>var isAuthenticated: Bool {
  return Credential.default != nil
}
</code>   
<p>Let’s go through the code.</p>

<p>The <code>isAuthenticated</code> computed property checks whether there’s a valid token stored in the app:</p>
 
   It uses <code>Credential.default</code>, a singleton that securely stores the user’s tokens. 
   If a valid token exists, the user is considered authenticated; otherwise, they are not. 
 

<p>Next, we’ll add the second helper computed property, which we will use to retrieve the user’s ID token. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, under the <code>isAuthenticated</code> property, add the following code:</p>

   <code>var idToken: String? {
  return Credential.default?.token.idToken?.rawValue
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>idToken</code> property retrieves the raw value of the ID token from the stored credential:</p>
 
   The ID token is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing user identity information, such as the user’s email, name, and subject (<code>sub</code>). 
 

<p>We successfully implemented the computed properties required by the protocol. Next, we’ll add the implementation for the three helper functions.</p>

<p>Tokens always expire, which means that at some point, they are no longer valid, and we must refresh them. Lucky, Okta’s SDK provides us with a solution for this need. We can leverage the refresh function, which is part of the <code>Credential</code> object.</p>

<p>Inside the <code>AuthService</code> class, right after the <code>signOut</code> method, add the <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await credential.refresh()
}
</code>   
<p>The <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded</code> method ensures that tokens are up-to-date by attempting a token refresh when necessary:</p>
 
   It calls the <code>Credential.refresh()</code> method, which uses the refresh token (if available) to get a new access token and ID token. 
   This helps avoid token expiration issues that could interrupt the user’s session. 
 

<p>At this point, we’ll add an empty implementation to the other two functions, which will help us get some information about the token and the user. In our case, we will present some data on the screen. Add the following code after the <code>refreshTokenIfneeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
    
func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>With this added, we resolved the errors we saw in <code>AuthService</code>, and you’ll be able to build the project successfully.</p>

 Use the auth service in your Swift app 

<p>Now that we’ve built the <code>AuthService</code> to handle sign in, sign out, token management, and user info retrieval, let’s see how to integrate it into your app’s UI.</p>

 Use <code>AuthService</code> in your views 

<p>Since this app is about authentication, rename the auto-generated view <code>ContentView</code> to <code>AuthView</code> and rename the file to match. Don’t forget to rename all the existing and auto-generated references to <code>ContentView</code> and use <code>AuthView</code> instead.</p>

<p>Next, in the same folder as the <code>AuthView</code>, we will create the <code>AuthViewModel</code>. The <code>AuthViewModel</code> handles all user actions and authentication:</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import Observation
import BrowserSignin

@Observable
final class AuthViewModel {
    // MARK: - Dependencies
    
    /// This is the service that handles all the sign-in, sign-out, token, and user info logic.
    private let authService: AuthServiceProtocol

    // MARK: - UI State Properties

    /// True if the user is currently logged in.
    var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    
    /// The user's ID token (used for secure backend communication).
    var idToken: String?
    
    /// Shows a loading spinner while something is happening in the background.
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    /// If something goes wrong (e.g., login fails), the error message will show in the UI.
    var errorMessage: String?
    
    /// This holds a message returned from the resources server.
    var serverMessage: String?

    // MARK: - Initialization

    
    /// Create the view model and immediately update the UI with the current authentication status.
    init(authService: AuthServiceProtocol = AuthService()) {
        self.authService = authService
        updateUI()
    }
    
    // MARK: - UI State Management

    /// Updates the `isAuthenticated` and `idToken` values from the authentication service.
    func updateUI() {
        isAuthenticated = authService.isAuthenticated
        idToken = authService.idToken
    }
    
    // MARK: - Authentication
    
    /// Called when the user taps the "Sign In" or "Sign Out" button.
    /// Signs the user in or out, updates the UI, and handles any errors.
    @MainActor
    func handleAuthAction() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            if isAuthenticated {
                // User is signed in → sign them out
                try await authService.signOut()
            } else {
                // User is signed out → sign them in
                try await authService.signIn()
            }
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - Token Handling
    
    /// Refreshes the user's token if it's about to expire.
    /// Keeps the user logged in longer without needing to manually sign in again.
    @MainActor
    func refreshToken() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            try await authService.refreshTokenIfNeeded()
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - User Info
    
    /// Requests user information (like name, email, etc.) from the authentication service.
    @MainActor
    func fetchUserInfo() async -&gt; UserInfo? {
        do {
            let userInfo = try await authService.userInfo()
            return userInfo
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
            return nil
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Token Info

    /// Retrieves token metadata like expiry time or claims.
    /// Returns nil if no token is available.
    func fetchTokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
        guard let tokenInfo = authService.tokenInfo() else { return nil }
        return tokenInfo
    }

    // MARK: - Helpers
    
    /// Sets the loading state (used to show/hide a spinner in the UI).
    private func setLoading(_ value: Bool) {
        isLoading = value
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we must extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use the view model and all the properties and functions we added. This view will change depending on whether the user is authenticated and will incorporate displaying the ID token and a button to refresh the token. Open <code>AuthView.swift</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI
import BrowserSignin

/// The main authentication screen that shows the current login state,
/// allows the user to sign in or out, and access token/user info and server message.
struct AuthView: View {
    // View model manages all auth logic and state
    @State private var viewModel = AuthViewModel()

    // Presentation control flags for full-screen modals
    @State private var showTokenInfo = false
    
    // Holds the fetched user info data when available
    // And presents the UserInfoView when assigned value
    @State private var userInfo: UserInfoModel?

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            statusSection
            tokenSection
            authButton
            if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
                refreshTokenButton
            }
            if viewModel.isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .onAppear {
            // Sync UI state on view load
            viewModel.updateUI()
        }
        .alert("Error", isPresented: .constant(viewModel.errorMessage != nil)) {
            Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
                viewModel.errorMessage = nil
            }
        } message: {
            // Show error message if available
            if let message = viewModel.errorMessage {
                Text(message)
            }
        }
    }
}

private extension AuthView {
    /// Displays "Logged In" or "Logged Out" depending on current state.
    var statusSection: some View {
        Text(viewModel.isAuthenticated ? "✅ Logged In" : "🔒 Logged Out")
            .font(.system(size: 24, weight: .medium))
            .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
    }

    /// Shows the user's ID token in small text (only when authenticated).
    var tokenSection: some View {
        Group {
            if let token = viewModel.idToken, viewModel.isAuthenticated {
                Text("ID Token:\n\(token)")
                    .font(.system(size: 12))
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            }
        }
    }

    /// Main login/logout button. Text and action change based on login state.
    var authButton: some View {
        Button(viewModel.isAuthenticated ? "Sign Out" : "Sign In") {
            Task { await viewModel.handleAuthAction() }
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
    }

    /// Opens the full-screen view showing token info.
    var refreshTokenButton: some View {
        Button("🔄 Refresh Token") {
            Task { await viewModel.refreshToken() }
        }
        .font(.system(size: 14))
        .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
    }
}

struct UserInfoModel: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let user: UserInfo
}
</code>   

<p>With this in place, you can run the application and test the authentication. Currently, we are not using the <code>TokenInfo</code> and the <code>UserInfo</code> from the <code>ViewModel</code> because we will expand the view in the next section.</p>

 Read token info 

<p>After successfully authenticating a user, it’s helpful to extract meaningful details from the ID token and present them in a user-friendly format. For this purpose, we created a <code>TokenInfo</code> model in the previous sections. It will be initialized from the ID token and includes a <code>toString()</code> function to generate a nicely formatted description of the token data for display in the UI.</p>

<p>Open <code>TokenInfo.swift</code> and add the code shown.</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import BrowserSignin

struct TokenInfo {
    var idToken: String
    var tokenIssuer: String
    var preferredUsername: String
    var authTime: String?
    var issuedAt: String?
    
    init?(idToken: JWT) {
        guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
            return nil
        }
        
        self.idToken = idToken.rawValue
        self.tokenIssuer = idToken.issuer ?? "No Issuer found"
        self.preferredUsername = idToken.preferredUsername ?? "No preferred_username found"
        
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = .medium
        formatter.timeStyle = .medium
        
        if let authTime = idToken.authTime {
            self.authTime = formatter.string(from: authTime)
        }
        
        if let issuedAt = idToken.issuedAt {
            self.issuedAt = formatter.string(from: issuedAt)
        }
    }
    
    func toString() -&gt; String {
        var result = ""
     
        result.append("ID Token: \(idToken)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Preffered username: \(preferredUsername)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Token Issuer: \(tokenIssuer)")
        result.append("\n")
        if let authTime {
            result.append("Auth time: \(authTime)")
            result.append("\n")
        }
        
        if let issuedAt {
            result.append("Issued at: \(issuedAt)")
            result.append("\n")
        }

        return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the previous sections, we introduced two methods for fetching information about the token and the authenticated user. However, we left their implementation empty. It’s now time to implement those functions, and we will start by implementing the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function.</p>

<p>Navigate to your <code>AuthService</code> class and in there find the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function, which should look something like this:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>To initialize our TokenInfo modal view, we need the ID token. Okta’s Swift SDK lets us fetch the ID token directly from the <code>Credential.default</code>. Remove the <code>return nil</code> from the function implementation and add the following code:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
    return nil
  }
      
  return TokenInfo(idToken: idToken)
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation extracts the ID token from the default Credential and tries to instantiate the <code>TokenInfo</code> object.</p>

<p>Next, we must implement the second empty function introduced in the previous sections, <code>userInfo()</code>. We’ll use the SDK’s <code>UserInfo</code> model to pass the data around. Replace the existing implementation of <code>userInfo()</code> with the code shown.</p>

   <code>func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  if let userInfo = Credential.default?.userInfo {
    return userInfo
  } else {
    do {
      guard let userInfo = try await Credential.default?.userInfo() else {
        return nil
      }
      return userInfo
    } catch {
      return nil
    }
  }
}
</code>   
<p>If your Okta setup includes them, you could extend this method to extract more claims, such as email, given name, family name, or custom claims.</p>

<p>With this code in place, we need to display the information to the user somehow in the UI. First, we’ll create a <code>TokenInfoView</code> to display all the information we fetched previously. Create a new Swift file in the root folder of your application and name it <code>TokenInfoView.swift</code>. After creating the file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI

struct TokenInfoView: View {
  let tokenInfo: TokenInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
            .resizable()
            .foregroundStyle(.black)
            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
            .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
          Text(tokenInfo.toString())
          .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
          .padding()
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
      }
         
    }
    .background(Color(.systemGroupedBackground))
    .navigationTitle("Token Info")
    .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Proceed with adding one more Swift file named <code>UserInfoView.swift</code>. This view displays previously fetched information about the User. In your newly created file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI
import BrowserSignin

struct UserInfoView: View {
  let userInfo: UserInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    
  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
              .resizable()
              .foregroundStyle(.black)
              .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
              .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
        Text(formattedData)
          .font(.system(size: 14))
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
          .padding()
      }
    }
      .background(Color(.systemBackground))
      .navigationTitle("User Info")
      .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
    
  private var formattedData: String {
    var result = ""
     
    result.append("Name: " + (userInfo.name ?? "No Name set"))
    result.append("\n")
    result.append("Username: " + (userInfo.preferredUsername ?? "No Username set"))
    result.append("\n")
    if let updatedAt = userInfo.updatedAt {
      let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
      dateFormatter.dateStyle = .medium
      dateFormatter.timeStyle = .short
      let date = dateFormatter.string(for: updatedAt)
        result.append("Updated at: " + (date ?? ""))
      }

      return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, we need to add some actions to the <code>AuthView</code> to see the views we just created. In the <code>AuthView</code> class at the end of the file, you will find the private extension that we previously defined. After the <code>refreshTokenButton</code> in the private extension of <code>AuthView</code>, add the following buttons:</p>

   <code>/// Opens the full-screen view showing token info.
var tokenInfoButton: some View {
  Button {
    showTokenInfo = true
  } label: {
      Image(systemName: "info.circle")
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
    }
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
  }

  /// Loads user info and presents it full screen.
  var userInfoButton: some View {
    Button("👤 User Info") {
      Task {
        if let user = await viewModel.fetchUserInfo() {
          await MainActor.run {
            userInfo = UserInfoModel(user: user)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    .font(.system(size: 14))
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Now that we have the buttons implemented, we need to add them to the <code>body</code> of <code>AuthView</code> so that the user can see them and click them. Scroll to the top of the file and find <code>struct AuthView:View</code>. Add both buttons right after <code>refreshTokenButton</code>, and then the <code>VStack</code> in your body should look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton // tokenInfoButton added here
    userInfoButton // userInfoButton added here
  }
  
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the definition for <code>body</code>, we need to call two view modifiers to be able to see the TokenInfoView and UserInfoView. You’ll add the following code right after the closing brace of the <code>message: {}</code> property:</p>

   <code>// Show Token Info full screen
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showTokenInfo) {
  if let tokenInfo = viewModel.fetchTokenInfo() {
    TokenInfoView(tokenInfo: tokenInfo)
  }
}
// Show User Info full screen   
.fullScreenCover(item: $userInfo) { info in
  UserInfoView(userInfo: info.user)
}
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the application, you should be able to click on the Info button to get the token information and the User Info button to get the user information.</p>

<p>And there you have it! 🎉 We built a sample app from scratch using Okta’s new Swift SDK and the <code>BrowserSignin</code> module to show the authenticated user’s ID claims. By following these steps, you’ve learned how to:</p>

 
   ✅ Configure Okta and set up your application 
   ✅ Implement a robust AuthService to handle login, logout, and token management 
   ✅ Build a SwiftUI interface that displays user info and handles authentication flows seamlessly 
 

<p>With just a few lines of code, you have a fully functional, secure login flow integrated into your iOS app – no more OAuth headaches or token handling nightmares.</p>

<p>Authentication is the first step in an app, but we want to display data from a backend resource securely.</p>

 Add backend authorization using a custom resource server 

<p>If you want to go beyond authentication and add authorization checks for your APIs, we can experiment using Okta’s Node.js Resource Server example as a starting point.</p>

<p>Here’s how to connect your iOS app to a backend that validates access tokens:</p>

 Set up a customer resource server for your mobile app 

<p>Clone the example Node.js resource server:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4.git
cd samples-nodejs-express-4
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Open the project in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. I like Visual Studio Code because it has a built-in terminal, but you can make the required code changes directly to the file. Open <code>resource-server/server.js</code>. Look for the configuration block where <code>oktaJwtVerifier</code> is initialized. Update it like this:</p>

   <code>const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
});
</code>   

<p>Replace the <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your Okta org domain, and replace the <code>{yourClientID}</code> with the client ID of your iOS project.</p>

<p>Serve the resource server by running the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>npm run resource-server
</code>   

<p>You should see your server running locally at: http://localhost:8000/</p>

<p>This server will validate incoming access tokens and respond with two messages if the token is valid:</p>

   <code>{
   "messages":[
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T19:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"I am a robot."
      },
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T18:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"Hello, world!"
      }
   ]
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s create the model conforming to this payload.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>MessagesResponse.swift</code> in the <code>Auth/Models</code> folder and add the code.</p>

   <code>import Foundation

struct MessageResponse: Codable {
   let messages: [Message]
}

struct Message: Codable {
   let date: String
   let text: String
}
</code>   

 Make authorized API requests from your iOS app 

<p>To call the resource server API from our iOS code, we must first implement a function inside our <code>AuthService</code> to fetch messages.</p>

<p>Open the <code>AuthService</code> file and add one more function at the end of the <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code>:</p>

   <code>protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
  var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
  var idToken: String? { get }
  
  func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
  func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
  func signIn() async throws
  func signOut() async throws
  func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
  func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String // added
}
</code>   

<p>Because we introduced a new function to the protocol, it requires an implementation. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, immediately after the implementation of <code>userInfo()</code>, add the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else {
      return "Not authenticated."
  }

  var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "http://localhost:8000/api/messages")!)
  request.httpMethod = "GET"

  await credential.authorize(&amp;request)

  let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
  let decoder = JSONDecoder()
  let response = try decoder.decode(MessageResponse.self, from: data)
  if let randomMessage = response.messages.randomElement() {
      return "\(randomMessage.text)"
  } else {
      return "No messages found."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>With this, you will get an error message that some classes aren’t found. That’s because we must <code>import Foundation</code> into our <code>AuthService.swift</code> file just below <code>import BrowserSignIn</code>.</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
import Foundation // added
</code>   

<p>Okta’s iOS SDK provides a handy method for automatically adding your access token as an Authorization header on a URL request.</p>

<p>We need to go back to the <code>AuthViewModel</code> and add a function to call <code>fetchMessageFromBackend()</code> and set the server message to our <code>serverMessage</code> property of the <code>viewModel</code>. Add the following code right after <code>fetchTokenInfo()</code>:</p>

   <code>// MARK: - Server Messages

/// Asks the backend for a message and saves it for display in the UI.
@MainActor
func fetchMessage() async {
  setLoading(true)
  defer { setLoading(false) }
  
  do {
    let message = try await authService.fetchMessageFromBackend()
    serverMessage = message
  } catch {
    errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use this function and show the fetched server message as an alert to the user. For this purpose, go to the <code>AuthView</code> file and in the extension just below the <code>userInfoButton</code>, we will add one more button like this:</p>

   <code>/// Requests a message from the backend and shows it in the UI.
var getMessageButton: some View {
  Button("🎁 Get Message") {
    Task {
        await viewModel.fetchMessage()
        
    }
  }
  .font(.system(size: 14))
  .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to present this button to the view. In the <code>body</code>of <code>AuthView</code>, let’s add <code>getMessageButton</code> and the body will look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton
    userInfoButton
      getMessageButton // getMessageButton added here
  }
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we’ll alert the user with the message contents received from our backend if the authentication is successful. To do so, we need to add the <code>.alert</code> view modifier to the body of <code>AuthView</code> after the final <code>fullScreenCover</code> closing bracket, like this:</p>

   <code>// Show Alert with the fetched message
.alert("Message Response", isPresented: .constant(viewModel.serverMessage != nil)) {
    Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
        viewModel.serverMessage = nil
    }
} message: {
    // Show message if available
    if let message = viewModel.serverMessage {
        Text(message)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>With all this in place, you’ll see a message alert when pressing the Get Messages button.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach for securely connecting your mobile app to backend APIs using OAuth 2.0 and JWT validation. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-swift-mfa-redirect-example">completed project in a GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>🎉 And that’s it! Your iOS app now has authentication and calls a backend API with the access token for fully integrated authorization verification.</p>

<p>Facial recognition technology has become increasingly common in our daily lives. From unlocking phones to airport security, it is changing the way we identify and <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">verify people</a>. This technology uses advanced software to analyze facial features and match them with existing databases, making many tasks faster and more secure.</p>
<p>While facial recognition offers convenience and improved safety, it also comes with challenges. Privacy concerns, accuracy issues, and ethical questions are important factors to consider before adopting this technology. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition can help businesses and individuals make informed choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Facial Recognition Technology? 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">Facial recognition technology</a> is a type of software that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing their facial features. Cameras with facial recognition capture images or video of faces. The software then compares these images to a database to identify a match.</p>
<p>It is widely used in security, banking, law enforcement, and even marketing. While it offers convenience, it also raises concerns about privacy and accuracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Facial recognition technology offers several important benefits. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
 1. Enhanced Security 
<p>One of the main advantages of facial recognition is improved security. It can identify individuals in crowded places, detect unauthorized access, and prevent fraud. For businesses, this technology can help protect sensitive areas.</p>
 
 Banks use facial recognition to verify clients for online transactions. 
 Airports and government buildings use it to control access and ensure safety. 
 
<p>By providing a layer of security beyond passwords or ID cards, facial recognition technology reduces the risk of theft and unauthorized entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Convenience and Speed 
<p>Facial recognition can make daily tasks faster and easier. Unlike traditional authentication methods, it does not require remembering passwords or carrying cards.</p>
 
 Phones and laptops can be unlocked instantly. 
 Airports can speed up boarding with automated facial scans. 
 Offices can track attendance without manual checks. 
 
<p>This convenience saves time for both individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Contactless Identification 
<p>In the era of health concerns and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">pandemics</a>, contactless systems have become essential. Facial recognition is a non-intrusive, touch-free technology. It reduces the need for physical contact, which is safer in public spaces and healthcare environments.</p>
<p>This feature makes it ideal for hospitals, banks, airports, and retail stores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Law Enforcement and Public Safety 
<p>Facial recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in tracking and identifying suspects. It is useful for finding missing persons, preventing crimes, and investigating incidents.</p>
<p>Cameras with facial recognition can scan crowds in real time, alerting authorities to potential threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Integration with Other Systems 
<p>Facial recognition can work with other technologies, such as security cameras, mobile apps, and access control systems. This integration allows for smarter solutions. For example, smart home systems can use facial recognition to unlock doors for family members but restrict access to strangers.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> make it easy to integrate facial recognition into existing systems efficiently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Disadvantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Despite its advantages, facial recognition technology has limitations and potential risks. Here are some of the main disadvantages:</p>
 1. Privacy Concerns 
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of facial recognition is the potential invasion of privacy. Constant surveillance can make people feel watched and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Data collected through facial recognition can be misused if not properly secured. Some governments and companies have faced criticism for using this technology without consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Risk of Misidentification 
<p>Facial recognition is not 100% accurate. Lighting, camera quality, facial expressions, and changes in appearance can affect results. Misidentification can lead to wrongful accusations or denied access.</p>
<p>This is a serious concern, especially in law enforcement and security applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. High Costs 
<p>Facial recognition requires good cameras, software, and secure storage, which can be expensive. Maintenance and upgrades also add to the cost. Tools like Recognito offer cost-effective solutions, making it easier for businesses to adopt without overspending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Ethical and Legal Issues 
<p>Facial recognition raises ethical questions. How and where should the technology be used? What limits should be set? Different countries have different laws regarding the use of facial recognition, making compliance challenging.</p>
<p>Improper use could lead to legal penalties or public backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Potential for Bias 
<p>Some facial recognition systems have shown bias against certain ethnic groups or genders. This can result in unfair treatment, especially in hiring processes, law enforcement, or financial services.</p>
<p>Developers are working to reduce bias, but it remains a concern.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Balancing the Pros and Cons 
<p>When considering this technology, it is essential to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition. For example, businesses may benefit from enhanced security and convenience. However, they must also address privacy, accuracy, and ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Public awareness, transparency, and regulations play a key role in ensuring facial recognition is used responsibly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Facial Recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology continues to evolve. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are improving accuracy and reducing bias. We are likely to see more industries adopt this technology for secure, efficient, and contactless operations.</p>
<p>However, its future will also depend on legal frameworks and public acceptance. Companies must use it responsibly and prioritize the protection of user data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition highlight both its strengths and limitations. Facial recognition technology offers many advantages, including better security, convenience, and integration with modern systems. At the same time, it comes with risks such as privacy concerns, misidentification, and ethical challenges.</p>

				  Indicio Proven adds Digital Passport Credentials aligned to ICAO DTC-2 Specifications  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE / AUGUST 19, 2025 — Governments are now able to issue Digital Passport Credentials directly to their citizens using Indicio Proven. These credentials align with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) specifications for Digital Travel Credentials (DTC-2) that are government issued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio developed and successfully deployed the world’s first Digital Passport Credential which involved travelers deriving a Verifiable Credential from the electronic chip in their passport and combining it with face-mapping, liveness check, and document validation. This Digital Passport Credential aligned with ICAO DTC-1 specifications and allowed for preauthorized travel and seamless border crossing. </p>
<p>By combining authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials, Indicio transformed portable digital identity and provided a simple way to mitigate the growing risks of biometric and AI-identity fraud. In recognition, Acuity Market Intelligence’s 2024 Prism Report described Indicio’s solution as “masterful.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio has now developed the next step in “government-grade” digital identity technology —&nbsp;Digital Passport Credentials that are issued directly by governments to accompany physical passports. These credentials follow the DTC-2 specifications outlined by ICAO.</p>
<p>A traveler is now able to carry a cryptographically secure digital passport on their smartphone, smartwatch, or fob linked to their existing physical passport. This can be instantly verified with simple software when crossing borders or presented anywhere across the travel ecosystem, including bookings, check-in, boarding, and hotel arrival.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to create digital identities that make life easier, safer, and more streamlined for everyone,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “We’ve&nbsp; shown how easy it is to create privacy-preserving, government-grade digital identity. We’ve shown the kinds of transformation this can achieve — the benefits to airlines, airports, and travelers that follow from having a fast and reliable way to streamline identity authentication. Now, we’re making it easy for governments to issue interoperable Digital Passport Credentials, secure borders, and welcome tourists.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is the world’s most advanced system for creating and deploying decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials in interoperable workflows. It allows users to select from SD-JWT VC, AnonCreds, and mdoc/mDL credential types, customizable schemas, mobile SDK for Android and IoS, a white-label digital wallet, field-leading mediation to handle issuance and verification at any scale, and a global ledger network to support deployments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Digital Passport Credentials, Indicio Proven’s Issuer software is easy to implement into existing systems and combine with biometric infrastructure and vendors. Verifier software is available in server or mobile configurations. Implementation is rapid, scale is simple, and compliance with data protection easy. Above all, Indicio Proven provides highly cost-effective ways to create both enterprise and public sector digital infrastructure that meets current and evolving business, consumer, and traveler needs.</p>

<p>As CMO of 1Kosmos, I’ve had a front-row seat to watch this company evolve over the past five years. When we founded the company, the cybersecurity world was still obsessed with building bigger walls around the perimeter. Password managers were the hot solution. Multi-factor authentication was cutting edge.</p>
<p>We saw something different coming. Identity would become the new perimeter. Passwords would become the liability, not the solution. And users would demand authentication that was both more secure and more convenient than anything available.</p>
<p>The market needed time to catch up to our vision. But it has, in a big way.</p>
 The Market Caught Up 
<p>Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/">$57 million Series B brings our total funding to over $72 million.</a> This isn’t just validation of our technology. It’s proof that the market has fundamentally shifted. Our recent <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-partnership-with-carahsoft-awarded-login-gov-next-generation-identity-proofing-blanket-purchase-agreement-bpa-worth-up-to-194-5m/">$194.5 million agreement for Login.gov</a> through Carahsoft shows that enterprise buyers are ready for what we’ve been building.</p>
<p>The timing makes sense. Every week brings news of another devastating breach, another ransomware attack, another company targeted by AI-generated deepfakes. Traditional passwords and even SMS-based two-factor authentication aren’t cutting it anymore. We’re seeing North Korean operatives deepfake their way into US companies through remote interviews and social engineers extract hundreds of millions in losses through the IT Service Desk.</p>
 What We Built 
<p>Instead of adding another layer to broken systems, we rebuilt the foundation with a platform that verifies you are who you say you are, every single time you log in. No more checking passwords – we verify actual identity.</p>
<p>We use biometrics tied to verified credentials on a private, permissioned ledger. The technology is sophisticated, but the user experience is intuitive: biometric authentication replaces passwords entirely. Users authenticate once with their identity, then access digital and in-person services seamlessly.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves – millions of daily users, zero successful account takeovers on our platform, and deployment times measured in hours instead of months. Our customers routinely tell us their users prefer our authentication to anything they’ve used before. Business efficiency improves.</p>
 The Certifications That Matter 
<p>We’re the only platform with full service NIST 800-63-3, FIDO2, and iBeta<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/compliance/"> certifications</a> – and that’s more than alphabet soup. These certifications prove our solution has the highest level of interoperability and works at the highest levels of government security requirements, which is why FedRAMP gave us High Authorization for national security applications.</p>
 Where We Go From Here 
<p>I’ve been in this industry long enough to know that technology alone doesn’t win markets, but when your technology solves a real problem that’s only getting worse and major enterprises are making significant commitments to deploy it, you know you’re onto something.</p>
<p>The identity verification market is exploding because every organization needs to know their users are who they claim to be – not just once during onboarding, but every time they log in.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, we bet that the future of cybersecurity would be identity-first, passwordless, and privacy-preserving. Today, that future is here, and we’re leading it.</p>
<p>Ready to see what passwordless looks like in practice?<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/contact/"> Let’s talk.</a></p>

			 Tokeny–recently acquired by leading global financial services provider Apex Group–is set to tokenize two of SkyBridge’s funds on the Avalanche blockchain network. 
<p>NEW YORK, 19th August 2025 – <a href="https://www.skybridge.com/">Skybridge Capital</a> today announced it will tokenize $300 million of its flagship hedge funds on the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche</a> blockchain network. This landmark initiative represents a collaboration with enterprise-grade tokenization leader <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a> and its parent company, <a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group Ltd.</a>, a global financial services provider servicing over $3.5 trillion in assets.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative<br>
investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors, and demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain can work together to create smarter, more efficient investment solutions.  Anthony ScaramucciFounder &amp; CEO of SkyBridge Capital    
	 
		 
			<p>A former Goldman Sachs executive and White House Communications Director, Scaramucci has long been a prominent voice in alternatives and digital assets, with deep networks across pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SkyBridge will tokenize its Digital Macro Master Fund Ltd and Legion Strategies Ltd leveraging the proven ERC-3643 standard with operational infrastructure delivered through Apex Group’s Digital 3.0 platform. The platform offers a single-source solution for the entire investment lifecycle, enabling institutional clients to seamlessly transition their funds to blockchain-based rails with integrated capabilities for creation, issuance, administration, and distribution.</p>

		 
	 
    This milestone shows how Apex Group and Tokeny are breaking down the operational and technology barriers that have historically slowed institutional tokenization. SkyBridge’s tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it’s happening.  Daniel CoheurGlobal Head of Digital Assets at Apex Group and Co-Founder of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Avalanche was selected for its institutional-grade architecture, offering the transaction speed and near-instant finality required for large-scale tokenization. As a leading blockchain for real-world assets (RWAs), Avalanche’s rapidly expanding institutional ecosystem already hosts regulated offerings in tokenized money market funds, private credit, and more. The network’s EVM compatibility and scalability make it an ideal foundation for bringing traditional assets on chain to unlock new distribution channels, utility, and blockchain-naive products and services.</p>

		 
	 
    Our work with Tokeny, Apex Group, and SkyBridge marks a pivotal moment for institutional adoption and serves as a powerful market signal that tokenization has entered the mainstream. SkyBridge Capital’s leadership and network within the allocator community makes this a strong validation of Avalanche's position as the premier platform for connecting capital.  John WuPresident of Ava Labs.    
	 
		 
			<p>This collaboration brings together next-generation technology, enterprise-grade infrastructure, and institutional credibility, a critical combination for accelerating the adoption of RWAs across hedge funds, private credit, and multi-strategy vehicles.</p>

<p>If you’ve wondered what working group chair skills actually matter, I have news for you: you don’t need to be a spec-writing wizard to be effective.</p>



<p>I do get it, though. I chair working groups, and I still can’t read specs the way implementers do. Half the time I open a technical specification, my eyes glaze over after the abstract. I couldn’t code myself out of a wet paper bag. (Unless that wet paper bag happens to include m4 and sendmail rulesets. Those, I can do.)</p>



<p>That said, if you take nothing else away from this post, take this and embed it in your brain: you don’t have to be a spec-writing wizard to be an effective contributor, or even to chair a working group.</p>



<p>In fact, some of the most valuable skills in standards work have nothing to do with writing code.</p>

 What a chair actually does (and doesn’t do) 



<p>There’s a misconception that working group chairs must be the ultimate subject-matter experts, the kind of person who can answer any question off the cuff. I used to believe that too. *buzzer sound* Wrong, try again! The job is about facilitation and neutrality, not encyclopedic knowledge.</p>



<p>A good chair brings the right working group chair skills to the table:</p>



 
 Manages time, the agenda, and the meeting queue. 



 Keeps the room neutral and separates their “chair hat” from their personal opinions. 



 Tests for consensus and documents objections. 



 Guides the group back to its charter when things start to sprawl. 
 



<p>What a chair doesn’t do:</p>



 
 Decide the technical design. 



 “Win” arguments on the mic. 



 Gatekeep new contributors. 
 



<p>Yes, a baseline of knowledge helps, mainly to keep the group on track and ask the right questions. But if you’re the loudest voice in the room or the person with the most opinions? That’s a red flag.</p>



 The Madrid moment 



<p>This post was inspired by a moment at the recent IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>I was sitting in a session (not one I was running) feeling wildly inadequate. The chair of that meeting seemed to know everything: answering questions without pause, bouncing ideas around, and generally radiating expertise. I thought, I can’t do that. I’ll never be that person.</p>



<p>Later, I mentioned my self-doubt to a friend who’s been in standards work since Gandalf was a baby (i.e., a very long time). They said something that stuck:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“That kind of deep subject-matter expertise isn’t what makes a good chair. The job is to be neutral, help the group come to consensus, and keep the process fair. If you’re too invested in the outcome, you can’t do that well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And they were right. In a session I chaired the next day, I reminded myself of that. Instead of getting pulled into the details, I paused, restated the questions we were debating, and asked for commitments to review from experts in the room. We left the meeting with clear decisions and action owners. Go, team!</p>



<p>No wizard-level technical knowledge required.</p>



 Where non‑coders shine 



<p>Even if you’re not a chair, these are the same skills that make you a great contributor and help you develop working group chair skills if you want to take that step later. Non‑coders are often the ones who:</p>



 
 Turn pain points into crisp user stories. “We need X because Y breaks if we don’t.” 



 Write readable summaries for product managers, lawyers, and execs. 



 Triage issues on GitHub—label them, close duplicates, line up proposals for meetings. 



 Spot interoperability gaps. Help set up test plans, track what passes/fails, and document blockers. 



 Herd the cats. Draft pre-reads, take notes, and make sure decisions actually get written down. 
 



<p>These are the unglamorous but critical pieces that keep work moving forward. Without them, groups stall, meetings get repetitive, and good ideas die in the noise. Groups well and truly need someone brave enough to ask “stupid” questions (that are never actually stupid) about how it all works.</p>



 How to start if you’re “not technical enough” 



<p>If you want to get involved but don’t know where to start, try this:</p>



 
 Read the charter of the group and two or three recent GitHub issues. 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list with a sentence about what you can help with (e.g., “I’m a PM and can help with use cases or meeting notes”). 



 Volunteer once. Scribe a meeting, write a summary, or draft a use-case doc. 



 Ask the chairs: “What would unblock you this week that doesn’t require coding?” 



 Shadow a consensus call and notice how the chair phrases questions and records outcomes. 
 



<p>These small steps get you known as someone who adds value quickly. That reputation goes a long way.</p>



 For managers: send the right people 



<p>If you lead a team, the worst thing you can do is assume only senior engineers belong in standards groups. You should be sending:</p>



 
 PMs, solution architects, and analysts. 



 Tech writers who can make decisions and docs accessible. 



 Support or operations leads who know what customers actually need. 
 



<p>Give them specific assignments: draft use cases, clean up issues, track interop progress. And measure their impact by outcomes that matter: fewer rehashed meetings, clearer issues, faster consensus.</p>



 Common traps (and how to avoid them) 



<p>Even experienced chairs and contributors stumble into these:</p>



 
 Wearing the company hat too heavily. Remember: your job is to move the group’s work forward. 



 Turning meetings into tutorials. Save deep dives for dedicated docs or issues. 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction. Ask for explicit “can live with it” signals from the room. 



 Treating silence as consent. It usually isn’t. 
 



<p>A simple chair’s checklist helps: agenda posted in advance (see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/">Important Dates</a> page for IETF meetings) → pre‑reads linked → scribe/timekeeper assigned → decisions written down → minutes posted within 48 hours.</p>



 Why this matters 



<p>Standards work touches every part of the identity world—federation, digital credentials, browsers, payments. These decisions shape products and policies your teams will live with for years. I mentioned this a while back in <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/11/standards-versus-reality/">Standards Versus Reality</a> with how even well‑intentioned technical choices can clash with deployment realities, which is why diverse voices are so important.</p>



<p>But the process isn’t self-sustaining. If only engineers and spec authors show up, important perspectives get lost. And that hurts interoperability, usability, and deployment.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to develop strong working group chair skills. You need to listen, ask questions, and help the group get to a decision.</p>



 Your turn 



<p>If you’ve thought, standards aren’t for me, try showing up once. Scribe a meeting. Draft a use-case doc. Or if you lead a team, send someone who can listen, write, and keep things moving.</p>

 Introduction 



<p>[00:00:26] Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29] Hi everyone, and welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>[00:00:33] Today I want to talk about something I hear often from people who are curious about standards work but never take the leap to participate.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] It’s that feeling of “I’m not technical enough. Standards are for engineers, so I’ll just sit this one out.”</p>



<p>[00:00:50] If that’s you, this episode is for you.</p>



<p>[00:00:54] The truth is, standards work is not just for coders. Some of the most important roles in working groups don’t involve writing a single line of code.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Standards Work Isn’t Just for Engineers 



<p>[00:01:04] I want to pull back the curtain on my own experience as a working group chair. I’ll share:</p>



 
 The skills that actually make standards work successful 



 How non-coders can contribute 



 How to build the confidence to jump in 
 



<p>[00:01:24] Here’s my confession: I chair groups in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>



<p>[00:01:33] But if you handed me a technical specification to implement — I couldn’t do it. I can’t code my way out of a wet paper bag.</p>



<p>[00:01:42] I can read the text of a specification.<br>[00:01:48] I can follow the arguments and track design decisions.<br>[00:01:53] But I don’t read specs like implementers do.</p>



<p>And that’s okay. Because being a chair is not about being the ultimate expert — it’s about facilitating process, guiding discussion, and keeping the group focused.</p>



 



 *** 



 What a Working Group Chair Actually Does 



<p>[00:02:16] So what does a chair really do?</p>



<p>[00:02:24] On a good day, you’re:</p>



 
 Setting the agenda and keeping discussions on track 



 Managing the queue so everyone knows when it’s their turn 



 Listening carefully and testing for consensus 



 Making sure objections are heard and documented 



 Guiding the group back to its agreed charter 
 



<p>[00:03:06] Importantly, chairs do not decide technical design. They don’t win arguments or gatekeep contributors.</p>



<p>[00:03:14] Yes, technical knowledge helps — but being the loudest, most opinionated person in the room? That’s a liability for a chair.</p>



 



 *** 



 Lessons from Experience 



<p>[00:03:30] This all came to mind recently at an IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>[00:03:36] I was sitting in a session I wasn’t chairing and felt completely inadequate. The chair was brilliant — answering every question instantly and recalling years of history.</p>



<p>[00:04:06] I shared my self-doubt with a long-time standards veteran. Their advice stuck: A good chair isn’t about deep expertise. It’s about neutrality and guiding consensus.</p>



<p>[00:04:28] The very next day, while chairing my own session, I leaned on that advice. Instead of diving into debate, I paused, restated the question, and asked the group to continue the discussion asynchronously.</p>



<p>[00:05:09] The result? We left the room with clear decisions and owners for next steps.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Non-Coders Are Essential 



<p>[00:05:19] Here’s the truth: non-coders bring incredible value to standards development.</p>



<p>[00:05:31] Examples include:</p>



 
 Turning pain points into crisp user stories 



 Writing clear summaries for product managers, executives, and legal teams 



 Triage work: labeling GitHub issues, closing duplicates, organizing proposals 



 Spotting interoperability gaps between specifications 



 Setting up test plans and documenting blockers 



 “Herding cats” by taking notes and tracking decisions 
 



<p>[00:06:44] None of these require writing code — but all are vital to progress.</p>



 



 *** 



 How to Get Started in Standards Work 



<p>[00:06:58] If you’re wondering where to begin, here are practical steps:</p>



 
 Read the group’s charter and skim recent issues to understand scope 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list — even a short message offering to scribe is welcome 



 Ask the chairs directly what one thing you could do this week to help 



 Observe consensus calls to learn how experienced chairs guide groups 
 



<p>[00:08:20] These small steps build confidence and help you learn core chairing skills: listening, documenting, and facilitating decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Advice for Managers 



<p>[00:08:31] If you lead a team, don’t assume only senior engineers should join standards groups.</p>



<p>Send your:</p>



 
 Product managers 



 Solution architects 



 Analysts 



 Technical writers 
 



<p>[00:08:56] Give them specific assignments like drafting use cases, cleaning up issues, or tracking interoperability progress. Measure outcomes such as:</p>



 
 Fewer rehash meetings 



 Closed issues and pull requests 



 Documented progress 
 



<p>[00:09:23] This builds institutional knowledge in your organization while helping the group succeed.</p>



 



 *** 



 Common Traps to Avoid 



<p>[00:09:31] Even experienced chairs fall into these traps:</p>



 
 Wearing your company hat too heavily 



 Turning meetings into tutorials that eat time 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction instead of true consensus 



 Treating silence as consent instead of seeking explicit signals 
 



<p>[00:11:04] A simple checklist can help avoid these pitfalls:</p>



 
 Post agendas in advance 



 Share pre-reads 



 Assign a scribe and timekeeper 
 



<p>It’s basic, but it works.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:11:30] Standards work touches every part of digital identity — from federation to credentials, browsers to payments.</p>



<p>[00:11:46] But if only engineers show up, critical perspectives are lost. That hurts usability, interoperability, and adoption.</p>



<p>[00:11:57] You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to contribute. You just need to listen, ask questions, and help the group reach decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Final Thoughts 



<p>[00:12:10] If you’ve thought “standards development isn’t for me,” I challenge you to reconsider.</p>



<p>Show up once.<br>Scribe a meeting.<br>Draft a use case.<br>Or, if you lead a team, send someone who can write, listen, and help keep things moving.</p>



<p>[00:12:26] These are the skills that keep standards work healthy.</p>



<p>[00:12:30] So ask yourself: What non-coding skill could you bring into a working group this month?</p>



<p>[00:12:48] Thank you for listening to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>

Trust Crisis in Stablecoins<p>The biggest challenge in scaling stablecoin payments isn’t speed. It’s&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Stablecoins are everywhere. They’re powering remittances, cross-border commerce, crypto payroll, and even merchant checkout systems. From Stripe to Shopify to major exchanges, stablecoin adoption is accelerating.</p><p>But while blockchains have solved the problem of speed and cost, they’ve quietly ignored the biggest bottleneck in real-world use: identity.</p><p>If stablecoins are going to scale globally, across regions, merchants and users, they need more than fast rails. They need a decentralized identity&nbsp;layer.</p> The Problem With Stablecoin Compliance Today <p>Most stable coins weren’t built with compliance in mind. And now that they’re being used in payments, cracks are&nbsp;showing.</p>  Merchants don’t know who they’re accepting money&nbsp;from  Platforms are duct-taping KYC providers into&nbsp;apps  Users go through verification again and&nbsp;again  There’s no standard for crypto KYC that works across wallets, bridges, and&nbsp;dApps  <p>The result? A fragile trust layer built on centralized data silos and repetitive identity checks. The exact same problems crypto was supposed to&nbsp;solve.</p> Stablecoin Payments Need Verifiable Identity, Not Just&nbsp;Wallets. <p>Verifiable Identity is the missing layer in the stablecoin stack.</p><p>As governments push for stablecoin regulation such as MiCA in the EU and the GENIUS Act in the US, platforms are scrambling to become compliant.</p><p>But compliance doesn’t have to mean surveillance.</p><p>With decentralized identity, users can hold their own credentials, verify once, and move between apps and services without repeating KYC. This is the foundation for self-sovereign identity, where users control their data and platforms remain compliant without storing sensitive information.</p> What’s Needed: A Portable, Privacy-First Trust&nbsp;Layer <p>Stablecoin adoption at scale will only happen if three things become possible:</p>  Users prove who they are without exposing everything  Merchants can verify transactions without handling private&nbsp;data  Developers can plug into identity infrastructure that works cross-chain  <p>That’s what Ontology is building. A modular identity and privacy framework that makes stablecoin payments secure, compliant, and user-controlled.</p> Ontology: The Identity Infrastructure for Stablecoin Adoption <p>Unlike issuers, Ontology isn’t creating another dollar-pegged token. We’re building the trust infrastructure that makes stablecoins usable in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here’s what that looks&nbsp;like:</p>  DID-based KYC that users&nbsp;control  Zero Knowledge Proofs to verify facts without revealing data  Reusable identity credentials for wallets, dApps, and fiat&nbsp;on-ramps  Cross-border compliance without centralized trust  <p>This infrastructure goes beyond payments. The next era of Web3 relies on a rebuilding of the crypto identity infrastructure.</p> The Future of Stablecoin Compliance is User-Controlled <p>If stablecoins want to compete with traditional infrastructure, they can’t just be faster. They have to be trusted. And that trust can’t be outsourced to centralized APIs or third party data&nbsp;silos.</p><p>It has to be built into the protocol layer and embedded in how users verify themselves, how dApps authorize transactions, and how compliance gets done in a decentralized world.</p><p>Speed is solved. Identity isn’t. Ontology is solving&nbsp;it.</p> About Ontology <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> is a high-performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data infrastructure. Built to power the next generation of Web3 applications, Ontology provides developers with the tools to build secure, privacy-preserving systems through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials.

<p>Capital markets firms face unique AML challenges across jurisdictions due to their cross-border activity and high-risk products. This article outlines key KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in the U.S., UK, EU, and other financial centre – and how iComply helps automate compliance workflows with speed and precision.</p>
 
 Global capital markets are fast, fluid, and increasingly regulated. Broker-dealers, custodians, exchanges, and asset managers operate across jurisdictions where expectations for AML, sanctions screening, and beneficial ownership verification continue to grow. 
<p>In high-risk sectors like trading, custody, private placements, and tokenization, regulators want more than just client onboarding—they expect continuous monitoring, automated escalation, and clear audit trails.</p>
 
 AML Frameworks Shaping the Sector 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: SEC, FINRA, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD Rule, ongoing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, sanctions screening (OFAC) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: CDD/EDD, transaction monitoring, PEP screening, audit logs, and AML controls under MLR 2017 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: ESMA, local NCAs 
 Requirements: 6AMLD, MiCA (for tokenized assets), UBO verification, and harmonized AML rules under AMLA (in progress) 
 
 Switzerland &amp; Luxembourg 
 
 Regulators: FINMA, CSSF 
 Requirements: KYC/AML for securities and fund transactions, strong data protection, and beneficial ownership transparency 
 
 
 Key Compliance Tasks 
<p>Capital markets participants must:</p>
 
 Verify legal entities and individuals across onboarding and lifecycle events 
 Monitor transactions for anomalies or regulatory breaches 
 Screen all clients against sanctions, PEP, and adverse media lists 
 Capture beneficial ownership for institutional and private placements 
 Log decisions and escalate based on internal risk policies 
 
 
 Industry-Specific Challenges 
<p>1. Cross-border account flows → Require localized data handling and multilingual tools</p>
<p>2. Institutional onboarding → Often slow due to document-heavy workflows and complex UBO structures</p>
<p>3. Layered due diligence → Multiple parties, custodians, and intermediaries complicate audit trails</p>
<p>4. Tokenized and digital assets → Face rapidly evolving rules under MiCA, AMLD, and SEC guidance</p>
 
 How iComply Accelerates AML for Capital Markets 
<p>iComply provides a secure, modular platform that streamlines compliance from onboarding to monitoring:</p>
 1. KYB + UBO Automation 
 
 Validate entities using public and commercial registries 
 Map complex ownership and nominee structures 
 Generate audit-ready UBO reports 
 
 2. Edge-Based Identity Verification 
 
 Fast, private KYC flows for individuals across global jurisdictions 
 On-device processing for secure and compliant identity checks 
 
 3. Transaction Monitoring (KYT) 
 
 Score trades and transactions by geography, frequency, value, and behavioural anomalies 
 Custom rules for escalations and risk segmentation 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Combine onboarding, AML, and due diligence into a unified audit trail 
 Assign reviews, manage escalations, and export regulatory reports 
 
 5. Flexible Deployment 
 
 On-premise, private cloud, or hybrid environments 
 Data localization and language support for global operations 
 
 
 Case Insight: Cross-Border Broker-Dealer 
<p>A multinational brokerage integrated iComply across its onboarding and compliance ops. Key results:</p>
 
 Cut entity onboarding time by 60% 
 Streamlined UBO discovery for global accounts 
 Improved internal SAR processing and response tracking 
 
 
 The Takeaway 
<p>Capital markets compliance is high-stakes and high-volume. Firms that embrace AML automation can:</p>
 
 Reduce onboarding friction 
 Catch risk signals faster 
 Satisfy multi-jurisdictional requirements from day one 
 
<p>Talk to iComply today to learn how we help capital markets firms eliminate compliance bottlenecks and stay ahead of global regulations.</p>

Will we meet the Q3 deadline? <p>“Hell yeah, we are.” The team is on track for Q3, with strong progress. No specific date is provided — as with all digital products, launch occurs when everything is&nbsp;ready.</p><p>The public mainnet is now live! Please check the full article for more details: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4">https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4</a></p><p>물론입니다. 팀은 3분기 목표를 향해 순조롭게 진행 중입니다. 다만 구체적인 날짜는 공개하지 않았습니다. 모든 디지털 제품과 마찬가지로, 준비가 완벽히 끝났을 때 출시하기&nbsp;위함입니다.</p><p>퍼블릭 메인넷이 공식 런칭됐습니다! 자세한 내용은 전체 공지를 확인해 주세요: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4">https://medium.com/aergo/house-party-protocol-public-mainnet-is-live-29be91574da4</a></p> 3. Why don’t we give a specific schedule/date? <p>Digital releases don’t require fixed launch dates like physical products (e.g., movies, retail). Avoids pressure that can lead to mistakes, citing the Columbia Shuttle disaster as an example of deadline-driven risk. Launch will be announced when ready, ensuring fairness and transparency to all participants simultaneously.</p><p>출시 일자는 유연하게 설정하여 충분히 준비가 완료된 후에 진행하는 것이 무엇보다 중요합니다. NASA 콜롬비아호 사고 역시 일정 압박이 한 원인이 된 사례로 자주 언급됩니다. HPP는 모든 준비가 철저히 마무리된 시점에, 모든 참여자에게 공정하고 투명하게 동시에 출시 사실을 알리는 방식으로&nbsp;진행됩니다.</p> 4. Are we going to do buybacks? <p>Buybacks are usually done by companies with revenue or exchanges tied to trading volume. HPP is performing strongly compared to the CMC100, even in a tough&nbsp;market.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Buybacks are more of a market signal than a sustainable growth strategy. They are often tied to short-term campaigns or exchange-driven burn mechanisms, which can create only temporary price support without strengthening the fundamentals. The reality is that their impact tends to be limited and short-lived, making them less effective for long-term ecosystem growth. Our approach is different. We aim to ensure that value stems from genuine fundamentals and usage, rather than from market engineering.</p><p>바이백은 보통 매출을 내는 기업이나 거래량과 연결된 거래소에서 진행합니다. HPP는 어려운 시장 환경 속에서도 CMC100 대비 강한 성과를 내고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>바이백은 장기적 성장 전략보다는 시장에 “신호”를 주는 성격이 강합니다. 단기 캠페인이나 거래소 주도의 소각 메커니즘과 연결되는 경우가 많으며, 일시적인 가격 지지 효과를 내지만 근본적인 가치 강화에는 기여하지 못합니다. 즉, 효과는 제한적이고 단명하는 경우가 대부분입니다. HPP의 접근 방식은 다릅니다. 우리는 인위적인 시장 개입이 아니라, 토큰의 실제 사용성·펀더멘털·생태계 확장을 통해 지속적인 가치를 만들어가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> 5. Why doesn’t HPP pump with other&nbsp;tokens? <p>HPP has outperformed the CMC100 over 12 months and the past 5 months. Movement doesn’t always align with BTC/ETH, which are influenced by ETFs and macro&nbsp;flows.</p><p>HPP는 지난 12개월과 최근 5개월 동안 CMC100보다 우수한 성과를 보여왔습니다. 단, 움직임이 항상 BTC/ETH와 일치하지는 않습니다. BTC와 ETH는 ETF나 거시경제 자금 흐름 등 외부 요인에 더 큰 영향을&nbsp;받습니다.</p> 6. What are cryptocurrency investment agents (on the roadmap)? <p>The specific product details are not disclosed yet. However, the vision and target direction have already been introduced under ArenAI. ArenAI will serve as an intelligent, AI-driven trading and asset management layer, enabling users to interact with DeFi and exchange platforms through natural language, agent automation, and portfolio optimization.</p><p>For more background and context, please refer to our previous article on ArenAI, which outlines the concept and future potential of this product: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p><p>구체적인 제품 내용은 아직 공개되지 않았습니다. 하지만 방향성은 이미 ArenAI를 통해 제시되었습니다. ArenAI는 AI 기반의 지능형 자산 관리 및 트레이딩 레이어로, 사용자들이 자연어 인터페이스, 자동화된 에이전트, 포트폴리오 최적화를 통해 DeFi 및 거래소와 상호작용할 수 있도록&nbsp;설계됩니다.</p><p>자세한 내용은 ArenAI에 관한 이전 아티클을 참고해 주세요: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p> 7. Updates on Upleat collaboration and stablecoin? <p>Aergo(HPP) provides tech infrastructure to Blocko and enterprise clients. No direct connection to the referenced stablecoin announcement.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Stablecoins are more than just blockchain-based technology. They interface directly with monetary policy tools, such as M1 (currency in circulation plus demand deposits) and M2, meaning their issuance may affect the real-world money supply and economic dynamics. That is why any project launching a stablecoin without operating within the bounds of formal governmental frameworks, such as Korea’s K-BTF (Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework), runs the risk of being inconsequential. These frameworks are crucial for establishing trust, gaining legal recognition, and integrating with national payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Without adherence to such regulatory and policy frameworks, a stablecoin project may technically function, but it will lack the necessary legitimacy, operational resilience, and broader institutional acceptance. To be meaningful, stablecoins must not only run on code but also align with economic infrastructure and compliance standards.</p><p>Aergo(HPP)는 Blocko와 엔터프라이즈 클라이언트들에게 기술 인프라를 제공합니다. 하지만 이번에 언급된 스테이블코인 발표와 직접적인 연결은&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>스테이블코인은 단순한 블록체인 기술이 아니라 통화정책 도구(M1, M2 등)와 직접 연결됩니다. 즉, 발행은 실제 화폐 공급과 경제 역학에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 한국의 K-BTF(Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework) 같은 정부 주도의 제도적 틀 안에서 운영되지 않는 스테이블코인 프로젝트는 실질적 의미가 크게 제한될 수밖에&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>이러한 제도적·정책적 프레임워크는 신뢰 확보, 법적 인정, 국가 결제 시스템과의 통합을 위해 반드시 필요합니다. 이런 기반이 없다면 스테이블코인은 기술적으로는 작동할 수 있어도 제도적 정당성, 운영 회복력, 기관 차원의 수용성을 확보하지 못합니다. 진정한 의미의 스테이블코인은 코드만으로 존재하는 것이 아니라, 경제 인프라와 규제 준수 기준에 맞추어야&nbsp;합니다.</p> Closing <p>The session closed with reminders that no universal solution exists to “make a token pump.” The team continues to deliver milestones on time, with the imminent launch of the Public&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>이번 세션은 “토큰 가격을 펌핑시킬 수 있는 보편적 해법은 없다”는 점을 다시 확인하며 마무리되었습니다. 팀은 퍼블릭 메인넷을 비롯한 주요 마일스톤을 계획대로 달성해나가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-21-public-mainnet-buybacks-and-arenai-4d71e7046c14">[Aergo Talks #21] Public Mainnet, buybacks, and ArenAI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

You need legal agreements.  You need alignment between IT teams on both sides.  And you need to repeat the process for every new identity provider.  <p>That works if you're collaborating with a few long-term vendors. But it completely breaks down when you’re dealing with hundreds of external users—freelancers, contractors, suppliers, or ecosystem partners—who need access today, not after a three-week firewall security review.</p>

Benefits for Everyday&nbsp;Users   One wallet, more chains — Manage your Concordium accounts alongside your existing&nbsp;assets  Privacy without compromise — Verified identity stays private unless disclosure is&nbsp;required  Easy setup — Create an account in just a few&nbsp;taps  Earn rewards — Delegate your CCD and participate in the&nbsp;network   5. Benefits for Developers   SDK-ready — The Safe Vault SDK now supports Concordium, so you can integrate CCD transactions and account creation directly into your&nbsp;apps  Identity assurance — Build dApps that require verifiable users without handling KYC data&nbsp;yourself  Cross-chain experience — Tap into Safle’s multi-chain capabilities while leveraging Concordium’s compliance-first architecture   6. How to Get&nbsp;Started <p>For users:</p>  Update your Safle Wallet on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/safle-web3-wallet/id6444435472">iOS</a> or&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safle">Android</a>  Open the app and select Create Concordium Account  Start sending, receiving, and delegating CCD instantly  <p>For developers:</p>  Request the updated Safle Vault SDK documentation <a>here</a>  Integrate Concordium account creation and CCD transfers into your&nbsp;app  Build privacy-first, compliance-ready Web3 experiences   Final Word <p>This isn’t just another chain integration it’s a step toward a Web3 where privacy and accountability can co-exist.</p><p>With Concordium inside Safle, you can trust your wallet to keep you secure, compliant, and ready for whatever the decentralized future&nbsp;holds.</p><p>Update your Safle Wallet today and start exploring Concordium.</p><p>Best,</p><p>Team Safle&nbsp;✨</p>

 Lessons from building YourGPT with a small team and a&nbsp;vision. Back in 2023 it was just us (Rohit and Sahil) starting.<p>When we started in 2023, our mission was simple: help businesses build with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Our first product was a fine-tuning tool for businesses to customise AI models. At the time, fine-tuning was resource-heavy &amp; challenging.</p><p>Fine-tuning required preparing datasets (and even synthetic data generation was not as highly feasible as today), running heavy compute, and testing multiple iterations to avoid issues like overfitting or underfitting. In practice, this meant months of work and high costs—something only big tech firms could&nbsp;manage.</p><p>We saw this gap. Instead of making everyone rebuild models, we introduced advanced RAG-based AI chatbots that could train on a company’s own data while using existing models. RAG allowed companies to use powerful existing models while still grounding answers in their own data—giving them customisation without the cost of fine-tuning.</p><p>As we worked with more customers it became clear that most businesses did not want multiple tools. They wanted one solution that could handle conversations, support teams, help them grow, and actually grow with&nbsp;them.</p><p>We realised many teams face the same challenge: managing multiple disconnected systems slows them down. We combined our fine-tuning capabilities with the YourGPT Chatbot for enterprise users who still need customised models, while also building a single platform for conversations, training, and automation so teams no longer have to juggle separate&nbsp;tools.</p><p>We are a small, fast-moving team bootstrapped from day one. We learn by shipping, watching, and listening. Over time every feature we built, from the action-oriented Copilots builder to AI Agents to AI Studio, Helpdesk, Voice Agents was brought together in one product:&nbsp;<a href="https://yourgpt.ai">YourGPT</a>.</p><p>It’s been a pleasure building our product from Mohali,&nbsp;India.</p>Mohali, where our story&nbsp;began<p>With a lean, customer-focused team, we help businesses unlock value and maximize innovation. One big lesson: hire for mindset.

 Unlocking Africa’s Digital Identity and Web3&nbsp;Future <p>Africa is standing on the brink of a digital revolution. With a youthful population, rising smartphone adoption, and a fast growing blockchain ecosystem, the continent is well positioned to leapfrog traditional systems into the decentralized future. Yet, one major challenge persists: trust, identity, and&nbsp;access.</p> This is where Ontology Network (ONT) steps&nbsp;in. <p>Ontology is a high-performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity (DID) and data management solutions. Unlike many blockchains that focus only on transactions, Ontology is designed to empower individuals and businesses with ownership and control over their data, all while enabling trust across&nbsp;borders.</p> Why the Ontology Network is important for&nbsp;Africa <p>1. Solving the Digital Identity&nbsp;Gap</p><p>Across Africa, millions remain unbanked or underserved due to the lack of reliable identity systems. Traditional ID infrastructures are often fragmented, slow, or inaccessible in rural areas. Ontology’s ONT ID solution provides a blockchain based identity that is secure, verifiable, and user controlled.</p><p>This means a young entrepreneur in Nigeria, a farmer in Kenya, or a freelancer in Ghana can create a trusted digital identity without relying on centralized institutions. With ONT ID, they can access banking, healthcare, education, and even global job opportunities.</p><p>2. Empowering Financial Inclusion</p><p>Blockchain has long been seen as a gateway to financial freedom in Africa. Ontology takes this further by enabling cross-border payments and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications with lower costs and faster processing compared to traditional systems.</p><p>By combining digital identity with financial tools, Ontology makes it easier for Africans to build credit histories, secure micro-loans, and engage with the global digital economy without being excluded by legacy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>3. Data Ownership in the Web3&nbsp;Era</p><p>In the Web2 world, users give up their data for free while tech giants profit. Ontology flips this model. With its self sovereign data framework, Africans can own, control, and monetize their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Imagine a student in South Africa who shares academic records with universities abroad, or a healthcare worker in Uganda who securely exchanges medical credentials across borders all on their own terms, without third party exploitation.</p><p>4. Building Trust in Governance and&nbsp;Trade</p><p>Trust remains a key challenge in African governance, business, and cross border trade. Ontology’s blockchain infrastructure makes it possible to verify supply chains, authenticate documents, and increase transparency in governance.</p><p>For example, farmers can prove the authenticity of their produce in export markets, while governments can use tamper-proof systems to reduce fraud and corruption.</p><p>5. A Bridge Between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3</p><p>Ontology is not just about the future it is building bridges to the present. Its technology integrates easily with existing systems, meaning African startups, SMEs, and governments can adopt Web3 without completely abandoning current tools. This makes the transition smoother, faster, and more inclusive.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Africa’s future is digital, and the Ontology Network provides the infrastructure to make that future more inclusive, trustworthy, and empowering. By addressing challenges like identity, financial exclusion, data ownership, and trust, Ontology positions itself as a game changer for the continent’s growth in the Web3&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-network-e44b9583b40c">THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>As AML enforcement expands globally, community banks must modernize their compliance operations to remain efficient, accurate, and audit-ready. This article outlines KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in key jurisdictions—and shows how iComply helps automate up to 90% of the compliance workload.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community banks play a crucial role in local economies, offering relationship-based financial services that foster small business growth and household stability. But in 2025, global AML regulators are raising the bar—and community banks, no matter how small, are expected to meet the same compliance standards as national institutions.</p>
<p>Whether you operate in the U.S., UK, Canada, or Australia, your bank must now prove it can detect, deter, and report financial crime with the same rigour as the biggest players.</p>
 Global AML Standards for Community Banks 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD Rule, BOI reporting (Corporate Transparency Act), SARs, sanctions screening (OFAC), and ongoing AML program testing 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: FCA, PRA 
 Requirements: Customer due diligence (CDD), enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk clients, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and PEP/sanctions screening 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Identity verification, beneficial ownership discovery, recordkeeping, and mandatory STR reporting. Provincial oversight may add regional layers. 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF program, member verification, source of funds checks, transaction monitoring, and ongoing risk assessments 
 
 
 What Community Banks Must Implement 
 
 KYB for Business Accounts: Verify legal status, beneficial owners, and operating legitimacy 
 KYC for Individuals: Confirm identity, address, and biometric match if applicable 
 KYT: Monitor transactions for structuring, velocity, or sanctioned entities 
 AML: Risk-based programs, SAR/STR filing, audit trails, staff training 
 
 
 The Pain Points 
<p>1. Manual Compliance Workflows → Slows onboarding, increases error rates</p>
<p>2. Fragmented Vendor Stack → No single view of client risk or activity</p>
<p>3. Limited IT and Compliance Staff → Resource constraints delay implementation of controls</p>
<p>4. Regulatory Complexity → Different reporting formats, rules, and thresholds by country or region</p>
 
 iComply: Built for Community Banking 
<p>iComply enables community banks to meet modern AML obligations with a single, modular platform that integrates with your core systems and scales to your needs.</p>
 1. Seamless KYB + KYC 
 
 Natural person and business verification 
 Real-time UBO discovery and registry validation 
 Edge-based identity checks (data processed locally on device) 
 
 2. Automated KYT and Risk Monitoring 
 
 Transaction scoring based on behaviour, geography, and value 
 Alerts for unusual activity, layering, or sanctioned exposure 
 Dynamic refresh cycles for high-risk accounts 
 
 3. Case Management and Reporting 
 
 Built-in workflows for escalation, review, and SAR filing 
 Preformatted exports for U.S. (FinCEN), UK (FCA), Canada (FINTRAC), Australia (AUSTRAC) 
 Timestamped audit logs for every action taken 
 
 4. Compliance Without Complexity 
 
 No-code policy configuration 
 White-labeled portals for customer onboarding 
 Multilingual and localization support across jurisdictions 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Bottom Line 
<p>AML compliance doesn’t need to be a burden. Community banks that automate early gain:</p>
 
 Faster customer onboarding 
 Reduced regulatory risk 
 Scalable operations without hiring more compliance staff 
 
<p>Let iComply show you how to automate up to 90% of AML tasks—so your team can focus on serving your community, not battling spreadsheets.</p>

 The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has long been a leader in setting cybersecurity standards for the financial services and insurance sectors. Under 23 NYCRR Part 500, regulated entities are required to implement a comprehensive cybersecurity program that addresses governance, access controls, incident response, and ongoing risk management.

<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has long been a leader in setting cybersecurity standards for the financial services and insurance sectors. Under 23 NYCRR Part 500, regulated entities are required to implement a comprehensive cybersecurity program that addresses governance, access controls, incident response, and ongoing risk management.</p>  
<p>As we move through 2025, NYDFS has signaled that enforcement is accelerating. The recent $2 million settlement with Healthplex, Inc., announced on August 14, 2025, underscores the steep cost of falling short. This case serves as a timely reminder for all covered entities: compliance is not a once-a-year paperwork exercise; it is a continuous obligation with real financial stakes.</p> 
 What you need to know about NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulations  
<p>Part 500 applies to most banks, insurers, and financial service providers operating in New York. At its core, the regulation mandates that each covered entity maintain a written cybersecurity policy approved by the board, conduct periodic risk assessments, limit access to sensitive systems and data, and implement robust security measures such as phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p> 
<p>Equally important is the incident reporting requirement, which mandates that breaches meeting certain criteria must be reported to NYDFS within 72 hours of determination. In addition, every covered entity must file an annual certification of compliance, or acknowledgment of noncompliance, by April 15 each year.</p> 
 What are the Key Requirements &amp; Upcoming Deadlines?  
<p>In 2025, several deadlines and requirements should be top-of-mind for compliance teams. The annual compliance certification for the 2024 calendar year must be submitted by April 15, 2025. Before that filing, organizations must ensure their risk assessment is current and documented.</p> 
<p>MFA enforcement is also a major focus for NYDFS this year. Covered entities are expected to have phishing-resistant MFA in place not only for remote network access but also for certain internal systems that handle sensitive information. The expectation is clear: email-only MFA or weaker second factors like SMS one-time codes no longer meet the standard.</p> 
<p>Finally, the 72-hour breach reporting requirement remains one of the most critical obligations. Delays in reporting can lead to enforcement actions - even if the breach itself could not have been prevented.<br><br></p> 
 Healthplex Case Study - A $2 Million Lesson  
<p>The Healthplex enforcement action provides a clear example of what can happen when these requirements are not met. In this case, a service representative at Healthplex clicked on a phishing email, giving an attacker access to sensitive consumer data stored in the employee’s Outlook 365 account.</p> 
<p>Several compliance failures compounded the incident. First, Healthplex had not deployed MFA for its email system, leaving it vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Second, the company lacked an email retention policy, meaning that sensitive data remained in mailboxes far longer than necessary, increasing exposure. Finally, Healthplex failed to notify NYDFS of the breach until more than four months after discovery – well beyond the mandated 72-hour reporting window.</p> 
<p>The result was a $2 million penalty, mandatory remediation measures, and a requirement for independent cybersecurity audits focused on MFA deployment. The costs extended far beyond the fine itself, including reputational damage and the operational burden of implementing corrective actions under regulatory scrutiny.</p> 
 The True Cost of Noncompliance  
<p>While the $2 million fine is headline-grabbing, the broader impact of NYDFS noncompliance is often far greater. Legal costs, remediation expenses, internal resource strain, and lost customer trust can quickly escalate. Regulatory investigations can also distract leadership and IT teams from strategic priorities, creating a sustained operational drag.</p> 
<p>For regulated entities, noncompliance can also lead to increased cyber liability insurance premiums - or difficulty obtaining coverage at all. And reputational harm, especially in the financial and insurance sectors, can have lasting effects on customer acquisition and retention.</p> 
 How to Stay Ahead of NYDFS  
<p>Proactive compliance requires more than simply meeting the bare minimum. Covered entities should:</p> 
  
  Implement phishing-resistant MFA such as FIDO2 hardware keys or device-bound passkeys across all systems that store or process sensitive information.  
  Automate breach detection and reporting to ensure the 72-hour notification rule is met without exception.  
  Establish clear data retention policies to limit the amount of information that could be exposed in the event of a breach.  
  Conduct annual independent audits to validate that cybersecurity controls meet or exceed NYDFS expectations.  
  
<p>By integrating these measures into their cybersecurity programs, organizations not only reduce enforcement risk but also strengthen overall resilience against evolving threats.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>NYDFS has made one thing clear in 2025: compliance with 23 NYCRR Part 500 is not optional, and the cost of failure is steep. The Healthplex settlement illustrates how a single phishing email, combined with gaps in MFA, data retention, and reporting, can spiral into a multi-million-dollar regulatory penalty.</p> 
<p>For financial and insurance organizations, the message is simple – treat NYDFS compliance as an ongoing operational imperative. Investing in phishing-resistant authentication, robust governance, and disciplined reporting processes can save millions and protect hard-earned reputations.</p> 
<p>Learn how HYPR helps financial and insurance organizations exceed NYDFS requirements with passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  NYDFS is aggressively enforcing 23 NYCRR Part 500, and penalties are climbing.  
  Annual compliance certification is due April 15, 2025; phishing-resistant MFA and timely breach reporting are top priorities.  
  Healthplex’s $2 million fine shows the financial and reputational risks of noncompliance.  
  Proactive, continuous compliance strengthens both security posture and business trust.

<p>For university leaders, registrars, student services, IT/security, and anyone who wants fewer emails, faster checks, and clearer truth—backed by cryptographic credentials.</p>


 


 TL;DR: What do you actually get—and how does it run on campus? 



 
 Issuance that’s controlled and auditable: Admins authenticate, prepare credential templates, and issue individually or in bulk from CSV, with a two-person approval policy you define. The portal logs who did what and when, so corrections are clean and traceable. 



 A single verification page you can host or embed: Verifiers scan a QR or use a public URL and get a clear result (Valid / Revoked / Incorrect/Unknown), with the option to copy/embed verifier HTML in your own site. 



 Admin UX that matches real registrar work: Backoffice lists admins and entities with statuses (Sent, Active, Revoked), invitation resend, disable/revoke with reason, and a guided “Alta de Administrador y Entidad” flow that emails the invite with wallet links, QR, and deep link. 



 Extrimian AI-First company: Even if AI agent Micelya is internal-only this help us to build and deliver a more accurate product for our clients and final users; it improves our delivery speed and consistency (knowledge hub, handoffs, SOPs), which you feel as better support and final product experience. 
 


 


 How can a university stop fake diplomas and identity theft 



 What problem are we solving—right now, in your inbox? 




Stop fake diplomas with crypto tamper-proof digital credentials and a one-page verifier. Students scan a QR; employers get answers in seconds.




<p>PDFs and screenshots look official but aren’t proof. Every week, employers and partner schools ask for confirmations; staff forward attachments; someone “just checks quickly,” and doubt lingers. Extrimian moves trust from appearance to cryptographic proof: students share a link/QR; your public verifier (hosted or embedded) returns Valid / Revoked / Unknown issuer in seconds—no inbox ping-pong, no guesswork.</p>


 


 What’s the solution in plain words (no acronym soup)? 



<p>Give each important proof a tamper-proof, shareable version—and give the world one official place to check it.</p>



 1) Issue credentials with control and clarity 



 
 Backoffice setup for admins &amp; entities: list admins with status (Sent, Active, Revoked), resend invites, revoke/disable with reason. This keeps who-can-issue under tight control. 



 Admin invites by email: your portal sends a welcome email with wallet links (iOS/Android), a QR to issue the admin credential, and a deep link for mobile. This is the clean onramp to wallet-based admin auth. 



 ID Wallet sign-in for admins (Login con credential): admins authenticate by presenting the admin credential’s QR, then land in their Home. 



 Projects and points: the Admin Home shows your default Project and two panels: Issuing Points, and Verification Points, with quick actions to create/edit each. This mirrors how registrars think about “where we issue” and “where we verify.” 
 



 2) Design and issue the right credential (one-off or at scale) 



 
 Types &amp; templates: for each Point of Emission, you manage Credential Types with editable name, description, hero, icon, background, plus attributes you can enable/disable or add. You also get a live preview before saving, which reduces surprises at graduation time. 



 Individual issuance: pick a template, fill recipient name/email, complete the dynamic attributes required by that template, preview, and Issuewhen everything’s correct. 



 Bulk issuance (CSV): select a template, upload .CSV, preview, and Issue Credentials when all fields validate. This is designed for large cohorts and reduces manual entry risk. 



 Safe edit/copy flows: you can only edit a type before issuing; you can also duplicate a type to iterate safely without touching live cohorts. 
 



 3) Give the world a one-page verifier (hosted or embedded) 



 
 Create aVerification Point: name it, choose the credential type, optionally set the issuer DID, add a webhook for events, and generate it. 



 Publish &amp; embed: copy the verifier HTML for your site and/or copy the public verifier URL hosted by Extrimian—both are provided at creation. 



 What verifiers see: your public verifier shows your university name, verifier name, and QR; when a presentation arrives, it updates the status to Successful Verification or Incorrect Verification—plain language for third parties. 
 



<p>Important clarity: Verification uses digital signatures and status (cryptography). We don’t run AI to “guess” authenticity. Your result is deterministic and transparent.</p>


 


 How does this look in real university life (concrete, day-to-day use)? 



 
 Diplomas without drama: students receive a digitally signed diploma they can share as link/QR. Employers use your verifier once and get a clear result, not a long thread. If a typo slips through, registrar follows revoke → re-issue → notify; the public link always shows the latest truth. (Flows supported by individual/bulk issuance, revocation controls, and public verifier.) 



 Enrollment status that respects privacy: most checks just need “enrolled this term.” You issue a minimal credential and point verifiers to your page. If status changes, the old one is Revoked, the new one is Valid, and external parties naturally see the right answer at the right time. (Backed by verifier status and revocation model.) 



 Transfers &amp; course recognition without email chains: shareable course completion credentials replace scans that go stale. The link stays constant while the truth stays current. (Template attributes + preview reduce errors before they happen.) 



 Career fairs &amp; outreach with momentum: students show a QR; recruiters scan at your public verifier URL and see Successful verification right there. (Easy to host or embed.) 



 Alumni support that actually helps: years later, alumni can request a re-issue; you revoke the old and issue the new. Anyone using the old link sees Incorrect/Reversed verification and requests the updated proof. (Admin list and actions maintain control.) 
 


 


 Who does what so this runs smoothly (roles mapped to the portal) 



 
 Registry &amp; Academic Records: Designs templates (name/description/hero/icon/background), sets attributes (on/off or new), and previews before saving; runs individual or bulk issuance; performs revocations and re-issues when needed; documents reasons for changes. 



 IT &amp; Security: Controls admin authentication (credential-based login via QR), configures/verifies Verification Points (webhook, optional issuer DID), and embeds verifier HTML or publishes the public verifier URL; ensures backups and uptime. 



 Student Services &amp; Comms: Educates students to share link/QR using the digital wallet on their mobiles, instead of PDFs and guides employers/partners to the official verifier URL; keeps a short FAQ aligned with the page’s Valid/Revoked/Incorrect outcomes. 



 Leadership (Provost, CIO/CTO, Risk &amp; Compliance): Endorses the one-page policy: “Verify here; PDFs aren’t official proof,” and monitors adoption (usage of the public verifier vs. email requests). (Policy and messaging are supported by the portal’s embed/public URL model.)

 How do we handle privacy, consent, and accessibility—without slowing anyone down? 



<p>Minimum disclosure by design: verifiers see exactly what’s needed to trust a result—no more. The public verifier returns a status and human-readable guidance, not full records. (This is inherent to the verifier’s status model.)</p>



<p>Consent that makes sense: students control when to present their credential (via link/QR). Because the verification lives on your official page, the experience is consistent and auditable across departments and partners.</p>



<p>Clear language and supportability: outcomes are stated plainly (e.g., Successful verification), and you can embed the verifier into familiar web contexts to reduce friction for external parties.</p>


 


 Where does “AI-first” fit—and why should you care if it isn’t inside verification? 



<p>We keep AI out of the verification path. Your truth is based on cryptography and status, not AI guesses. Where AI helps is inside Extrimian, through our agent Micelya:</p>



 
 Shared Knowledge Hub: policies, templates, integration notes, and client context live in a role-based, searchable space so our teams respond with consistent, up-to-date answers. 



 Faster handoffs and fewer do-overs: Micelya suggests next steps for our internal tasks (who approves, which template, what changed), so corrections move faster and communication is aligned. 



 Continuous improvement that sticks: when we learn a better placement for the verifier link or a clearer outcome message, it enters our playbook and stays there—even as teams change. 
 



<p>You feel Micelya in response times, consistency, and smoother rollouts—not in your verifier stack.</p>


 


 FAQs about Extrimian Identity Verification Solution for Universities 



<p>Do you use AI to verify credentials?<br> No. Verification uses digital signatures and status checks only. The public verifier returns a deterministic result (Successful/unsuccessful verification) that doesn’t depend on AI.</p>



<p>Can we embed the verifier into our website?<br> Yes. When you create a Verification Point, the portal gives you HTML to embed and the public verifier URL. You can copy either—or both—depending on your deployment.</p>



<p>How do admins authenticate?<br>Through credential presentation (QR) on the Admin Login, which takes them to their Home. The initial admin credential is issued via the invitation email with wallet links, QR, and deep link.</p>



<p>How do we issue a whole cohort?<br> Use Mass Issuance: pick a template, upload CSV, preview, and Emitir when checks pass. For single cases, use Individual Issue with dynamic attributes and preview.</p>



<p>How do partners verify?<br>They scan your QR or open your public verifier URL. The page shows university name, verifier name, and a status (Successful/unsuccessful verification) when a presentation arrives.</p>


 


 Contact us to avoid diploma and data fraud 



<p>Let’s map your flow and harden it—without slowing anyone down.<br>In one session, we’ll share a demo on how you can issue diplomas, and how the verification process works, identify quick wins, and hand you a short, clear plan: which credentials to start with, how your verification page should look, the approval steps to lock in, and the four KPIs you’ll track.</p>



<p>Not jargon. Not heavy lift. Just a safer, calmer way to run credentials in the AI era, with Extrimian as your AI-first partner for security and trust.</p>

				  Portable Authenticated Biometrics are the future of Biometric Authentication, one where you can use your biometric information across platforms and services. Learn how this powerful new technology allows users to hold their sensitive biometric information securely on their mobile device and what benefits it can offer your organization.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
 What are Portable Authenticated Biometrics? 
<p>Many people are familiar with the term Biometric Authentication. It refers to the use of unique physical characteristics to verify a person’s identity, such as their fingerprint, voice, or face scan, and many people use it daily to access their phones or other technologies.</p>
<p>Portable Authenticated Biometrics take these characteristics out of a siloed database, and store them inside of a Verifiable Credentials on the user’s smart phone.</p>
 The problem they solve 
<p>Current methods of biometric authentication rely on databases of authenticated biometrics that have been proven to be able to be tied to their users. The main benefits being that biometrics are harder to impersonate than traditional passwords, offer more convenience for the user, and cannot be forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as technology has advanced, we have realized a few major problems with this system:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large databases will always represent a lucrative target for bad actors. There is no amount of security that can guarantee that these large collections of personal information stay safe.</p>
<p>Current systems rely on a connection to the database to function. No internet or service means that you cannot share your biometric data or prove your identity, representing another point of failure.</p>
<p>Storing your biometrics with a third party means that they have control over that information and use it as they see fit, including using it to track your digital or physical actions or sharing it without your consent.&nbsp;</p>
 How do Portable Authenticated Biometrics work? 
<p>Every time a new person is added to a biometric authentication system a template of that person’s biometric data is created, and the system learns what you look like. This is what the system compares your new scan to when you are trying to access your phone or documents. In the system these authenticated biometrics are tied to you, and enable you alone to be granted access.</p>
<p>Portable Authenticated Biometrics are a method Indicio has created of allowing users to hold their biometric data securely on their mobile device. Because of the way it is stored (inside a <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credential</a>) the data inside cannot be manipulated once the credential is created.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  The Benefits 
<p>The biggest benefit of this system is that a large database is no longer required to use biometric authentication. This reduces costs and liability for the organization, and offers a huge increase in security for the user’s data.</p>
<p>The second advantage is that by having each user submit their biometric template alongside the new scan, we achieve multifactor authentication built in without any additional effort from the user. All the increased security without the need to check your email or text messages for a one-time code.</p>
<p>The third, and maybe most game-changing feature is the portability inherent in this system. If an organization that you trust — for example the government — issues someone a biometric credential, you can set your systems to accept that biometric information without needing the user to create a new biometric template with your organization. Think of the ease of “login with Google” but even more secure, and backed by any organization that you trust.</p>
 Benefits in Context: A Banking Call Center 
<p>Let’s walk through a quick example.</p>
<p>When calling your bank to fix an issue — such as a declined payment — you will need to prove your identity. Currently, most banks will ask you for information like your name, account number, social security number, or security questions to try to positively identify you before sharing any personal information. This process is not typically particularly long, but it is also not particularly secure. Any bad actor can also collect this information from a data breach and pretend to be you, increasing the risk of fraud and being dependent on the bank representative to catch it.</p>
<p>With Portable Authenticated Biometrics, the bank representative can digitally request your biometric scan and authenticated biometric to identify you instantly, in a way that cannot be impersonated. Once identification has been achieved, you can move on with the purpose of the call, without having to jump through any additional hoops, saving both the user and the call center time while reducing the chance of fraud.</p>
 Getting Started 
<p>The technology behind Portable Authenticated Biometrics is built to easily integrate into existing systems to create a faster, more secure experience for users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recently hosted what will be the first of many livestream events for everyone in our community, a series we’re calling Holochain Horizon (for those who want to go to the primary source, here’s a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/VZZWCSzhYxA?si=5-W9QdGMY3JDhl03&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org"> link</a> to that conversation). </p><p>Here, I want to do three things:</p>  Provide both context for, and a summary of, this first conversation – especially as it gave an opportunity for many of you to hear directly from Madelynn Martiniere for the first time, who recently joined our board and is providing direct support to the leadership team and broad community as we move forward and build out our ecosystem  Identify where we are right now as an organization – we’ve been working hard, for years, on an incredibly ambitious project: finding a path to building out open-source tech in a way that's actually viable in the world. While significant challenges remain, we benefit from having a clear picture of the often hard choices we have to make in order to make good on the promises we’ve made to both our community, and ourselves  And finally, having first written directly about the organizational shifts needed to provide our developers and community with the time, and space, necessary to deliver on our commitments (<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-holochain-foundation-is-coming-of-age/#:~:text=As%2520part%2520of%2520the%2520reorganization,'t%2520get%2520through%2520before%255D.">here</a>) in November 2024, I want to offer some specifics about what lies ahead – which, while I am admittedly biased, I am genuinely excited about  <p></p><p>ONE: Foundation Forward&nbsp;</p><p>I began the call by characterizing myself – accurately – as a little nervous, partially because it was our first such event as the Foundation, and partially because I was and remain genuinely excited about the direction these key decisions have led us to. </p><p>At the highest level, as I’ve said, it means operationalizing the Holochain Foundation itself – a shift from IP stewardship to active and direct involvement and management. &nbsp; This allows the Foundation to hold coherence for all our stakeholders, internal and external, to benefit from a strategic allocation of resources so that we can accelerate toward appropriately phased delivery.</p><p>Back in November I wrote that “part of our coming of age is realizing that we can’t do everything we might like. Focus matters.” From a technology infrastructure perspective, that means strategically advancing the capability, and durability, of Holochain.&nbsp;</p><p>As Madelynn and I discussed on the call, we clearly recognize the need to engage with our community and like-minded partners via formalized processes that will migrate one-off engagements to defined projects that benefit everyone by advancing the infrastructure itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Madelynn has a lifetime of experience in building healthy and robust technology ecosystems, and practically speaking, that means much of her role is to continuously iterate on improving surface-areas of engagement for all types of folks adopting Holochain, from individual developers, to enterprises and organizations looking for robust decentralized solutions to tough problems. A big part of that is engagement and communication, and as Madelyn herself said, her role is to ask, “how do we create processes and pathways for the community to be in deeper dialogue with us about what it is that they're building? How can we best support that? How do we engage them in actual development?”</p><p>So far, the concrete steps we’ve taken in bringing the Foundation forward include strengthening the technical team, along with a corresponding improvement in release structure and quality, and enhanced transparency, as embodied by our operational roadmap (which you can see<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/introducing-the-new-holochain-roadmap/"> here</a>) to provide the community with a clearly delineated roadmap showing the scoping, planning, and evolution of our ongoing work.</p><p>For our community, the takeaway should be clear: the Foundation’s leadership, and the organization itself, are orienting around proactive engagement to move us – all of us – from the strategic to the tactical.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>TWO: Where Are We Now?</p><p>On the call, I made a plain but accurate observation: “to build out open-source tech in a way</p><p>that's actually viable in the world… is a hard problem.”&nbsp;</p><p>From an organizational perspective, we’re evolving to meet the world as it is becoming. As I previously wrote, this means operationalizing the Foundation to ensure that while we’re always mindful of our ambitions, we remain connected and committed to action. In turn, that means constant and deliberate self-interrogation, making sure we have the right resources delivered to solve for the most important problems.</p><p>We talked about it at length in the livestream, but a clear example and core initiative for us is the continued build-out of our “Wind Tunnel” performance testing framework. One of the conundrums of technology is that while it sometimes appears there is unlimited capital to build out certain ideas (it is hard to observe without jealousy the trillions of dollars that have been dumped into AI), there is proportionately much less patience. Distributed technologies, by their nature, demand economic patience as they’re a half step slower to commercialize as the very decentralization creates different economic incentive structures.&nbsp; From a performance perspective, decentralized systems also have a different profile due to their architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what makes Wind Tunnel so important: we want (and developers need) to be able to verify that Holochain’s operating envelope will meet the demands of Holochain applications. And that's what Wind Tunnel can do. It allows developers to create a scenario to drive a network of Holochain nodes, see what happens, record the rates at which data is synchronized (or any other parameter they want to measure, like DHT synchronization speeds, CPU usage, bandwidth usage across different nodes, etc.) and have the metrics reported.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>THREE: Where We’re Going</p><p>Having shifted the structure of our organization, and as we continue to evolve and direct our resources at our highest-priority opportunities, you can expect to see some exciting developments in the near term.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, in our past configuration we spent a significant amount of time working on developing the Holochain app and infrastructure necessary to support HoloFuel. Effecting the conversion of HOT into HoloFuel – a mutual credit currency anchored in the value created by Holo hosting - has, from the beginning, <a href="https://holo.host/files/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">been a stated goal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Though we already knew the concept of HoloFuel had a much broader application as a pattern, we also realized that we could implement a generalized version for mutual credit currencies that other decentralized infrastructure projects could use, while also creating more value for current HOT holders.&nbsp;</p><p>Accounting for value flow and creating a fabric for establishing rules and systems to support and govern these flows, enables networks, communities, economies and cultures to grow and thrive. Recognizing this opportunity led to our strategic decision to create Unyt, a separate subsidiary organization designed to implement a generalized version for mutual credit currencies that decentralized infrastructure projects could use, while also creating more value for current HOT holders.&nbsp;</p><p>While Unyt is in its early days, they’re getting close to being able to launch beta versions of their multi-unit accounting framework and open them to our community for testing via a scavenger hunt. I won’t say too much more here about Unyt, but expect to hear more from them soon.&nbsp;</p><p>More broadly, we’re working hard on supporting this and other key initiatives at the Foundation that we believe will not only represent significant milestones, but genuinely put us on a path to delivering on the vision we’ve had, and shared, since Holochain’s inception.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for your continued support, and confidence.</p><p>Eric&nbsp;</p><p></p>

<blockquote>TL;DR<br>Stablecoins bridge traditional finance and the crypto-native world, enabling payments, global liquidity, and Web3 growth. In the AI economy, that bridge is native off-chain computation and verifiable inference, directly linking AI workloads to blockchain trust. HPP’s Noosphere delivers this at the protocol level, unlocking scalable, trustworthy AI integration.</blockquote><p>Today, many of Korea’s largest companies, including Naver, Toss, and Kakao are preparing to launch their own stablecoins.</p><p>Why? Because stablecoins are the essential entry point for entering and expanding into the crypto-native ecosystem.</p><p>In traditional finance, value transfer is limited by banking rails, operating hours, and jurisdictional boundaries. Stablecoins remove those barriers, enabling:</p>  Frictionless on/off-ramps between fiat and&nbsp;crypto  24/7, borderless settlement for payments, remittances, and&nbsp;commerce  Direct integration into DeFi, GameFi, NFT, and RWA markets without requiring volatile&nbsp;assets  Programmable money that can be embedded into smart contracts, loyalty programs, and digital marketplaces  <p>Beyond domestic use, these tokens also position Korean tech giants for global Web3 expansion, enabling them to directly integrate into international crypto liquidity, DeFi protocols, and cross-chain payment networks.</p><p>In short, stablecoins are not just a payment tool; they serve as a strategic bridge from Web2 scale to Web3 opportunities.</p> If so, what is the essential gateway to the AI&nbsp;economy? <p>In the same sense, off-chain computation and inference are a must for AI-native infrastructures. Just as stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto-native ecosystem, off-chain computing acts as a bridge between AI workloads and blockchain trust.</p><p>If a blockchain project claims to be “AI-powered” but lacks AI-native infrastructure, such as native off-chain computation, verifiable inference, governance over AI agents, and protocol-level integration, it is merely a marketing label and not a genuine AI platform.</p><p>On-chain environments are excellent for verification, consensus, and transparency, but they are not optimized for heavy computation or real-time AI inference. That’s why it must be natively implemented at the protocol level, not added later through an&nbsp;oracle.</p><p>This is the design principle behind HPP’s Noosphere:</p>  Protocol-native off-chain AI execution for inference, data aggregation, and simulation  On-chain verification to ensure results are correct and tamper-proof  Scalability for enterprise-grade and consumer-facing applications without congesting the main&nbsp;chain  <p>Potential Use&nbsp;Cases:</p>  Enterprise: Fraud detection in financial services, medical diagnostics in healthcare, real-time logistics optimization in supply chain&nbsp;networks  DeFi: AI-driven trading strategies, dynamic risk assessment, predictive yield optimization  Identity &amp; Security: Instant biometric verification, decentralized KYC/AML&nbsp;checks  RWA &amp; NFTs: Dynamic NFTs that change with market or environmental data, real-time asset valuation for tokenized real-world assets  <p>By embedding Noosphere directly into HPP, developers gain a built-in, verifiable AI execution layer, not a fragile add-on dependent on external services.</p><p>Just as stablecoins open the door to Web3 adoption, Noosphere unlocks scalable, trustworthy AI integration for blockchain ecosystems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/stablecoins-built-the-bridge-for-money-noosphere-builds-the-bridge-for-ai-2a2d0a25d002">Stablecoins built the bridge for money.

<p>Since launching Bluesky two years ago, we’ve grown tremendously. As our community has expanded, feedback on our terms of service, community guidelines, copyright, and privacy policies has surfaced opportunities to improve clarity. With more experience under our belt and an evolving regulatory landscape, we’re updating the language in our terms and policies to better explain our approach and provide more detail.</p>
<p>For our Community Guidelines, we’re asking for input from the community. The proposed guidelines enhance clarity, add user safety details, and provide more transparency around moderation. You’ll have until August 28th to submit comments, and then they’ll go into effect on October 15th. You can view our updated <a>Community Guidelines</a> on our <a>Support Page</a>.</p>
<p>Our Terms of Service have been updated to reflect new legal requirements and give users more control in case of disagreements. Changes include clarifying eligibility and age assurance to comply with new regional regulations, as well as introducing a formal appeals process. We’ve also expanded our dispute resolution section to prioritize informal resolution.</p>
<p>The new Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy will go into effect on September 15th. You can view these updated policies on our <a>Support Page</a>.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of what’s being updated:</p>
 1. Community Guidelines 
<p>We believe the best policies are created in partnership with the people they serve. Our draft Guidelines incorporate lessons from our community's growth and feedback, and your input will help us ensure they're ready to support Bluesky's future. We started by creating a draft that we think improves on our current Guidelines. Below are some of the updates we’ve proposed; <a href="https://forms.gle/mfgZGnhDMaKeq61p7">here is the form to use for feedback</a>.</p>
 
 Clearer Structure: Organized around four key principles—Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules—with specific examples of allowed and prohibited content under each. 
 Harm Categories Clarified: Updated with more examples, to align with the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act. 
 Enforcement Procedures: Introduced progressive enforcement model and clarified content moderation logic as required by the OSA and DSA. 
 Appeals &amp; Redress: Aligned with the DSA and now includes out-of-court and judicial remedy guidance for EEA users. 
 
 2. Terms of Service (ToS) 
 
 Eligibility and Age Assurance Section: Updated to clarify compliance with online safety laws and regulations (e.g., US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA], OSA, DSA) and to require age assurance where necessary. 
 Moderation and Illegal Content: Added detail on proactive moderation and illegal content responses to comply with the DSA. 
 Complaints and Appeals: Introduced detailed appeals process to comply with the DSA. 
 Dispute process: We have provided users with greater control in the event that we have a disagreement.
 
 We’ve added details about using the informal dispute resolution process, including an agreement that we will talk on the phone before proceeding to any formal dispute process. This is because we think most disputes can be resolved informally. 
 We’ve added a specific detail around liability: if a user makes a claim that we did something wrong that caused certain types of harm, they can choose to resolve that claim in court rather than through arbitration. 
 We are giving users a choice when it comes to any dispute we must resolve through arbitration. That means users choose one arbitrator, Bluesky chooses one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators choose a third. 
 
 
 
 3. Privacy Policy 
 
 User Rights: Enhanced transparency around data subject rights under the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other global privacy laws. 
 International Data Transfers: Updated to explain safeguards used for transfers outside EU and UK. 
 Retention and Deletion: Strengthened clarity on deletion limitations due to decentralized architecture; consistent with DSA and data minimization requirements. 
 Jurisdiction-Specific Sections: Added information that applies to some of our users based on the jurisdiction where they live. 
 
 4. Copyright Policy 
 
 Streamlined Takedown Procedure: Ensures compliance with US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), DSA, and similar laws. 
 Abusive Reporting Clause: Added mechanisms to deter fraudulent takedown misuse, compliant with the DSA. 
 Transparency Reporting: Aligned with the DSA by clarifying that we will include required information in transparency reports.

<p>On the cusp of our<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/"> series B funding</a>, and as I look ahead to many big and bright developments for our company and for Identity and Access Management at large, I can’t help but look back at the vision and design intent behind the 1Kosmos platform and how it became reality.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, we had a simple but audacious goal: fix digital identity once and for all. Not with incremental improvements, but by rebuilding the entire foundation from scratch. Looking back now, our early design decisions have become the blueprint that the entire industry follows.</p>
<p>The vision was clear. People were drowning in passwords, companies were struggling with ransomware and breaches, and personal data was being treated as a corporate asset rather than a fundamental right. We knew that any real solution would need to solve identity verification and passwordless authentication simultaneously, not as separate problems but as two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>What we didn’t anticipate was how quickly our architectural approach would become the standard. Today, when industry analysts discuss “best practices” in digital identity, they’re describing the principles we built into 1Kosmos from day one.</p>
 Identity Verification: Inclusion Was Always the Goal 
<p>When we designed our verification system, we made a controversial decision. While everyone else bet everything on smartphone-first experiences, we insisted on building multiple pathways that would work for everyone. The mobile experience had to be exceptional, but it couldn’t be the only option.</p>
<p>That decision proved prescient. Organizations discovered that when you make identity verification truly accessible, adoption rates soar. Our verification architecture combines real document authentication with live biometric matching across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this foundation is proving essential for the digital wallet revolution. As governments and enterprises begin issuing verified credentials, the ability to verify identity anytime, anywhere and with or without a mobile phone proves to be a core requirement, not just a nice-to-have feature.</p>
 Authentication: The Distributed Biometric Breakthrough 
<p>The breakthrough that really set us apart came from our approach to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/biometric-authentication-vss-threat-of-deepfakes/">biometric authentication</a>. Everyone else was building bigger central databases. We asked a fundamental question: what if we could authenticate users without ever storing their biometric data centrally?</p>
<p>The answer was distributed biometric verification across a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/blockchain-identity-management-a-complete-guide-2/">private blockchain</a>. Your face or fingerprint gets distributed and encrypted in ways that neutralize threats from centralized breaches. You can authenticate anywhere in our network, but your biometric data never leaves your control.</p>
<p>This architecture has become what security experts call the gold standard for biometric authentication. The user experience is seamless—your face becomes your password—but there’s simply no central target for attackers because there’s no central database to breach.</p>
 Privacy: Building What We Couldn’t See 
<p>Perhaps our most important early decision was to architect the entire platform around data we couldn’t access ourselves. This wasn’t just about compliance—it was a fundamental design constraint that shaped every technical choice we made.</p>
<p>We built zero-knowledge proof capabilities into the core platform. We could verify that someone was over 21 without knowing their exact birthdate or confirm employment status without accessing salary information.</p>
<p>This privacy-first architecture seemed radical when we first deployed it. Now it’s becoming a requirement. As verified credentials become mainstream, the ability to selectively disclose information through zero-knowledge proofs will transform everything from border crossings to loan applications.</p>
 Verified Credentials: The Network Effect We Envisioned 
<p>When we started building support for verified credentials, we were betting on something that didn’t quite exist yet. The standards were emerging, use cases were theoretical, and most organizations had never heard the term. But we could see where things were heading.</p>
<p>Today, verified credentials are transforming how organizations think about identity and access. The employee badge, professional license, customer verification—all can now exist as cryptographically signed digital credentials that work across platforms and organizations.</p>
<p>Our early investment is paying dividends! Organizations using 1Kosmos can issue credentials to employees that work seamlessly with partners’ systems. Customers get verified once and use that verification across multiple services. The network effects we envisioned are becoming reality.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: The Vision Realized 
<p>The most ambitious part of our original vision was true decentralized identity—putting users in complete control while maintaining the security that organizations require. Users own their identity information completely. Organizations get stronger security and easier compliance. The system becomes more resilient as it grows.</p>
<p>The decentralized approach has proven essential as digital wallets evolve from concept to reality. When your identity isn’t locked in corporate databases, you can present it anywhere, anytime, for any purpose you authorize. The wallet becomes truly portable because the identity itself is truly yours.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, this foundation supports use cases we’re only beginning to explore. International travel with digital passports. Seamless access across different countries. Professional credentials that work globally. Age verification that protects privacy completely.</p>
 The Reference Platform: Looking Forward 
<p>What started as our vision for fixing digital identity has become the reference architecture that defines how modern identity platforms should work. When analysts evaluate new solutions, they measure them against capabilities we pioneered. When enterprises set requirements, they’re describing features we built years ago.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the most exciting applications are just beginning. Digital wallets that work across borders and platforms. Verified credentials that enable instant, private verification of any attribute. Zero-knowledge proofs that let you prove exactly what you need without revealing anything else.</p>
<p>The next chapter is already being written. Your digital wallet will soon hold not just payment cards but professional licenses, educational credentials, government documents, and membership cards—all cryptographically verified and completely under your control.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos architecture is ready for this future because we built it into the foundation from the beginning.</p>
<p>The infrastructure is built. The standards are emerging. The future of digital identity isn’t coming—it’s here, working, and ready to transform how we interact with the digital world.</p>

				  In a recent Indicio Meetup, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijah-levine/">Elijah Levine,</a> CEO of <a href="https://blackmountainig.com/">Black Mountain</a>, Indicio CEO Heather Dahl, and CTO Ken Ebert discussed the digital transformation of banking and finance, driven not only by decentralization and digital assets, but by consumer preference for mobile interaction. An opportunity or a migraine? That all comes down to digital identity — and how banks and financial services manage customer authentication.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Banking and financial services are in the mobile age, whether they like it or not. With <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2024">55% of customers preferring mobile banking</a>, adaptation to a world of seamless digital interaction isn’t a choice. Many customers — but especially those who have grown up digitally native — don’t see the point of going into a brick and mortar building any more; they want to open an account, manage their finances, and access services as they do everything else — through their phones.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem. The scale of this opportunity to reinvent banking is anchored to a pre-digital, show up in person, world. And its a drag.</p>
<p>“We’re working with the biggest and best bank in the world,” said Elijah Levine, CEO of Black Mountain at the Indicio Meetup,&nbsp; “and for them to verify our identity, we need to bring two physical forms of identity into an in-person branch for a physical person to do a touch and feel test… using their banker’s best judgement for if this paper document is real.”</p>
<p>How, then, do you onboard and authenticate a new customer remotely —&nbsp;especially when paper documents and pictures can be easily forged with ubiquitous AI tools?</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  Verifiable Credentials with biometrics: A revolution in&nbsp; identity verification 
<p>A Verifiable Credential makes information tamper proof and cryptographically verifiable — meaning you don’t have to check the data in a credential against the same data stored somewhere in a database.</p>
<p>For a customer logging into an account this means no more passwords or usernames —&nbsp;by presenting an account credential from a digital wallet, they gain seamless access to their account. What this means for both the bank and the customer is that a key vulnerability —&nbsp;stolen login credentials — is removed as a security risk. You can’t phish for data that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>The process of verifying the credential also doesn’t just include verifying the customer, it also means verifying the identity of the bank so the customer can be certain it is their bank. Again, the shuts down a common phishing tactic of luring customers with emails or sms messages that purport to be from their bank.</p>
<p>But Verifiable Credentials reach peak usability when they combine verified biometrics with biographical data. By using Indicio software, a bank can enable a customer to turn the data in their passport into a credential, a process that includes taking the embedded image in the passport and performing a real-time face map of the passport holder to ensure both match.</p>
<p>“The beauty of combining a verifiable credential with a biometric,” said Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, “is that it can bind the data in the credential to the person who is presenting it and in a way that’s stronger than just having a set of data in a file… If you’ve bound the biometrics to opening the wallet as well, you can tell that the person is not only present, but they’re the one that the credential was issued to. And you can match that data to the data in the credential for purposes of ascertaining that you’re dealing with the right person”</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This functionality allows us to not only verify the data presented, but that the correct user is there at the time of data submission, making presenting someone else’s credentials without their consent essentially impossible.</p>
<p>It also provides a simple way to dodge a deepfake: simply ask the person to present an authenticated biometric. The verifying software will compare the live image to the biometric in the credential to see if it matches.</p>
<p>All this allows customers to verify their identity information from anywhere without the need to bring their paper documents to a building. And there’s no need for a bank or a relying party to have to store a person’s biometrics to verify them, simplifying the stringent privacy compliance around biometric data too.</p>
 What does this mean for KYC? 
<p>This technology is poised to change KYC, but it doesn’t need to be an all or nothing replacement of current infrastructure. “Although this is a new and cool technology,” said Ebert, “it doesn’t have to immediately supplant everything that’s already going on in KYC. It’s an add-on. It’s an enhancement. It’s a boost of confidence or a higher assurance level. It’s an immediate benefit, but it doesn’t have to be a rip and replace. It can integrate with existing systems. That’s part of the beauty of it —we’re not reinventing KYC”</p>
<p>But KYC will be reinvented.

<p>In this episode of The Future of Identity Podcast, I’m joined by Thomas Mayfield, Head of Decentralized Trust &amp; Identity Solutions at the Cardano Foundation. Thomas leads the development of the Veridian Wallet, an open-source digital identity platform built on the KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) protocol and funded by the Foundation.</p><p>Our conversation explores the rapidly evolving Web3 digital identity ecosystem—and how Veridian aims to bridge Web2 and Web3 with universal interoperable identifiers that cut through today’s fragmented identity landscape. We also dig into the growing urgency to rebuild digital trust as data breaches, ransomware, and AI-powered threats escalate.</p><p>In this episode we explore:</p>  Why interoperability—across Web2, Web3, and beyond—is essential to breaking down identity “walled gardens.”  How the KERI protocol enables quantum-proof, tamper-evident, and recoverable identifiers for individuals, organizations, and AI agents.  Real-world adoption: how the United Nations is using Veridian for organizational identity and passwordless authentication.  The potential for verifiable IoT and AI agent identities to transform trust in machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions.  How developers can leverage Veridian’s open-source infrastructure, sandbox environments, and tooling to build secure, compliant identity solutions faster.  The role of regulation in driving adoption—and why future-proofing identity systems now could save billions in breach-related costs.  <p>This episode is essential listening for anyone working on decentralized identity—whether you’re building infrastructure, integrating identity into products, or shaping policy. Thomas offers a rare, in-depth look at how to design for both future-proof security and real-world interoperability.</p><p>Enjoy the episode, and don’t forget to share it with others who are passionate about the future of identity!</p><p>Learn more about the <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/">Cardano Foundation</a>.</p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>“If you want to follow what’s happening in AI, it helps to know where the conversations are happening.” </p>



<p>That doesn’t just mean the headlines and white papers; it means the standards bodies, working groups, and protocol discussions shaping the infrastructure AI systems will have to live with (and live inside). Some of these efforts put “AI” right in the name. Others are quietly solving problems that have been around for a while, which AI has now made urgent.</p>



<p>At IETF 123 in Madrid, AI topics were everywhere, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not. Just like every other event I’ve been to this year, it’s clear that AI is no longer a side topic. But it’s also not one big monolith. A working group with “AI” in the title might be useful, or it might be entirely orthogonal to the problems you’re facing. And meanwhile, some of the most critical technical work is happening in groups that never mention AI at all.</p>



<p>This post is a snapshot of both: a look at where the “AI conversations” are happening in the standards world, and where the deeper technical groundwork is being laid, whether or not anyone’s calling it AI.</p>

 Where AI is the elephant in the room 



<p>Some of the most relevant work wasn’t framed as AI-specific at all… at least, not when it started.</p>



<p>Delegation chaining, for example, is a topic that’s been simmering in OAuth land for a while. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">identity chaining draft</a> defines a way to preserve identity and authorization information across trust domains. Useful for distributed architectures in general and now getting a lot more attention thanks to agentic AI models that need to act across domains, on behalf of users, and maybe other agents.</p>



<p>If you’re designing systems that involve third-party APIs, partner orchestration, or AI-driven workflows, this isn’t theoretical. It’s the difference between “this agent can complete a task” and “this agent just leaked PII across environments you can’t audit.” (This is often what’s happening right now; it’s a terrifying prospect, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Same story for WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments). AI doesn’t appear in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/wimse/about/">charter</a>, but the group is wrestling with exactly the kinds of problems that show up when AI agents act like software workloads, make API calls, and need identity and trust across services.</p>



<p>These efforts weren’t built for AI, but they are shaping the environment in which AI agents will operate.</p>



 Where AI is the headline 



<p>There’s also a growing set of efforts waving the AI banner from the start. Here are a few places to watch if you want to keep a product roadmap aligned with emerging standards and activities.</p>



 AI Preferences (IETF AIPREF) 



<p>This working group is focused on standardizing how people (and systems acting on their behalf) express preferences about how their data is used in AI systems. Think training, inference, and deployment. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/aipref/about/">Their charter</a> is about giving users the power to say “yes,” “no,” or “only under these conditions.”</p>



<p>Why this matters: Consent banners and privacy policies are blunt instruments. If your app collects user content, you might soon need a finer-grained way to handle “don’t train on this” or “only use for personalization.” Product teams working on personalization, LLM features, or customer data ingestion should keep this on their radar.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>Born out of a hallway conversation, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/">Web Bot Authentication</a> group is asking what it means to authenticate bots—especially AI-powered ones—when they interact with websites meant for humans.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If your web properties are being used (or abused) by AI scrapers, this work could define how to tell the difference between legitimate agents and free-riders. This could impact content licensing models, rate-limiting strategies, and even customer support bots.</p>



 AI Agent Protocol (side meeting) 



<p>This one hasn’t formalized into a working group yet, but a side meeting at IETF 123 kicked off discussions about protocols for AI agents to act autonomously online by invoking APIs, collaborating with each other, making decisions, etc.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If you’re building or integrating with AI agents—anything from internal copilots to customer-facing assistants—expect questions soon about how they authenticate, how their actions are logged, and what delegation looks like at runtime.</p>



<p>(Also, please don’t schedule the next AI Agent meeting opposite WIMSE again. Some of us have to clone ourselves as-is.)</p>



 Beyond the IETF 



<p>Other standards bodies are also entering the fray. Here’s a quick tour of where else things are heating up:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/">W3C AI Agent Protocol Community Group (CG)</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/"> </a>is developing protocols for AI agents to find each other, identify themselves, and collaborate across the web. It’s early days, but think of it as DNS and HTTP for agentic AI. 



 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/aikr/">W3C AI K</a>R CG is focused on knowledge representation, i.e., how to structure information so AI systems (and people) can reason over it consistently. It is relevant to anyone dealing with search, ontologies, or explainability. 



 <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">OpenID Foundation AI Identity Management CG</a> is mapping out how identity systems need to adapt to agentic AI. It’s not creating protocols (yet), but its members are watching government regulation closely.

 Signals to watch 



<p>Standards are slow… until they’re not. You don’t need to read every draft, but here are some signs that these efforts are going mainstream:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol), which lets AI agents act autonomously by invoking APIs or services, is <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/17/the-mcp-bandwagon/">not a standard</a>, but it’s being adopted or piloted by major platforms like cloud providers and browsers. To function securely, it depends on underlying standards for identity chaining, authentication, and authorization—things like OAuth, delegation models, and token handling. 



 Vendor AI agent SDKs start referencing delegation models or bot authentication best practices. 



 Your compliance team starts asking about AI consent and model provenance. 
 



<p>When that happens, product managers will need to have answers or at least know where to look for them.</p>



 If you’re building anything touched by AI 



<p>This is just one slice of what’s happening in the standards space. No one—myself included—can keep up with it all. And if I try to AI-clone myself, who knows what hallucinations might creep in! But hopefully there’s enough cross-pollination between these (and other) efforts that we won’t be reinventing wheels or missing blind spots entirely.</p>



<p>If you’re an architect, engineer, or product leader, now’s a good time to:</p>



 
 Start mapping where AI agents (or their proxies) may interact with your system 



 Review your assumptions about trust, delegation, and human intent 



 Assign someone to monitor the relevant working groups or participate, if you can 
 



<p>Standards work isn’t glamorous, but it’s how the internet keeps functioning. And right now, the decisions being made will shape how agentic AI interacts with everything from your login flows to your support tools.</p>



<p>With luck—and a little planning—the next wave of automation won’t break the web. Or your roadmap.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:26 Welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>Today we’re diving into the latest round of AI buzz — but from the standards world. Specifically, we’ll unpack what happened at IETF123 in Madrid and how it connects to a much bigger, messier, and louder story: the infrastructure needed to support AI.</p>



<p>00:00:51 If you feel like there’s way too much going on in AI and standards right now to keep track of, you’re absolutely correct.</p>



<p>00:01:00 One of my goals in this episode is to give you a map — not of every working group or proposal, but of the most relevant conversations shaping the AI systems your teams will build on, run into, or be regulated by.</p>



 



 Agentic AI and Why It Matters 



 



<p>00:01:22 Let’s talk about agentic AI, because it’s especially interesting.</p>



<p>00:01:28 The term refers to AI systems that can take autonomous action.</p>



 
 Large language models integrated into agents that can invoke APIs 



 Systems that make decisions and complete multi-step tasks 



 Agents that interact across systems — for a user, or even for another agent 
 



<p>00:01:53 This is a big shift. Like most computing shifts, it won’t work unless the plumbing underneath is solid — identity delegation, authentication, policy enforcement.</p>



<p>00:02:18 So where is that plumbing discussed? Some of it happens in AI-specific groups, but much of the critical work is in mature standards groups that don’t even mention AI in their charters.</p>



 



 Delegation Chaining 



 



<p>00:02:51 One example is delegation chaining in OAuth/authorization.</p>



<p>00:03:01 This draft defines a way to preserve identity and authorization across multiple trust domains.</p>



<p>Why it matters:</p>



 
 AI agents often act on behalf of users across multiple systems 



 Without it, product teams end up “duct taping” credentials to every interaction — not scalable 



 A scheduling agent booking travel crosses multiple trust boundaries 
 



<p>00:03:44 This work began before AI hype took off — but agentic AI makes it urgent.</p>



 



 Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments (WHIMSY) 



 



<p>00:04:05 Another crucial effort is WHIMSY — short for Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments.</p>



<p>00:04:21 It tackles how services, bots, APIs, and AI agents assert identity across environments.</p>



 
 Relevant for agentic AI because these identities aren’t tied to human sessions 



 Helps establish runtime identity for autonomous systems 
 



<p>00:04:52 Takeaway: If it doesn’t say AI, it can still be vital to AI infrastructure.</p>



 



 AI-Focused Standards Groups at IETF 



 



<p>00:05:01 Of course, there are groups with AI in their name and charter.</p>



 AI Preferences Working Group (AI-Pref) 



<p>00:05:08 This group is creating a standard way for users (or systems) to express data-use preferences for AI:</p>



 
 Training 



 Inference 



 Deployment 
 



<p>The aim is to move beyond vague privacy policies toward technical mechanisms for enforcing user preferences.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>00:05:58 A discussion about how bots — especially AI-powered ones — should identify themselves when accessing human-oriented websites.</p>



<p>Questions under debate:</p>



 
 Are bots allowed? 



 How should they authenticate? 



 How do we distinguish helpful agents from malicious scrapers? 



 Who’s accountable when things go wrong? 
 



 AI Agent Protocol (Side Meeting) 



<p>00:07:02 This informal discussion explored whether the IETF should standardize protocols for AI agents to discover, invoke, and communicate.</p>



<p>Connections to existing work:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol) is emerging in pilots 



 Secure use depends on OAuth delegation chaining and other identity models 
 



 



 Beyond IETF: W3C and OpenID Foundation 



 



<p>00:08:14 Standards work isn’t just at the IETF.</p>



<p>W3C Community Groups:</p>



 
 AI Agent Protocol CG – protocols for how agents identify, collaborate, and operate on the web 



 AI Knowledge Representation CG – structuring domain knowledge so AI systems can reason and explain themselves 
 



<p>OpenID Foundation:</p>



 
 AI Identity Management CG – mapping use cases, identifying gaps, tracking regulations 



 Not building protocols, but providing a regulatory and technical landscape view 
 



 



 What Product Teams Should Do 



 



<p>00:09:27 For product managers and executives, here are the practical takeaways:</p>



 
 Understand where delegation fits in your systems 



 Define identity for non-human actors — avoid relying on user credentials 



 Implement technical enforcement of consent for AI agent actions 



 Track compliance triggers early to avoid future architectural rework 
 



<p>00:10:44 Watch for signals:</p>



 
 MCP or delegation models adopted by major vendors 



 New authentication guidance for bots and agents 



 Increased compliance chatter about AI-related access 
 



 



 Final Thoughts

<p>When a company’s own founders and team members dig deeper into their pockets to invest more of their personal money, you know something big is happening. That’s exactly what just occurred at 1Kosmos—and it’s sending ripples through the digital identity world.</p>
<p>Today we announced $57M in Series B funding, bringing our total funding to $72M. But here’s what makes this round extraordinary: it was led by Forgepoint Capital and Origami Capital’s Oquirrh Ventures, with every prior investor participating, and included new funding from some of our own team members.</p>
<p>This blows past the typical $38M Series B, but the real story isn’t the size—it’s who’s writing the checks.</p>
 Momentum Building to a Crescendo 
<p>This funding caps off a remarkable year of wins. We’ve achieved <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-reports-record-breaking-growth-for-2024/">3x revenue growth</a> while becoming the only full-service Credential Service Provider with both FedRAMP High authorization and NIST 800-63-3 certification. KuppingerCole named us a leader across Product, Innovation, and Overall categories in their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/leadership-compass-identity-verification/">2025 Leadership Compass</a> for Identity Verification and passwordless authentication, and we scored “perfect” marks in Presentation Attack Detection level 2 (PAD 2) certification.</p>
<p>Our new Microsoft partnership for External Authentication Methods to Entra ID and the Carahsoft-awarded <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-partnership-with-carahsoft-awarded-login-gov-next-generation-identity-proofing-blanket-purchase-agreement-bpa-worth-up-to-194-5m/">Login.gov blanket purchase agreement</a> worth up to $194.5M prove the market is ready for what we’re building. Add our 1Kosmos biometric security key (aka1Key) for frontline workers with LiveID (real biometrics), and it’s clear why everyone—including us—wanted in on this round.</p>
 Riding the Digital Identity Wave 
<p>Digital identity has become one of tech’s hottest sectors, and for good reason. On the heels of warnings from none other than Sam Altman about the coming “fraud crisis” powered by artificial intelligence to enable bad actors to impersonate other people, major breaches and rising identity fraud have exposed fatal flaws in passwords and fragmented ID checks.</p>
<p>Recent news of Palo Alto Network acquiring CyberArk provides further evidence of a turning point in Identity. Cybersecurity stalwarts that traditionally considered identity verification peripheral to their mission now recognize it as the new security perimeter. It’s clear organizations worldwide are scrambling for solutions that deliver both security and user-friendly identity verification experiences.</p>
<p>The shift to zero trust security models puts verified digital identity at the center of access control. Cybersecurity investors are flocking to identity-focused startups because these solutions tackle the most pressing issues in our digital-first world.</p>
 What’s Next: Putting $57M to Work 
<p>This funding enables us to accelerate on three fronts: expanding our engineering team to push product innovation faster, scaling our go-to-market efforts globally, and building partnerships that bring passwordless multi-factor authentication to more organizations.</p>
<p>Our Engineering team is already using powerful AI tools in areas such as prototyping UI / UX designs to reduce cycle times and recommending microservices to update, data models to use, and APIs to build for speeding implementation planning. We have site reliability engineering in our target, using AI to handle complex operational functions independently, moving beyond simple automation to true autonomous decision-making. We’ll continue to work harder and smarter in engineering.</p>
<p>With the injection of fresh capital, Marketing and Sales will move beyond regional focus, tapping into global demand for improved identity and authentication services. Partnering will also benefit from the cash infusion. We plan to engage large global systems integrators, regional systems integrators, and various government entities to expand the 1Kosmos footprint into ready industries including Healthcare, FED/SLED and Manufacturing,</p>
<p>The included $10M credit line also gives us financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities without immediate dilution—letting us move fast when the right deals or talent emerge.</p>
<p>Our platform uniquely addresses both identity proofing and authentication, providing comprehensive protection against identity fraud and account takeover. Organizations need to stop bad actors without creating obstacles for legitimate users, and that’s exactly what 1Kosmos delivers.</p>
 The Bottom Line 
<p>When founders and executives invest their own money alongside institutional investors, it sends an unmistakable signal: we’re not just confident in our pitch deck—we’re betting our personal wealth on our vision.</p>
<p>With $57M in the bank and our team doubling down with their own money, we’re not just riding the digital identity wave—we’re creating it. The mission we founded 1Kosmos on—secure digital identity under user control, enabling ubiquitous access that can’t be stolen, borrowed or shared—is no longer just a vision.</p>
<p>It’s happening. And we’re just getting started.</p>

 Behind every digital interaction is a technical standard working quietly in the background. Here, we explore some of the most important in the digital identity space and explain how they’ll affect how you verify customers very soon. 



 



<p>Over the past few years, the European Union (EU) has garnered much attention in its goal to transform how people interact with governments, businesses, and each other online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Central to its mission is the rollout of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity EUDI) Wallet</a>, a secure, portable digital identity solution set to become the foundation for cross-border services, e-government, and AML-compliant onboarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two regulations in particular, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>, are redefining how identity and trust are managed across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the core of the transformation lie technical standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These are legally binding through Commission Implementing Regulations (CIRs), which lay the groundwork for secure, interoperable, and compliant digital identity services.</p>



<p>For example, earlier this year, IDnow became <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">one of the first companies in Europe </a>to receive certification under the latest ETSI standard for remote identity proofing, signifying a crucial step toward meeting eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD 6 requirements. One of the most important technical standards we achieved was the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, which is widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.</p>



<p>Technical standards ensure interoperability across borders, promote security by design, and create the certainty businesses need to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’ve championed the EU’s vision for a more harmonized approach to digital identity from the start. Our priority has always been to promote open, secure standards that allow technical innovation to thrive. In a regulatory environment that began shifting from voluntary best practices to mandatory rules, we welcome the clarity and opportunity that harmonized standards bring to the market, to institutions, and above all, to users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For IDnow’s regulatory and standards department it is important to keep looking ahead to what comes next and how it will affect the everyday lives of people. Standards play a crucial role in ensuring that impact is not only manageable, but truly beneficial. This remains the bedrock of our mission.</p>

 Why standards matter. 



<p>Behind every digital interaction, such as verifying your identity for bank account opening or digitally signing a contract, there are technical standards working quietly in the background. These standards ensure that systems speak the same language, that data remains secure, and that services can be trusted no matter where in the EU (or beyond) they are used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations like ETSI, CEN, and ISO play a critical role in setting these benchmarks. They bring together experts from governments, tech companies, and the public sector to define how trust services, digital identity, and secure onboarding should work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the EUDI Wallet and new trust services move from concept to implementation, these standards are not just technical specifications or guidelines; they are becoming the legal foundation for the way digital identity is handled across Europe.</p>



 Laying the foundation for trust. 



<p>The shift toward standards-driven digital identity and trust services offers better technology and builds a harmonized, secure, and legally enforceable ecosystem across borders. With the EUDI Wallet and the upcoming AMLR, Europe is setting a global precedent in how identity, privacy, and trust should be handled in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standards from ETSI and CEN are already embedded in the first wave of EU’s CIRs and will directly guide how identities are verified, wallets are certified, and trust services are recognized. These aren’t abstract technical documents anymore; they’re becoming the blueprint for how millions of people will access digital services, from banking to healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What often goes unseen is the deep, ongoing work that makes this possible. At IDnow, our regulatory and standards team has been deeply engaged behind the scenes as we work alongside our colleagues at ETSI, CEN and ISO to shape these standards in a way that balances security, innovation, and practical deployment. It’s this kind of collaboration that enables digital services to scale with confidence and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More specifically, IDnow has recently contributed to the following standards and technical reports:</p>



  ETSI TR 119 476-1. A feasibility study of how selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented in the EUDI Wallet. IDnow was one of the main contributors to this technical report.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 461: Requirements that define how identity proofing must be performed when enrolling for a Qualified Certificate or a Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes. The standard can also be applied to Personal Identification Data (PID) enrollment to the EUDI Wallet and AMLR guidelines. IDnow has been co-editors and contributors to both versions of this standard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 431: Specifies how remote signing with Qualified Certificates should be deployed in a remote Qualified Signature Creation Device. IDnow designed the new approach to only rely upon identification for one-time Qualified Electronic Signatures, which streamlines the remote signing process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  CEN TS 18098: Outlines how to onboard PID to EUDI Wallets. IDnow has been co-editors of the chapters related to identity proofing during the on-boarding process.  



<p>Regardless of whether you’re a wallet provider, financial institution, or public sector authority, now is the time to take a close look at how your internal systems align with these evolving standards. After all, these specifications are not optional; they are rapidly becoming the rulebook for trust in Europe.</p>

<p>Munich, August 12, 2025 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announced that several of its flagship products had achieved ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, the technical standard widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 was selected by the European Commission as the standard for AML-compliant identity verification for qualified trust services and the upcoming Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR).</p>



<p>The certification was awarded following rigorous testing by the accredited conformity assessment body, QSCert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obtaining certification in ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 establishes IDnow as one of the first providers in Europe to fulfill the stringent biometric and security standards necessary for compliant identity verification in line with evolving European regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why this matters for European businesses&nbsp; 



<p>With rising threats from deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated types of online fraud, especially in the finance, mobility, and telecom sectors, the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 standard outlines a comprehensive European framework for compliant identity verification services, including requirements for presentation attack detection, injection attack detection, and biometric-integrity assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This milestone is not only a technical and security achievement; it is a practical commitment to advancing digital onboarding in the most regulated industries. We’re proud to lead the way in enabling compliant, secure, and user-friendly identity verification across all major digital channels.</p>Armin Berghaus, Founder and Managing Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



 What comes next&nbsp; 



<p>As one of the first identity verification providers to be certified under the latest eIDAS 2.0 requirements, and the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) security standards, IDnow enables customers to adopt a variety of compliant identity verification solutions, each of which fulfill existing and upcoming European regulatory expectations and trust service requirements:&nbsp;</p>



  Expert-led video identity verification&nbsp;  



  Automated identity verification&nbsp;  



  NFC (Near Field Communication) identity verification&nbsp;  



  Electronic ID card (eID) verification&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet verification (which all EU banks will need to accept by 2027)&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>All above options are supported by IDnow’s identity verification and fraud prevention platform, which combines certified biometric checks, real-time fraud prevention, and seamless orchestration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2027, all banks that operate in Europe will be required to work with providers that are certified to the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 standard, allowing IDnow customers to have peace of mind today that its range of expert-led, automated and wallet-based identity verification solutions meet existing and upcoming EU regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This latest certification confirms IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof technology partner for regulated businesses across Europe,” added Berghaus. “It represents our intention for IDnow to continue to provide the most flexible and future-proof identity verification and fraud prevention platform for businesses navigating complex European compliance and customer experience demands.”</p>

<p>Consumer expectations have reached an all-time high, and they’re demanding more than just personalized marketing. They expect every interaction to reflect who they are, what they want, and where they are in their journey. For digital leaders and marketing teams alike, this creates both urgency and opportunity: how to deliver unified, real-time experiences across channels while ensuring data privacy and trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, this has been a complex and manual effort. Integrating identity provider (IdP) data with customer relationship management (CRM) systems often required custom development, while building user flows demanded coordination across multiple siloed teams. The result was disjointed customer journeys, delayed launches, and limited visibility into the customer identity lifecycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, today’s modern customer identity and access management (CIAM) systems have changed the game. Digital leaders now achieve true end-to-end integration far beyond just <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/capability/single-sign-on.html">single sign-on (SSO)</a>, using out-of-the-box (OOTB) connectors and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/capability/identity-orchestration.html">no-code orchestration tools</a>. Identity data can flow directly into marketing, analytics, and customer experience (CX) platforms, unlocking seamless omnichannel engagement with speed, accuracy, and confidence.</p>

  Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are transforming how companies verify suppliers, authenticate products, and prove ethical sourcing.

 The Supply Chain Transparency Crisis <p>Global supply chains are under more pressure than ever. Delays in verifying suppliers, counterfeit goods slipping through the cracks, and unproven ethical sourcing claims have left retailers and manufacturers scrambling to protect trust. Traditional verification systems (slow, manual, and vulnerable to manipulation) can’t keep up.</p><p>Without instant proof of business registration, certifications, or compliance status, production stalls. Counterfeit goods remain a multi-billion-dollar problem, undermining brand reputations and putting consumers at risk. Ethical sourcing claims often rely on unverified labels, leaving “fair trade” or “sustainably sourced” promises open to doubt.</p> How VDCs Transform Supply Chain Operations <p>Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are cryptographically signed records that can be instantly checked for authenticity. In supply chains, they replace the patchwork of PDFs, phone calls, and manual forms with secure, real-time verification.</p><p>They work across global trade systems, integrating with logistics software, ERP platforms, and customs processes. Whether it’s confirming a supplier overseas or verifying a product’s compliance with safety regulations, VDCs allow companies to act in seconds instead of weeks.</p> Real-World Examples of VDC Impact  Walmart <p>Faced with delays, counterfeits, and unverifiable ethical claims, <a href="https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us/blog/post/blockchain-in-the-food-supply-chain.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Walmart implemented VDCs</a> to:</p>  Verify suppliers in seconds with cryptographic certainty.  Authenticate products from source to shelf.  Prove ethical sourcing through tamper-proof records.The result: faster time to market, stronger consumer trust, and reduced risk.   Amazon <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/post/amazons-plan-for-digital-ids?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Amazon is exploring VDCs</a> to streamline marketplace seller onboarding, reducing the time from application to listing, while keeping counterfeit goods out of its ecosystem. This protects both customers and legitimate sellers.</p> Target <p><a href="https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-governance/responsible-supply-chains?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target</a> safeguards its quality standards by verifying supplier credentials and tracking product origins. VDCs provide data-backed proof that meets consumer expectations for safety and integrity.</p> Tesla <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biserdimitrov/2020/04/14/how-tesla-and-bmw-are-leading-a-supply-chain-renaissance-with-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Tesla is testing VDC-based tracking</a> for raw materials, ensuring that minerals like cobalt meet strict sustainability and human rights criteria before they enter the supply chain.</p><p>Across industries, VDC adoption is building supply chains that are faster, more resilient, and more transparent.</p> The Business Case for VDC Adoption in Supply Chain <p>Companies are embracing VDCs for three main reasons:</p>  Speed: Supplier verification shrinks from months to days, accelerating launches.  Fraud prevention: Cryptographic verification blocks fake credentials and counterfeit products.  Transparency: Real-time, verifiable records meet regulator and consumer demands for proof.  <p>In competitive markets, proving your supply chain story isn’t just compliance, it’s a differentiator.</p> What’s Next for Supply Chain Credentials <p>Emerging trends promise to make VDCs even more powerful:</p>  Blockchain integration for immutable supply chain records.  IoT tracking to connect physical goods to digital credentials in real time.  AI-driven verification for smarter fraud detection.  <p>With regulators moving toward requiring verifiable transparency, adoption will soon shift from competitive advantage to a baseline requirement.</p> The Bottom Line <p>Verifiable digital credentials are no longer futuristic, they’re here and already transforming global commerce. From Walmart’s operational gains to Tesla’s sustainability tracking, the results show that verification delays can be eliminated, counterfeits shut out, and ethical sourcing backed by proof.</p><p>If your organization is ready to explore VDCs for supplier verification, product authentication, and ethical sourcing, SpruceID can help design and deploy systems that meet global standards and build consumer trust.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Facial recognition search has quickly shifted from science fiction to everyday reality. Whether it’s tracking down an online impostor, securing access to a building, or reconnecting with an old classmate, the technology is becoming a go-to tool for both professionals and curious individuals. The magic lies in matching a human face to an image in a database or on the internet. The process is fast, accurate, and surprisingly accessible to anyone who knows where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Facial Recognition Search and Its Process 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">Facial recognition search</a> works by analyzing a photo or video to find and match an individual’s face in a database or on the internet. Unlike traditional image search, which focuses on colors, shapes, or objects, this method analyzes unique facial features. Think of it as the digital equivalent of recognizing a friend in a crowd only faster, and without the need to squint.</p>
<p>The process involves three main steps:</p>
 
 Detection – AI locates a human face in an image or video frame. 
 Mapping – The software pinpoints facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and jawline. 
 Matching – These mapped points are then compared with saved facial data to identify a possible match. 
 
<p>Facial recognition online services often combine large-scale public image databases with advanced AI. Tools like a facial recognition finder make it possible to track down a person from a single uploaded photo. Below is a simplified workflow example:</p>



Step
Action
Technology Used


1
Detect the face in the photo
AI + Computer Vision


2
Map facial landmarks
Face recognition SDK


3
Compare with database
Neural networks


4
Return match results
Search engine integration



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Technologies Behind Facial Recognition Search 
<p>The engine that drives facial recognition search is built from a combination of AI, deep learning, and specialized software. At the core, a face recognition SDK allows developers to integrate recognition capabilities into apps or websites.</p>
<p>But accuracy alone isn’t enough. To ensure the search result is from a real, live person and not a printed photo or screen replay, security layers like a face liveness detection SDK or liveness detection SDK are used. These tools can detect blinking, slight movements, and even texture differences in skin to confirm authenticity.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison between traditional image search and facial recognition search:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Popular Uses of Facial Recognition Search 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Security and Law Enforcement 
<p>Security agencies use internet facial recognition search tools to identify suspects, missing persons, or unauthorized access attempts. A facial recognition lookup can pull records from vast criminal and public databases within seconds.</p>
 2. Social Media and Online Networking 
<p>Ever spotted someone in a photo but couldn’t recall their name? Facial recognition online services help identify people from public social media images. A good facial recognition finder can track old friends or even verify profiles.</p>
 3. Business Applications 
<p>Banks and e-commerce platforms now use a face <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">liveness detection SDK</a> to confirm the identity of customers during transactions. This prevents fraud and speeds up onboarding for new accounts.</p>
<p></p>
 Free and Paid Facial Recognition Search Options 
<p>Many are tempted to try a free facial recognition search for quick results. While free tools can be useful for casual searches, they often come with limited accuracy and smaller databases. Paid services usually provide:</p>
 
 Larger and more up-to-date databases 
 Stronger privacy protections 
 Faster search times 
 Integration options with <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition SDK</a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How to Choose the Right Facial Recognition Finder 
<p>Selecting the best tool requires weighing its accuracy, privacy safeguards, speed, and cost. Here’s what to look for:</p>
 
 Database size: Larger databases mean better match chances. 
 Privacy policies: Ensure that any images you upload are not kept permanently. 
 Liveness detection: Prevents matches with fake images. 
 Integration: For businesses, make sure the tool is compatible with your face recognition SDK. 
 
<p>Example: A marketing agency verifying influencer identities could choose a service with fast searches, a liveness detection SDK, and an API for automation.</p>
<p></p>
 Ethical and Privacy Concerns in Facial Recognition Search 
<p>Although facial recognition technology is convenient, it brings up significant ethical concerns. Without proper safeguards, it could lead to mass surveillance, identity theft, or profiling.</p>
<p>To protect user privacy:</p>
 
 Limit who can access the technology 
 Always get consent before searching 
 Store data securely with encryption 
 
<p>For deeper insights, visit:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/biometrics">NIST Biometrics Standards</a> – U.S. standards for biometric systems 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Facial Recognition Search 
<p>By 2025, expect facial recognition search to become more accurate and even faster. Integration with other biometrics like fingerprints and voice recognition will make identity verification nearly seamless. AI will also play a bigger role in reducing false positives and increasing security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Facial recognition search has grown from a niche innovation to a practical everyday tool for security, networking, and business. The key to using it effectively lies in choosing a reliable service, understanding privacy risks, and staying updated on the latest advancements. With responsible use, this technology can be a powerful ally and <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> is here to keep that future secure.

<p>The rise of AI agents is one of the most significant shifts unfolding across the internet today. From booking travel to managing work tasks, agents are quickly becoming powerful tools that act on behalf of users. In fact, by next year, there may be more non-human agents online than human users. The promise is clear: automate the drudge work and reclaim your time.</p><p>But as the excitement grows, a critical piece of the conversation is being overlooked—identity. How do we know which agent is acting? Who authorized it? What is it allowed to do? And how do we prevent misuse when these agents gain access to sensitive systems or personal data?</p><p>In our latest live session,&nbsp;<a href="https://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Labs</a>&nbsp;CEO Nick Lambert sat down with Peter Horadan, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vouched.id/?ref=blog.dock.io">Vouched</a>, to explore these questions in depth. Peter not only shared his perspective on the growing risks but also gave a live demo of a new identity and delegation framework that makes it possible to verify and control what agents can do on our behalf.</p><p>Here are the main takeaways:</p>

 Q1: What is&nbsp;DeFAI?   A term describing projects that merge Decentralized Finance (DeFi) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently used to label this emerging segment in Web3. Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).  Naming: Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).   Q2: When will the HPP website and mainnet go&nbsp;live?   Mainnet Launch: Originally planned for Q4, now targeted for Q3 2025 (ahead of schedule). Progress is on track; nearing the end of the planned&nbsp;window.  Website Launch: Advanced stage — wireframes complete, style guide implemented, interactive elements reviewed. Branding draws from CRT distortion and terminal-style visuals, reflecting the “early era” feel of AI. Likely to launch before the&nbsp;mainnet.  <p>Note: The <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">hpp.io</a> site is already live with content for testnets and the private&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Q3: When will AIP-21 rewards be distributed?   Airdrop Start: After mainnet&nbsp;launch.  Vesting: Rewards have a long vesting&nbsp;period.  Expected Timing: Likely this quarter, soon after mainnet goes&nbsp;live.   Q4: Are the AIP-21 swap ratios still accurate?   Yes. Ratios were set at the time of the AIP-21 vote based on agreed project valuations. These remain locked and will not&nbsp;change.   Q5: Do holders need to take action for the&nbsp;swap?   If on Exchanges: Swaps may be automatic if the exchange supports&nbsp;it.  If Off-Exchange: May require using a bridge or manual&nbsp;process.  <p>General Guidance: Follow official channels for detailed instructions.</p>  Expect a generous grace period for swapping.  Token migrations are becoming more common — always track official updates for your holdings.   Q6: How is HPP an upgrade to the existing Layer&nbsp;1?   AI Integration: Aergo L1 (current mainnet) will gain the AI technologies being developed for HPP (e.g., off-chain computation, verifiable AI interaction).  Enterprise Use: Aergo remains the enterprise/private chain option, with forks for specific deployments (e.g., public&nbsp;sector).  Dual-Layer Advantage: HPP Mainnet enables easier integration with exchanges, AI-native dApps, and multiple blockchains without L1 modifications.   Q7: Community concern about low trading volume and price movement only on&nbsp;news   Price changes are not always tied to news; many announcements have no lasting effect, and derivatives can even push prices&nbsp;down.  Volume is important as a sign of utility, but isolated charts can mislead; always compare them with broader market&nbsp;trends.   Q7: Will HPP mainnet launch in late Q3 or early&nbsp;Q4?   Confirmed: Target remains end of Q3&nbsp;2025.  Airdrop: Will start after mainnet launch, following the vesting schedule.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-20-recap-defai-airdrop-and-more-660999a40fa2">[Aergo Talks #20] DeFAI, airdrop, and more</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Choosing the right identity verification (IDV) partner is one of the most critical security decisions you'll make. As organizations fortify their defenses, it’s clear that verifying the identity of your workforce requires a fundamentally different approach than verifying customers.<br><br>The stakes are simply higher. For customer verification, the primary goal is often a smooth, low-friction sign-up process. For your workforce, the goal is ironclad security to prevent a breach. The reality is that many IDV solutions on the market are repurposed customer onboarding tools, not purpose-built platforms designed to stop a skilled attacker from impersonating an employee.<br><br>This guide is designed to help you look beyond the surface-level features and assess whether a vendor can truly meet the security demands of a modern enterprise. Use these questions to find a genuine partner and a solution that is truly workforce-grade.</p> 
 Core Capabilities and Security  
<p>The foundation of any IDV solution is its ability to accurately verify an identity while defending against advanced, modern attacks.</p> 
 1. How do you protect against deepfakes and other advanced impersonation attacks?  
<p>To protect against modern threats, your first question should focus on a vendor's strategy for tackling sophisticated fraud. Threat actors now use AI to create deepfakes for both presentation attacks (showing a fake image to a camera) and injection attacks (bypassing the camera to feed a fake video stream directly into the system).</p> 
<p>A workforce-grade solution should deliver:</p> 
  
  Advanced Liveness Detection: The best solutions employ sophisticated liveness checks to distinguish between a live person and a spoof like a mask or recording.&nbsp;  
  Injection Attack Prevention: A vendor should offer technology that prevents attackers from bypassing on-device cameras, making it nearly impossible to inject a deepfake into the verification stream.  
  
 2. What verification methods do you offer beyond a simple document check?  
<p>While document verification is essential, a resilient IDV platform must offer a wide array of options to create a multi-layered defense and ensure all employees can be verified successfully.</p> 
<p>A top-tier vendor should provide a flexible framework that includes:</p> 
  
  Geolocation and IP Intelligence: A modern IDV solution should analyze passive risk signals like the user's IP address and device location.  
  Biometric Matching: Comparing a user's live selfie to the portrait on their government ID is a necessary feature for modern verification.  
  Workforce-Specific Workflows: The most innovative solutions provide methods uniquely suited for an enterprise environment. One such powerful, context-aware method is manager attestation, where a supervisor can digitally vouch for an employee's identity through secure chat or video call.  
  
 Deployment and Integration  
<p>A solution's value is directly tied to how well it integrates with your existing technology stack without causing major disruptions.</p> 
 3. How does your solution integrate with our key workforce workflows and technology stack?  
<p>To avoid creating information silos and clunky workarounds, an IDV solution's value multiplies when it is deeply embedded into the systems where identity is most critical. For maximum efficiency and security, a vendor should offer:</p> 
  
  IAM and IdP Integration: Out-of-the-box connectors for major Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Provider (IdP) platforms like Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, and Ping are crucial for managing employee access and credential resets.  
  Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): To combat candidate fraud early in the hiring process, integrations with ATS platforms to verify an applicant's identity, ensuring the person you interview is the person you hire are important.  
  Help Desk and Ticketing Systems: The ability to integrate into your existing help desk or ticketing platform is essential for securely handling high-risk workflows like password and MFA resets.  
  SIEM Integration: A vendor should be able to seamlessly integrate with your SIEM systems. This allows your security team to feed identity event logs into a centralized platform for auditing, threat analysis, and compliance monitoring.  
  Standards-Based Integration: Look for solutions built on open standards like OIDC and SAML, as this ensures broad compatibility and future-proofs your investment.&nbsp;  
  
 4. What is the deployment process like, and what resources are required from my team?  
<p>The deployment model should align with your organization's infrastructure and technical capabilities. A cloud-native platform offers superior scalability and easier integration. For organizations looking to address urgent threats, it's best to prioritize vendors that offer ready-to-use solutions rather than a lengthy, resource-intensive implementation project.</p> 
 The User Experience  
<p>Security measures should empower productivity, not hinder it. The employee experience is paramount for adoption and success.</p> 
 5. What is the end-user journey like for initial verification and future re-verifications?  
<p>The process should be fast, intuitive, and require minimal effort from the employee. The best user experience is achieved through:</p> 
  
  App-less Workflows: Forcing users to download a separate application creates unnecessary friction. A vendor should offer app-less web experiences that allow users to complete verification on any device with a browser.  
  Seamless Re-verification: It is critical that a solution is designed to handle re-verification and the re-binding of an identity to a new device. Products that treat every verification as a one-time event are poorly suited for managing the employee lifecycle, where device changes are common.  
  
 6. Do you support flexible workflows for different risk levels and use cases, like help desk support?  
<p>A one-size-fits-all approach to identity verification is inefficient. A modern IDV platform must allow for fully customizable and configurable workflows that can be tailored to specific use cases and risk levels. For example, a vendor should be able to integrate with your call center operations. This allows help desk agents to securely trigger a verification flow before performing high-risk actions like a password reset, which is a common vector for attack.</p> 
 Security, Compliance, and Data Privacy  
<p>Handling sensitive employee data requires the highest, non-negotiable standards of security and certified compliance.</p> 
 7. What are your security certifications and how do you ensure compliance with data privacy regulations?  
<p>A reputable vendor must demonstrate its commitment to security through widely recognized, independent certifications. You should require proof of:</p> 
  
  Security and Trust Certifications: SOC 2, ISO, and FIDO2 certifications are essential benchmarks.  
  Regulatory Compliance: The solution must support compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, as well as regulations like HIPAA.  
  Identity Standards Adherence: The platform should be compliant with identity standards from NIST, ideally up to Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3) for the highest-risk environments.  
  
 8. How do you store and protect our employees' personally identifiable information (PII)?  
<p>A vendor's data handling policies are a direct reflection of its security posture. The ideal approach is one that minimizes your organization's data exposure. You should look for a vendor that:</p> 
  
  Employs Strong Encryption: All data, both at-rest and in-transit, must be encrypted using strong standards like AES-256.  
  Minimizes Data Retention: The best practice is to hold Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for the shortest time necessary. An attestation-only model, where the raw data is destroyed after a short period, significantly reduces your risk and is superior to models that store PII indefinitely.  
  
 Finding Your Workforce Identity Verification Partner  
<p>Choosing an IDV vendor is about more than buying a tool; it's about establishing a partnership to navigate evolving threats. By asking these questions, you can identify a provider who understands the unique challenges of workforce security and is committed to your long-term success.</p>

<p>Every digital interaction is a chance to build trust or break it. Today’s customers are more privacy-conscious, security-aware, and experience-driven than ever, and they’ve never had more options. One broken login flow, one unnecessary verification step, one untrustworthy interface, and they’re gone—often for good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why do some customers remain loyal to certain brands, while others abandon their carts, apps, or accounts with a single frustrating click?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is trust. And increasingly, trust is powered by modern identity.</p>

 Upgrading Legacy Blockchain Systems with AI-Native Infrastructure  Case Study: NHIS and Aergo. A Blueprint for Public Sector Blockchain Adoption  Background <p>The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea pioneered blockchain adoption in the public sector by launching a high-throughput Timestamping Authority (TSA) system built on the Aergo Enterprise platform. This system verifies and records the issuance of key documents, including insurance contracts, care applications, and official certifications, with over 400,000 transactions processed daily. The system is projected to handle over 1.8 million transactions per day once the upcoming services are fully deployed.</p> Key Features of the Aergo-Based TSA   Immutable Timestamping: Each document issuance is timestamped and anchored to the Aergo blockchain.  System Integration: Deployed with zero downtime, fully integrated into NHIS’s legacy&nbsp;systems.  Environmental Efficiency: Reduced reliance on paper documentation and physical verification processes.  Security &amp; Auditability: Enhanced traceability and document verification for public trust and regulatory compliance.  <p>This Aergo-powered system is widely recognized as one of the most successful enterprise blockchain deployments in the public&nbsp;sector.</p> How HPP Could Evolve the NHIS TSA: From Timestamping to Intelligence <p>Although HPP is not currently implemented by NHIS, future upgrades of similar public systems could benefit significantly from integration with HPP’s AI-native infrastructure. The House Party Protocol is designed to enhance legacy blockchain systems by combining verifiable AI execution, decentralized governance, and modular scalability.</p><p>Here’s how HPP could enhance a use case like NHIS’s TSA&nbsp;system:</p> 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection Using AI&nbsp;Agents <p>Current Limitation<br> Fraud detection in the current TSA is largely external or manual, relying on human audits or external tools to identify document forgery, duplicate claims, or anomalous patterns.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP integrates a Fraud Detection System (FDS) that uses intelligent agents to flag suspicious behaviors in real-time. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Detecting attempts to submit forged care applications or duplicate insurance claims.  Flagging statistically abnormal combinations (e.g., elderly care requests submitted by unusually young applicants).  <p>These agents run on ArenAI, HPP’s AI execution layer, and automatically initiate fraud reviews, reducing risk while accelerating operational trust.</p> 2. Document Intelligence Through Noösphere +&nbsp;SLM <p>Current Limitation<br> The Aergo TSA verifies the timestamp and issuance of documents, but not the content of documents. There’s no native understanding or validation of what is inside each&nbsp;form.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP’s Noösphere infrastructure powers off-chain SLM (Small Language Model) inference, enabling systems&nbsp;to:</p>  Analyze document contents for consistency (e.g., checking for contradicting information across multiple submissions).  Classify and tag public documents automatically.  Feed results into smart contracts that enforce policy (e.g., deny requests that don’t meet minimum medical criteria).  <p>This creates a hybrid system where off-chain AI logic is made on-chain verifiable through Proof-of-Inference, increasing transparency and auditability for automated decisions.</p> Final Thought <p>As public institutions pursue digital transformation, the NHIS case offers a proven foundation. However, the next generation of infrastructure will require more than just timestamping. HPP demonstrates how AI-native Layer 2 blockchain architecture can enhance public systems into intelligent, verifiable, and programmable digital services — transitioning beyond record-keeping to real-time decision-making and automation.</p><p>Note: The HPP enhancements described are exploratory and not affiliated with NHIS at the time of&nbsp;writing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/how-hpp-could-transform-public-blockchain-use-b0a4191db725">How HPP Could Transform Public Blockchain Use</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Helpdesks are critical support hubs, but their central role makes them prime targets for sophisticated social engineering attacks. These attacks exploit human psychology, tricking helpdesk personnel into divulging sensitive information or compromising security, often by targeting credential resets. When attackers convince an agent to reset a legitimate user's password, they bypass security, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. The devastating impact was demonstrated by the 2023 MGM attack, reportedly initiated via a helpdesk social engineering tactic, causing significant disruptions and financial losses. Understanding and preventing these threats is crucial for organizational strength.</p> 
 Defining Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering attacks are sophisticated tactics where cybercriminals manipulate helpdesk personnel through deception. The core objective is unauthorized access, often via credential resets. Attackers impersonate legitimate users, perhaps an executive needing urgent access, using publicly available information to sound convincing. This circumvents technical defenses, allowing free movement within networks for data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or further attacks. The 2023 MGM breach, costing over $100 million in reported damages, exemplifies the profound financial and reputational harm from such a successful helpdesk social engineering attack.</p> 
 How Common Social Engineering Attacks Are Performed on Helpdesks  
<p>A typical helpdesk social engineering attack is a carefully orchestrated sequence:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: Attackers gather employee details from public sources (social media, company websites, data breaches) to create a believable persona.  
  Impersonation: They contact the helpdesk, posing as a legitimate employee, often a high-authority figure or a distressed user, sometimes using caller ID spoofing or deepfake voice technology.  
  Exploiting Weak Verification: Attackers exploit flaws like knowledge-based authentication (KBA), finding answers through research or dark web data to bypass security questions.  
  Building Trust and Pressure: They use psychological tactics: 
    
    Urgency: Creating immediate crises to rush the agent.  
    Authority: Impersonating executives to imply repercussions for delays.  
    Insider Knowledge: Using researched details to sound credible.  
      
  Credential Reset/Modification: Trust established, they convince the agent to reset a password or enroll a new MFA device.  
  Exploitation: With new credentials, they gain unauthorized access for data exfiltration, malware installation, or fraud.  
  
<p>These attacks are prevalent; reports from 2023 indicated that a significant percentage of organizations experienced credential compromises linked to social engineering, with an increasing shift to voice and video-based tactics.</p> 
   
<p>Train your helpdesk staff to adopt a mindset of "verify, don't trust." This means questioning every request for credential changes or sensitive access, regardless of how urgent or authoritative the request seems. Always use established, out-of-band verification methods, such as calling the user back on a pre-registered, known phone number, rather than relying solely on information provided during the current interaction.</p> 
 The Weakest Link: Flaws in Traditional Identity Verification  
<p>Traditional helpdesk identity verification methods often present critical vulnerabilities:</p> 
  
  Reliance on Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA): Easily compromised as answers to security questions are often publicly available or found in data breaches.  
  Static Credentials (e.g., Passwords): Vulnerable to phishing and brute-force attacks; a compromised password grants persistent access.  
  Lack of Multi-Factor Verification Enforcement: Helpdesks may have weak processes allowing MFA bypass or re-enrollment without stringent identity proofing.  
  Human Error and Pressure: Agents, under pressure and manipulation (urgency, authority), may overlook red flags or deviate from protocols.  
  Inconsistent Procedures: Lack of standardized verification protocols allows attackers to "shop around" for a less vigilant agent.  
  
<p>The inherent limitations of static credentials, once compromised, give attackers sustained access, enabling extensive network exploration and damage before detection.&nbsp;</p> 
 Implementing Low-Friction Authentication<br>  
<p>Low-friction authentication is crucial to combating helpdesk social engineering by making authentication seamless without compromising security. Complex, slow processes can inadvertently lead staff to bypass protocols or fall prey to quick-fix social engineering.</p> 
<p>Passwordless authentication eliminates the primary target for phishing—passwords—and offers numerous benefits:<br></p> 
  
  Enhanced Security: FIDO-based solutions use phishing-resistant public-key cryptography, making compromise significantly harder.  
  Superior Usability: Eliminates password memory burdens, frequent resets, and lockouts, providing a faster, intuitive login for users and reducing password-related helpdesk calls.  
  Reduced Attack Surface: No passwords to steal, crack, or breach, drastically shrinking potential attack vectors.  
  Cost Savings: Directly reduces helpdesk call volumes related to password issues, translating into significant operational savings.<br>  
  
<p>Biometrics, for example, transforms login into a natural, quick action while providing a higher level of security assurance.</p> 
 The Role of Generative AI in Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfake technology, is rapidly enhancing the sophistication and scale of helpdesk social engineering attacks, making them harder to detect. For a deeper dive, read our blog on <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">preventing generative AI attacks</a>.&nbsp;<br></p> 
<p>AI's role includes:<br></p> 
  
  Advanced Pretexting: LLMs generate highly plausible, contextually aware scripts for calls, emails, or chats, mimicking corporate language and adapting tone for credibility.  
  Deepfake Voice Cloning: AI clones target voices from audio samples, enabling convincing "vishing" attacks where helpdesk agents believe they're speaking with the legitimate person. This was a key concern highlighted in HHS alerts.  
  Deepfake Video: While still evolving for real-time helpdesk use, deepfake video could enable visual impersonation during video calls, adding another layer of authenticity.  
  Automated and Scalable Attacks: AI automates reconnaissance, personalized message generation, and simultaneous social engineering attempts, allowing large-scale, targeted campaigns with less manual effort.  
  Adaptive Strategies: AI systems can learn and refine their deceptive approaches based on responses, increasing their agility and making them harder to defend against with static security measures.<br>  
  
   
<p>As generative AI makes impersonation easier, organizations must move beyond knowledge-based authentication. Implement identity verification methods that are inherently resistant to AI-generated fakes, such as live liveness detection for biometrics or multi-factor verification that relies on device-bound cryptographic keys rather than shared secrets.<br></p> 
 Real-World Examples of Helpdesk Social Engineering  
<p>The threat of helpdesk social engineering is not theoretical; it's a proven and ongoing attack vector. Here are some notable instances and warnings:</p> 
 HHS Sector Alert  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering is a persistent threat. The Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) within the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) has issued alerts detailing sophisticated tactics.</p> 
<p>HHS Sector Alert: HC3 highlighted threat actors (e.g., "Scattered Spider") using advanced social engineering. These attackers call helpdesks, impersonating employees (often in financial roles), using sensitive, likely breached, information (e.g., last four SSN digits) to pass initial verification. They then claim a broken phone, persuading helpdesk staff to enroll a new, attacker-controlled MFA device. This grants access to corporate resources, exploited for payment fraud or ransomware. HHS specifically noted the potential for AI voice impersonation, making remote identity verification increasingly challenging.<br></p> 
 How to Prevent the Helpdesk from Social Engineering  
<p>Preventing helpdesk social engineering requires a multi-faceted approach combining strong technology, comprehensive training, and robust policies.<br></p> 
 Using Deterministic Controls to Stop Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Stopping AI-fueled social engineering and deepfake attacks means adopting deterministic controls over probabilistic methods like passwords. Deterministic controls offer higher certainty about user identity, often involving multi-factor verification (MFV) that uses inherently secure and hard-to-spoof methods.<br></p> 
<p>Recommended steps to harden the credential reset process:<br></p> 
  
  Implement Phishing-Resistant MFA: Prioritize FIDO2-based authentication (e.g., hardware security keys, biometrics with device-bound keys) which uses public-key cryptography, making it resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be a baseline for sensitive access and helpdesk-initiated changes.  
  Introduce Dynamic Verification: 
    
    Identity Proofing: Require strong identity proofing for account creation and high-risk operations like resets. This includes live liveness detection during video calls or leveraging trusted third-party services.  
    Out-of-Band Verification: Always verify identity via a channel not controlled by the attacker, such as calling a pre-registered phone number or sending a code to a secure, verified email.  
      
  Limit Resets via Secure Channels &amp; Enforce Stringent Escalation: Define strict protocols for resets. Require multi-layer approvals for high-risk requests and implement "cooling-off" periods for new device enrollments from unusual locations. Exceptions should involve supervisory review and additional robust identity proofing.  
  Emphasize Automation and Self-Service: Empower users with secure self-service password reset and account recovery using strong, phishing-resistant MFA. This reduces helpdesk burden and minimizes the attack surface.<br>  
  
 Strengthening Workplace Security with Robust Identity Proofing  
<p>Effective identity proofing is paramount for preventing unauthorized access. While authentication confirms credential possession, identity proofing confirms the claimant's true identity, crucial against social engineering where attackers have valid information but aren't the legitimate user.</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Robust identity proofing practices are essential throughout the employee lifecycle:</p> 
  
  Onboarding: Ensures only legitimate employees gain initial access through verified IDs, background checks, and biometric enrollment.  
  High-Risk Transactions/Requests: For actions like helpdesk password resets or sensitive data access, identity proofing should be re-applied or elevated. This includes biometric verification with liveness detection, document verification, or live video verification with a trained agent.  
  Continuous Monitoring: Integrating identity proofing with continuous monitoring detects anomalous behavior, triggering strong proofing protocols if a user attempts unusual actions (e.g., new device enrollment from a foreign IP).  
  
<p>Strengthening identity proofing builds a more resilient defense against social engineering, significantly hindering impersonation attempts.</p> 
 How HYPR Affirm Thwarts Social Engineering Attacks  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/ai-attack-prevention">HYPR Affirm</a> directly combats sophisticated social engineering attacks targeting helpdesks and identity systems, especially those amplified by generative AI and deepfakes. It shifts from vulnerable, probabilistic identity verification to a deterministic, phishing-resistant approach.</p> 
<p>Here's how HYPR Affirm helps:</p> 
  
  Eliminates Phishable Credentials: Built on FIDO standards, it enables strong, passwordless authentication, removing the primary target for phishing and credential-stuffing attacks.  
  Deterministic Identity Assurance: Provides comprehensive, adaptable identity verification using high-fidelity proofing, like live biometric verification with liveness detection, to confirm the user's true identity, not an impersonator.  
  Automates &amp; Strengthens Workflows: Automates complex identity verification flows, reducing human error and ensuring consistent protocols. High-risk events trigger robust identity proofing automatically.  
  Adaptive Risk Analysis: Incorporates real-time identity risk analysis, leveraging dynamic signals to detect suspicious behavior (unusual logins, device changes), driving adaptive security measures.  
  Protects Fallback Mechanisms: Ensures even alternative authentication methods are secure and phishing-resistant, or require strong identity proofing for recovery actions.  
  
<p>By implementing HYPR Affirm, organizations can fortify their identity security, making it significantly harder for social engineers to trick helpdesk personnel and gain unauthorized access.</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  Social engineering is a growing threat: Attackers use sophisticated psychological tactics and AI-powered tools to target helpdesks for unauthorized access.  
  Vulnerable verification methods are the entry point: Traditional, static identity checks (like passwords and security questions) are easy for attackers to bypass.  
  Phishing-resistant authentication is key: Deploy FIDO-based passwordless solutions to eliminate the primary target of most social engineering attacks—the password itself.  
  Implement deterministic identity proofing: For high-risk actions like credential resets, use strong, modern methods like live biometric verification with liveness detection to ensure the user is who they claim to be.  
  Strengthen helpdesk procedures: Train staff to handle high-pressure situations and use secure, automated workflows to reduce human error and enforce consistent security policies.  
  Leverage purpose-built tools: Solutions like HYPR Affirm are designed to provide AI-resistant identity assurance, offering a crucial layer of defense against modern social engineering techniques.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>Generative AI amplifies the evolving threat of helpdesk social engineering, which bypasses technical controls by exploiting human elements and outdated identity verification. Countering this requires deterministic controls and robust identity proofing, prioritizing phishing-resistant passwordless authentication and dynamic high-risk verification. HYPR Affirm offers essential tools for AI-resistant identity assurance, enabling organizations to prevent attacks and achieve comprehensive passwordless security.</p> 
 FAQs  
<p>Q: Why Is Social Engineering Effective? A: Social engineering works by exploiting human psychology (trust, urgency, fear) to manipulate individuals into making mistakes or divulging information, often through convincing fabricated scenarios or impersonation.</p> 
<p>Q: How are Helpdesks Targeted in AI Voice Cloning Attacks? A: Attackers use AI to mimic an employee's voice from audio samples, then call the helpdesk, posing as that individual. They request sensitive actions like password resets or new device enrollments, often claiming urgency or a broken device to bypass MFA.</p> 
<p>Q: What is an Example of a Social Engineering Attack? A: A vishing attack where an attacker calls a helpdesk, impersonating an executive who "forgot" their password. Using publicly available details, they pressure the agent to bypass verification and reset credentials for a "critical project."</p>

<p>A second phone number is&nbsp;an additional phone number that you can use on your existing device, separate from your primary number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You use a second phone number to shield your personal phone number in situations where you don’t want to give out your private line.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers (or secondary phone numbers, as they’re sometimes called) can be either tied to a traditional SIM or operate on an internet connection (VoIP numbers). VoIP or “voice over IP” phone numbers are assigned to a user and not to a physical location. A VoIP second phone number is often called a virtual phone number.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers are usually kept permanently or long-term for things like separating work and personal life, signing up for services, travelling, shopping online, and interacting with people and organizations you don’t know or trust. They can help you organize your communications, manage and secure accounts and services, reduce the risk of scams to your private line, and protect against unwanted contact.</p>



<p>Considering a person’s personal phone number is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/shocking-privacy-facts-our-ceo-told-naomi-brockwell-about-cell-phones/">most valuable piece of data</a> to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">advertisers</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">criminals</a>, shielding it with a second phone number is a smart privacy move. But what can be even smarter is protecting your personal phone number with a bunch of secondary phone numbers and using them for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">different purposes in your work and personal life</a>.</p>

 Introduction <p>The convergence of AI and blockchain technology is no longer a futuristic concept — it’s happening now. Imagine large language models (LLMs) like Claude or ChatGPT directly interacting with blockchain networks. Developers could build decentralized applications in a far more intuitive and efficient manner.</p><p>We’ve developed the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Metadium blockchain to make this vision a reality. This server empowers AI models to interact with the Metadium network using natural language, enabling seamless accessTJ to core blockchain functions.</p><p>(This technology is already integrated into MChat, which was recently launched.)</p> Metadium + MCP: A Perfect&nbsp;Match <p>Metadium is a next-generation blockchain platform optimized for decentralized identity (DID) management. It supports DID protocols, smart contracts, and token standards such as MRC20 and MRC721, allowing users to retain complete control over their digital identities.</p><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, enables AI models to interact with external systems in a structured way. With MCP, AI can go beyond text generation and execute real-world tasks through direct system integration.</p> Key Features  1. Comprehensive Account Management <p>The Metadium MCP server supports a wide range of blockchain account operations:</p>  Balance Check: Retrieve METADIUM token balances for up to 20 addresses simultaneously  Transaction History: Access both external and internal transaction logs  Token Tracking: View MRC20 and MRC721 token holdings and transfer&nbsp;activity  Mining Records: Trace mined blocks by a specific&nbsp;address   @mcp.tool()<br>async def get_metadium_balance(addresses: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get METADIUM Balance for one or more addresses (max 20)"""<br>if len(addresses) == 0 or len(addresses) &gt; 20:<br>raise ValueError("addresses must contain 1–20 items")<br># … implementation details  2. Smart Contract Integration <p>Developers can seamlessly interact with smart contracts:</p>  ABI Retrieval: Access verified contracts’ Application Binary Interface  Source Code: View the source code of verified contracts  Contract Verification: Automate source code verification for new contracts   3. DID&nbsp;Support <p>Specialized tools for managing Metadium’s decentralized identity&nbsp;system:</p>  DID Stats: Track issuance by hour, day, or&nbsp;month  Total Issuance: Retrieve the real-time total number of issued&nbsp;DIDs   async def get_total_issued_dids() -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get total number of issued DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)"""<br>function_selector = "0xa1707e7b" # Call the nextEIN() function<br>call_data = {"to": MAINNET_DID_REGISTRY, "data": function_selector}<br># … Contract call via JSON-RPC  4. Full Ethereum JSON-RPC Compatibility <p>As an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, Metadium supports all standard JSON-RPC API functions:</p>  Block Info: Retrieve detailed block data by hash or&nbsp;number  Transaction Handling: Send transactions, track status, and fetch&nbsp;receipts  Gas Estimation: Predict gas requirements for transactions  Event Logs: Filter and view smart contract event&nbsp;logs   Technical Architecture  Modular Design <p>The MCP server is organized into clearly separated modules:</p> ├── api_client.py # HTTP/JSON-RPC client<br>├── accounts/ # Account-related features<br>├── contracts/ # Smart contract features<br>├── eth_namespace/ # Ethereum-compatible API<br>├── statistics/ # Network statistics<br>└── others.py # Utility functions  Asynchronous Processing <p>All blockchain interactions use Python’s async/await to ensure high performance and responsiveness through concurrent requests:</p> async def make_jsonrpc_request(<br>method: str, params: List[Any] = None, request_id: int = 1<br>) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:<br>response = await client.post(JSONRPC_API_BASE, headers=headers, json=payload)<br>return response.json()  Human-Friendly Data Transformation <p>Hexadecimal blockchain data is automatically converted into readable decimal format for both AI models and end&nbsp;users:</p> def add_decimal_fields_to_block(block_data: Dict[str, Any]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>hex_fields = ["baseFeePerGas", "difficulty", "gasLimit", "gasUsed", …]<br>for field in hex_fields:<br>if field in result and result[field].startswith("0x"):<br>decimal_value = hex_to_decimal(result[field])<br>modified_result[f"{field}_decimal"] = decimal_value  Real-World Use&nbsp;Cases  1. AI-Powered Blockchain Analytics <p>Developers can ask Claude natural-language queries&nbsp;like:</p><p>“Analyze DID issuance patterns over the past 7 days and list all MRC20 token transfers from this contract in chronological order.”</p> 2. Smart Contract Development Support <p>Smart contract developers can speed up their workflows:</p><p>“Fetch the ABI of this contract, estimate gas costs for each function, and suggest optimization strategies.”</p> 3.

 Identity assurance is the goal 

<p>When we think about authentication, we think of gaining access to sensitive resources. We want some level of barrier so the data isn’t publicly available. It’s not enough to merely add a barrier, though. Wouldn’t it be more useful to have assurances that the user’s credentials are uniquely theirs and that no one can impersonate them? It’s more than a fence around the data; we also have assurances that the user accessing the data is who they say they are. It sounds great in theory.</p>

<p>We want to balance security requirements with our users’ comfort in an ideal world. Increased security requirements may increase user friction points. The more friction points a user encounters, the lower their satisfaction, engagement, and app usage – the balance point changes depending on the app user and the data sensitivity. For example, requirements may differ for public applications catering to consumers (B2C) versus internal applications used within an organization’s workforce.</p>

<p>Let’s navigate this balancing act together so you can find the right path for your needs.</p>

 Demystifying authentication factors 

<p>Before we dive into possible solutions, let’s review the three authentication factor categories:</p>



    
    
      Something you know <br>
      Knowledge factors include passwords and PINs
    


    
    
    Something you have<br>
    Possession factors include devices such as smart cards, security keys, phones, and tablets
    


    
    
    Something you are<br>
    Inference factors include biometrics such as fingerprints and facial recognition
    



<p>Authentication relies on one or more factor categories to establish identity assurances before granting users access to applications.</p>

 Embrace phishing-resistant authentication 

<p>The best-in-class, more secure, and recommended authentication methods are phishing-resistant. Phishing-resistant authentication is more difficult to hack and mitigates unauthorized access due to intercepting PINs and sign-in links.<br>
Phishing-resistant authentication relies on biometrics and specialized devices or equipment to prevent an attacker from accessing your application.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant factors include the following forms.</p>

 Smart cards and PIV cards 

<p>Large enterprises, regulated industries, and government entities widely use smart cards and PIV cards. These organizations may issue smart cards for attaching personal profiles to shared workstation access, as seen in banks or hospitals. Organizations may issue cards to their workforce even when the employee uses an issued laptop as an extra security measure.</p>

<p>Pros: Secure, can be uniquely tied to the user, and well utilized in industries</p>

<p>Cons: Requires a physical device that can be lost or stolen, not scalable to use for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience</p>

 Security keys and hardware devices 

<p>Hardware security keys are another elevated security mechanism organizations use for their workforce. Security keys can have differing levels of security, from the older and less secure Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) keys, Near Field Communication (NFC) keys that require a secondary device such as a phone, and keys requiring biometrics. For the highest level of security, you’ll want to use keys and hardware with biometric capabilities. Security keys work by storing the credentials on hardware, which requires registering the key on each device you use. While keys that plug into computers may be familiar, biometric-capable hardware, such as a laptop, and capable software can also be a phishing-resistant authentication factor. Okta FastPass on a biometric-capable computer is an example of a phishing-resistant hardware device.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based hardware devices are highly secure.</p>

<p>Cons: It may require a physical device, you need to register the key on each device you use, and it isn’t scalable for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience. Device manufacturers can make them small and lightweight for convenience, alleviating concerns about relying on bulky equipment. But what happens if the user loses or damages this device? How long would it take before they have access to the system again?</p>

 FIDO2 with WebAuthn and Passkeys 

<p>FIDO2 and WebAuthn combined are a strong authentication factor that utilizes biometrics on capable devices and new capabilities in web frameworks to increase user security reliably. This factor requires a biometric-capable device meeting FIDO standards, such as a phone or a laptop, and capable software. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">World Wide Web Consortium spec for web authentication</a> (WebAuthn) means JavaScript-based web apps can support phishing-resistant authentication right in the browser. The difference between phishing-resistant hardware factors, such as security keys or Okta FastPass on biometric devices and Passkeys, is discoverability and the ability to port credentials. Instead of storing credentials on the hardware, discoverable FIDO authentication stores credentials outside software, such as in the iCloud Keychain or Android Keystore. The credential storage makes authenticating on the same site across different devices within the same ecosystem possible without re-registering.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based FIDO authentication is secure, scales for public and consumer users, and there is no need to carry a security key or card</p>

<p>Cons: Each app must support this authentication method, and consumers must own capable devices</p>

<p>For the highest levels of identity security, use phishing-resistant factors.</p>

 Phishing-resistant factors decision tree 

<p>We recommend phishing-resistant factors at Okta as they offer the best application protection. You have identity assurances built in, along with authentication security. Consider this decision tree for your authentication needs:</p>

<p></p>

 Avoid weak authentication methods 

<p>We no longer live in a world where passwords alone are good enough to secure sensitive resources. Studies have shown that over <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">80% of data breaches result from compromised credentials</a>. We must elevate authentication methods by avoiding weak credentials and preferring more substantial forms. Look towards industry leaders in cybersecurity, including companies such as Okta, nonprofit foundations such as OWASP, and government standards such as <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management">NCSC</a>, to guide you towards strong factors and away from weak ones. In particular, be wary of legacy factors.</p>

 Avoid security questions as a factor 

<p>Cybersecurity organizations do not recommend security questions, as they are neither secure nor reliable. Security questions are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. It’s best to avoid this method.</p>

 SMS one-time codes are unsafe 

<p>Attackers can access those messages through SIM-swapping and interception attacks. NIST proposes deprecating SMS as an authentication factor, so consider alternate authentication methods.</p>

 Email Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) have similar security issues as SMS 

<p>Using email for TOTP presents similar security issues as SMS codes. Attackers can intercept email. Emails may mistakenly get flagged as spam. Email delivery delays can result in configuring longer time validity periods, causing lower security.</p>

 Avoid password antipatterns 

<p>Passwords must evolve by allowing longer character lengths and character variety. Avoid antipatterns such as complexity requirements and forced password resets. Enforce strong passwords by checking them against compromised password databases. Password managers can offset user risks by recommending unique, strong passwords for each site and applying the stored passwords. Still, password managers aren’t failproof, and users may use insecure passwords for the password manager themselves.</p>

<p>These factors do offer a weak barrier to sensitive resources, but a key element is missing: identity assurance. The weak authentication factors lack the safeguards to ensure the users making the authentication challenge are who they say they are.</p>

 Elevate authentication security with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) 

<p>Passwords alone require caution, but a combination of passwords and other factors elevates identity security. A single legacy authentication factor is rarely secure enough to protect any resource; it isn’t safe enough to access your users and Okta configuration.</p>

<p>Adding factors such as authenticator apps supporting TOTP and push authentication increases the barriers to sensitive data. Raising the barriers helps protect your application by requiring more effort for impersonators trying to hack accounts. However, using the weakest authentication factors combined isn’t as strong as phishing-resistant.</p>

 Combine strong authentication factors 

<p>The best way to ensure authentication security and reasonable identity assurances is to combine moderate to high authentication factors. Doing so supports good security with secure fallback systems. For example, if you can’t use phishing-resistant authentication in a consumer scenario, layer a password with push authentication. Allow the consumer to opt into Passkeys while supporting MFA. For workforce scenarios, issue hardware keys as a backup factor in addition to Okta FastPass.</p>

<p>Okta’s authentication policy builder can help you create strong authentication requirements to access Okta services and applications protected by Okta’s sign-in while tailoring session lifetimes to your needs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s time we evolve our application’s authentication security and favor phishing-resistant factors.</p>
</blockquote>

 Customize authentication requirements dynamically 

<p>Identity security isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. FIDO2 with WebAuthn factors such as Okta FastPass for workforce use cases and Passkeys for consumer use cases can be the standard methodology.</p>

 Consider Adaptive MFA for conditional authentication requirements 

<p>Complex use cases call for more tailoring. Your needs may change depending on use factors such as geographic location, IP addresses, device attributes, and threat detection. Identity Providers offer solutions that help you tailor authentication security. For example, Okta supports features such as <a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/adaptive-authentication/">Adaptive MFA</a>, which adjusts authentication requirements depending on context, and <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/itp/overview.htm">Identity Threat Protection</a>, which continuously monitors threats and can react by terminating authenticated sessions. If your industry requires the highest levels of identity security or your application contains highly sensitive resources, look to these options.</p>

 Revalidate identity for sensitive resource requests 

<p>Identity assurances don’t have to happen only at application entry. When sensitive actions and data require elevated authentication, consider using the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-step-up-authentication-when-to-use-it/">Step Up Authentication Challenge</a> to protect resources. The Step Up Authentication Challenge is an OAuth standard for requiring secure factors or recent authentication when performing actions within the application.</p>

<p>Third-party interactions may require identity assurances. While we primarily think about authenticating as a solo activity, think about the case where someone calls into a help center for support. The help center agent needs to verify identity remotely, and we don’t want to rely only on weak methods such as passwords or pins. Consider using <a>Client-Initiated Back-channel Authentication (CIBA)</a> for your application in cases like this.</p>

<p>What do all these recommendations mean for developers working on these applications? How can we take advantage of identity security best practices?</p>

 Build secure apps by applying identity security concepts 

<p>We developers have a tough job. We must ensure our applications meet compliance requirements and guard against security threats, all while delivering product features. Authentication is foundational, but not your entire product line. It’s an expectation that doesn’t drive product innovations for your app, but detrimental when implemented incorrectly.</p>

 Use an Identity Provider (IDP) that supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>To best protect your application and free yourself from getting into the weeds of implementing authentication, delegate it to your Identity Provider (IdP) whenever possible. When you delegate authentication to an IdP like Okta, you can access industry-recognized best practices, such as using OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards with user redirect for the authentication challenge. Redirecting the user to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget frees you from managing authentication methods manually. It allows you to leverage the Sign-in Widget user challenge with the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) for phishing-resistant authentication factors. Using the Okta Identity Engine means your app accesses the latest and greatest features for secure identity management.</p>

 Delegate authentication to your Identity Provider (IDP) 

<p>When you redirect the user to Okta for sign-in, you make authentication Okta’s problem. And that’s great because it provides you with the most security and the least amount of work. Your Okta administrator can configure authentication policies and add business rules to those authentication user challenges. You don’t have to worry about how to implement WebAuthn in your app, ensuring you have all the user controls to handle push notifications, or track sign-in context to adapt authentication factors. It’s all handled. All you need to know is whether the user completed authentication challenges, and then you can return to delivering features.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned a browser redirect for sign in degrades user experience or if your application’s use case demands a custom look and feel, you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget’s styles. When you combine a custom-branded Sign-In Widget with a custom domain, your users may never know they leave your site. We’re continuing to build out capabilities in this area so you can deliver both secure identity and branding requirements. Be on the lookout for content about customizing sign in.</p>

 Use a vetted and well-maintained OIDC client library 

<p>A vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library increases implementation speed, lowers developer effort, and, most importantly, is crucial for authentication security. Because OAuth 2.1 and OIDC are open standards, writing your code to handle the required transactions is tempting. Resist the temptation for the sake of your application security and the efforts for the continued maintenance that good authentication libraries require. It’s too easy to introduce developer error in something like the Proof-Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) verification steps or to miss something in the token verification, for example. <a href="https://salt.security/blog/traveling-with-oauth-account-takeover-on-booking-com">Many more subtle errors can adversely affect your application</a>. Resist the temptation.</p>

<p>The standards can also change over time, such as adding new protection mechanisms or introducing breaking changes. Writing custom implementation means changes and maintenance become your responsibility, and you <a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-oidc-mistakes-7f3bb909518b">can’t presume prior spec knowledge is good enough, as specs can change</a>. Resist the temptation and take this responsibility off your plate.</p>

<p>Ideally, use a vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library that is <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/">OIDC-certified</a> or the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/">Okta SDKs</a>. Okta’s SDKs not only securely handle the OAuth handshake and token storage for you, but you’ll also get built-in support for the latest advancements in OAuth specs, such as Step Up Authentication Challenge, CIBA, and more.</p>

 Join the identity security evolution 

<p>Protect your workforce and customers by elevating authentication factors using phishing-resistant factors. Allow Okta to work for you by configuring strong authentication policies. Enable dynamic authentication factors and threat detection in your Okta org to mitigate data breaches and strengthen your reputation.</p>

<p>In your software applications, leverage Okta SDKs to redirect users to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget to quickly gain access to the more secure authentication factors efficiently and seamlessly. Then, build more safety in your apps by adding the Step Up Authentication Challenge to maintain identity security. Staying updated with the latest security best practices and thoughtfully integrating OAuth specs are essential to secure identity management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply these key takeaways</p>

But as the use cases for Web3 evolve, touching AI, real-world assets, and scientific modeling, those same design principles begin to feel limiting.</p><p>Smart contracts were never meant to think. They can’t infer, predict, adapt, or process complexity the way humans (or AI) can.

DeSci Protocols: Scientific research platforms can outsource high-performance modeling (e.g. protein folding, climate simulation) to Noosphere agents.  On-Chain RWA Intelligence: Tokenized real-world assets (real estate, receivables) gain real-time valuations, credit scores, or logistics tracking via AI models verified through Noosphere.  Decentralized Compliance &amp; KYC (with Booost): AI agents trained on regulatory data assess AML risk or compliance patterns and return auditable scores. When paired with Booost’s proof-of-humanity, it enables dynamic, compliant onboarding across ecosystems.  Inference Markets for Synthetic Datasets: Researchers can generate and verify AI-based interpretations in medical, legal, or financial contexts. Tokens are staked to incentivize validation, with outputs coordinated and verified through Noosphere.  <p>As decentralized applications evolve beyond static logic and into intelligent, adaptive systems, the need for verifiable off-chain computation becomes urgent. Noosphere fills this gap, not by replacing smart contracts, but by extending their capabilities with off-chain AI reasoning, data coordination, and secure delegation. Whether you’re building in DeFi, DeSci, RWA, or beyond, Noosphere unlocks the infrastructure to make your dApps not just programmable, but truly intelligent.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/noosphere-a-gateway-to-verifiable-off-chain-intelligence-9eb6a4523fb5">Noosphere: A Gateway to Verifiable Off-Chain Intelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>“Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation. These terms get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.” </p>



<p>That distinction matters when designing resilient infrastructure that supports trust.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. 



 Disinformation is deliberately deceptive content, often politically or financially motivated. 



 Malinformation is factual information used out of context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most of our efforts to address these problems focus on content, activities like fact-checking, moderation, and takedown requests. And those are important. But after sitting through multiple sessions at <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20</a> last month, I came away thinking about the architectures that enable or undermine digital trust in the first place. (Did you see my post <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/29/wsis20-and-identity-governance/">last week</a> on learnings from WSIS+20?)</p>



<p>Remember, trust doesn’t start with content. It actually starts with infrastructure.</p>



<p>The people in those WSIS+20 rooms weren’t talking about disinformation in the abstract. They were talking about humanitarian workers in the field, where timely, accurate, and secure information can be a matter of life and death. They talked about public health campaigns, peacekeeping missions, and journalists trying to survive in an environment where lies move faster than truth. And in almost every session, it became clear that the technical underpinnings of the Internet—especially in crisis and conflict settings—are being overlooked.</p>

 Identity is part of the equation 



<p>While identity wasn’t explicitly discussed in these sessions, it’s a critical part of establishing authenticity, which in turn helps build trust. IAM systems can’t prevent disinformation, but they can help validate source integrity and support accountability.</p>



 
 Verified senders can be identified without compromising privacy. 



 Digital credentials can establish provenance for content or data. (Shout out to the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> work here!) 



 Attribute-based access can help ensure information reaches the right people in the right roles. 
 



<p>I’m not promoting centralized control or surveillance. What I want is to build confidence in the systems we rely on to make decisions, especially in high-stakes environments.</p>



 Disinformation and infrastructure resilience 



<p>Something I thought about as I settled down with my notes after the event, though it wasn’t phrased this way quite like this during any of the sessions: When infrastructure fails, it doesn’t just disrupt services; it disrupts the foundation of trust that identity and information systems rely on. Several sessions at WSIS+20 focused on resilient digital infrastructure, especially in the context of sustainability and the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Speakers from IEEE, CERN, and disaster risk reduction agencies reminded us that resilience is more than just a technical property; it’s what enables everything. Disinformation thrives when infrastructure fails. That includes failures of availability, integrity, and interoperability. When identity systems falter, the ability to authenticate sources, validate messages, and maintain digital trust during crisis response suffers, too.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure often isn’t designed to serve people in remote or underserved areas. 



 Technical standards don’t always account for multilingual or multi-platform accessibility. 



 Short-term, market-driven decisions prioritize scalability over long-term resilience. 
 



<p>Standards developers and IAM professionals know this at a technical level. Heck, I wrote about this a few weeks ago in a post on <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/01/resilience-in-standards/">resilience in standards.</a> But what’s often missed is how infrastructure failure becomes a governance issue. When people lose trust in digital systems, they distrust more than just the failed platform. They also start to distrust institutions and even each other.</p>



 Resilience isn’t for other people 



<p>IAM systems face similar challenges: do we build for edge cases, or optimize for the majority? Whose threat model are we prioritizing? How do we balance user experience with verifiability?</p>



<p>Just to make it more complicated, there is the fact that technology designed to protect can also exclude.</p>



 
 Overly strict verification requirements can lock out vulnerable populations. 



 Misapplied protections can be used to suppress journalism or advocacy. 



 “Safety” features can become surveillance tools in the wrong hands. 
 



<p>Even well-intentioned systems can marginalize people when their design doesn’t include a wide range of needs and experiences.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem. And digital identity experts and standards architects have a role to play.</p>



 Closing the loop: From resilience back to disinformation 



<p>The sections above touched on how resilient, inclusive infrastructure supports digital trust. But let’s not lose sight of the central theme: disinformation. It spreads most easily where infrastructure is brittle, trust is low, and identity signals are weak or absent. That’s why the work of IAM professionals and standards developers matters—not just for security or compliance, but for defending the conditions in which truth can survive.</p>



 So, what can identity professionals do? 



<p>I love it when a plan comes together, and the plan here is to think about fighting disinformation and improving the resilience of our systems.</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal: Build IAM systems that account for low-connectivity, low-trust environments. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern: Support verifiable claims, provenance metadata, and strong-but-private identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations: Push for feedback loops between standards bodies, policymakers, and civil society. Ask who is being served and who isn’t. 
 



 And what can standards architects do? 



 
 Define and document trust assumptions: Clearly state what the system assumes about message integrity, source authenticity, and the broader infrastructure. Make those assumptions visible and testable. 



 Design for degraded conditions: Create standards that support verifiability even when connectivity is intermittent, metadata is partial, or infrastructure is compromised. 



 Include threat models beyond fraud: Consider disinformation campaigns, information suppression, and adversarial use of identity signals in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process: Include journalists, humanitarian responders, civil society groups, and policy experts in standards development. Their use cases will expand your view of what “interoperable” and “resilient” really mean. 
 



 Building for trust means building for everyone 



<p>Trust isn’t just about whether users believe your system is secure. It’s about whether they believe the Internet is still a place where truth can be found and relied upon. That belief erodes when digital systems exclude marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented users, whose experiences and threat models are often left out of design decisions. And that erosion creates fertile ground for disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation to take root.</p>



<p>This connection wasn’t made explicitly in the WSIS+20 sessions, but it became clear to me: trust in digital systems isn’t separate from trust in public discourse. If we want to defend the truth, we have to build systems that serve the whole public, not just the easy parts of it.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem, and identity has a role to play.</p>



<p>This work is messy. It spans disciplines, sectors, and priorities. But if we want trustworthy systems, we have to build them with and for the people who rely on them most. That starts with looking beyond our immediate use cases and asking harder questions about who benefits, who’s left out, and what it means to build for trust in a world where truth itself is contested.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest<br>[00:00:04]</p>



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Disinformation, Really? 



<p>[00:00:29]</p>



<p>Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation.</p>



<p>They may sound similar, but these terms have crucial differences. And if we want to design digital systems that truly support trust and accountability, those differences matter.</p>



<p>This week, I’m sharing an unexpected takeaway from my time at WSIS+20 in Geneva. I left that event with a strong belief that disinformation isn’t just a content problem — it’s an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And that infrastructure includes identity.</p>



 



 Defining the Terms 



<p>[00:01:05]</p>



<p>Let’s start with some clear definitions — because words matter.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. Think: hearing a rumor and passing it along without realizing it’s untrue. 



 Disinformation is intentionally deceptive, crafted and spread to influence behavior or opinion, often politically or financially. 



 Malinformation is true, but used maliciously — like doxing someone or leaking sensitive context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most efforts to combat these focus on content — fact-checking, takedowns, moderation policies. And that work is vital.</p>



<p>But what I heard in the WSIS sessions wasn’t just about policies. It was about digital infrastructure.</p>



 



 Real-World Impact: Why Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:02:00]</p>



<p>Here are a few stories that helped this hit home:</p>



 
 Humanitarian workers struggling to communicate securely in conflict zones. 



 Journalists fighting to survive and tell the truth amid algorithmic lies. 



 Peacekeeping missions and public health campaigns racing to get accurate information out before disinformation spreads faster. 
 



<p>In all these cases, trust didn’t hinge on whether someone flagged a tweet. It depended on whether the underlying systems could support or sabotage the truth.</p>



 



 Technical Failures Become Governance Failures 



<p>[00:03:02]</p>



<p>If your network goes down, people will turn to unofficial channels.<br>If your logs are incomplete or timestamps unverifiable, message integrity falls apart.<br>If your system can’t authenticate a sender, how do you know whether or not to act?</p>



<p>That’s not just a technical failure — it’s a governance failure.</p>



<p>And when people lose trust in digital systems, the consequences ripple outward:</p>



 
 Trust in platforms erodes 



 Trust in institutions falters 



 Trust in each other breaks down 
 



 



 Where Identity Comes Into Play 



<p>[00:03:45]</p>



<p>Interestingly, identity wasn’t a primary topic in most disinformation sessions. But it kept showing up — just at the edges.</p>



<p>Because when you ask:</p>



 
 Who sent this message? 



 Has it been tampered with? 



 Is this authentic? 
 



<p>You’re really asking identity questions.</p>



<p>Identity systems can help us answer those questions without sacrificing privacy, by:</p>



 
 Establishing provenance 



 Enabling verified senders to be trusted faster 



 Supporting credentials that show who said what, and when 



 Ensuring information flows to the right people at the right time 
 



<p>While identity and access management alone can’t solve the disinformation crisis, they’re essential tools in restoring trust in the systems where that information travels.</p>



 



 Designing for True Resilience 



<p>[00:04:50]</p>



<p>Another recurring theme at WSIS+20 was resilience. Not just uptime and backups — real resilience.</p>



<p>How systems perform in messy, unpredictable, even dangerous environments.</p>



<p>Sessions on sustainability, infrastructure, and disaster response included speakers from IEEE, CERN, physicists, and others who manage risk daily.</p>



<p>One takeaway stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Resilience isn’t just technical — it’s a social contract.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When resilience breaks down, we’re breaking that contract. We’re designing for the well-connected, the resourced, the mainstream — not for:</p>



 
 Remote communities 



 Multilingual populations 



 Low-trust or high-risk environments 
 



<p>And identity systems? They struggle with this all the time.</p>



 



 Exclusion Creates Fertile Ground for Disinformation 



<p>[00:06:02]</p>



<p>Strict verification protects against fraud. But what if you’re a displaced person without documents?</p>



<p>In trying to protect, we often exclude. And where people are excluded, disinformation grows.</p>



<p>Because people turn to what’s available. If trustworthy systems aren’t available — or don’t work for them — they’ll turn to anything that is.</p>



<p>So bringing this back full circle, disinformation thrives where:</p>



 
 Systems can’t verify sources 



 Users don’t trust what they see 



 Infrastructure fails or excludes 
 



<p>If your digital trust infrastructure — identity included — only works in ideal conditions, then you’ve built perfect conditions for disinformation.</p>



 



 Why Identity Standards Matter 



<p>[00:07:01]</p>



<p>Identity and access management (IAM) standards matter because they define the defaults.</p>



<p>They determine:</p>



 
 What’s interoperable 



 What can be verified 



 Whether truth can be seen, heard, and trusted 
 



<p>So if you’re an identity professional, what can you actually do?</p>



 



 What Identity Professionals Can Do 



<p>[00:07:25]</p>



<p>Here are some tangible steps to start with:</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal<br>Consider low-connectivity and low-trust environments. Build for those, too. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern<br>Support verifiable claims, embed provenance, and use privacy-preserving identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations<br>Don’t outsource this to policymakers. Collaborate with:
 
 Standards groups 



 Civil society 



 Policymakers 



 Employers 
 
 
 



<p>Ask hard questions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who’s being served? Who’s being left out?</p>
</blockquote>



 



 For Standards Architects: You Are My People 



<p>[00:08:20]</p>



<p>If you work on protocols, specs, or standards, here’s your to-do list:</p>



 
 Define layout and trust assumptions<br>Spell out what the system presumes about message integrity and infrastructure. 



 Design for degraded conditions<br>Don’t assume perfect metadata or nonstop uptime. 



 Think beyond fraud<br>Include disinformation, suppression, and misuse in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process<br>Bring in:
 
 Journalists 



 Emergency responders 



 Civil society leaders 
 
 
 



<p>Their use cases will expand your understanding and improve your solutions.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts: Trust as a Design Mandate 



<p>[00:09:30]</p>



<p>Trust isn’t just about security. It’s about whether people believe in digital systems at all.</p>



<p>When systems exclude people — by design or by neglect — trust erodes.<br>And in that erosion, disinformation thrives.</p>



<p>That’s what stood out to me most at WSIS+20.</p>



<p>If we want to fight mis-, dis-, and malinformation, we can’t just treat it as a content problem.</p>



<p>We must treat it as an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And identity professionals and standards architects?<br>We’re part of the solution.</p>



<p>It’s messy work. Cross-disciplinary. Politically thorny. Often frustrating.<br>But if we want trustworthy systems, we must build them for everyone — not just the easy users.</p>



<p>So keep asking:</p>



 
 Who’s benefiting? 



 Who’s being left out? 
 



<p>Make it explicit. Even if it’s uncomfortable.</p>



<p>What does it really mean to build for trust, in a world where truth itself is constantly contested?</p>



<p>Food for thought. And thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Imagine I got a FaceTime call from my daughter right now, tears streaming down her face, desperately pleading for help. “Dada, I’m stuck somewhere. I need some money right now. I lost my wallet. Could you just send me an Apple gift card?” The voice is unmistakably hers. The face looks exactly right. My parental instincts would kick in, and the probability of me actually getting taken by it and sending her money would be very, very high. Except my daughter is safely at home, completely unaware of what just happened. I would have just become the latest victim of an AI voice cloning attack that required nothing more than a 15-second voice sample to execute.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks are happening every day, and cybersecurity experts are warning that we’re on the brink of an epidemic that will make traditional phone scams look like child’s play.</p>
 From Comedy Central to Criminal Enterprise: The Evolution of Voice Mimicry 
<p>Voice attacks aren’t new. For decades, skilled impressionists have made careers out of mimicking celebrities on Comedy Central and late-night television. Turn on your TV, go watch any stand-up comedy where people mimic the voice of somebody else. Not everybody is good at mimicry, there are a few people who are really good at it, and that’s their skill set, and they make a living out of it.</p>
<p>So, what’s the difference? What once required rare talent and years of practice can now be accomplished by anyone with a smartphone and access to AI tools.</p>
<p>You can literally take a voice sample of 20 seconds, 15 seconds, and trust me, getting a voice sample of any user is a piece of cake. You can record them in a meeting, in webinars, at conferences. Taking a voice sample of a person, feeding it into an AI engine, and having AI generate paragraphs of text in your voice couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>The technology combines voice cloning with face swapping capabilities, creating what security professionals call “deepfakes”, AI-generated content that can make anyone appear to say or do anything. Unlike the obvious robotic voices of yesterday’s scam calls, these new attacks are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>
 The Perfect Storm: Why Voice Cloning Attacks Are About to Explode 
<p>Currently, sophisticated voice cloning technology requires some technical expertise to deploy effectively. But that barrier is rapidly disappearing. But before you snap your fingers, trust me, this is going to be in the palms of every individual on this planet because they are building AI agents, voice bots, chatbots, and all of them are available as apps on your phone.</p>
<p>The democratization of AI tools means that what once required specialized knowledge will soon be as simple as downloading an app. Combined with the wealth of voice samples available through social media, video calls, and public speaking engagements, attackers will have unprecedented access to the raw materials needed for convincing impersonations.</p>
<p>Consider the attack surface: every Zoom meeting, every Instagram story, every TikTok video, every voicemail message becomes potential ammunition for cybercriminals. For public figures, executives, or anyone with an online presence, avoiding voice sample collection is virtually impossible.</p>
 From Spam Calls to Family Emergencies: The Human Cost of AI Deception 
<p>The implications extend far beyond individual financial losses. Traditional text-based scams already trick thousands of people daily with messages claiming, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or gift card.” Now imagine those same scenarios playing out with the actual voice and face of a loved one making the plea.</p>
<p>Imagine what’s going to happen to all these spam calls that people have been receiving over time. Those text messages that you get, saying, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or an Apple Card or a gift card,” and people fall for it. Imagine that happening in the age of AI. It’s going to be rampant.</p>
<p>The psychological impact cannot be overstated. When a scammer can perfectly replicate your child’s voice expressing genuine distress, the emotional manipulation becomes exponentially more powerful. Traditional security awareness training that teaches people to “verify before you trust” becomes significantly more challenging when the verification methods themselves can be compromised.</p>
<p>For organizations, the threat is equally severe. Help desk calls from “employees” requesting password resets, IT support requests from “executives” demanding immediate access, and vendor communications requesting urgent payment changes all become potential attack vectors when voice authentication can be spoofed with AI precision.</p>
 The $4.4 Million Question: Counting the Cost of Deepfake Breaches 
<p>While comprehensive data on AI voice cloning losses is still emerging, the broader cybersecurity landscape provides sobering context.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach"> According to IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, the average cost of a data breach has reached a record high of <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/ibm-cost-data-breach-2025/">$10.22 million for US companies</a>, while the global average was $4.44 million.</p>
<p>The reputational damage may prove even more costly. Consumer trust, once lost, can take years to rebuild. According to recent research, <a href="https://vercara.digicert.com/news/vercara-research-75-of-u-s-consumers-would-stop-purchasing-from-a-brand-if-it-suffered-a-cyber-incident">75% of consumers would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident</a>. For organizations that handle sensitive customer data or financial transactions, a successful deepfake-enabled breach could trigger regulatory investigations, class-action lawsuits, and permanent customer defection.</p>
<p>Beyond direct financial losses, there’s the operational disruption. Companies targeted by sophisticated social engineering attacks often must shut down systems, reset credentials enterprise-wide, and implement emergency security protocols that can paralyze operations for days or weeks.</p>
 Beyond Traditional Defenses: The Rise of Liveness-Based Authentication 
<p>Traditional security measures are proving inadequate against AI-powered impersonation attacks. Standard multifactor authentication, password policies, and even basic biometric systems can be circumvented when attackers can convincingly impersonate authorized users during help desk interactions.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’re addressing this challenge head-on. If somebody is using biometrics to authenticate into a system, be it face, be it voice, be it anything, if we have the ability to identify that it’s crossed a certain threshold of risk with relationship to it being a deepfake or fake or AI-generated content, we can raise those signals. Our systems then have the ability to determine the kind of access they need to provide or even prevent access altogether based on those signals.</p>
<p>The solution lies in what we call “liveness detection”, technology that can distinguish between live human interaction and AI-generated content. We’ve developed systems that combine multiple authentication factors, including live facial scanning compared against government-issued credentials, to create what I call a “risk threshold” that determines whether access should be granted.</p>
<p>We look at all the fraud signals from various factors to generate what we call a risk threshold that could tell our systems what that system should or should not do with that access request or authentication attempt. The way we have designed our platform is to ensure that all the signals that we get when a user authenticates into the system, be it video, be it live ID, be it selfie, be it a document scan, or be it voice, we analyze these signals comprehensively.</p>
<p>This marks a shift away from reactive security measures that only respond after a breach has occurred. Instead, we focus on proactive security that works to stop threats before they happen.</p>
<p>Being proactive means putting systems in place that can detect voice attacks, deepfakes, and other forms of AI-generated impersonation early in the process. That kind of prevention is becoming essential as these attacks grow more advanced.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe it’s our responsibility to help users and organizations recognize and block these threats before any damage is done. Our biometric authentication platform is built to detect signs of manipulation in real time and prevent unauthorized access based on those signals.</p>
 Building Deepfake-Resistant Organizations: The Path Forward 
<p>The window for preparation is rapidly closing. As AI voice cloning tools become more accessible and sophisticated, organizations must implement robust detection and prevention measures before they become targets.</p>
<p>The most effective defense combines technological solutions with updated security protocols. This includes implementing liveness-based biometric authentication for all system access, training staff to recognize potential deepfake scenarios, and establishing verification procedures that don’t rely solely on voice or video confirmation.</p>
<p>For individual protection, the advice is equally urgent: establish out-of-band verification methods with family members, be skeptical of urgent financial requests regardless of apparent source, and understand that if something seems emotionally manipulative, it very well might be.</p>
<p>The threat of AI voice cloning isn’t a distant future concern, it’s a present-day reality that’s about to become exponentially more dangerous. Organizations and individuals who take proactive steps now will be far better positioned to defend against the inevitable wave of sophisticated impersonation attacks heading our way.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go, but companies are recognizing that threats like this are no longer a fairytale. They are very real. We believe that identity is the entry into any organization or into any IT assets. We need to be 100 times more careful and stringent about how we do deepfake checks.</p>

 The European Union passes major regulation to allow the private sector to read eIDs via Near Field Communication. 



<p>In a significant milestone in the evolution of Europe’s digital identity framework, the European Commission has adopted <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/1208/oj/eng">Regulation (EU) 2025/1208</a>, which authorizes private sector companies to access key data stored in the chips of electronic identity documents (eIDs), most notably the bearer’s portrait (DG2) via <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a> technology.</p>



<p>The regulation, which amends the original Commission Decision 2025/1218, came into force on July 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With NFC, identity verification moves from passive image capture to active chip-based validation, fundamentally transforming how businesses can confirm identities across onboarding journeys.</p>



 What’s changed and why it matters. 



<p>Until recently, access to the chip on EU member states’ national ID cards and biometric passports was largely restricted to border authorities. With Regulation 2025/1208 now adopted, private entities can legally read the facial image stored in DG2, provided the holder consents, using NFC technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This opens the door to more accurate, secure, fast, and automated identity proofing across industries like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, insurance, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecom</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/nfc-based-id-verification-shared-mobility/">mobility</a>, without compromising on privacy or regulatory integrity.</p>



 Let’s break it down: What’s in the chip? 



<p>eMRTDs (electronic Machine-Readable Travel Documents), such as biometric passports and eID cards, store personal data in a secure chip embedded in the document. This structure follows the globally recognized <a href="https://elibrary.icao.int/product/421430">ICAO 9303 standard,</a> developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which ensures interoperability and security across international borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chip’s contents are organized into Data Groups (DGs), each designed to hold specific types of information:</p>


 
 
 
 DG1: Machine-readable zone (MRZ) data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number)&nbsp; 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Retrieve electronic data from ID holder in secure way.</p>

 
 
 
 DG2: Biometric facial image (high-resolution portrait of the bearer) 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Biometric match to selfie.</p>

 
 
 
 DG3: Fingerprint data (accessible only to border and police authorities) 
 

<p>Private sector access? No.<br>Use case: Reserved for border and police use only.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>By reading the encrypted data directly from the chip, IDnow’s NFC-enabled verification confirms the authenticity and integrity of the document and the portrait photo, ensuring the person presenting it is its rightful holder.</p>

 Meet strict regulatory frameworks with confidence. 



<p>With NFC-enabled verification, businesses can:&nbsp;</p>



  Validate ID authenticity through cryptographic signatures&nbsp;  



  Verify the portrait from the chip (DG2) against a selfie or video for liveness detection&nbsp;  



  Read DG1 and DG2 simultaneously for cross-checking document and biometric consistency&nbsp;  



  Reduce false positives and manual review, accelerating onboarding&nbsp;  



<p>NFC-based identity verification isn’t just technically superior, it’s also compliant with both existing and emerging regulations:&nbsp;</p>



  National frameworks: Compliant with current schemes such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">GWG (Germany</a>), <a href="https://www.fma.gv.at/en/financial-market-supervision-in-austria/">FMA (Austria)</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI (France)</a>, and others across the EU.&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a>: The EU’s revised digital identity regulation, requiring high-assurance identity proofing methods for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), banks, and government services&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/future-of-amlr-identification-2027/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>: Recently approved and set to replace national laws by mid-2027. NFC supports fully automated, risk-based identity proofing in line with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence (CDD)</a> expectations.&nbsp;  



<p>So, whether you’re serving regulated industries or managing onboarding at scale, NFC verification gives you a future-proof foundation.</p>



 The IDnow NFC advantage. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC identity verification is already live and battle-tested across Europe, with tens of thousands of verifications processed every month.&nbsp;</p>



  Available globally: All new passports, residence permits, and national ID cards in the EU include NFC chips. Globally, most passports include this chip by default. In some regions, driving licences and other documents are also adopting chip-based formats.&nbsp;  



  Available for mobile app and mobile SDK integrations: Developer-friendly SDKs and APIs make it simple to integrate NFC into existing onboarding flows across platforms.&nbsp;  



  UX / speed: Onboarding can be completed in under one minute. Just tap the document. No manual data entry needed.&nbsp;  



  Conversion Rate: NFC onboarding shows higher success rates compared to optical scanning, thanks to improved read accuracy and fewer drop-offs.&nbsp;  



  Automation Rate: NFC verifications are fully automated, with no need for manual agent review. This accelerates onboarding and scales efficiently.&nbsp;  



  Security and data integrity: Cryptographic signature checks detect cloned or forged chips. Data is read with 100% accuracy, straight from the issuing authority.  



 NFC = No barriers to implementation. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC-enabled identity verification is available and fully compliant today. With Regulation (EU)&nbsp;2025/1208&nbsp;adopted, the private sector now has a clear legal foundation to access biometric data, such as the facial image stored on the chip of eID documents, with the user’s consent. This enables immediate integration of NFC verification into onboarding journeys.</p>



<p>Forward-thinking organizations that move early can gain a competitive edge by offering faster, more secure, and regulation-ready identity verification. Don’t wait for market-wide adoption, now is the time to optimize your onboarding flows and lead the way.</p>



 How it works: NFC-powered identity proofing, step by step. 



<p>So, what happens when a user taps their ID document with their phone? NFC-based identity verification transforms onboarding from a manual, error-prone process into a fast, secure, and fully automated journey. By reading encrypted data directly from the chip, rather than relying on photos or scans, IDnow ensures every verification is accurate, fraud-resistant, and compliant with the latest regulations.&nbsp;</p>



  Static capture: Capture the document’s MRZ to generate the key and decrypt the chip.&nbsp;  



  NFC readout: Instantly read secure data from the chip.&nbsp;  



  Selfie check: Capture a selfie for biometric face comparison and liveness detection.&nbsp;

<p>Let’s imagine you’re checking into a hotel after a long flight. You’re tired, hungry, and just want your key. But instead of fumbling with paperwork, the receptionist simply scans your passport and boom, your details are verified, and you’re all set. No typing. No waiting. No drama.</p>
<p>That seamless experience? It’s powered by passport recognition, a rapidly evolving technology that’s rewriting how we verify identity in real time.</p>
<p>So what’s under the hood of passport recognition, and why does it matter for businesses, governments, and consumers alike? Let’s explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Passport Recognition? 
<p>Passport recognition refers to the automated process of scanning and extracting information from a passport’s data page using computer vision and AI. It’s often part of a broader ID document recognition SDK, which can process various identity documents beyond passports, such as driver’s licenses or national IDs. It allows machines to identify and authenticate passports with high accuracy and often in seconds.</p>
<p>The core components include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) to extract name, passport number, expiry date, etc.
<p></p> 
 Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) decoding, where standardized passport data is stored.
<p></p> 
 Document validation using holograms, microprint, and UV patterns.
<p></p> 
 Face matching, comparing the passport photo to a live image or selfie.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Think of it like giving computers the ability to read and verify your passport like a border officer, only faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Traditional Passport Checks Don’t Cut It Anymore 
<p>Manual passport checks are vulnerable to:</p>
 
 Human error (typos, missed fakes)
<p></p> 
 Delays at airports, hotels, or secure facilities
<p></p> 
 Fraud through forged or tampered documents
<p></p> 
 
<p>In a world where speed and security matter equally, automated passport recognition offers a compelling alternative.</p>
<p>Quick stat: According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 73% of travelers prefer to use biometrics instead of passports for identity verification. That number is growing fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Passport Recognition Technology Works 
<p>Let’s lift the hood and see how the magic happens.</p>
 Step-by-Step Passport Recognition Process: 



Step
Description


1. Image Capture
A camera or mobile device captures the passport’s data page.


2. MRZ Detection
The system locates and isolates the machine-readable zone.


3. OCR Extraction
Characters from the MRZ and other fields are read via OCR.


4. Data Validation
The system checks for authenticity: font, format, expiry date, etc.


5. Face Match (Optional)
Compares the passport photo with a live selfie or stored biometric.



<p>With today’s advanced AI, the whole recognition flow wraps up in under three seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passport Recognition vs Traditional OCR: What’s the Difference? 



Feature
Traditional OCR
Passport Recognition


Accuracy
85–90%
97–99%


Security Features

<p>Passport recognition is not just OCR on steroids it’s an entirely smarter approach built for identity assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Industries Benefiting from Passport Recognition 
<p>From airports to Airbnb, industries across the board are embedding this technology into their platforms. Here’s where it’s making waves:</p>
  Travel &amp; Border Control 
 
 Automated border gates (e-gates)
<p></p> 
 Self-check-in kiosks
<p></p> 
 Immigration pre-screening
<p></p> 
 
<p>“With passport recognition, airports can reduce processing time by up to 40% during peak hours.” SITA Air Transport IT Insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Healthcare &amp; Insurance 
 
 ID verification during telehealth appointments
<p></p> 
 Onboarding for digital health insurance
<p></p> 
 Prescription fraud prevention
<p></p> 
 
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 KYC during account registration
<p></p> 
 Cross-border remittance validation
<p></p> 
 Preventing identity fraud in loan applications
<p></p> 
 
  Hospitality &amp; Rentals 
 
 Faster hotel check-ins
<p></p> 
 ID verification for short-term rental platforms (e.g., Airbnb)
<p></p> 
 VIP loyalty programs linked to passport data
<p></p> 
 
  Education &amp; Exams 
 
 Verifying student ID for international admissions
<p></p> 
 Securing online proctoring systems
<p></p> 
 
<p>The bottom line? If you deal with real humans and legal identity documents, passport recognition can tighten your security and smooth your UX.</p>
<p></p>
 The Power of Passport Recognition + Face Verification 
<p>On its own, passport recognition is impressive. But pair it with face verification, and the security multiplies.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 User scans their passport using a smartphone or webcam.
<p></p> 
 System extracts data and photo from the passport.
<p></p> 
 User takes a selfie or a live video.
<p></p> 
 The system uses AI to verify the passport photo against a real-time selfie.
<p></p> 
 Verification result is returned within seconds.
<p></p> 
 
<p>This combo stops impostors in their tracks, including those armed with stolen documents or digital fakes.</p>
<p> Bonus Tip: Want higher fraud resistance? Add <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">id document liveness detection SDK</a> capabilities to confirm the person behind the document is physically present not a still image or a video spoof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Using Passport Recognition in 2025 
<p>Let’s get specific about the benefits:</p>
  Speed 
<p>Verifies documents in under 3 seconds. Perfect for high-traffic systems and instant KYC.</p>
  Accuracy 
<p>Uses deep learning and AI to extract data with up to 99% accuracy even from worn or wrinkled documents.</p>
  Compliance 
<p>Helps meet global identity regulations like:</p>
 
 <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (Europe)
<p></p> 
 eIDAS (EU)
<p></p> 
 KYC/AML (Global finance)
<p></p> 
 HIPAA (U.S. Healthcare)
<p></p> 
 
  User Experience 
<p>No long forms. No typos. No delays.</p>
<p>Just scan, verify, done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Case Study: How Banks Use Passport Recognition 
<p>A leading European neobank integrated passport recognition into its digital onboarding.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
 
 Manual ID verification took 6–12 hours
<p></p> 
 20% drop-off due to long wait times
<p></p> 
 
<p>After:</p>
 
 Verification in under 60 seconds
<p></p> 
 Conversion rate improved by 37%
<p></p> 
 Fraud attempts decreased by 45%
<p></p> 
 
<p>Talk about ROI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges to Watch Out For 
<p>While powerful, passport recognition isn’t without its hurdles.</p>
  Low-Quality Images 
<p>Crinkled pages, bad lighting, or glare can cause recognition failures. Always guide users to scan in good light.</p>
  Document Forgery 
<p>Some fake passports can bypass simple OCR-only systems. That’s why layered security with AI, facial matching, and liveness detection is a must.</p>
  Device Limitations 
<p>Older mobile devices may struggle with camera quality. Make sure your SDK supports fallback options or minimum device specs.</p>
<p></p>
 Choosing the Right Passport Recognition SDK 
<p>Not all tools are created equal. Here’s what to look for in a solid passport recognition solution:</p>
 
  MRZ extraction &amp; validation
<p></p> 
  Face matching capability
<p></p> 
  Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
<p></p> 
  Real-time results (&lt; 3 seconds)
<p></p> 
  Built-in compliance (GDPR, KYC, AML)
<p></p> 
  Developer documentation &amp; SDK support
<p></p> 
 
<p>Some top players also include open-source demo tools, sample UIs, and REST APIs to make integration smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

			 Apex Digital 3.0 is Live – The Future of Finance Starts Now 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>To truly scale tokenisation, we need a global force at the heart of capital markets. A player with the reach, trust, and operational strength to be able to bring all stakeholders out of fragmented and manual systems into the future of on-chain finance.</p>
<p>That player is Apex Group.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Apex Group launched Apex Digital 3.0, the digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges traditional finance with on-chain finance at scale.</p>
<p>This is a turning point for our industry. Apex Digital 3.0 is not a product, it’s a movement to transform global finance, redefine distribution, and unlock liquidity. For the first time, a global asset servicer now offers blockchain-powered infrastructure for tokenisation and stablecoins, covering everything from regulatory setup, structuring to issuance, compliance, servicing, and global distribution.</p>
<p>In today’s market, launching a tokenised product is slow and fragmented. Issuers must juggle multiple providers, face regulatory complexity, and often wait months, only to end up with limited liquidity and poor distribution. It’s impossible to scale that way.</p>
<p>With Apex Digital 3.0, we’ve changed the game. Everything is integrated. Tokenising existing assets or natively issuing ones on-chain can be done within a few weeks. What’s more, Apex Group clients, who already entrust them to operate over $3.5 trillion in assets, can now move on-chain seamlessly, without changing the tools or workflows they know.</p>
<p>To them, it simply feels like an upgrade, and they will gain new capabilities. It includes 24/7 subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers; access to multiple secondary trading venues and borrowing or lending in a real-time DeFi application. No disruption. Just a next-generation investor experience.</p>
<p>What truly sets Apex Digital 3.0 apart is its ability to bring all stakeholders together, including issuers, investors, allocators, and distributors. Tokenised assets can connect directly with existing investor pools, including through multiple distribution channels and physical events like Apex Invest. This dramatically enhances both liquidity and distribution, solving one of the most critical and long-missing pieces in the industry.</p>
<p>Tokenisation finally works, at scale. Tokeny’s technology is the foundation of this transformation. We’re delivering blockchain capability that integrates across the entire value chain and fund lifecycle, enhancing the experience and value for all of Apex Group’s clients.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc are proud to be appointed to lead Apex Digital 3.0, powered by the full strength of the Tokeny team. Our mission becomes bigger: To transform financial markets and unlock access for all. Just as Microsoft put a computer on every desk, we’re building the digital infrastructure to put private assets in every portfolio, bringing the future of finance to everyone.</p>
<p>This marks a brand new chapter, and we’re proud to be writing it with you!</p>
