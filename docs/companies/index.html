  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>At this year’s European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC 2022) that we hosted in Berlin from May 10th to 13th, some topics stood out from all the vibrant discussions and enlightening presentations. My #1 topic is the emergence of integration between decentralized identity (DID) - also referred to Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) or as verifiable credentials - and traditional, centralized IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) and CIAM (Consumer IAM).</p>
<p>DID has been a hot topic at EIC for many years, but more as an innovation that is somewhat separate from traditional IAM. This started to change with last year’s announcement of GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network), which is sort of a semi-centralized (or semi-decentralized) model for identities.</p>
<p>To find out more on these topics, have a look at this blog post entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/guest/decentralized-identity-101-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters">Decentralized Identity 101: What It Is and Why It Matters</a> and this Leadership Brief entitled: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81119/gain-explained">GAIN Explained</a>.</p>
 DID and IAM convergence a hot topic 
<p>This year, a lot of talk has been about how to converge these worlds. How to enable authentication with a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lb81204/guide-to-implementing-decentralized-id">decentralized ID</a> and the proofs in the wallet to an enterprise, be it as employee, business partner, or customer? How to issue proofs for employees and others into their wallets?</p>
<p>Integration is rather straightforward, based on standards such as OpenID Connect and their upcoming extensions. Decentralized IDs can just become another means of onboarding users, based on all the verified information in the wallets, and letting users in, based on a successful, decentralized authentication. This allows for simplification of onboarding by relying on proven data, as well as relying on a strong proof of identities. Process and identity vetting costs can be reduced massively that way.</p>
<p>Beyond that, in policy-based authorizations, the proofs from the wallet can be used for delivering attributes used in decision making. If a proof isn’t valid anymore, this will become effective immediately.</p>
<p></p>
 The journey has just begun 
<p>There are many applications for making traditional IAM more efficient and powerful by integrating the decentralized and centralized identity approaches. That journey has just started, and to me this was the #1 trending topic at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022/agenda">EIC 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some links to presentations and panel discussions at EIC 2022 that looked at various aspects of decentralized identity:</p>

<p>Notes to readers:&nbsp;</p>
 
 The thinking for this post came as we prepare for the public launch of our AiP 1.0 mobile wallet app – and as we prepare to demonstrate AiP 2.0 compliance. 
 This post assumes that the holder is already in full control of their interactions and relationships. It also assumes that the entire way of delivering digital ID is user-driven. This post is specifically meant to make the reader think about how to create more stickiness around credential issuance implementations. 
 There is a need for better UX in SSI to spur more adoption – and we’re hopeful that “holder-driven credential issuance” can become a more common approach. 
 
<p>—</p>
 <br>
The process of credential issuance should be holder-driven 
<p>The holder must be somewhere in their user journey and have a specific need for a credential. At this point they need to provide some form of eligibility to claim a credential.</p>
<p>In Government-regulated scenarios, eligibility is often covered by foundational ID credentials. For example, “I’m a citizen of a country”, or “I’m of age of majority”.</p>
<p>The type of information exchange, whether as a credential offer received or a proof presented depends on the type of relationship that you wish to establish with the other entity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you may not want to share your government-issued driver’s licence to all your peers as your proof of identity; you may want to share your digital driver’s licence with a financial institution to open up a bank account, but with others you may trust to share only your utility bill.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
Relationships and personas 
<p>Even though the proof requests (for your identity) are the same in the above scenarios, the relationships you have with the peer entities (government-issuer and financial institution-verifier) differ for you (the subject).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can draw a similarity with what email addresses you would use to interact with different relationships of yours. You may use one email address to interact with friends and family, but another one to interact with work colleagues.</p>
<p>By introducing the concept of personas, you can start having separate DIDs for every different type of relationship you seek. You may want one DID for family interactions, another for your financial interactions, another for your work, etc..&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to separate DIDs by personas because each persona has its own set of rules. And to establish a relationship, you must ensure contextual rules are met. This is how relationships are created and trusted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wallet’s job in life is to securely and privately intermediate the interactions of a user. From an implementation perspective, every persona could create and be represented by their own wallet. And each wallet could have its separate DID to use to create separate connections. So you choose which persona to use; just like you choose which email address to communicate with another entity.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
Establishing a connection (onboarding) 
<p>Now the question is how do you get onboarded? If it’s issuer-driven, can you trust a QRCode or any information presented to you if you’re unable to verify the provenance of the QRCode and information related to it? (Note: A QRCode is just an optical interface mechanism. If anything, a wallet should protect against QRCode fishing)</p>
<p></p>
<p>A connection request QRCode sent via email</p>
<p>Another key question is – why are they reaching out to you? People typically prefer to reach out to another entity they wish to engage with. You likely feel that calling your financial institution is much more comforting than receiving a call out of the blue from someone claiming they’re your financial institution.</p>
<p>Therefore rather than being presented with a QRCode, you should go to them, provide eligibility and then claim a credential. To claim a credential, you always need to provide eligibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eligibility is a verified email address, verified government ID, past references, skill-sets, etc.. Just like you go to Amazon, to a Government Service Desk, etc..</p>
 <br>
Managing a relationship 
<p>So now you have multiple personas, which helps you create different types of relationships which comply with the rules governing that relationship.</p>
<p>For example, one of the rules may be connection-based or connectionless-based relationships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connection means that you consent to the entity tracking you so that you can build common trust. For example, you need to be tracked over time by a credit bureau for them to establish a credit score on your behalf. If the relationship is about building trust, then you want them to track you to some extent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when you don’t need to build trust/relationship/tracking, you don’t require a connection, just a one-time interaction.. For example: doing an age check to purchase alcohol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also imagine short-lived connections for short-term relationships. And you can also reset the relationship if you wish to. For example, they may be collecting too much data on you – boom you reset it, create a new DID and your history with them is disassociated from the new connection you’ve established. Hence correlation is limited and in your control. Do you want to be tracked? Do you want your transactions to be correlated? As a holder, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Within your connection management inside your digital wallet, you should be able to see the relationship level you have with other entities. You should be able to see how much you’ve shared and consented to. Do you want to reset your DID with them? Go for it – up to you, the holder.</p>
<p>All of this is very holder-driven – and during the onboarding process (e.g., creating a DIDComm channel/secure relationship) – the relationship is at 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only when you start sharing some eligibility information about yourself and claim a credential can you start establishing a &gt;0 relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>—</p>

<p>On Wednesday 8th and Thursday 9th June 2022, InfoCert will participate to the 35th EEMA Annual Conference, that will takes place at Microsoft in London and will focus on Securing Identity and its Business Models. EEMA is the leading independent, not for profit, European Think Tank focusing on various topics, including identification, authentication, privacy, risk management, cyber security, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and mobile applications.</p>



<p>During the conference, InfoCert will take the lead in debating the impact of proposed changes to the electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) regulation, and the impact it will have in enabling an interoperable Europe.</p>



<p>Igor Marcolongo – Head of Business Compliance at InfoCert, will chair an international panel to discuss eIDAS, which was introduced by the EU in 2014 to regulate verifying the identity of individuals and businesses online, as well as the authenticity of electronic documents.</p>



<p>Fabrizio Leoni – InfoCert’s Head of Innovation Portfolio, will participate in a session investigating how existing Identity Schemes can create Digital Identity Wallets for Business &amp; Citizens of the future.</p>



<p>Last but not least, on day two, Carmine Auletta – InfoCert’s Chief Innovation and Strategy Officer, will lead a panel titled: Identity as a Business, Investment Decisions &amp; Emerging Marketplaces.</p>



<p>Danilo Cattaneo – CEO of InfoCert, states: “As an EEMA member InfoCert is delighted to be supporting and participating in its educational programme once again. Sponsoring the live webinar series last year gave us the opportunity to engage with large audiences across the EU and beyond. Now we look forward coming together once again in London.”</p>



<p>Director Special Projects at EEMA, Roger Dean, states: “InfoCert has long been an important partner for EEMA. As an organisation they have an eagerness to engage with our international network on a wide range of identity-related topics including sovereign identity, digital wallets, and regulation. Their involvement in EEMA events has become an essential element of our education programme.”</p>

<p>İşletmeler ve kuruluşlar, kişileri tanımlamak için çalışan rozetleri, sürücü belgeleri, pasaportlar, sosyal güvenlik kartları vb. gibi fiziksel kimlik bilgilerini kullanır.</p><p>Bu fiziksel kimlik bilgileri bizlerin kim ve neleri yapmaya yetkimiz olduğuna dair ortaya kanıt sunar. - Bizler, gece kulüplerine gidebilecek, uluslararası seyahatlerde tanımlanabilecek , üniversiteyi bitirdikten sonra işe başvurabilecek yaştayız.</p><p>Fakat artan dijitallizeşme, insanları binlerce işletme ile çevrimiçi bir şekilde iletişime geçmeye itiyor.</p><p>Dijital bir ortama kimlik bilgisi kanıtlamak, yavaş ve zor bir doğrulama sürecini içerir. Bu süreç veri ihlalleri ve sahte kimlik bilgileriyle ilişkili riski artırır.</p> <br>Burda sorun nedir?<br> <p>Belgeleri elektronik olarak yeniden oluşturmaya yönelik mevcut sistem, kimlik bilgilerinin de dijital bir sürümünü oluşturmayı kapsamaktadır. (PDF veya XML belgesi gibi).<br></p><p>Bu süreç (en azından pratikte) gayet basit ve kolayca uygulanabilmektedir.<br></p><p>Ancak bu formatlarda sunulan belgelerin kökenini ve gerçekliğini doğrulamak karmaşıktır. Alttaki maddelerin doğru olması gerekir:<br></p>  Yayıncı Kuruluş, bu kimlik bilgisini etkin bir şekilde düzenlemiştir ve bunu yapma yetkisini sahiptir.  Kimlik bilgilerini sunan kişi, bu bilgilerin gerçek hak sahibidir.  Kimlik bilgileri geçerli olmakla beraber süresi dolmamış veya iptal edilmemiştir.  <p>Bir çok durumda, tasdikleyici kuruluşa ulaşmak gerekir.</p><p>Sertifikaları ve belgeleri taklit etmek ve fotoşoplamak çok kolay hale gelmiştir. Ve bu durum işleri daha kötü hale getirmektedir.</p><p><a href="https://aaar.assembly.ca.gov/sites/aaar.assembly.ca.gov/files/reports/Intro%20to%20Degree%20Mills.pdf">Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'nde yeni bir doktora yaptığını</a> iddia eden insanların yarısından fazlasının sahte sertifikası var.</p><p>Ayrıca bu yöntemler, kuruluşları kullanıcılarının büyük miktarda kişisel verisini depolamaya zorlar. Ayrıca kuruluşlar, kullanıcılarını kişisel bilgilerine kimin eriştiği, belgelerinin nerede saklandığı ve bunların nasıl kullanıldığı konusunda kontrolsüz bırakır.</p><p>Bu noktada, bireylerin kimliklerini güvenilir bir şekilde oluşturmasını ve paylaşmasını sağlayan veri koruma sistemleri ve doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri devreye girer.<br></p> Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri Nelerdir ve Bize Nasıl Yardımcı Olurlar?<br> <p>Basit bir ifadeyle, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, kişilerin doğrulama için onlara ihtiyaç duyan üçüncü taraflara sunabileceği, kağıt tabanlı kimlik bilgilerinin dijital bir sürümüdür. Ancak, fiziksel kimlik bilgilerinin ve pdf'lerin aksine, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri kurcalanmaya karşı korumalıdır ve anında doğrulanabilir.</p><p>Kuruluşlar derecelerini, kimliklerini, lisanslarını vb. doğrulanabilir dijital kimlik bilgileri olarak verebilir.</p><p>Insanlar fiziksel belgeler gibi, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini de dijital bir cüzdanda depolama imkanina sahiptir.</p><p>Dijital cüzdan, insanların telefonlarında, bilgisayarlarında ve hatta bulut tabanlı bir sunucuda mobil uygulama olarak taşıyabilecekleri geleneksel veya fiziksel cüzdanın dijital versiyonudur.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ve dijital cüzdanlar kullanmak, bugün piyasadaki diğer kimlik yönetimi çözümlerine güvenli ve kullanışlı bir alternatiftir.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerinin tüm dünyada insanlar ve işletmeler arasında giderek daha popüler hale gelmesinin başlıca nedeni, kullanıcı gereksinimleri söz konusu olduğunda birçok hizmete olanak sağlaması ve mevcut kimlik yönetim sistemiyle ilgili çeşitli sorunları ele almasıdır.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri, taraflar arasında anında güven yaratır. </p><p>Bir kuruluş, Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgilerini kullanarak, bir belgenin gerçek olup olmadığını ve onu kimin yayınladığını hemen tespit edebilir. Ve bunu yayıncıyla iletişime geçmeden saniyeler içinde yapabilir!</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, doğası gereği dijital olmanın yanı sıra (günümüzde daha fazla ön koşul haline gelen bir husus), veri korumasını desteklemeye yönelik büyük bir adımdır.</p><p>İşte olay;</p><p>Fiziksel bir kimlik bilgisini veya bir pdf'yi paylaştığınızda, gerekli olandan çok daha fazla kişisel bilgiyi ifşa ediyor olabilirsiniz.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri, kişilerin kimliklerini doğrulamasını ve yalnızca bağlamla ilgili bilgileri sunmasını sağlar.</p><p>Fiziksel kimlik bilgileri bu tür bir esneklik sunmaz.<br><br>Ayrıca, kağıt tabanlı kimlik bilgilerini oluşturmak kolaydır.</p> Merkezi Kimlik Yönetim Sistemi Neden Problem Taşımaktadır?<br> <p>Bu konuyu bir örnekle inceleyelim - son COVID19 aşı sertifikası.</p><p>Bir kriket maçı veya uçuş yolculuğu gibi hızlı tempolu bir ortamda kağıt tabanlı veya pdf tabanlı bir aşı sertifikasını doğrulamak genellikle zaman alıcıdır ve hatalara açıktır.</p><p>Dijital bir ekosistemde, bu aşı sertifikaları merkezi bir veri tabanında depolanarak, bu tür senaryolarda doğrulanmaları gerektiğinde onları daha hızlı ve daha kullanışlı hale getiriyor.</p><p>Bununla birlikte, milyonlarca insan hakkında kişisel bilgileri depolayan merkezi bir veri tabanı, bilgisayar korsanları için bir altın madeni gibidir.</p><p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ve blok zinciri tabanlı merkeziyetsiz kimlik yönetimi, insanların kendi verilerini depolamasına ve yönetmesine olanak tanır.</p><p>Dorğulanabilir kimlik bilgileri insanlara verilerini nasıl, ne zaman ve kiminle paylaşmak istediklerine dair karar verme hakkını saklı tutarlar.</p><p>Bu zorlukların üstesinden gelmek için IATA Uluslararası Hava Taşımacılığı Birliği , Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgilerini benimsedi.<br></p> Doğrulanabilir Kimlik Bilgileri Nasıl Çalışır?<br> <p>Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerinin nasıl çalıştığını anlamak için, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri ekosisteminde yer alan temel varlıklar (yayıncı kuruluş, varlık sahibi ve doğrulayıcı) hakkında bilgi sahibi olmanız gerekir.<br><br>Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi, yayıncı kuruluş, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgileri verme yetkisine sahip bir varlıktır. Bu, kursu bitirdikten sonra size diploma veren üniversiteniz, size ulusal bir kimlik veren devlet kurumları vb. Olabilir.</p><p>Bireyler , kimlik bilgilerinin sahibi olan kişilerdir. Dijital cüzdanlarındaki doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini saklar ve paylaşırlar.</p><p>Son olarak, doğrulayıcı, kimlik bilgilerini doğrulatan veya doğrulayan kişidir. Bu, diplomanızı paylaştığınız bir işe alım şirketi olabilir.<br></p> Peki kimlik nasıl doğrulanır? <p>Yayıncı kuruluş, doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgisini yayınlar ve yalnızca yayıncı kuruluşun kullanabileceği bir şifreleme anahtarıyla dijital olarak imzalar.</p><p>Doğrulayıcı bir kimlik bilgisi aldığında, değiştirilemez ve merkeziyetsiz bir veritabanı olan blok zinciri aracılığıyla orijinalliğini doğrulayacaktır.</p><p>Unutulmaması gereken husus, blok zincirinin aslında kullanıcıların doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgilerini saklamamasıdır. Yalnızca doğrulayıcının kimlik bilgilerinin gerçekliğini doğrulamak için ihtiyaç duyacağı bilgileri depolar. Örnek olarak - verenin kimlik bilgisini imzalayanla eşleştiren genel şifreleme anahtarı diyebiliriz.</p><p>Bu bilgileri kullanarak, doğrulayıcı şunları inceleyecektir:</p><p>1) Yayıncı Kuruluşun bu kimlik bilgilerini verme yetkisi var mıdır?.</p><p>2) Doğrulanabilir kimlik bilgisi hala geçerli midir? (iptal edilmemiş veya süresi dolmamış ise).</p><p>3) Kimlik bilgisi tahrif edilmiş midir?.</p><p>Bu sistem güvene ihtiyaç duymaz. Doğrulayıcının artık kimlik bilgilerinin geçerliliğini onaylamak için verenle iletişim kurmasına gerek yoktur.

  <p>Cloud adoption continues to increase rapidly worldwide, and not only in the software industry. Every year more and more companies move their applications to the cloud. In the last JHipster community survey, from December 2021, participants valued JHipster’s ability to get them to production faster, and requested more tutorials on deployment to cloud platforms. DigitalOcean is among the most popular “other” cloud vendors, according to some surveys. This post is a quick walk-through of the deployment of a JHipster microservices architecture to a Kubernetes cluster in DigitalOcean’s cloud.</p>

 About DigitalOcean 

<p>DigitalOcean is a cloud services company founded in 2011 by brothers Ben and Moisey Uretsky. Their headquarters are in New York City in the United States, and they also have offices in Massachusetts and Bangalore. Last March 2022, DigitalOcean reached its IPO (Initial Public Offering), and some press articles describe it as the cloud services provider for small businesses: “Cloud services for the Little Guy”.</p>

<p></p>

<p>DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you deploy Kubernetes clusters without the complexities of handling the control pane and containerized infrastructure. Clusters are compatible with standard Kubernetes toolchains and integrate natively with DigitalOcean load balancers and block storage volumes. DOKS offers fast provisioning and deployment, and provides a free high-availability control pane, for reliability management. It can also provide a Cluster Autoscaler that automatically adjusts the size of the cluster by adding or removing nodes based on the cluster’s capacity to schedule pods. Pricing for Kubernetes workloads is based on resources required by the cluster, droplets, block storage, and load balancers.</p>

<p>The company publishes its data center <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/trust/certification-reports">certification reports</a> on its website, and all the data centers have approved two or more of the following certifications: SOC (System and Organization Controls) 1 Type II, SOC 2 Type II, SOC 3 Type II, and ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (Security techniques - Information security management systems). PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry - Data Security Standard) has been certified in all data centers.</p>

 Set up a microservices architecture for Kubernetes 

<p>Before working on the application, you need to install JHipster. The classical way of working with JHipster is to do a local installation with NPM.</p>

   <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster@7
</code>   

<p>If you’d rather use Yarn or Docker, follow the instructions at <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/#local-installation-with-npm-recommended-for-normal-users">jhipster.tech</a>.</p>

<p>For this test, start from the <code>reactive-jhipster</code> example in the <code>java-microservices-examples</code> repository on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples">GitHub</a>. The example is a JHipster reactive microservices architecture with Spring Cloud Gateway and Spring WebFlux, Vue as the client framework, and Gradle as the build tool. You can read about how it was built in <a>Reactive Java Microservices with Spring Boot and JHipster</a>.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/java-microservices-examples.git
cd java-microservices-examples/reactive-jhipster
</code>   
<p>If you inspect the project folder, you will find sub-folders for the <code>gateway</code> service, which will act as the front-end application, and a gateway to the <code>store</code> and <code>blog</code> microservices, which also have their subfolders. A <code>docker-compose</code> sub-folder contains the service definitions for running the application containers.</p>

<p>The next step is to generate the Kubernetes deployment descriptors. In the project root folder, create a <code>kubernetes</code> directory and run the <code>k8s</code> JHipster sub-generator:</p>

   <code>mkdir kubernetes
cd kubernetes
jhipster k8s
</code>   

<p>Choose the following options when prompted:</p>

 
   Type of application: Microservice application 
   Root directory: ../ 
   Which applications? (select all) 
   Set up monitoring? No 
   Which applications with clustered databases? select store 
   Admin password for JHipster Registry: (generate one) 
   Kubernetes namespace: demo 
   Docker repository name: (your docker hub username) 
   Command to push Docker image: <code>docker push</code> 
   Enable Istio? No 
   Kubernetes service type? LoadBalancer 
   Use dynamic storage provisioning? Yes 
   Use a specific storage class? (leave empty) 
 

<p>NOTE: You can leave the Docker repository name blank for running Kubernetes locally, but a repository will be required for the cloud deployment, so go ahead and create a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">DockerHub</a> personal account, and the image pull configuration will be ready for both local and cloud deployments.</p>

<p>Build the <code>gateway</code>, <code>store</code>, and <code>blog</code> services container images with Jib. As Jib will push the images to DockerHub, you first need to do a <code>docker login</code>.</p>

   <code>docker login
</code>   
<p>If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you must generate a token and use it as the password for the login. In the Docker web, go to the user menu and choose Account Settings. Then in the left menu choose Security and New Access Token.</p>

<p>For example, for building the <code>gateway</code> service image:</p>

   <code>cd ../gateway
./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jib -Djib.to.image=&lt;docker-repo-name&gt;/gateway
</code>   
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately the application example does not build with Java 17 at the moment of writing this post. As specified in the introduction, this example was built with Java 11.</p>

<p>Check that the images were uploaded to <a href="https://hub.docker.com">DockerHub</a>, and navigate to the project root folder in the terminal for the next step.</p>

 Configure authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>One more configuration step before running the architecture locally, let’s configure Okta for authentication.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create jhipster</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
  Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI streamlines configuring a JHipster app and does several things for you:</p>

 
   Creates an OIDC app with the correct redirect URIs:
     
       login: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
       logout: <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and <code>http://localhost:8761</code> 
     
   
   Creates <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups that JHipster expects 
   Adds your current user to the <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups 
   Creates a <code>groups</code> claim in your default authorization server and adds the user’s groups to it 
 

<p>NOTE: The <code>http://localhost:8761*</code> redirect URIs are for the JHipster Registry, which is often used when creating microservices with JHipster. The Okta CLI adds these by default.</p>

<p>You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app. It will look like this (except the placeholder values will be populated):</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="/oauth2/default"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="{clientId}"
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="{clientSecret}"
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/security/#okta">Create a JHipster App on Okta</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Add the settings from the generated <code>.okta.env</code> to <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/application-configmap.yml</code>:</p>

   <code>data:
  application.yml: |-
    ...
    spring:
      security:
        oauth2:
          client:
            provider:
              oidc:
                issuer-uri: https://&lt;your-okta-domain&gt;/oauth2/default
            registration:
              oidc:
                client-id: &lt;client-id&gt;
                client-secret: &lt;client-secret&gt;
</code>   

<p>Enable the OIDC authentication in the <code>jhipster-registry</code> service by adding the <code>oauth2</code> profile in the <code>kubernetes/registry-k8s/jhipster-registry.yml</code> file:</p>

   <code>- name: SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
  value: prod,k8s,oauth2
</code>   

 Run locally with minikube 

<p>Install <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/">minikube</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/"><code>kubectl</code></a>.</p>

<p>For minikube, you will need at least 2 CPUs. Start minikube with your number of CPUs:</p>

   <code>cd kubernetes
minikube --cpus &lt;ncpu&gt; start
</code>   
<p>minikube will log the Kubernetes and Docker versions on start:</p>

   <code>Preparing Kubernetes v1.23.3 on Docker 20.10.12 ...
</code>   

<p>For the <code>store-mongodb</code> deployment to work, the property <code>Service.spec.publishNotReadyAddresses</code> was required, instead of the annotation <code>service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints</code>, as the latter was deprecated in <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.11.md#kubernetes-111-release-notes">Kubernetes release 1.11</a>.</p>

<p>Edit <code>kubernetes/store-k8s/store-mongodb.yml</code> and add the <code>publishNotReadyAddresses: true</code> property to the <code>spec</code> key near the bottom of the file:</p>

   <code>...
# Headless service for DNS record
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: store-mongodb
  namespace: demo
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true
  ports:
    - name: peer
      port: 27017
  selector:
    app: store-mongodb
</code>   

<p>Then deploy the application to minikube.  In the <code>kubernetes</code> directory, run:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   
<p>Now is a good time to install <a href="https://k9scli.io/topics/install/">k9s</a>, a terminal-based UI to interact with Kubernetes clusters. Then run k9s with:</p>

   <code>k9s -n demo
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://k9scli.io/topics/commands/">commands list</a>, some useful ones are:</p>

 
   <code>:namespace</code>: show all available namespaces 
   <code>:pods</code>: show all available pods 
 

<p>You can navigate the pods with <code>ENTER</code> and go back with <code>ESC</code> keys.</p>

<p>Set up port-forwarding for the JHipster Registry.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/jhipster-registry -n demo 8761
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and sign in with your Okta credentials. When the registry shows all services in green, Set up port-forwarding for the gateway as well.</p>

   <code>kubectl port-forward svc/gateway -n demo 8080
</code>   

<p>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, sign in, and create some entities to verify everything is working fine.</p>

<p>After looking around, stop minikube before the cloud deployment:</p>

   <code>minikube stop
</code>   

<p>Also delete the minikube cluster to have a clean slate for future tests:</p>

   <code>minikube delete
</code>   

 Deploy to DigitalOcean Kubernetes 

<p>Now that the architecture works locally, let’s proceed to the cloud deployment. First, create a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new">DigitalOcean</a> account. The registration requires a $5 PayPal payment, or providing a credit card.</p>

<p>Most of the cluster tasks, if not all, can be accomplished using <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl#installing-doctl">doctl</a>, the command-line interface (CLI) for the DigitalOcean API. Install the tool, and perform the authentication with DigitalOcean:</p>

   <code>doctl auth init
</code>   
<p>You will be prompted to enter the DigitalOcean access token that you can generate in the DigitalOcean control panel. Sign in, and then in the left menu go to API, click Generate New Token. Enter a token name, and click Generate Token. Copy the new token from the Tokens/Keys table.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can find a detailed list of pricing for cluster resources at <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/">DigitalOcean</a>,  and with <code>doctl</code> you can quickly retrieve a list of node size options available for your account:</p>

   <code>doctl k options sizes
</code>   

<p>Create the cluster with the following command line:</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster create do1 -v --size s-4vcpu-8gb-intel
</code>   
<p>After creating a cluster, <code>doctl</code> adds a configuration context to <code>kubectl</code> and makes it active, so you can start monitoring your cluster right away with k9s. First, apply the resources configuration to the DigitalOcean cluster:</p>

   <code>./kubectl-apply.sh -f
</code>   

<p>Monitor the deployment with k9s:</p>

   <code>k9s -n demo
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Once you see the <code>jhipster-registry</code> pods are up, set up port forwarding again so you can also monitor the status of the services in the registry UI.</p>

 Notes on DigitalOcean’s node sizes and volumes 

<p>Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean’s cloud can be tricky if you don’t specify enough capacity from the start.</p>

<p>At first, I tested the cluster with the highest size Intel nodes available for my account, <code>s-2vcpu-4gb-intel</code>. I attempted to run the application in the default cluster configuration, a three-node cluster with a single node pool in the nyc1 region, using the latest Kubernetes version. As I started to see pods not running due to <code>insufficient CPU</code>, I increased the number of nodes and got everything working. DigitalOcean’s latest and default Kubernetes version at the moment of writing this post was 1.22.8.</p>

<p>If you need to find out the reason why a pod is not running, you can get the pod events with <code>kubectl describe</code>, for example, for the <code>jhipster-registry-0</code> pod:</p>

   <code>kubectl describe pod jhipster-registry-0 -n demo
</code>   

<p>The output of the command, in the events section, for a pod that has failed due to insufficient cpu, looks like the following:</p>

<p>If you see a pod failing in <code>k9s</code>, check the events for that pod with <code>kubectl describe pod</code> as in the example above.</p>

<p>To add CPU, increase the number of nodes with <code>doctl</code>:</p>

<p>After I increased CPU (adding one more node to the cluster), some of the pods, in the <code>store-mongodb</code> stateful set with 3 replicas, did not run due to unbound immediate PersistentVolumeClaims. This was reported in the pod events, in the output of <code>kubectl describe pod</code>, for the failing pods. I then inspected persistent volume claims with the following commands:</p>

   <code>kubectl get pvc -n demo
kubectl describe pvc datadir-store-mongodb-2 -n demo

<p>As instructed by the event message, I contacted DigitalOcean support and they fixed it.</p>

<p>Finally, as I first registered for the free trial account, I had to open a second support ticket requesting higher node sizes, so I could use the size <code>s-4vcpu-8gb-intel</code>. Not all the size options were available after signing up for the trial, but that is not the case for a standard account. Billing should be under $10 USD for a short Kubernetes service test.</p>

 Find your gateway’s external IP and update redirect URIs 

<p>Once all the pods are running, find the gateway external IP with the <code>kubectl describe</code> command:</p>

   <code>kubectl describe service gateway -n demo
</code>   
<p>The output will look like this:</p>

   <code>Name:                     gateway

</code>   

<p>Update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the gateway address as a valid redirect. Run <code>okta login</code>, open the returned URL in your browser, and sign in to the Okta Admin Console. Go to the Applications section, find your application, edit, and add:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080</code> 
 

<p>Navigate to <code>http://&lt;load-balancer-ingress-ip&gt;:8080</code> and rejoice when everything works!</p>

 Secure web traffic with HTTPS 

<p>Since the gateway service acts as the application front-end, in the k8s descriptors it is defined as a <code>LoadBalancer</code> service type. This exposes the service externally using the cloud provider’s load balancer. DigitalOcean load balancers are a fully-managed, highly available network load-balancing service. Load balancers distribute traffic to groups of droplets, which decouples the overall health of a backend service from the health of a single server to ensure that your services stay online.</p>

<p>The standard practice is to secure web traffic to your application with HTTPS. For traffic encryption, you need a TLS (SSL) certificate. DigitalOcean also provides automatic certificate creation and renewal if you manage your domain with DigitalOcean’s DNS, which is free. But domain registration is not provided.  To use DigitalOcean’s DNS, you need to register a domain name with a registrar and update your domain’s NS records to point to DigitalOcean’s name servers.</p>

<p>Then, for using DigitalOcean’s managed domain and certificate, you must <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/tutorials/dns-registrars/">delegate the domain</a>, updating NS records in the registrar. Because of this requirement, you cannot use free DNS services where you cannot set up NS records, like <a href="https://nip.io/">nip.io</a>.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: Before changing the registrar NS records (the nameservers), add your domain to DigitalOcean, to minimize service disruptions.</p>

<p>You can create the certificate and the domain at the same time in the DigitalOcean control panel, when you set up the load balancer HTTPS forwarding.</p>

<p>DigitalOcean load balancers support two main configurations for encrypted web traffic:</p>

 
   SSL termination: decrypts SSL requests at the load balancer and sends them unencrypted to the backend at the Droplets’ private IP address. The slower and CPU-intensive work of decryption is performed at the load balancer, and certificate management is simplified. The traffic between the load balancer and the backend is secured by routing over the VPC network, but data is readable inside the private network. 
   SSL passthrough: sends the encrypted SSL requests directly to the backend at the Droplets’ private IP address, traffic between the load balancer and the backend is secured. Every backend server must have the certificate, and client information contained in <code>X-forwarded-*</code> headers might be lost. 
 

<p>Taking advantage of the simplified certificate management, SSL termination will be configured in the following steps through the DigitalOcean control panel.</p>

<p>Log in to your DigitalOcean account, and in the left menu choose Kubernetes. Then choose your cluster, and on the cluster page, choose Resources. In the LOAD BALANCERS list, choose the single load balancer that must have been created. On the load balancer page, choose the Settings tab. Click Edit in the Forwarding Rules. Add a forwarding rule for HTTPS in port 443, and in the certificate drop-down, choose New certificate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the New Certificate form, choose the Use Let’s Encrypt tab, and then in the domain box, choose Add new domain. Then enter your domain name, and list other subdomains to include. Add a name for the certificate and click Generate Certificate.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in the Forwarding rules page, check that the generated certificate is selected, and forward the traffic to the droplet HTTP port where the gateway is running. Tick the checkbox Create DNS records for all the new Let’s Encrypt certificates and then Save the forwarding settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, in the SSL section of the settings, tick the checkbox Redirect HTTP to HTTPS.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once again, update the redirect URIs in Okta to allow the newly configured domain. Add the following redirect URIs:</p>
 
   Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>https://&lt;your-domain&gt;</code> 
 

<p>Test the configuration by navigating to <code>http://&lt;your-domain&gt;</code>. First, the load balancer should redirect to HTTPs, and then the gateway should redirect to the Okta sign-in page.</p>

 Inspect and manage cluster resources 

<p>You can retrieve the cluster associated resources with the following <code>doctl</code> command:</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster list-associated-resources do1
</code>   

<p>The output will list the volumes and load balancers created for the cluster, which generate billing charges besides the cost of the nodes:</p>

   <code>Volumes                                                                                                                                                                                       Volume Snapshots    Load Balancers
[a33dbaba-cb22-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 a6e18809-cb22-11ec-8723-0a58ac14468c 65fb3778-cb23-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 ac106c49-cb22-11ec-9383-0a58ac145375 c7122288-cb22-11ec-bd08-0a58ac14467d]    []                  [8ebbcbf2-1e67-46f5-b38a-eddae17f00f3]
</code>   

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way to pause the cluster. According to DigitalOcean, you can power a droplet off, but this does not halt the billing. Billing costs can be reduced by taking a snapshot of the droplet and then destroying it. The snapshot cost is less expensive.</p>

<p>While testing the platform, you can delete the cluster in between sessions, to avoid spending the trial credit while not actively working on it.</p>

   <code>doctl k cluster delete do1
</code>   

<p>Volumes provisioned to the cluster are not deleted with the cluster, and charges are generated hourly. You can delete volumes using the control panel or with the following commands:</p>

   <code>doctl compute volume list
doctl compute volume delete &lt;volume-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>The load balancers are not deleted with the cluster either:</p>

   <code>doctl compute load-balancer list
doctl compute load-balancer delete &lt;load-balancer-id&gt;
</code>   

<p>During registration, a project must have been created, allowing you to organize resources. You can list all the resources associated with a project with the following command:</p>

   <code>doctl projects list
doctl projects resources list &lt;project-id&gt;
</code>

				 <p>If I said that I was disappointed with the Ontario election results, that would be an understatement. I’m not talking about the results – I’m talking about the turnout. It’s discouraging to see such low participation.</p>
<p>Elections Ontario <a href="https://www.elections.on.ca/en/election-results/provincial-results.html">reported</a> that 4.6 million out of 10.7 million eligible voters cast a ballot in Thursday’s election.</p>
<p>That’s around 43 percent of eligible voters. Not healthy for democracy.</p>
<p>The 2018 provincial election saw 57 percent voter turnout, the highest voter turnout in over a decade.</p>
<p>What happened? There could be many reasons, from people are just done with it all after Covid, voting locations problems to early predictions affecting turnout. Who knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not an expert on the election process, and this is just my opinion. I’ve been lazy in past elections, and I’d be lying if I said I’ve voted in every one. As a citizen, I believe ease and accessibility have a lot to do with it. If I could have voted from home on my phone, I would have voted in every election. Not to mention, from my experience, the voting method is archaic. I’ve heard of these Dominion machines – I’ve never seen one, and I’ve been of legal voting age since 1998.</p>
<p>When I cast my ballot on June 2nd, I made my choice via a sharpie on a piece of card stock paper and put it in a cardboard box, as I have done in every election. As soon as I did this, I thought about how my vote might not be accounted for correctly. Would that cardboard box make it to the counter system? Would my vote be counted accurately? What about human error? And how do I know that someone won’t add ballots for those who didn’t show up? Right now, I can’t see that my vote was counted accurately or even counted at all. All I see are vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>What if you could securely vote from your phone at home? What if you had a choice to continue to vote in person or a new way – via trusted credentials that live in your digital wallet? Even if people are “done” with politics. If people could take 2 minutes and vote from their phones, I believe more would be inclined to vote, thus increasing the turnout.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf#page=19">You Already Have a Digital Wallet</a>, so let’s imagine a scenario where citizens could vote accurately AND know that hackers working for the opposition (or Russia!) aren’t taking over the election.</p>
  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			 
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
 Let’s imagine that <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bubbas-wallet/">Bubba’s Wallet</a> is the <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf#page=51">trusted digital wallet provider</a>. We trust Bubba’s Wallet because it’s gone through the rigorous vetting processes to be said trusted provider. 
  
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
					
					 
						
						 <p>We should have many trusted digital wallet providers for a healthy market.&nbsp;</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
 The election authority could issue citizens (who opt-in) verifiable credentials stored in Bubba’s Wallet. That credential would be used when citizens&nbsp; vote – and the system would make sure they only vote once. Users would be able to load up a website, and their wallet would make sure it was actually the election authority (e.g. Elections Ontario for the Ontario provincial election). 
 The election authority could also create a voting app compatible with Bubba’s Wallet and other trusted wallet providers. It would be like logging on to a banking app or using Apple or Google pay via Biometrics. 
 To safeguard the system from fraud, the election authority would have to make it so that users cannot log on or access the app unless they have a verified voting credential. Because the verifiable credentials are stored and shared via <a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Distributed Ledger Technology,</a> and the credentials are not stored in a centralized manner by the Issuer (e.g. Elections Ontario), they are inaccessible to hackers. 
  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>If the four scenarios above were factual and in play today, citizens would be able to log into the Elections app on voting day, no matter where in the world, and vote for the candidate in their riding. Citizens could instantly see that their vote was accepted for the chosen candidate, assuring that they were counted accurately.</p>
<p>The technology is there for this to happen, but we need the government and general public to adopt the technology, and I know that’s a big order. We have a ways to go as the trust needs to be rebuilt among many parties.</p>
<p>Digital ID can increase voter participation and improve democracy.</p>
<p>Something to think about.</p>

 Institutional Investment in the Digital Assets Space Still Modest, Regulatory Parity can Change it — BIS&nbsp;Report  The Bank of International Settlements looked into what motivates banks and other financial institutions to enter the crypto market?, and what factors can propel institutional activity in the digital assets industry? So, let’s look at the findings. <blockquote>Key Takeaways<br>- As per the recently published BIS report, most of the recent growth in the digital assets space was attributed to the retail activity in the crypto world, with minimal information on the role of institutional investors.</blockquote><blockquote>- The report further states that major banks have only exposure worth $200 million to digital assets, which is minuscule compared to the total market cap of the global crypto industry.</blockquote><blockquote>- Regulatory Parity between banks and virtual assets service providers (VASPs) will bring more institutional investment into the crypto&nbsp;market.</blockquote><p>A <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1013.htm">recent Bank for International Settlements (BIS) report</a> looked at the level of institutional investment in the virtual assets market, which has grown by leaps and bounds in the last couple of years. The report argues that the retail activity in the crypto markets hogs all the limelight, with limited information available on the involvement of traditional financial organizations in the nascent crypto assets industry.</p><p>Thus, BIS decided to research: what motivates banks and other financial institutions to enter the crypto market?, and what factors can propel institutional activity in the digital assets industry? So, let’s look at the findings.</p> The Factors That can Attract Institutional Investors <p>The BIS report states that with growing user numbers, further innovation, economic development, and regulatory clarity, the crypto industry will be able to attract funds from the traditional financial sector successfully. So far, institutional capital has been relatively minimal, which is evident from the fact that major banks have only $200 million of exposure to digital assets. In comparison, the global crypto market at the time of writing is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">$1.3 trillion</a>. It shows just how inconsequential is the involvement of banks in the virtual assets market currently.</p><p>Even with pretty limited exposure to digital assets, banks seem to prioritize virtual asset exchanges that are at the least lightly regulated. Thus, it goes without saying that traditional financial organizations will always stay clear of any crypto exchanges that aren’t regulated. Regulated exchanges are popular among both retail investors and institutional ones.</p><p>That said, regulatory parity is the need of the hour, considering the difference in the regulatory treatment of banks to that of crypto-based businesses, such as exchanges. Banks have immense support from authorities, which is something that virtual asset service providers don’t get. For instance, the Travel Rule, which was already applicable to the banks, and investment funds, among other traditional financial players, have been extended to the crypto industry, but minus the&nbsp;support.</p><p>The only way that Virtual Asset Service Providers have here is to ensure data privacy at all costs and take appropriate measures to offer the utmost privacy to&nbsp;clients.</p><p>Talking about Travel Rules, how can we miss mentioning “Veriscope”? After all, Shyft’s Veriscope is the best product available to comply with Travel Rule without any hassles. Plus, it solves the much-dreaded “Sunrise” issue that makes compliance with the Travel Rule a tricky&nbsp;process.</p><p>Make sure to visit our <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">website </a>to get a first-hand look at how <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>can enable your company to stay compliant.

<p>This Dev Pulse unpacks the recently announced Developer Immersive in more detail, but don’t miss the other good stuff at the bottom! There’s a new Holochain Launcher release, some important breaking changes in the Tryorama testing framework, and videos and articles from around the community.</p> Rust Developer Immersive <p>By now you may have heard the news that Holo is <a href="https://press.holo.host/214789-announcing-the-holochain-developer-education-initiative">committing $2 million USD</a> over the next couple years to support developer education. I was pretty excited when I heard the news because equipping developers to be successful is, well, everything. And education is a huge part of that. (And let’s face it, Holochain is a little weird and it’s nice to have as much help as you can get.)</p><p>The first piece of this initiative is a <a href="https://holo.host/holochain-rust-developer-immersive">Developer Immersive programme</a> from July 10th to 22nd. The content builds on the popular Dev Camps — it will introduce developers to Rust and Holochain concepts, then get them involved in writing code — but the format is quite different. This is an in-person event, two weeks of intense, iterative, hands-on learning with three and your peers.</p><p>In the Austrian Alps!</p><p>Yeah, that’s right. The course takes place in a guest house in a mountain village in Tyrol, Austria. Live-in accommodations and supplied meals will free up your time to both focus on your learning and build connections with each other. And I think that connection is one of the beautiful things about the community of devs and supporters in Holochain-land — the way they support each other, to grow not just at their craft but as people too.</p><p>Now, I realise that this format is not going to work for everyone. It’s a very intense programme, you have to commit all of your life for two weeks, and there is a tuition fee. But if these things work for you, I think it will be a transformative experience. It’ll also be transformative for Holo as we learn what approaches work best.</p><p>And because this is a cooperative experience, you’ll be much better equipped to become a skilled distributed app developer by the end of the two weeks. You’re not likely to slip through the cracks when everyone is dedicated to each other’s success!</p> Who’s leading this course? <p><a href="https://www.marcusphillips.com/about-me">Marcus Phillips</a> co-founded <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, an immersive software engineering school, in 2012. In conversations with him, it was immediately clear to me that he has a deep wealth of skill and wisdom when it comes to learning. He’s evidently passionate about supporting people to succeed — I know I keep using that word; it’s because this isn’t about just teaching a curriculum, it’s about tangible results. Out of all the possible ways to teach people about Holochain, he’s looking for the path that gets them to writing code most effectively and quickly. And he recognises that the curriculum needs to adapt in real-time to the participants. Not only that, but he’s genuinely excited about Holochain. Honestly, I’m stoked that he’s signed up to help lead this course.</p><p><a href="https://guillemcordoba.github.io/about/">Guillem Cordoba</a> is no stranger to Holochain education. In addition to being involved in the last few DevCamps, he’s also created a lot of great learning resources like the <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/">Holochain Gym</a> and <a href="https://holochain-playground.github.io/">Playground</a>, helps lead <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">Holochain in Action</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GuillemCordoba/videos">Wednesday Workshop</a> sessions, and has created a lot of reusable libraries as well. He’s a skilled and creative developer who writes straightforward, readable code, and he’s also just an all-around good-hearted and humble guy. His knowledge and helpfulness in the Holochain developer community are already renowned.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-penny-7533a6b">Liz Penny</a> has been a tech educator and director of education with Hack Reactor, <a href="https://thelastmile.org/">The Last Mile</a>, and <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/">Galvanize</a>. As Marcus’ collaborator she brings the same desire to see participants succeed. She’ll be involved in designing and coordinating the course and describes her role in programmes like this as ‘leader-student’ and ‘doula’. My colleagues say she’s got a singular focus on making things happen and choosing the right things to make happen, yet in the kindest and most supportive way.<br><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmeigooni/">Muhammad Meigooni</a> lives at the intersection of education and technology, having worked as a full-stack software engineer for a number of startups, including Fullscreen and Speakeasy, as well as a Product / Campus owner at MakerSquare, Hack Reactor, and Galvanize. Muhammad was the 'student developer' in our 2-week pre-pilot immersion with Marcus, Guillem, and Arthur Brock.<br><br>I’m excited to see what will happen when the four of them bring their strengths together for this course.</p> Who is it for? <p>We’re looking for people who already have a good amount of experience with full-stack software development. You don’t need to know Rust (that’s the first part of the course) but you should be competent at writing and reading well-structured code.</p><p>Aside from that, the biggest thing we’re looking for is a willingness to dedicate yourself to learning and supporting your peers’ learning in an immersive context.</p><p>It’s not meant to be for everyone, nor can it be. As I mentioned, it’s an on-site course with a pretty intensive schedule, which will allow us to iterate rapidly towards an ideal curriculum for you and future participants. So you’ll be taking the course and helping us design it at the same time. As such, there will be a screening process to determine whether this programme is right for you.</p><p>But this iterative approach means you’ll also be well-supported at every step of the way; Marcus and Liz come from a school with a long and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-complaints-from-students-in-Hack-Reactor">acclaimed</a> history of not letting a single person slip through the cracks.</p><p>If you’d prefer taking an online course with others or at your own pace, those are coming soon too. In fact, we plan to use the insights we gain from this course to help construct them as well as future in-person courses.</p> A note on the tuition fees <p>We know this programme costs a lot, and you may not be able to afford it. And the intensity might not be appropriate for everyone. But we don’t want anyone to be shut out simply because they can’t afford it. We all know the tech world suffers from a lack of diversity, and I think it’s a loss for everyone — the valuable everyday experiences and perspectives of women, indigenous people, people of colour, trans people, residents of the global south, and many others are largely missing. I know we can’t change such a complex problem by ourselves, but we do want to do what’s in our power.</p><p>If you’re in a position to take two weeks to travel to this course, please know that scholarships are available. If you don’t see yourself in the criteria, look a little harder. Maybe you’re like me and don’t see yourself as an ‘exceptional’ candidate. I urge you to set that voice aside; you’re more exceptional than you think!</p> What happens once I get back home? <p>Of course, we can’t promise that you’ll get a job with a dev shop or create a wildly successful hApp as soon as you leave the course, but the instructors are dedicated to skilling you up so that your prospects will be high. A growing number of people and companies are adopting Holochain as the toolkit for their applications, and it’s not just crypto stuff. Holochain is good for regular, everyday apps that happen to not need the cloud (although we think it’ll be used for some pretty ground-breaking apps too). Here are some examples:</p>  <a href="https://ethelo.com/">Ethelo</a>, who create collective decision-making and civic engagement software, is planning on <a href="https://ethelo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ethelo-DAO-White-Paper.pdf">moving</a> their machine-learning back-end to Holochain. They’ve already had experience in the crypto world, having helped GitCoin manage the project screening process.  <a href="https://www.sensorica.co/">Sensorica</a>, a pioneer <a href="https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Open_Value_Network">open value network</a> (like a pre-crypto DAO) that builds scientific instruments, intends to <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/digital-environment-for-material-commons-based-peer-production-with-sensorica/5659">rebuild</a> their management software on Holochain using the <a href="https://github.com/h-REA">hREA</a> economic toolkit.  <a href="https://twitter.com/kizuna_fndn">Kizuna</a> is a new private messenger app from scratch using Holochain, and they have a usable demo you can download in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/tags">Holochain Launcher</a>.  <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">Flux</a> is a ‘community in a box’, a way for clubs, teams, DAOs, and other groups to spin up communication and knowledge sharing software. They have an installable <a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases/tag/v0.2.17">early release</a> you can try; it feels a lot like Discord or Slack.  <a href="https://sprillow.com/">Sprillow</a> is a small dev shop focused entirely on building hApps. Their flagship product is <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn">Acorn</a>, a beautiful app for planning goals together, and they’re also taking on stewardship of hREA.  <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/">Lightning Rod Labs</a> is a coalition of developers and designers (some of them Holo alumni) who build interesting local-first hApps and experiments for <a href="https://github.com/glassbeadsoftware/snapmail">self-hosted email</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/where">group self-awareness</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">collaborative document editing</a>.  <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/">IOEN</a> is using Holochain to build cooperative management software for micro-grids powered by renewable electricity.  <p>This course will probably look good on a resume too. And even if you don’t end up creating hApps, Rust is becoming increasingly popular, especially in the DWeb and web3 world, and knowledge of distributed systems is now in demand whether you’re working in decentralised or traditional cloud.</p><p>Can you see yourself becoming a part of this ecosystem? If so, it’s time to get skilled up.</p><blockquote><a href="https://holo.host/holochain-rust-developer-immersive">More info</a> · <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/MFclGDrB">Apply now!</a></blockquote> Don’t miss the next AMA! <p>AMA #51, coming up on Wednesday, June 8th at 16:30 UTC, &nbsp;is going to be all about the Developer Education Initiative.

Most of this has been simplification under the hood, but the API has seen some breaking changes too. Here are the highlights:</p>  New: More complete typedefs for the parts of Tryorama that you interact with.  New: Complete documentation for the entire Tryorama API. This is exciting! <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/blob/v0.5.2/docs/tryorama.md">Check it out</a>.  New: Use the <code>hc</code> command to manage conductors.  Breaking: Removed middleware feature (previously supported <code>tape</code> and TryCP).  Breaking: Conductor config files are no longer generated and stored; the config is passed to the <code>hc</code> command instead.  Breaking: Removed implicit usage of <code>tape</code> as test harness; it’s now unopinionated and you can use any JavaScript-based testing framework you like.  Maintenance: Greatly expanded test coverage, and tests run on both Linux and macOS to check for OS-specific failures.  <p>You can get it from <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/tryorama/v/0.5.2">NPM</a> by installing <code>@holochain/tryorama</code> in your test project.</p> Holochain Launcher 0.4.7 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.136<br>Lair keystore version: 0.1.3</p><p>The three releases since I made a big <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/launcher-launches-new-features/#unboxing-the-user-friendly-launcher-044">noise</a> about Launcher in the last Dev Pulse have been mostly bug fixes — no new conductor versions are included.</p>  Bugfix: Don’t overwrite local RPC and keystore interface settings when saving new config file.  Bugfix: Fix incorrect mimetype for JavaScript assets served to browser.  Bugfix: Fix incorrect compatible HDK version for Holochain 0.0.131.  <p>On a side note, there are now a few more applications for you to download and try from the built-in DevHub, including the Kizuna messenger!</p> Holochain 0.0.140, 0.0.141, and 0.0.142: Maintenance releases <p>HDK compatibility (all three releases): 0.0.129 to 0.0.135</p><p>The only significant change among these releases is more documentation improvements, yay! (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1391">#1391</a>) The admin and app RPC API documentation has gotten a big cleanup; read them <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/0.0.42/holochain_conductor_api/index.html">here</a>.</p><p>Minor updates:</p>  Bugfix (regression): Fix broken tracing (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1389">#1389</a>).  Use Rust 1.60 by default in Holonix shell (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1383">#1383</a>).   Holochain in Action videos  Launcher + DevHub demo <p>A recent Holochain in Action meeting unpacked the newest Holochain Launcher with the built-in DevHub. If you haven’t tried it yet, you can experience it through other people’s eyes here.</p> Profiles module <p>Yesterday’s meeting involved a pair programming session on integrating the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles/">Profiles module</a> into a basic hApp. Member profiles are of course an important part of almost any app with a social component, so I’m guessing this video will be useful to most of you.</p> Neighbourhoods in the news <p><a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a>, a sister project building tools for reputation and shared social sense-making, has been getting public lately. Everything they’re sharing is a good window of what they’re planning, and will give you nutritious food for thought in designing your app to foster healthy social interactions. Here are a couple recent things:</p> Articles: Distributed Social Sensemaking, Parts 1 and 2 <p>I’ve been loving this series of articles about ‘distributed social sensemaking’. If that term is unfamiliar to you, it simply means how we make sense of the things we see and hear about, together, without top-down management. There are dysfunctional and healthy ways to do social sensemaking, and in this series Dr Emaline Friedman, Pablo Somonte Ruano, and the rest of the Neighbourhoods team unpack their vision of how tech could help facilitate the healthy kind. Read <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/distributed-social-sensemaking-part-1-7f2e816d9031">part 1</a> and <a href="https://blog.neighbourhoods.network/distributed-social-sensemaking-part-2-b696b8204e7e">part 2</a> (parts 3 and 4 still to come).</p> Presentation: Social Sensemaking and Governance <p>Two weeks ago the <a href="https://metagov.org/">Metagovernance Project</a> hosted Dr Emaline Friedman and Michael Hueschen from Neighbourhoods. They got the chance to share their plans to build tools for ‘soft’ governance via social norms expressed in day-to-day activities. In other words, the ways our group’s members express themselves in normal interactions shapes the way we make decisions together, and can reduce the need for more formal governance structures like voting, moderation, penalties, token engineering, etc, and can also reduce the need for a “march on city hall” when governance goes wrong, as Emaline says. Sounds like a much gentler approach than much of what’s being explored in the crypto-governance space, although it does seem to be moving rapidly towards this sort of soft governance as it grows up.</p> DWeb Camp returns in August <p>After a long absence, <a href="https://dwebcamp.org/">DWeb Camp</a> is back again, August 24th to 28th in Camp Navarro, CA, US! This weekend event is hosted by the <a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a> and attracts people who are involved in a lot of different DWeb and web3 people, representing everything from traditional HTTP-based approaches like <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid</a> and <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>, to cryptographic protocols like <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> and Holochain (and yes, even a bit of blockchain), to social initiatives like <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/">Centre for Humane Tech</a> and <a href="https://compost.digital">COMPOST magazine</a>. It’s a wonderful mashup of ideas, projects, and personalities; I thoroughly enjoyed the first (and so far only) one back in 2019.</p><p>It’d be great if you could come, and I’d love to meet you in person. I’m not saying we should dominate DWeb Camp or anything, but if Holochain had a visible presence there, would that be a bad thing?</p><p>There are scholarships available if you’d love to go but can’t afford it, and you can also volunteer to help with camp setup, facilitation, and tear-down. If you love giving presentations, you can sign up to give a lightning talk, and if you love hosting workshops, you can do that too. <a href="https://dwebcamp.org">Learn more and sign up here</a>.</p>

<p>This week, Verizon released its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">DBIR report</a> marking 15 years of the annual report. In the report, Verizon highlighted their analysis of more than 5,212 breaches and 23,896 security incidents to find that attackers have four key paths to enterprise estates; credentials, phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, and malicious botnets.</p>
<p>They go on to state that hackers exploit the human element (including errors, misuse and social engineering). Combining this element and the entry points above, hackers gain access to organizations to launch their attacks. In fact, Verizon states that 82% of intrusions this year were related to that human element which included – errors, misuse, and social engineering. In addition, the Verizon research broke down the factors leveraged in a breach:</p>
 
 45% were related to credential reuse 
 25% were related to social engineering 
 50% were related to remote access and web applications 
 
<p>The takeaway here is the fact that humans (re. employees) are still the weak link in the security chain. Why? Because users continue to click malicious links, they continue to “lose” or give away their credentials. Users are still making poor security decisions and as a result, hackers are gaining access to applications, systems, and data. While that likely is not a surprise to anyone the numbers make this abundantly clear. As they do most years. And while these reports can be all doom and gloom, fear not, it’s not all bad, because there are ways to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While eliminating the human element sounds challenging for organizations, there are options. Verizon recommends the usual approach to solve some of these problems like deploying two-factor authentication and/or implementing password managers for users, all in an effort to avoid the impact credentials introduce. This approach can reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to exploit poor passwords to gain access to applications, systems, and data. These capabilities have been available and in production for years BUT we are still seeing similar numbers year over year from reports like this year’s DBIR.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on credentials. Why? If you do a quick search for the term in the report it appears 86 times! With that in mind, the report states: “Unfortunately, if you can access the asset directly over the internet simply by entering the credentials, so can the criminals.” So if we can improve upon authenticating users without the use of credentials then I’d argue organizations will be better for it.</p>
<p>How can the use of credentials be improved over the recommendations? Eliminating as many of them as possible. But how? It sounds complicated and even impossible! But that’s simply not the case. Take for instance what 1Kosmos customers can do. Our customers systematically replace credentials with real biometrics that are matched to a verified digital identity and it works across all operating systems including <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/microsoft-windows-and-windows-hello-for-business/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/macos/">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/blockid-workforce-for-unix/">Unix</a>, and <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/linux/">Linux</a>.</p>
<p>How can credentials be replaced? With identity. By combining<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/online-id-verification/"> identity verification</a> with access management organizations can eliminate credentials, especially passwords and therefore, prevent most of the 82% of intrusions caused by humans. This would then free up organizations to place focus on other areas that inject more security risk.</p>
<p>Hopefully, more organizations will take this approach and next year we’ll see a decline in these human-based errors.</p>

 Personal data between the United States and the European Union might soon be flowing smoothly again after the two jurisdictions agreed in principle to a new privacy framework. 



 



<p>Data transfers between the EU and the US have been problematic for some time due to a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">conflict</a>&nbsp;between US surveillance laws and EU data protection and privacy regulations. In&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">July 2020</a>&nbsp;the Court of Justice of the European Union&nbsp;invalidated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">Privacy Shield</a>,&nbsp;an arrangement that had allowed&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/">more than 5,000</a>&nbsp;US companies to conduct transatlantic trade while complying with EU data protection rules.&nbsp;The landmark ruling, informally known as&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/">Schrems II</a>&nbsp;after Max Schrems, the lawyer and privacy advocate who filed the original complaint against Facebook with the Irish Data Protection Commissioner,&nbsp;struck down Privacy Shield on the basis that US surveillance programs (signals intelligence activities such as wiretapping phone calls, SMS, and any type of data transfer)&nbsp;went beyond what was strictly necessary and&nbsp;EU&nbsp;citizens had no “actionable judicial redress” or effective remedy in the US. In a nutshell, Privacy Shield didn’t protect Europeans from US surveillance.&nbsp;The decision meant companies and regulators have had to approach data transfers on a case-by-case basis to determine whether they’re meeting EU standards, which hampers trade and increases their compliance burden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further back from Privacy Shield, though, was Safe Harbor, which Europe’s top court also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">invalidated</a>&nbsp;over “the same core clash between EU privacy rights and US surveillance laws” following a case also put by Max Schrems.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/europes-top-court-strikes-down-flagship-eu-us-data-transfer-mechanism/">Tech Crunch</a>&nbsp;explained: “Putting a little more meat on the bones, the US’ prioritizing of digital surveillance — as revealed by the 2013 revelations of NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden; and writ large in the breadth of data capture powers allowed by Section 702 of FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) and executive order 12,333 (which sanctions bulks collection) — collides directly with European fundamental rights which give citizens rights to privacy and data protection, as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights and specific pieces of pan-EU legislation (such as the General Data Protection Regulation).”</p>



<p>Facebook (cited in the Schrems case) and other big data companies like Google were particularly hard hit by the loss of smooth transatlantic data flows.&nbsp;Meta has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">threatened</a>&nbsp;to shut down Facebook and Instagram in Europe over the data transfers uncertainty in recent years.</p>



<p>At the time of the Schrems II ruling, the International Association of Privacy Professionals (<a>IAPP</a>) made the point that&nbsp;data protection is incredibly important to global commerce, and privacy professionals play a critical role in implementing protections in line with foreign legal requirements.</p>



 



 What the new agreement means 



<p></p>



<p>The new privacy framework, agreed to in principle by the US and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en">European Commission</a>, brings to a head a couple years of legal wrangling and offers the potential for easier cross-border data transfers going forward, especially for Meta and Google and the thousands of other companies that rely on smooth data flows for trade.</p>



<p>In announcing the new deal in late March, President Biden&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/25/remarks-by-president-biden-and-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-in-joint-press-statement/">said</a>,&nbsp;“This framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection, and to the rule of law,” and that the flow of data would “help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relationships with the EU.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/25/remarks-by-president-biden-and-european-commission-president-ursula-von-der-leyen-in-joint-press-statement/">added</a>&nbsp;that the new agreement would “enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and US, safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">Nick Clegg</a>, Meta’s president of global affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">said</a>&nbsp;the deal “will provide invaluable certainty for American and European companies of all sizes, including Meta, who rely on transferring data quickly and safely.”</p>



<p>Nick Clegg has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">summarized</a>&nbsp;the data transfers issue in strong terms as “the global internet fragmenting”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s president of global affairs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">Kent Walker</a>, also welcomed the development: “People want to be able to use digital services from anywhere in the world and know that their information is safe and protected when they communicate across borders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we’re not out of the woods on this issue yet. This new agreement is expected to be heavily tested with legal challenges, some of which Schrems himself indicates he might launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/eu-and-us-agree-new-data-transfer-pact-to-replace-privacy-shield.html">saying</a>&nbsp;the “final text” of the new agreement would take more time to come through, and that he was prepared to challenge it “if it is not in line with EU law.”</p>



<p>“In the end, the [EU] Court of Justice will decide a third time. We expect this to be back at the Court within months from a final decision,” Schrems said in a&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en/privacy-shield-20-first-reaction-max-schrems">statement</a>&nbsp;on the web site of his privacy non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a>.</p>



 



 The detail as it currently stands 



<p></p>



 In the White House&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/fact-sheet-united-states-and-european-commission-announce-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;on the new privacy framework, we glean some of the key detail that was missing when the deal was first announced: 



<p></p>



  The new agreement is officially called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, and promises to be “a durable and reliable legal basis for data flows”, fostering&nbsp;transatlantic data transfers and addressing the concerns raised in the Schrems II decision.&nbsp;  The framework commits the US to “implement new safeguards to ensure that signals intelligence activities are necessary and proportionate in the pursuit of defined national security objectives, which will ensure the privacy of EU personal data and to create a new mechanism for EU individuals to seek redress if they believe they are unlawfully targeted by signals intelligence activities.”  The framework will benefits citizens and companies in both the US and EU. “For EU individuals, the deal includes new, high-standard commitments regarding the protection of personal data. For citizens and companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the deal will enable the continued flow of data that underpins more than $1 trillion in cross-border commerce every year, and will enable businesses of all sizes to compete in each other’s markets.”&nbsp;  



 The White House says the United States has made “unprecedented commitments to: 



<p></p>



  Strengthen the privacy and civil liberties safeguards governing US signals intelligence activities;  Establish a new redress mechanism with independent and binding authority; and  Enhance its existing rigorous and layered oversight of signals intelligence activities.”  



 <br>It gives examples of the new framework’s assurances such as: 



<p></p>



  “Signals intelligence collection may be undertaken only where necessary to advance legitimate national security objectives, and must not disproportionately impact the protection of individual privacy and civil liberties;  EU individuals may seek redress from a new multi-layer redress mechanism that includes an independent Data Protection Review Court that would consist of individuals chosen from outside the US Government who would have full authority to adjudicate claims and direct remedial measures as needed; and  US intelligence agencies will adopt procedures to ensure effective oversight of new privacy and civil liberties standards.”&nbsp;  



<p>The White House says any company or organization that uses the new framework to legally protect data flows must continue to adhere to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Requirements-of-Participation">Privacy Shield Principles</a>, including the requirement to self-certify their adherence to the Principles through the US Department of Commerce. EU individuals will continue to have access to “multiple avenues of recourse to resolve complaints about participating organizations, including through alternative dispute resolution and binding arbitration.”</p>



 



 What we think of this development 



<p></p>



<p>This is an important issue to be across if you do business outside the US. We believe this new privacy framework is necessary, and we’re pleased to see progress on this long-running issue.</p>



<p>Reading the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/25/fact-sheet-united-states-and-european-commission-announce-trans-atlantic-data-privacy-framework/">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;from the White House, it sounds like the US had to make concessions in the main areas that the EU court had issues with: US signals intelligence activities and a perception of lack of oversight and proportionality.</p>



<p>The requirement on companies and organizations to continue to self-certify adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles is something Anonyome Labs already does and will continue to do.</p>



<p>We believe Max Schrems and his privacy non-profit&nbsp;<a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a>&nbsp;will challenge again in the European Court of Justice. And, of course, it’s still for the US to demonstrate in practice that they’ve made real change. We hope this new agreement is not just buying a couple more years on the merry go round.</p>

<p>Cash back is a way stores reward their customers and clients when they purchase items from them. You can avail yourself of it through your credit cards, debit cards, or by using specific apps and websites.</p><p>A cash back program allows you as a cardholder or account owner to refund a certain percentage of the purchase you have made using a credit or debit card or a personal&nbsp;check.</p> Why Do Stores Offer Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>This marketing strategy encourages account owners to utilize their cards and personal accounts in specific applications to conduct purchases with their cards and apps. In this way, financial transactions stay within the terms of their banking system. This scheme is one of the ways banks advertise their company’s products and services.</p> What Line of Stores Offer Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>E stablishments that fulfil our everyday needs such as grocery stores, gas stations, and even department stores offer cash backs. However, it’s rare to find clothing stores, home goods stores, and home furnishing stores that offer cashback promos to their customers.</p><p>If you want to avail cashback promo, it is essential to fairly be straightforward about your intent of availing cashback before making a purchase. This can definitely put you at the advantage of being aware of the store’s welcoming policies on cash&nbsp;backs.</p><p>Several lines of stores are within the country offer cash backs. They can give you cashback if you use your debit card to purchase from their racks rather than credit cards or&nbsp;bills.</p> How do Customers Benefit from a Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback brings a host of benefits in terms of saving money or even putting customers up for loyalty programs. The greatest utility is that a part of what you spend is given back to&nbsp;you.</p><p>It also saves the customers from making errands to the nearest ATM and to servicing banks, as the same stores allow them to avail of the cashback with no fees at all. The fee waiver becomes invalid if they transact from differing branches of banks and&nbsp;ATMs.</p><p>In addition, most stores offering cash backs allow you to withdraw from your checking account through their stores. But of course, it has limits. Should you need cash for a family gathering tomorrow, it is best to go to the nearest branch of your bank. These stores often give money back with minimal to no minimum purchase.</p> Stores That Offer Cash&nbsp;back <p>Now that we have a fair idea of how to receive cashback and save bucks, it is helpful to identify some stores that give cashback to its customers for a variety of purchases.</p> 1. Albertsons <p>The store offers cashback to a maximum of $300.00 if you use your debit card for making a purchase.

It can only be in monetary valuations of $10,$20, $40, or $100. They do not allow customers to customize other amounts for cashback; employing this procedure will enable Aldi to maintain their efficient and super speedy check-out counters.</p><p>Their cashback limit stays within the maximum of $100.00, but if you need a higher amount of cash, you can try splitting your purchases into two payments on the counter. Other options are to go to the nearest ATM booth, your bank, or another store that allows higher cashback.</p> 3. Food&nbsp;Lion <p>It is one of the biggest chains of stores in the United States, started in 1957. The store now has more than a thousand branches in ten different states of the US.

Hannaford <p>Hannaford is one of the longest-running supermarkets in the country today, founded by Arthur Hannaford in 1883 on the waterfront of Portland, Maine. The grocery stores also offer cashback for their customers who will be paying through debit cards, Discovery credit cards, and personal&nbsp;checks.</p><p>They give a maximum cashback of $100, free of charge. You can use your debit card, Discover Credit Card, or your&nbsp;checks.</p> 6.

If you are planning to use a personal check, Kroger can only give you a maximum cashback of $20. You can avail of this reward offer at all Kroger locations.</p><p>Suppose ever you would like to avail of the cashback promos of Kroger. In that case, ensure that your purchases do not include alcohol, tobacco products, pharmaceutical products, gift cards, lottery, money service, fees, and fuel. Cash backs do not include items under the “Manager’s Special” or closing out sales&nbsp;promos.</p><p>You can avail of cashback rewards at the self-check-out counters, customer service help desk, or right at the cash register check-out counters.</p> 7.

			  Thaddee Bousselin is Sales Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Thaddee, I am a 28 year old Frenchman. I am a son, a grandson, a brother, and a partner. I’m also a friend, a travel buddy, and a proud Tokeny coworker!</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Joining Tokeny was really a logical continuation of my previous experiences. I have traveled my entire life: first following my parents and later for my studies. In total, I spent 10 years in South Korea and China, several years in the United States, and spent my university years in the Czech Republic, Spain, and France. Thanks to these experiences, I learned that diversity and an open-minded entourage are must-haves for me. In high school, I started to notice how technology and new companies were constantly reshaping the way I lived. This inspired me to start studying computer science and entrepreneurship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started to follow Tokeny and the disruptions happening in finance and real estate while writing my master’s thesis. I was motivated to learn more, and therefore started an internship related to tokenization. After that, I knew that I wanted to continue in this ecosystem. Tokeny was the obvious top choice, and it all happened very naturally.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s certainly an incredibly fulfilling experience! I feel very fortunate working with&nbsp; like-minded team members that are so passionate about our mission. For every start-up, there are internal challenges. And, as we have seen in the past years, there will also be new and unforeseen external challenges. I feel reassured being part of a team that has a proven ability to grow together in the face of adversity.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>The most important thing to me is to always keep learning and get better at everything I care about. I spend quite some time learning about ways to solve issues such as climate change and finding ways to be proactive about them.</p>
<p>Trying to approach life with a philosophy of gratitude is part of my daily routine, like appreciating the ‘little’ things, good and bad. Of course, I am always looking forward to good times with friends and family. I love listening to and playing music, and on the weekends, you might see me enjoying the thrill of motorcycle driving!</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Hard question! I’d say being able to look back at my life with a smile, knowing I made the ones around me happy and had even a small but positive impact on society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Welcome aboard 🙂 Getting started can sometimes feel overwhelming. Here are a few things that help me daily: setting priorities, planning the day ahead, asking for help, taking the time to learn things step-by-step, and putting everything into perspective. You will see that learning more about blockchain and technology is really part of everyday life at Tokeny, and it keeps us on our toes!</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>So many different things! Most of all the mix of people working here and the incredible service we provide. In my opinion, tokenization will become mainstream, as what we offer is mind-blowing compared to the traditional approach. Being on the forefront of such an evolution and participating in shaping a better tomorrow for entire industries is, for me, a dream come true.</p>

 Build a Java REST API with Helidon 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a Helidon app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn -U archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false \
   -DarchetypeGroupId=io.helidon.archetypes \

You can also install <a href="https://helidon.io/docs/v2/#/about/05_cli">Helidon’s CLI</a> and run <code>helidon init</code>.



 
 
 
<p>Add MicroProfile JWT support in <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.helidon.microprofile.jwt&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;helidon-microprofile-jwt-auth&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloResource</code> class that returns the user’s information: [<code>h-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.helidon.security.Principal;
import io.helidon.security.SecurityContext;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import java.util.Optional;

import static javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Optional&lt;Principal&gt; userPrincipal = context.userPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.get().getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloApplication</code> class in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest</code> to register your resource and configure JWT authentication: [<code>h-app</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import com.okta.rest.controller.HelloResource;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.auth.LoginConfig;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import java.util.Set;

@LoginConfig(authMethod = "MP-JWT")
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Set&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getClasses() {
        return Set.of(HelloResource.class);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Helidon REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 mvn package &amp;&amp; java -jar ./target/helidon.jar 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Helidon app with GraalVM 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Helidon app into a native executable using the <code>native-image</code> profile:</p>
 
 
 mvn package -Pnative-image 
 
 
 
 
<p>Start your Helidon app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/helidon 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps start up 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

<p>The United States is home to <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2021/08/31/advocacy-releases-2021-small-business-profiles-for-the-states/">32.5 million</a> small businesses, which amounts to 99.9% of all <a href="https://www.uschamber.com/small-business/state-of-small-business-now">businesses</a> in the country. They employ just under half of the workforce, and are responsible for 44% of <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/small-businesses-really-mean-us-220028160.html#:~:text=A%20new%20report%20also%20shows,portion%20of%20overall%20GDP%20contribution.">total GDP</a>. Clearly, supporting the growth of small-to-midsize businesses is essential to the lifeblood of the economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The important role of the small business in the economy isn’t always reflected by lending guidelines that work for the small business owner, however. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/problems-getting-a-small-business-loan/">Thirty percent</a> of businesses that apply for credit through traditional lenders are denied, or only qualify for a portion of the funds they need. These numbers drop <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-november-consumer-community-context.htm#f4">even further</a> for minorities looking for the operating capital they need to grow their businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an increasingly data-driven, digital economy, there’s room for additional choice. Innovative lending solutions can give every owner an equal opportunity to make their business dreams a reality.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking is Giving Lenders and Small Business Owners More Choice 
<p>According to Mastercard’s <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking study</a>, 74% of small-to-midsize business (SMB) owners would share business performance data if it meant that they could better demonstrate their ability to pay back a loan and have more choice in lending options. Black, hispanic and millennial owners are even more enthusiastic about sharing financial data, if sharing it means being presented with better loan terms and options. Over 80% responded positively to data sharing in each of those demographic categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Owner-permissioned data through Mastercard’s open banking platform can power apps and services with up to 24 months of rich cash flow attributes. This can inform better, more accurate insights which lenders can use to make financial decisions. Approvals, credit increases, leases and other small business needs can be granted with reduced risk of bad debt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data can be used to develop new lending models and underwrite new lending products. This opens up access to capital with terms and options that can be crafted to fit unique SMB needs. Funding is an ongoing issue for small business owners. Eighty-five percent are looking for faster, easier access to capital, and 62% have received a business loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it comes from public-facing consumer retail, ecommerce, professional services or seasonal businesses, owner-permissioned open banking data is the launchpad for a fast-growing ecosystem of effective financial tools that simply didn’t exist in the pre-digital era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than basing lending decisions on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business-loans/problems-getting-a-small-business-loan/">metrics</a> like personal credit scores, business credit scores and time in business, lenders are using open banking data points and analytics to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2021/11/05/how-fintech-lending-trends-benefit-small-businesses/?sh=32ecff9368fa">unlock capital</a>. Businesses that may have been impeded by traditional guidelines that aren’t aligned with the modern economy now have new options for funding. They’re benefiting from advances in open banking data technology, and they’re asking for the financial opportunities and insights that data can provide.</p>
 Small Business Owners Want to Grow With Tools and Allies 
<p>Despite the challenges of rising costs, talent acquisition, supply chain issues, cybersecurity and a host of other concerns, owners are optimistic and ready to grow. Forty-seven percent say they’re in growth mode, and looking for allies to help them scale up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 80% of owners say they want a partner to help them find access to capital and to loans that fit the needs of their specific business. This is where open banking solutions stand out, and where innovators are expanding the lending ecosystem with data-driven loan products, like:</p>
 
 Low-interest loans 
 Micro-loans 
 Credit card options 
 Niche lending 
 
<p></p>
<p>In just a three-month period at the beginning of 2020, U.S.-based fintech <a href="https://www.lendio.com/">Lendio</a> helped over 100,000 small businesses <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/how-open-banking-is-giving-a-san-diego-coffee-roastery-the-jolt-of-capital-to-thrive/">connect to over $8 billion</a> in <a href="https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans/covid-19-relief-options/paycheck-protection-program">U.S. Paycheck Protection Program loans</a>, using owner-permissioned open banking data to analyze cash flow and other alternative lending metrics.</p>
<p>Small business specialists like Lendio have been a badly-needed lifeline during the pandemic and beyond. An open banking platform makes it possible to close the smaller loans that financial institutions don’t typically originate, and to do it more quickly. The manpower needed to run open banking-powered apps and services is less intensive than what is required to handle the traditional underwriting process at larger institutions. The amount of work that it takes to underwrite smaller loans has made them less appealing to some lenders in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has caused some business owners to be left behind, particularly women and minorities seeking less capital to fund their enterprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Open banking provides real-time data that helps lenders understand a small to mid-sized business’ creditworthiness, letting them more quickly and easily approve loans, no matter the size. With small business loans ranging from <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/loans/small-business-loan-amounts/">$5,000 to $1.2 million</a>, it’s clear there is a wide range of opportunities to ally with owners by offering specialized lending products.&nbsp;</p>
 Addressing a Growing Need in the Small Business Sector 
<p>There’s a growing list of lenders covering every need and every niche that the market is asking for, and demand has never been higher. According to the <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Mastercard study</a>, eighty-seven percent of owners already use or would like to use open banking-powered fintech apps and services to secure funding for their businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small businesses are still recovering from the effects of the pandemic, with the percentage of cash-strapped enterprises <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/loans/2022/federal-reserve-bank-of-philadelphia-report-finds-fintech-lending-crucial-for-smbs/">moving up slightly</a>, from 15% to 18%. Innovators have an opportunity to create solutions that help owners who need reserves and operating capital, but who may have a short tenure in business, a thin credit file or low FICO scores.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners want to secure and refinance loans. They want allies to help them make informed decisions. Ninety-six percent of them are linking their accounts and sharing their data. Alongside the desire for funding, 85% are looking for the customized financial recommendations that can come from sharing data with open banking apps and services. They want access to capital, and they want it quicker and smarter, to keep pace with an unpredictable consumer marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

   Mastercard’s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Finicity) offers pre-close reports that provide just the right data that GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment.

<p>Mastercard’s open banking platform (provided by Mastercard’s wholly-owned subsidiary, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/">Finicity</a>) offers pre-close reports that provide just the right data that GSEs need for 10-day verification of employment. Today, <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/">Freddie Mac</a> announced the acceptance of our Verification of Employment (VOE) Reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In adding the VOE Payroll and Transactions reports to our <a href="https://www.finicity.com/mortgage/">Mortgage Verification Services</a> (MVS) product, we have enabled lenders to receive only the data GSEs require for the 10-day verification. Lenders can use these reports to view only your borrower’s employment status, rather than refreshing the full reports that contain more data than required for an employment verification. This minimizes the introduction of new income data or other redundant and unnecessary underwriting changes that could delay the loan closing or cause additional work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two available reports provide different types of information. The VOE Transactions report contains 120 days of refreshed transactions with dates and description, but no amounts or totals so income is not reassessed. It shows the latest direct deposits in the income streams, to confirm the&nbsp; borrower is still being paid on their regular cadence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is the VOE Payroll report. This contains only employment status and details—no income or other data—so lenders can see that the individual is still employed according to their payroll provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two reports are part of MVS at no extra charge and are currently available for lenders connecting directly to Mastercard and through <a href="https://www.icemortgagetechnology.com/">Ice Mortgage Technology.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VOE Transaction and Payroll reports can help lenders improve accuracy and simplify the process of verifying employment within ten days of closing, removing more friction from the loan origination process without increasing risk. With one click, a GSE-accepted VOE report is available in moments, avoiding the lost time and the uncertainty of tracking down verbal verifications from employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you access these 10-day pre-closing reports?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To pull the VOE reports today, your team will need to code directly to the endpoints or add this functionality through Encompass LOS from Ice Technology. You can find documentation <a href="https://docs.finicity.com/refresh-reports-2/?_ga=2.113730375.1120103029.1652973413-1532333468.1650401033&amp;_gac=1.185664347.1651010851.CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWICAsHgsgrPcIj2ND4TdBsNQLGC5c9HN9lh-6TI1W3zokTiGR_pSKhoCvBwQAvD_BwE">here</a>.

<p>Each year, new platforms and businesses join the ecommerce arena, making it more crowded. This eventually leads to an increase in the cost of clicks and conversions, which is why it is far more economical to get existing consumers to place a repeat purchase than it is to acquire new&nbsp;buyers.</p><p>However, have you ever evaluated your marketing techniques and engaged with your customer base to entice them to return to your store? If you believe you have not done enough, now is an excellent opportunity to develop comprehensive customer retention management strategies. Let’s start with the&nbsp;basics.</p> What is Customer Retention Management? <p>The concept of customer retention management centers around how a customer continues to engage with a business and how that business may gain additional value from its returning customers. According to experts, learning how to manage client retention is critical to a company’s long-term viability.</p><p>Customer retention is important in both contractual and non-contractual relationships. Client retention in a contractual relationship is defined by whether or not the consumer agrees to renew the arrangement, whereas the customer has the flexibility to just stop transacting with a business in a non-contractual relationship.</p><p>In a nutshell, customer retention management is ensuring that the consumers you fought so hard to stick with you, have a high level of customer satisfaction, and continue to cherish your products and services. In some circumstances, it may also entail ensuring that the consumer does not flee to your competitor.</p><p>Churn, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of customer retention. This is when a customer decides to stop doing business with a company. When it comes to retention management, churn is your number one&nbsp;enemy.</p> What Metrics Help You Measure Customer Retention? <p>Measuring customer retention is crucial for businesses since it helps anticipate how long someone will be a loyal client and, ultimately, calculates a company’s long-term profitability and value. It can also be used to assess the health of a business.</p><p>There are different formulas used by experts for measuring retention. However, the traditional equation focuses on the number of customers at the beginning (CS) and end of a period (CE), as well as the number of new customers you get&nbsp;(CN).</p> Customer Retention Formula <p>The formula for calculating customer retention is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>((CE-CN)/CS)) X&nbsp;100</p><p>Don’t be concerned if you’re not a math genius. We will use a short case study to assist you to learn how to use the&nbsp;formula.</p><p>Assume you own a barbershop with 200 repeat clients at the start of last year. Throughout the year, you notice that 20 of those customers are missing, but you also have 40 new customers that come to your place every month. This means you’ll have 220 loyal clients by the end of the&nbsp;year.</p><p>Let’s do the math and enter the numbers into the&nbsp;formula</p><p>((220–40)/200)) X&nbsp;100</p><p>You should get a 90 as the answer, which indicates your customer retention rate for the period is 90%. Is it suitable for a barbershop? It all depends on the industry and the data from previous&nbsp;years.</p> Important Factors for Customer Retention <p>Measuring customer retention is important because if you cannot measure it, it simply means you cannot manage it. However, besides the formula, below you will find some other important factors when measuring your customer retention strategies.</p> 1. Product engagement <p>Customer retention is heavily influenced by how frequently and intensely your consumers buy your service or product. As a result, the greater the frequency and intensity, the higher the product engagement will&nbsp;be.</p><p>Big companies like Facebook and TikTok rely heavily on product engagement to maintain a high number of loyal customers. They accomplish this by creating habit-forming technologies that are intrinsically engineered to keep people encouraged to&nbsp;return.</p> 2. Service&nbsp;quality <p>Service quality is the next most significant element influencing customer retention. While quality is a somewhat subjective concept, certain characteristics, such as a smooth shopping experience and a high level of customization, can positively influence it.</p><p>Customers in the ecommerce industry are concerned not just with the things they purchase, but also with the process of purchasing them, which is why a pleasant shopping experience is essential. To put it another way, the fewer steps required to purchase the product, the more likely the client will&nbsp;return.</p><p>Customers also like it when a company understands exactly what they are looking for. If you’ve ever wondered why large ecommerce companies invest so much money to create an algorithm that knows what someone is looking for, this is the&nbsp;answer.</p> 3. Relationship quality <p>Quality relationship development begins the first moment a consumer walks into your store. Luckily, a warm greeting, a discount coupon after purchase, or even a simple “thank you” should help you make a lasting, positive impression.</p><p>Of course, you should deliver excellent service along the way. Offering multiple communication channels, training your personnel to execute operations effectively, and never ignoring any customer request are some of the keys to accomplishing this.</p><p>Having a specialized customer service team will greatly assist you in creating strong bonds with your client base. This team should not only ensure that the consumer is satisfied, but should also look for ways to win the hearts of your customers.</p> 4. Branding <p>One thing any entrepreneur should understand is that people tend to stick with brands they are familiar with. This is why putting significant effort into your branding should help you get more repeat consumers.</p><p>Clearly presenting your brand helps people in determining whether or not they would think about buying your items. Aside from that, branding will help clients understand what your company advocates for. As a result of these elements, many buyers can make a more informed purchasing decision.</p><p>Knowing how to develop compelling and educational material is also critical. It keeps your clients up to date on your products and, hopefully, keeps them engaged in a continuous and participating cycle.</p> 5. Switching cost <p>If it costs a fortune to get an alternative to your goods, a customer will not move to another brand. Maintaining a loyal consumer should not be difficult if an entrepreneur can give great products, quality service, and strong branding while keeping costs reasonable.</p> Best Practices to Improve Your Customer Retention <p>Every new consumer represents a potential long-term customer. Even if a customer does not return, you should make every effort to leave a positive impression. Certain best practices below can help put you and your company up for success in terms of customer retention.</p><p>The first practice is to make it a priority for your team to maintain and improve the customer experience. It is never only about how much your clients can spend on your products; it is also about what your staff can accomplish for&nbsp;them.</p><p>Your business plan should also be more focused on becoming scalable and capable of supporting the company’s shifting objectives. You must develop ways of measuring the impacts of these adjustments and continue to respond as needed. More importantly, your staff must be adaptable to these developments.</p><p>After you’ve determined what your team is capable of and what your company’s goals are, it’s time to streamline your company’s operations. After streamlining processes, your team should have consistent measures in place for everything from acquiring new customers to minimizing churn.</p><p>Finally, to build a consistent client base, you must maintain customer ties. In terms of shopping habits and experience, you should always be aware of where your buyers are as well as where they are going. This will assist you in ensuring that their path does not take them out the&nbsp;door.</p><p>Integrating these tried-and-true practices into your daily operations should help you prove to your consumers that you are the smartest option. Seek out developing technologies that provide early warning signals for red flags in shopping behavior and recommend appropriate next measures for the best&nbsp;results.</p> The 15 Best Customer Retention Management Strategies for Businesses <p>You should never underestimate the value of a devoted consumer base. According to studies, loyal customers account for 68 percent of sales, so maintaining existing clients should be your top priority. Read on for the greatest strategies for maintaining a high level of customer&nbsp;loyalty.</p> 1. Set realistic expectations for your customers <p>It can be unlikely to please someone you hardly know at times, so you may think it’s normal to create high expectations for them. However, if you want to set and satisfy client expectations, it is best to be truthful while making a&nbsp;promise.</p><p>Only guarantee what you can do and give your customers expectations that you can meet. If you are unable to fulfill expectations, apologize and recompense your customers.</p><p>If a customer expects a high-quality product and service but receives a subpar product, the disappointment will linger for a long time. They will eventually find it impossible to forget false promises and, worse, will leave negative reviews about your&nbsp;company.</p> 2. Build trust slowly and carefully through relationships <p>Customers agree that trust is a crucial aspect of their judgment when making a purchase. However, developing trust is not a process that any company can undertake overnight.</p><p>You allow new and existing clients to trust you when you create interactions with them. Unfortunately, if clients realize you’re not trustworthy, they’ll go to your competitors.</p><p>After all, consistency in offering value to customers is a major aspect of creating trust, so your business should be persistent in meeting customer needs. As previously said, continuously delivering on your marketing promise over time will influence whether or not your clients see your company as trustworthy.</p> 3. Improve your customer service department’s KPIs <p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurable benchmarks that show how well a company is able to meet corporate objectives. These criteria are necessary so that businesses can assess their progress in meeting&nbsp;targets.</p><p>KPIs can be thought of as a road map to your goals. They assist you in seeing what the future brings for your company and the path you should&nbsp;take.</p><p>Developing working KPIs for your customer service division quantifies a variety of criteria depending on your sector. However, they mostly involve response time, conversion rate, and funnel drop&nbsp;rate.</p><p>The results will astound you once you start measuring these KPIs. It will be easier to determine how to better engage customers and what actions must be&nbsp;taken.</p> 4. Make use of customer feedback&nbsp;surveys <p>Client feedback surveys may appear boring, and their response rate is not always high, yet they can offer you valuable customer input. It can be a great instrument for increasing customer interaction and driving business&nbsp;actions.</p><p>Hearing personally from clients about how they feel about your offerings is a terrific approach to strengthen the connections that already exist. When people are given the opportunity to communicate themselves, they share their thoughts and opinions about your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>It is critical not to frown when your consumers complain. Learn about their dissatisfaction and be perceptive enough to discover their pain points. Making changes in such areas will assist you in improving customer relationships.</p> 5. Develop real-time customer engagement protocols <p>One of the most renowned client retention tactics is to use real-time customer engagement solutions. Live sessions have been shown to have a significant influence on customer satisfaction, and quick response decreases the number of client touchpoints.</p><p>Some financial organizations, for example, have co-browsing and video chat solutions in place. Their primary objectives are to promote user involvement through internet banking activities and to provide a cutting-edge digital banking experience.</p><p>Face-to-face interactions also promote individualized conversations with customers. Interestingly, research has shown that video chat solutions also help anxieties and concerns settle faster, allowing you to develop personal and dependable relations with&nbsp;clients.</p> 6. Try to outperform your&nbsp;claims <p>The secret to not disappointing your customers is to under promise and over deliver. When you follow this approach, you are surpassing customer expectations, giving your company the opportunity to gain a more loyal customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>It is critical to keep your promises and to dare to exceed them. Never miss a chance to delight your consumers. Treat them as special individuals, and you will undoubtedly increase customer retention.</p><p>Be aware that the initial purchase of your product is a delicate stage. When they are disappointed, they can become hostile. So, something as easy as delivering your product a few days sooner than promised will make your consumer delighted.</p> 7. Make a schedule for customer interactions <p>You use a communication calendar to stay in touch with your consumers on a routine basis. Even if your clients do not provide feedback, your team should be assertive in interacting with&nbsp;them.</p><p>The calendar is essentially a pre-programmed series of phone calls, events, and so on. Through continuous contact and exchanges, it is expected that doubts will be removed, trust levels will be increased, and the consumer will be persuaded to&nbsp;return.</p><p>Luckily, you can now effortlessly automate frequent contacts with your consumers. There are various communication calendar solutions available online today that enable you to deliver unique offers and appreciation messages to customers on a certain schedule.</p> 8. Learn something from any customer complaint <p>Only bad business owners feel the urge to flee from complaining customers. If you want to be a successful businessman, you should go for these clients since they might be your most valuable marketing asset.</p><p>Complaints highlight what you should change and what you need to discard in your company. You may learn what your consumers care about and what they anticipate from your services by analyzing client complaints.</p><p>Some consumers leave without leaving a comment, which is bad for your business. Encourage people to share their concerns because this is how you learn about flaws in your products and services.</p> 9. Figure out the CLV of your&nbsp;business <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of these critical key performance metrics that demonstrates the importance of your clients over time. For example, if you provide subscription-based online courses, your primary focus should be on each customer’s lifetime&nbsp;value.</p><p>Some of your consumers have contributed more than others. Those who consistently purchase your stuff should be considered VIP customers.</p><p>This is because they not only provide you with continuous income, but they are also the same clients who will promote your business to others. They tell their peers about their experience, which helps your brand’s credibility.</p> 10. Consistently deliver valuable information <p>Just because a customer has made a transaction with you does not suggest you should abandon your efforts to seal the deal. Because people have more alternatives than ever before, go the additional mile and provide them with something meaningful.</p><p>Education is one of the most significant services you can provide to your customers. The goal here is to advise and engage people until they are ready to buy your&nbsp;product.</p><p>It provides clients with knowledge and insights into the product to help them comprehend it. Once they become loyal, they can also turn into your brand advocates.</p> 11. Re-engage customers by leveraging automation technologies <p>It takes time to manually check and keep your consumers informed. There are numerous actions that must be performed daily to keep your brand relevant in the minds of your customers. This is where automation technology can come in&nbsp;handy.</p><p>They enable software to handle parts of your processes automatically. You may manage your customer contacts, continue giving education letters, schedule marketing offers, and send other notifications using automation.</p><p>Not only will you notice an improvement in conversion rate as you engage clients automatically, but you will also be able to form stronger ties. Moreover, making these processes more efficient will allow you to deliver on the promises you make to your&nbsp;clients.</p> 12. Monitor and evaluate churn&nbsp;metrics <p>Businesses that want to optimize retention efforts must understand how to analyze and measure churn data. You should be measuring and evaluating the number of consumers who churn as well as the reasons why they&nbsp;churn.</p><p>You can improve the customer experience by learning why consumers leave and how they leave. More importantly, it teaches you how to keep your current consumers from&nbsp;leaving.</p><p>Customer churn will come regardless of your best attempts. When this occurs, you should take advantage of the chance to investigate what you can do to prevent a comparable customer from leaving for the same reason in the&nbsp;future.</p> 13. Provide customized, one-of-a-kind services to loyal customers <p>Scientists believe that surprise is beneficial to the brain. It provides enjoyment and spice to one’s life. So, instead of waiting for your clients to make a request, go ahead and delight them with personalized service.</p><p>Unexpected offers can give your clients the impression that they are a part of something special. Therefore, if you want your clients to stick around and love your brand, you should go above and beyond the standard service that you&nbsp;provide.</p><p>A well-designed client retention campaign can be a fantastic idea. By rewarding your consumers with one-of-a-kind discounts and prizes, you make them feel good about their purchases and encourage them to&nbsp;return.</p> 14. Use newsletters to keep in touch with customers <p>Generating email newsletters is still the most effective client retention method. It is one of the most effective strategies to stay in touch with consumers and develop long-term connections with&nbsp;them.</p><p>It is essential to follow up with new clients and email subscribers after the initial interaction. If you want to cultivate client loyalty, you must keep your subscribers up to date on the latest and hottest information from your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Email newsletters enable you to convey relevant information to your intended audience. You can categorize the list based on characteristics such as buying habits and age demographics, and then tailor the newsletter to each category.</p> 15. Create a community to improve customer interactions <p>Creating a forum on your webpage is an easy approach to fostering engagement and community. Having a forum allows your customers to discuss your products, services, and everything else about your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>One example of a very active platform used by store owners to communicate with customers is a discussion board. The platform allows users to post challenges, questions, and fresh ideas. This media can also be used to share information about new product features, promotions, and expansions.</p><p>You may even spice up the conversation by rewarding your most active users. This would encourage more active engagement, which would increase your customers’ loyalty to your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Look around and you’ll find that prosperous digital companies got there not only because of their excellent services, but also because their customers collaborated. They employ community platforms to connect with customers, eventually transforming them into brand advocates.</p><p>However, you will almost certainly come across bad remarks or complaints. When you find one, don’t dismiss it; instead, confront it. Users will learn, respect, and trust your brand this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>Now that you’re armed with a list full of useful retention management strategies, which would you go for first? There is no one-size-fits-all solution that will work for every business, but as long as you keep the customer’s interests in mind, they will&nbsp;return.</p><p>To proactively treat customers, you must provide excellent customer service and build interpersonal kindness. With well-designed client retention strategies, you will better understand your consumers’ needs and enhance&nbsp;loyalty.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-retention-management/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Identity has to be mobile. It makes no sense to talk about verifying and sharing data if you can’t do either through a mobile device. But this simple requirement can be a technical challenge when, as with mobile devices, IP addresses aren’t permanent. </p>
<p>This is why you need a Mediator Agent. A Mediator Agent provides a cloud-based connection point that will hold and receive messages for Mobile Agents. <br></p>
<p>Given how critical mediation is to decentralized identity adoption, Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-tech-advances-decentralized-identity-with-release-of-critical-open-source-technology/">built</a> on the work of the open-source community to make mediation interoperable and vendor agnostic. We developed a robust Mediator Agent and contributed it to Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) and the Aries Toolbox. </p>
<p>As a result, mediation can be managed and debugged through ACA-Py’s built-in Admin REST API.</p>
<p>But we also host a <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-public-mediator-2/">public version</a> on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-networks/">Indicio Network</a>, our Hyperledger Indy-based global network for decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Use the Indicio’s free hosted Mediator Agent for testing <br>If you’re building solutions that need a Mediator Agent, you can use Indicio’s hosted version for testing, development, and demonstrations. </p>
<p>This will shorten the time to develop proof-of-concept and pilot solutions and help with ensuring interoperability. You can access the Indicio-hosted Public Test Mediator Agent <a href="https://indicio-tech.github.io/mediator/">here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also run a Mediator Agent Training <a href="https://indicio.tech/product/mediator-agent-training/">workshop</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mediation doesn’t have to be a struggle<br>We know mediation is a concern, and we know some have struggled with it; but it’s a problem that has been solved. The Hyperledger Aries Mediator Agent works—try it, use it, and if you have any questions, <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">we’re here to help</a>.</p>

<p>“Hybrid” is everywhere today, whether it’s vehicles, work or infrastructure deployment – you can’t help noticing the rise of hybrid. Identity and Access Management (IAM) deployments are no different, but why is hybrid cloud and on-premises important for IAM, and when might you need it? In this blog we’ll take a brief look at these questions and give you our view on the state of IAM deployments today and where hybrid is heading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The paths to hybrid 
<p>We’ve all got a pretty good idea of what we mean when we talk about a hybrid ‘thing’: a system that uses different (heterogenous) parts, a mixture of various items. Less immediately obvious is that we have two paths to transitioning to hybrid.</p>
<p>The first path is an evolutionary one, where new, different parts are added as part of a longer roadmap to achieve a specific end-state. A good example here is hybrid vehicles. Originally, internal combustion engines were the main power source. The value of electric power was easily recognised but battery technology lacked the convenience of ‘wet fuel’, so the hybrid vehicle was born. As battery technology improved, pure electric vehicles became more common. Here, hybrid is an evolutionary steppingstone.</p>
<p>The second path is a symbiotic one, where two differing things/approaches are combined to deliver a better, broader outcome. Let’s take the work example. Pre-pandemic, we had a global ‘in-office’ culture. Corporations would give many reasons for employees to be present, on-site each day. Then the pandemic hit. As a result, organisations were forced to transition to a home working approach. With the slow return to ‘normal’, it has become clear to many organisations that there are significant benefits (as well as some challenges) to various aspects of home working, and so are now adopting a hybrid approach to maximise the benefits of both options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hybrid IT deployments 
<p>The world of IT and infrastructure is no different to any other eco-system. The common element is the variety of systems and deployment models that exist.</p>
<p>Cloud deployments models are the norm, with many systems being consumed ‘as a Service/aaS’. Cloud deployments effectively outsource the physical infrastructure issues, and the ‘aaS’ layer further outsources the management and maintenance of the platforms. Combined, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS have massively lowered deployment costs and time to ‘live’.</p>
<p>Whilst the benefits of cloud deployments are well understood, there still exist disparate cloud platforms and legacy systems that are fundamental to the complete business needs.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary point of view, the majority of business began with on-premises platforms and, over time, replaced many of their systems with cloud-based platforms. The interim, and even final state in many cases, is hybrid combining multi-cloud and on-premises systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hybrid IAM 
<p>The IAM platform is no different to any other IT platform. IAM is commonly found at the core of Zero Trust initiatives and underpinning workforce and customer access to various systems. It is the breadth of integrations that shape the deployment models selected for an IAM platform.</p>
<p>Some IAM vendors offer IDaaS (Identity as a Service), with the IAM capabilities delivered as a service from a cloud. Some offer on-premises in the customers data centre. And some, such as Ubisecure, offer both options.</p>
<p>We’ve already acknowledged that ‘aaS’ brings efficiency and timeliness, so why would an organisation want to continue with on-premises? The answer tends to fall into one of three categories:</p>
 
 Security 
 Regulation 
 Legacy 
 
<p>The security category is always one up for debate. However there are organisations, typically governments and very large enterprises that, by policy, require deployments on-premises in their data centres, managed by their staff.</p>
<p>Regulation, typically national ‘data residency’ based, can require user attributes and data to be hosted in the user’s home country. Of course, this does not preclude a cloud deployment in that country, but there could be circumstances where that is not the most viable solution and so an on-prem solution is implemented.</p>
<p>Legacy integration can impact many architectures. And if the user directory itself originates from an on-prem legacy system, the IAM platform will have to be closely coupled to that system.</p>
<p>Hybrid solutions – a combination of cloud and on-prem components – can provide an effective architecture to the above situations. Placing the majority of the IAM features in the cloud and connecting to an on-prem IdP (user directory) can realise the benefits of both deployment models.</p>
<p>For organisations with multiple identity sources, using a cloud IAM deployment as a central brokering/integration point can simplify integration. This model also applies to multi-national companies operating across data residency boundaries (for example, EU-Russia-China-Brazil).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Some examples of hybrid IAM 
<p>We have written previously about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customer-iam/ciam-mergers-acquisitions/" title="the value of IAM for assisting integration following M&amp;A activity">the value of IAM for assisting integration following M&amp;A activity</a>. Running an evolutionary hybrid model that connects the various identity sources from the acquisitions provides an efficient mechanism to perform initial technical integration. With a suitable cloud deployed, fine grained access management platform, such as Ubisecure IDaaS, disparate systems can be quickly connected and securely accessed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From a regulatory perspective, we need to be mindful of data storage vs data processing. An experienced Data Protection Officer is a must these days. However, the ability to connect a number of separate identity stores, manage the identities locally whilst managing the stores centrally, and provide a single standards compliant interface to the various relying parties within the organisation’s IT domain, delivers substantial savings to the organisation.</p>
<p>A typical example of this is a large multi-national with employees or customers spread over multiple regions with differing data residency requirements. Deploying local user directories, aggregated and accessed via a cloud deployment, provides a hybrid mechanism to centralise capability whilst distributing user data.</p>
<p>Finally, the ability to integrate user directories from legacy systems, often with non-standards-based interfaces, is key to an organisation’s evolution. Using a cloud-based IAM platform that supports custom interfaces with standard protocols like <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/open-id-connect-ciba/" title="CIBA">CIBA</a> provides a lower risk alternative to a big bang replacement project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Ubisecure IDaaS 
<p>The Ubisecure IAM platform is available as IDaaS and on-premises from a single core set of software. The IAM platform caters for all of the above scenarios and can be connected to third party on-prem systems, or even deployed as on-prem software, to encapsulate various use cases whilst still providing relying party connectivity via the cloud instance.

  <p>I recently got back from a series of events filled with lots of interesting discussions around various OAuth-related topics. At the official IETF meeting in Vienna back in March, I presented the latest work on OAuth 2.1 and we discussed and made progress on some of the current open issues. At the OAuth Security Workshop a few weeks later, I presented a session on client authentication for mobile apps, and there were many more presentations on a huge variety of topics. Many of us went straight from there to the European Identity and Cloud Conference to continue those discussions the next week.</p>

<p>One recurring theme that came up across the series of events concerned the idea of OAuth client impersonation and authentication.</p>

 What is OAuth client impersonation? 

<p>In short, OAuth client impersonation is when one OAuth client pretends to be another, usually to take advantage of any capabilities that the legitimate client may have that are not granted to other clients.</p>

<p>In OAuth terminology, a “Confidential Client” is an application that is issued credentials by the authorization server and can use these credentials to authenticate itself to the OAuth server when doing things like requesting access tokens. The credential can be a simple client secret or a more secure option such as a private key used to sign a JWT. The benefit of using client authentication of any sort, assuming the client properly protects its credentials, is that the OAuth server knows that any requests made with those credentials are from the legitimate client, and client impersonation isn’t possible.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a “Public Client” is an application that doesn’t have credentials, hence cannot prove its own identity when contacting the authorization server for tasks such as requesting access tokens. Usually this is because it would be impossible to deploy such an application with credentials in a way that would remain secret. Common examples of public clients are single-page apps and mobile/desktop apps. In both cases, if you were to try to include a client secret in the app, it would be possible for anyone to extract the secret, which means it would no longer be secret. For this reason, it has always been the case that OAuth flows for public clients are done with entirely public information.</p>

<p>Originally, the Implicit flow was recommended for both SPAs and mobile apps. Proof Key for Code Exchange (also known as PKCE) was later introduced as an additional security feature for the authorization code flow, primarily targeted at mobile apps. As browsers evolved, it eventually became possible to do the authorization code flow with PKCE from single-page apps as well. The current draft of the OAuth Security Best Current Practice deprecates the use of the Implicit flow, and recommends using PKCE for both SPAs and mobile apps, as well as web server applications. That said, this recommendation has nothing to do with client impersonation. PKCE solves a number of different attacks, and even solves attacks that are still possible with a client secret, but it is not a form of client authentication so it doesn’t solve client impersonation attacks for public clients.</p>

<p>For public clients, both the Implicit flow and Authorization Code flow with PKCE are done with only the publicly-known information about the client: the <code>client_id</code> and <code>redirect_uri</code>. Since there is no client authentication used, it is possible for anyone to take that information and pretend to be that client by doing an OAuth flow that looks identical to the real app.</p>

 Should I be worried about client impersonation? 

<p>Maybe and maybe not! Whether client impersonation can be used for any ill purpose depends on how you treat OAuth clients in your system. Many companies aren’t concerned with this problem at all. There are plenty of situations where being able to impersonate a client doesn’t actually benefit an attacker at all.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the things an attacker might be interested in doing if client impersonation is possible.</p>

<p>The authorization server is where all the decisions around issuing tokens are made, things like how long tokens should last and what claims should be added to a token. Sometimes these decisions involve policies that depend on the identity of the client application that will be receiving the access token. If an attacker impersonates a valid client, the authorization server would be using the policies of the valid client for the requests coming from the attacker’s client.</p>

 Bypassing the consent screen 

<p>One example is the decision of whether or not to show a consent screen to inform the user of which application they are logging in to. For third-party apps, the consent screen is a critical part of the flow, communicating which app is requesting access to the user’s account and what information will be shared with the app. For first-party apps, where the app is the same brand as the data being accessed, it doesn’t necessarily make sense to ask the user for this permission. It would be awkward, for example, if the Twitter app asked you for permission to access your Twitter data. For this reason, many companies want to bypass the consent screen for first-party apps. With this policy in place, and with public clients, impersonating a first-party app means bypassing the consent screen and immediately issuing tokens to the impersonating application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This accomplishes basically nothing if you do this to your own account on your own device, but is potentially more interesting if you can accomplish this on someone else’s device.</p>

<p>A typical sequence when logging in to an application is to click the “log in” button, enter your credentials, be prompted with a consent screen, and be redirected back to the application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The authorization server may choose to skip the credential prompt if the user is already logged in. The authorization server may also choose to skip the consent screen if the user has already consented to this application before or for first-party apps. In that case, the redirect would be immediate, which is good for user experience, but bad if client impersonation is possible. Again, this isn’t a concern for confidential clients since client impersonation isn’t a concern if the client can authenticate. But for public clients, since the OAuth flow is done with only public information, client impersonation is definitely possible. That said, the original OAuth 2.0 specification actually calls this out explicitly in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.2">Security Considerations Section 10.2</a>. The recommended mitigation from the original spec is to require redirect URL registration and to avoid skipping the consent screen. This gives the end user a chance to spot any attempts at tricking them into authorizing a malicious application.</p>

 Gaining privileged API access 

<p>Some services may restrict certain APIs for use only by specific clients. If the service has some APIs that should only be called from a particular mobile app, the service may want to reject requests made from other apps that are accessing other parts of the system. Additionally, some services may set different API rate limits for different clients depending on the trust level of the developer or whether the client is a first-party or third-party client.</p>

<p>In order to do this, the API needs to know which client an access token was issued to. Typically, the authorization server will embed the application’s client_id in one of the claims of the access token. In this way, the client_id is accessible to the API when it validates the token. Of course, this information is only as good as the authorization server’s confidence that it was really that app making the token request. Again, if the client can authenticate itself, then this is reasonably reliable. But for public clients, there is much less certainty.</p>

<p>Keep privileged access in mind when you’re building APIs that limit features based on the application.</p>

 Frequently asked questions 

<p>With these concerns in mind, let’s answer a few quick questions about OAuth client impersonation.</p>

 Is client impersonation a new problem? 

<p>Not at all! In fact, client impersonation <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-10.2">was mentioned in the original OAuth 2.0 spec</a> RFC 6749 in 2012! The next year, the “Threat Model and Security Considerations” document was finished and became RFC 6819. This document has <a>a large section</a> dedicated to the topic of client impersonation. That section is worth a read for more information on various ways to mitigate this risk.</p>

 Is client impersonation a problem unique to OAuth? 

<p>Client impersonation is relevant to OAuth for the reasons previously mentioned, but those issues may also be relevant to systems that don’t use OAuth at all.</p>

<p>This is a pervasive problem with mobile app games. Let’s take a simple example of building a leaderboard service for a mobile game application. For the sake of the example, let’s assume the app doesn’t have any concept of user accounts, and wants to show a high score leaderboard in the game from all users of the app worldwide. In order for the game server to collect the high score data, it provides an API endpoint that the game can report scores to. The API would like to only accept POST requests from real instances of the game app, and not people who are trying to cheat and send fake scores to the API.</p>

<p>Without the support of the mobile operating system, there’s nothing in the API call that can authenticate the mobile app, since any HTTP request the app makes would be possible for anyone to mimic outside of the application.</p>

 Does PKCE solve client impersonation? 

<p>Nope! This is a common point of confusion, likely because of how PKCE was originally developed and rolled out. PKCE was originally described as a way for a mobile app to do the authorization code flow safely. But keep in mind this was back in 2015 when mobile apps were still advised to use the Implicit flow or the authorization code flow without credentials.</p>

<p>Despite PKCE being originally described as a technique for mobile apps, it is not an alternative to client authentication and doesn’t ever attempt to pretend it is. PKCE prevents a few specific attacks, mainly authorization code interception and authorization code injection. And interestingly, authorization code injection is also possible even if the app does use a client secret or other client authentication. That’s the reason PKCE is now recommended for all types of OAuth clients, regardless of whether they are a mobile app, a SPA, or a server-side app with credentials.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, PKCE is not a form of client authentication, so it doesn’t solve the client impersonation problem. PKCE is still a good idea to use since it prevents other notable attacks.</p>

 Are there any solutions for client impersonation? 

<p>As of today, there aren’t any reliable mechanisms for authenticating pure SPA clients in a browser. Anything the browser can do can be mimicked outside the browser. Google Chrome even has a developer tool that lets you copy any request the browser makes as a cURL command to be replayed on the command line.</p>

<p>For mobile apps, there is more hope. Apple has an API known as “App Attestation”, and Google has a similar API called “Google Play Integrity”. Both APIs work similarly, with a few technical differences. At a high level, both of them involve the application making a request to the operating system to sign some data. Then the app includes that signed string in the call it makes to the developer’s API. The API can validate the signature against the public key from Apple and Google to determine its confidence level that the API request is made from a real version of the mobile app.</p>

<p>The intent of these mobile operating system APIs is to give the developer a way for a web service to validate that a request is being made on a non-jailbroken device with a legitimate app store instance of an application. Interestingly, in both cases, Apple and Google have specific language in the documentation that suggests these should be used as hints, but not guarantees, of app integrity.</p>

 Does the BFF pattern solve client impersonation? 

<p>The BFF pattern, short for “backend for frontend”, is the idea of running a backend service to supplement a single-page application. There are multiple variations of how this can be deployed, some of which are documented in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps#section-6">OAuth for Browser-Based Apps</a> draft specification.</p>

<p>The key difference this makes with regard to OAuth client impersonation is that your backend can be the OAuth client and can use client authentication. If the backend holds the tokens without sending them to the SPA at all, then the tokens can never leak to an impersonating application. While this might sound good at first, your backend has no assurances that any requests made to it are from the legitimate SPA, so the problem is only half solved. This does makes the problem less severe, since someone trying to take advantage of client impersonation wouldn’t be able to actually get the access token itself, but would only be able to trick the backend into making API requests with that access token.</p>

 Future solutions for client impersonation 

<p>I mentioned this had been a recurring theme in the recent discussions within the OAuth community at the last several events. I presented a session about client impersonation specifically in mobile apps at the <a href="https://oauth.secworkshop.events/osw2022">OAuth Security Workshop</a>. The session wasn’t recorded, but <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/aaronpk/app-integrity-attestations-for-oauth-oauth-security-workshop-2022">I posted the slides here</a>. In that session, I suggested the idea of leveraging Apple and Google’s app attestation APIs as a form of client authentication. In a side discussion after the talk, we heard from a group who had actually implemented that for a client recently, which was a nice  validation of the concept. Separately, George Fletcher <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5063/2">presented a session at EIC 2022</a> the following week about nearly the same topic! I’m glad to see this recognized as a need for mobile apps.</p>

<p>As far as browsers go, I think we’re farther off in finding a similar solution, since browsers don’t have the same level of tie-in with the operating system that mobile apps do. With the advent of modern browser APIs like WebCrypto and WebAuthn, it’s possible we may see something similar in the future.</p>

<p>Is client impersonation something you should be concerned about? It really depends on your situation, in particular whether you have any policies in place that treat particular public clients differently from others.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Today, Microsoft announced a new name for their identity product family which encompasses familiar capabilities alongside new capability launches. Microsoft Entra covers identity, including Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Permissions Management, and Verified ID.</p>
<p>Azure AD is a familiar offering and will remain available stand-alone. But it is now accompanied by a Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) offering and a decentralized identity offering.</p>
<p>At first glance, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management has a smattering of interesting functionality like visibility on permissions across cloud environments including AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. It works to counteract permissions sprawl, enforce the least privilege, monitor and detect anomalies. For more information on CIEM, read this edition of the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-ciem">KC Navigator</a>.</p>
<p>Verified ID is Microsoft’s implementation of Verifiable Credentials, a standard for issuing and verifying decentralized identity credentials. This allows identity credentials to be issued by identity providers (IdPs) outside of an organization’s ecosystem, and still be accepted with confidence and verifiability – hence the name. Verified ID serves some interesting use cases such as remote onboarding, secure access, and streamlined account recovery. It will be generally available in August 2022. For more in-depth reading on verified identity, read this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Market Compass</a> and be on the lookout for the update in Summer 2022.</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra also includes an administrative portal, available as of today. Existing portals are still accessible, and the transition to this new portal may be done at will.</p>
<p>Takeaways</p>
<p>The change of branding on existing capabilities is indicative of the importance Microsoft is giving to new capability launches, like those of Verified ID and Permissions Management; they carry the theme of “securing access to everything for everyone”. Verified ID allows enterprises to handle identities from external identity providers (IdPs) while still maintaining trust in the individual, embracing the “everyone” while Permissions Management spans the “everything” of multi-cloud.</p>
<p>This launch is cognizant of the changing security and collaborative environment, where identity plays a major role in facilitating secure and smooth interactions.</p>

 Considering all the issues that the proposed EU-wide law on virtual assets will present, it would have been better to regulate virtual assets under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework, essentially considering them as financial instruments. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- The Luna-UST debacle has led to increasing calls for regulating the nascent digital assets industry globally.</blockquote><blockquote>- Today, the European Union’s “Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations” draft is among the most comprehensive regulatory frameworks. It aims to put an end to the free-run enjoyed by digital assets industry in the political and economic union of 27 countries.</blockquote><blockquote>- Despite what experts may say, the EU’s “Markets in Crypto-assets Regulations” is far from perfect. For instance, if the proposed law comes into effect, it will ensure that the only digital assets available in the European Union are the ones that have received authorization from relevant authorities.</blockquote><p>Amid the current crypto market turmoil in the face of the unraveling global economic crisis and the LUNA-UST debacle, the need for strong regulatory measures is being felt globally.</p><p>At the same time, keeping in mind the growing demand for virtual assets, the European Union will soon be releasing a concrete framework around digital assets. Now, some in the crypto regulatory circles view it as much needed exercise to prevent unscrupulous elements from exploiting the nascent industry. Yet, the reality is altogether different.</p><p>In fact, the proposed law is far from being a remedy to bring virtual assets under the regulatory net. For instance, under the proposed rule, the only virtual assets that can be offered to investors in the European Union are the ones that have received permission from relevant authorities in the European Union member&nbsp;states.</p><p>Thus, Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, and some of the top-most virtual assets may have to apply for authorization if the proposed bill receives a green light in the EU. Another thing to consider here is that many crypto founders have chosen to remain anonymous, such as Satoshi Nakamoto of Bitcoin. So, who will apply for EU authorization in such cases? Will Satoshi Nakamoto apply for the approval? Well, there are bleak chances of it. Mutual recognition of virtual assets across jurisdictions, too, is out of the question, as governments’ view on digital assets varies drastically worldwide.</p><p>Then there is the issue regarding supervisory authority, which is too tangled to differentiate the role of regulatory bodies within the member states and the EU-wide authorities. Such is the extent of complexity of the proposed law that launching a virtual asset exchange is far easier than launching a traditional exchange governed under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework.</p><p>Less said, the better when it comes to the rules around market manipulation and insider trading of digital assets. The truth is that the rules are not comparable to the current EU rules. Among all these issues, the most affected party will be none other than the consumer, as they will be the ones receiving the shorthand of the&nbsp;stick.</p><p>Considering all the issues that the proposed EU-wide law on virtual assets will present, it would have been better to regulate virtual assets under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) framework, essentially considering them as financial instruments.</p><p>All in all, crypto businesses must comply with the stringent requirements that traditional financial institutions and companies already comply with. Anything less is unacceptable for the greater good of the nascent virtual assets ecosystem.</p><p>There is no doubt doing so will draw complaints from crypto asset companies saying that such measures would throttle the industry’s growth. But why should regulators cut them any&nbsp;slack!</p><p>That said, virtual asset service providers have nothing to worry about. Shyft knew the day would come when VASPs would have to comply with regulations. Thus, we have developed solutions to smoothen the transition from “No Compliance” to “Full Compliance” for VASPs. Shyft’s Veriscope, for example, makes it easy to comply with FATF’s Travel Rule. It is also the only official solution against the much-dreaded “Sunrise Issue” that VASPs face while complying with the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>So, visit our website to know more about <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope </a>and learn how it can enable your company to stay compliant.

Rapid digitalization to re-capture post-pandemic growth coupled with an uncertain geopolitical climate requires security leaders to rethink their cybersecurity strategy. Despite the increased in cybersecurity spend, businesses continue to fall prey to cyberattacks. To stay ahead of cybercriminals, “knowing the enemy and knowing yourself” is key to building effective defenses. Organizations must have full visibility to their external threat landscape and be aware of potential attacks targeting them. This predictive capability allows organizations to focus on the biggest risks and avert the most damaging fallout.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the first installment of We Are Mastercard, a series of blog posts highlighting the fintech innovators behind our platform. Mastercard’s open banking solutions are powered by thousands of connections to financial institutions, layers upon layers of security and groundbreaking artificial intelligence-driven analytics.</p>
<p>However, what truly sets our technology apart is the people who create it, like Rachel Burnett. She’s a software engineer at Finicity, a Mastercard company, and a 2020 graduate of the University of Utah.</p>
 What’s your position at Finicity? And what are your responsibilities? 
<p>I’m a software engineer on the Connect services team. We support Finicity Connect, an application that allows users to connect to their bank and pull their financial data.</p>
<p>My team manages a service that maintains and serves financial institution data. Everything from the physical location of the institution to the routing number, branding files and a lot more. We store that information and then serve that up to Connect.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges is how to make the users’ flow in Connect as efficient and successful as possible. Another challenge is market expansion, looking at how we’re moving our products and services into different countries.</p>
 How does Finicity give you the resources to solve those problems? 
 <p>Teddy frequently reviews Rachel’s code while she’s working from home.</p> 
<p>As an early career software engineer, I have a passion for technology and am always looking to learn and grow as much as possible by reading about new technologies or practicing coding languages I might not use regularly.</p>
<p>Every other Friday afternoon, we have “innovation time,” where we have the freedom to research or play around with side projects to grow and practice our skills as software engineers. It’s awesome that we can have that freedom and flexibility to work on those skills and learn more. I feel like I’ve grown a lot since I’ve been here.</p>
 What’s the culture like on your team? 
<p>I have really great teammates who have a lot more experience than me. They’re incredibly knowledgeable. And they’ve been incredibly patient and generous in sharing their expertise and helping me with problems along the way. They are such a valuable resource. Just being able to Slack them questions or ask them to pair-program with me has been incredibly helpful.</p>
<p>On our team, you’re not expected to have everything perfect the first time. Teammates offer to do code reviews, help you test across environments, and genuinely want you to succeed because that’s what will make the team succeed.</p>
 How does your team exemplify Mastercard values? 
<p>Ownership is really important and something that our team really values—making sure that our code is thoroughly tested and that we hold each other accountable with code reviews as a team, together. We make sure that we ask the right questions to verify that there aren’t any gaps and that we’ve thought about the different use cases and scenarios.</p>
<p>Even if something seems trivial, we take accountability so that we can see it all the way through to how it might affect the end user.</p>
 What does working at Finicity enable you to do in your spare time? 
 <p>One of Rachel’s hobbies is hiking with Hazel on mountain trails just minutes away from Finicity’s headquarters in Murray, Utah.</p> 
<p>My dog loves hiking, so that’s always fun. Just spending time with friends and family, camping, that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>We have a good work-life balance for sure. If we ever need to take time off to recharge or go see family outside of Utah or anything like that, we’re definitely supported and encouraged to do so.</p>
 Why should someone consider joining the Mastercard open banking team? 
<p>I think it’s really exciting to be working in an industry that is so important. I mean, it’s awesome to see the impact of the work you do because banking has a place in all of our lives. That’s exciting.</p>
<p>Also, Mastercard has awesome values and we have great benefits. We have 5 paid volunteer days per year, “work from anywhere” days and <a href="http://mastercard.us/en-us/vision/who-we-are/careers/life-at-mastercard.html">the Mastercard Cares program</a>. It’s a great company that really cares about the employee and the individual. You know, they want to see us succeed and be happy. And then, on top of that, I think it’s fun and engaging work.</p>
 Interested in joining our team?

 Why Implement Biometric MFA? 
<p>We are all aware of the risks associated with password-based authentication. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of password-based breaches that we see in the news every day. Some companies have attempted to mitigate password risks by adding two-factor authentication (2FA), pesky one-time codes sent via email or text.</p>
<p>The truth is, if you authenticate users who access your systems by way of username-password combinations, even if enhanced by so-called 2FA or MFA methods, then you could improve security a lot, reduce user friction, and cut operating expenses by implementing a biometrics-based solution.</p>
<p>While some solutions claim to solve these problems, many are only exchanging the password for FaceID/TouchID. These legacy apps fail to do the one thing that they are supposed to do – prove who the user is.</p>
<p>Imagine if you could prove each user’s identity every time they logged into a resource. That makes all of the other pillars much easier.</p>
<p>1Kosmos offers identity based Zero Trust- with real biometrics and cryptographic proof of possession and audit.</p>
 Identity Is One of the 6 Pillars of Zero Trust 
<p>Take this diagram:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other solutions base the “binding” on a username and password exchange which can be done by anyone. This is a problem because when an issue like a lost phone occurs, other solutions fall back to a username, password, 2FA as the bootstrapping process to re-enroll. What do you think the bad guys are going to do with this recovery process? That’s right, exploit it.</p>
 How Does 1Kosmos Prove Identity? 
<p>When a user downloads the BlockID app and enrolls, they will take a live selfie – This is part of our LiveID. Then, we ask the user for that selfie and compare it to their photo in government issued documents like a passport or a driver’s license. 1Kosmos matches the selfie with the documents, and gives the user a digital certificate that verifies their identity and it binds the account to the proven identity. When users authenticate through LiveID we compare the live selfie with the one taken at enrollment to prove identity and grant access.</p>
<p>To summarize, proving identity and reaching Zero Trust requires one platform that<br>
1)&nbsp; Establishes user-controlled identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with that previously established identity</p>
<p>There are two standards for identity and authentication: NIST 800-63-3 for ID enrollment and strong ID usage, and FIDO2 for passwordless. No platform besides BlockID has combined both of these into one experience. When done right, this single experience can replace many legacy processes and provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/trust-registry/trust-status-list/#full-services">NIST 800-63-3</a> and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/company/1kosmos/">FIDO</a>, BlockID’s live biometrics are <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1Kosmos-Biometric-Subsystem-Certification-Report-V2.0-1.pdf">iBeta</a> certified which validates the reliability of BlockID for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are other key values of the BlockID platform:<br>
– Can be <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/">integrated</a> with every system that matters – Remote Access (VPN, Citrix, ZScaler, Appgate, etc.), Desktops (Mac/Windows), SSO systems (Okta/Azure AD/Ping), PAM (Cyberark/Thycotic)<br>
– Can be implemented in parallel, without impacting the existing mechanisms<br>
– Supports multiple company accounts in the same app: Domain Admin, Regular users, AD, Unix Account, etc.<br>
– Supports password reset in the app<br>

 Following the merger with ARIADNEXT, the joint group reports a successful first quarter 



<p></p>



<p>Munich, May 31th, 2022,&nbsp;IDnow group, a leading European provider of&nbsp;&nbsp;identity proofing and document signing, reports&nbsp;a rising demand for the joint portfolio in the first quarter of 2022. The company has confirmed an increase in order intake by 95%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By offering the broadest portfolio in Europe via a single platform, the IDnow group is at the forefront of current market trends: the acceleration of advanced digital business models has led to a shift in demand, from single-product identity verification towards more comprehensive identity proofing and document signing platforms such as IDnow’s.</p>



<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO at IDnow, comments: “By combining IDnow, ARIADNEXT and IdentityTM, the IDnow group has emerged as one of the strongest players in Europe as we offer business customers a range of solutions for various use cases and jurisdictions, all from a single source. This is reflected in both our financial performance as well as in our order book. Following a string of M&amp;A transactions over the last 18 months, I am excited to see the company off to a flying start into its first year as a consolidated group and am looking forward to continued joint success.”</p>



<p>The group’s automated identity verification solution has also had a strong first quarter, with an increase in revenue of 134%. Automated identity verification has been a key trend in Europe for some time and it is receiving regulatory approval for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) use cases in an increasing number of European countries. The revenue growth for IDnow’s automated solution is expected to continue, as the group forecasts an 80% increase of order intake.</p>



<p>IDnow group has made a series of senior hires across Europe to support the company’s rapid growth. Mario Fassbender has joined as Vice President Marketing while Stefan Kauhaus has been recruited as Director Product Management Digital Identity. Mike Kiely has also joined IDnow’s UK team as Head of Financial Services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the second half of 2022, IDnow is looking to expand the platform for identity proofing with additional services. The group is anticipating further certifications to be granted in its role as a remote identification service provider. The group’s automated and expert-assisted solution&nbsp;in the French market are ready to receive a ‘prestataire de vérification d’identité à distance’ (PVID) certificate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, the group anticipates entry into the Romanian market with the Authority of Digitization of Romania (ADR) certification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow group’s automated solution, coupled with a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), already offers a global solution for remote onboarding for industries under AML regulation.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Pathlock’s acquisition tour is changing the market dynamics 
<p>A few days ago, Pathlock, one of the leading providers in the market for <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/ashford/navigator-access-controls-for-business-applications">Access Control &amp; Risk Management for Business Applications</a>, has announced a merger with Appsian and Security Weaver, and the acquisition of CSI Tools and SAST Solutions. With that, five of the vendors in this market segment, become one. In our recent <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80517/access-control-solutions-for-sap-and-other-business-applications">Leadership Compass on Access Control Solutions for SAP and other LoB (Line of Business) Applications</a>, we had covered overall 23 vendors. With five of these merging into one, it becomes apparent that this step of Pathlock will change the dynamics in this market segment.</p>
<p>The market segment contains solutions that help organizations in analyzing and managing the access controls and access risks in business applications such as ERP solutions. This includes managing entitlements and roles, defining and managing SoD (Segregation of Duties) controls, managing privileged access such as emergency access, and other capabilities.</p>
 Relevant players in the market 
<p>Pathlock, which also received a funding in the $200m range, is building on its already strong position in this market and becomes one of the largest players serving this market segment. Aside of Pathlock, there is SAP, which is starting to serve not only the SAP domain, but also other solutions with its Cloud IAG (Identity Access Governance) offering. SAP still has a dominant role in SAP-centric environments. Pathlock, on the other hand, offers both depth for SAP environments as well as breadth for multi-vendor environments, including business applications delivered as SaaS.</p>
<p>When it comes to breadth in coverage of applications, two other large players in this market are SailPoint and Saviynt, both having their roots in IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration). SailPoint has acquired ERP Maestro, another specialist vendor for Access Control &amp; Risk Management for Business Applications, back in 2021, while Saviynt has focused on own capabilities in this area from the start of the company. Several other IGA vendors such as One Identity, IBM, or EmpowerID, to name just a few, also come with a good level of support for access controls management in business applications.</p>
<p></p>
 Market evolves out of a niche into a larger market segment 
<p>It will be interesting to observe how fast Pathlock manages the organizational and technical integration of all the entities that now come together, with technologies ranging from ABAP-based solutions to SaaS platforms. However, taking the breadth and depth of the combined capabilities, Pathlock surely is a vendor that must be evaluated when looking for solutions to manage access controls and access risk in business applications, be it in the SAP domain or in a heterogeneous multi-vendor environment.</p>
<p>With this acquisition, the recent ERP Maestro acquisition by SailPoint, and the investments of SAP into their Cloud IAG offering, this market is clearly evolving out of a niche into a larger market segment.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>In the digital era, being able to manage and control access to services, data and other resources by employees, partners, customers, and devices (things) is extremely important, and a key element of that is identity. Having a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) capability, therefore, is essential for any modern business.</p>
<p>In fact, the management of identities and permissions in digital transformation is the key to security, privacy, compliance, governance, and audit, as well as system usability and user satisfaction. Traditional IAM systems meet only a fraction of current requirements, and therefore a new, modern approach is necessary.</p>
<p>At KuppingerCole, we believe that the best approach to enabling a comprehensive, IAM capability for the digital era is to build it on a modern, modular architecture that supports an integrated set of Identity Services that deliver the capabilities required for providing seamless, controlled, and secure access for everyone and everything from anywhere to every service.</p>
<p>Because this model of IAM involves the combination of multiple isolated but corresponding elements that are “woven” into an integrated, seamless whole, we use the shorthand term of “Identity Fabrics” when talking about this paradigm for architecting IAM within enterprises to deliver the full range of identity services required by an organization.</p>
<p>The Identity Fabrics concept is aimed at enabling access for all, from anywhere to any service, while integrating advanced features such as support for adaptive authentication, auditing capabilities, comprehensive federation of services, and dynamic authorization.</p>
<p>Most organizations using the Identity Fabric paradigm tend to build on a strong core platform for delivering major features and complementing this with other solutions. These core platforms typically deliver a broad range of IAM capabilities, including a good level in both Identity Governance and Administration, and Access Management by providing a comprehensive set of APIs for consuming these services.</p>
<p>Core platforms that support the Identity Fabric paradigm should deliver these capabilities in a modern architecture, using microservices architectures and container-based deployments. They should also support different deployment models and all types of identities, including employees, partners, customers, devices, and services.</p>
<p>In building an IAM capability that is fit for doing business in the digital era, enterprises need to deploy solutions that not only deliver functionality and support for all types of identities, but also meet the requirements of the Identity Fabric paradigm regarding the architecture, deployment model, and interoperability with traditional applications, cloud services, and new digital services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The market for Identity Fabrics is evolving quickly. The number of vendors has grown significantly, as well as the maturity of solutions. However, the market is still not at the level of maturity as IGA or Access Management, for example. Positively, we observe significant innovation happening in this market segment.</p>
<p>— Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst, KuppingerCole Analysts.</p>

<p>All of our shopping habits revolve around convenience. Consumer spending has shifted dramatically due to considerable changes in living, working, and learning settings. Everything is done via online shopping, from buying groceries to toilet paper to apparel and health care products.</p><p>The average person buys year-round but by spending less each time. People are getting less loyal to individual stores, with<a href="https://www.chainstoreage.com/heres-how-shopping-habits-are-changing#:~:text=But%2062%25%20of%20them%20said,week%20and%2017%25%20they%20are"> 65%</a> admitting that if their favorite brands are sold out or low in stock, they will buy the next best alternative.</p><p>As a result, retailers need to rethink their tactics to adapt to changing consumer behavior, expectations, and shopping&nbsp;habits.</p><p>If you adapt quickly to new market trends while staying relevant to your audience, your company will likely be one of the first to take advantage of the online shoppers’ demands and&nbsp;needs.</p><p>People are ready to spend-let us learn how to target shoppers to your sites instead of your competitors.</p> 1. Online sales are increasing <p>Online shopping has become more popular than ever before. People can purchase quality goods and get value for money (more discounts on online shopping platforms than in-store shopping channels) and from the convenience of their homes. And the attention spans of online shoppers are getting shorter. So, suppose you possess an ecommerce business and want consumers to buy from you, you must be able to instantly capture their attention-and make the purchasing experience enjoyable and straightforward.</p><p>Here’s how you can do&nbsp;it:</p>  Ensure your website is compatible with both desktop and mobile app versions and has adequate speed and fast&nbsp;loading.  Remember that a good photo is worth a thousand words (and maybe a thousand dollars).  When it comes to content, keep in mind that less is often&nbsp;more.  Include feedback from consumers.  Catalog and categorize your merchandise and make the user interface easily navigable.  Tell shoppers if an item is in stock or when it will be back-ordered on the product&nbsp;page.  Make it simple for customers to get in touch with you or subscribe to your email&nbsp;list.  Allow consumers to save their carts and make checking out straightforward.  As long as you can afford it, provide free shipping.   2. But physical retail is still important <p>While online shopping is becoming more popular, in-store shopping still appeals to customers. According to research, most customers <a href="https://www.chainstoreage.com/heres-how-shopping-habits-are-changing">(88%)</a> still do their grocery shopping in&nbsp;stores.</p><p>As a result, merchants that have physical storefronts shall continue to invest in there for the following reasons:</p>  Consumers who pick up their orders in a store often purchase additional things.  A product that a customer has seen in person is more likely to be purchased. This can also lessen the likelihood of a product being returned due to size, color, or other&nbsp;issues.  Personalized customer experience promotes&nbsp;sales.  A physical store gives you a chance to create a memorable brand experience.  By observing people buy and engage with the space and items, retailers may gain free market research about their preferences and habits (you can<a href="https://www.verfacto.com/blog/behavioral-data/real-time-customer-profiler/"> analyze customer behavior in online shops</a>&nbsp;too).  Online retailers receive more traffic from physical&nbsp;stores.   3. Users want more flexibility and&nbsp;control <p>According to research, online consumers also demand complete freedom and control over when and how their packages are delivered. It also revealed that consumers have strong opinions on delivery costs and timelines. They also demand more efficient services and the option to follow their online orders and packages throughout the delivery&nbsp;process.</p><p>To keep up and compete in a world where the competition is fierce, and the stakes are high, online retailers must genuinely comprehend the ever-changing face of the buyer and must constantly develop their strategy.</p> 4. Mobile-first is here to&nbsp;stay <p>The way we shop on the internet is evolving. Smartphone sales have risen considerably, indicating that customers are adjusting to the connectedness that their cell phones&nbsp;provide.</p><p>Furthermore, search engines favor mobile websites, with Google’s mobile-first index demonstrating their popularity. Google considers the speed of sites to be one of the most crucial factors for ranking. Image dimensions, file sizes, and site code scripts can significantly slow down websites; therefore, a mobile audit is worthwhile.</p><p>If it isn’t already, your website should be mobile-friendly to make it as simple as possible for clients to purchase things with a smartphone tap.</p> 5. Voice search is important <p>Smart speakers and voice searches on smartphones have quickly become a must-have accessory. According to reports, <a href="https://ng.oberlo.com/blog/voice-search-statistics#:~:text=Summary%3A%20Voice%20Search%20Statistics,-Here%27s%20a%20summary&amp;text=40.2%20percent%20of%20the%20United,consumers%20owned%20a%20smart%20speaker.">135.6 million</a> individuals in the United States now utilize voice search&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Voice searches are inclusive and allow those with visual impairment to better access your platforms and make purchases, thus increasing your sales and popularity among online shoppers.</p><p>Optimizing your Google My Business listing for location and hours of operation responds to frequently asked questions like “where is the nearest spa?” and helps people find&nbsp;you.</p> 6. Customer loyalty is&nbsp;evolving <p>According to <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/">statistics</a>, 263 million Americans (or 80% of the population) enjoy shopping online. 55% of internet users prefer to shop online, and 80% shop at least once a month. This goes on to illustrate how vital convenience and comfort are to consumers. If loyalty marketing isn’t already part of your strategy, here are some pointers to help you get&nbsp;started:</p>  Learn everything you can about your consumers in their environment: It has become more vital than ever to have the data and resources you need to listen, engage, and provide a valuable experience to your customers.  Consistency and authenticity inspire client trust: Authenticity breeds confidence. People are drawn to brands that have a unique story to tell. Every interaction with your customer should be consistent in tone and significance.  Don’t be scared to become emotional: It’s crucial to remember that emotions significantly impact purchasing decisions. If marketers can master the art of telling emotional tales, they can transform ordinary customers into loyal customers.  Make everything seem effortless: It’s all in the details. It’s not just about pleasing your consumers; it’s also about making it easier for them to solve a&nbsp;problem.   7. AI, AR, and VR will impact how people&nbsp;shop <p>Mintel, a market research firm, predicted that virtual and augmented reality technologies would permeate our homes, affecting how we shop, the brands we prefer,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Consider the impact that technology can have on purchasing habits if you consider the possibility of obtaining your things via drone rather than the good old parcel delivery driver. AI-powered chatbots promote a better consumer experience and help provide intelligent suggestions to end-users based on their browsing experience and past purchases.</p> 8. Users want instant customer&nbsp;support <p>Consumers don’t require go-betweens to help them with simple functions in the self-service internet age. People have come to anticipate self-service, and if you allow them to get to the point where they need to contact you, you’ve stifled usage and adoption. Here are some suggestions for how to improve your customer service strategy:</p>  Ascertain that your squad has the necessary equipment: When it comes to providing exceptional customer service, dedicated CRM software is typically the best&nbsp;option.  Provide self-service support: Most consumers want to be able to fix most problems on their&nbsp;own.  Ensure you have a knowledge base with solutions to frequently asked questions and how-to articles that walk clients through the procedures necessary to address common&nbsp;issues.  Optimize your content for search engines to simplify end-users to locate solutions to their questions.  Patience, alertness, the ability to communicate properly, a willingness to learn, and empathy are all essential qualities to look for when hiring customer support personnel.  Responding to inquiries in time is important.  Make it simple for consumers to reach you by placing your contact information in strategic locations throughout your&nbsp;website.   9. Customers are using social media to&nbsp;purchase <p>There are now tons of alternatives for purchasing items online via social media. Small businesses especially use social media for marketing their products. Affiliate and influencer marketing help drive sales among their followers.</p><p>When consumers were questioned, “Have you ever bought something directly from a social media platform?” Approximately 55 percent of consumers affirmed that they had bought products on at least one of these platforms:</p>  Facebook Shops: Facebook Shops allows admins of business pages to create a “Shop” with a list of products or product collections. Social media helps create brand loyalty and even established brands and new brands see huge revenue being generated from their social media&nbsp;pages.  Instagram: To take advantage of Instagram shops, simply connect your online shopping site and Instagram Business pages. You may also use the Instagram Shoppable Posts functionality to link your Instagram feed posts and photographs to the product’s Instagram Checkout page. You can use Instagram tools like Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram Reels to promote your brand’s offerings.  WhatsApp: As WhatsApp keeps expanding its business features, it’s worth keeping an eye on if you’re looking to build a chat-based community while also generating social&nbsp;revenue.  Pinterest: Pinterest is used by many audiences to develop inspiration boards with products or items they might want to buy. Pinterest data also suggests that visitors enjoy searching for and learning about things on the&nbsp;site.   Conclusion <p>Online buying habits are constantly changing and evolving. Retailers are striving to keep up and anticipate buyers’ behavior. Consumers are spoilt for choice, switching from one merchant to the next at the touch of a&nbsp;button.</p><p>To keep up and prosper in a world where the competition is fierce, and the stakes are high, everyone has to be constantly on their toes to survive, from big box retailers like Walmart and Target to new-age startups.</p><p>Companies can break through the noise and foster loyalty, engagement, and trust by providing extraordinary client experiences.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/shopping-habits/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Una nuova importante certificazione per il mondo dei servizi fiduciari si va ad aggiungere alle altre conseguite negli anni da InfoCert, a conferma del ruolo di European Champion of Digital Trust.</p>



<p>InfoCert, infatti, ha recentemente ottenuto da AgID il riconoscimento di Provider dei servizi di: “Convalida Qualificato di Firma Elettronica Qualificata e Sigillo Elettronico Qualificato” (Qualified validation service for qualified electronic signature, Qualified validation service for qualified electronic seal).</p>



<p>Si tratta di una certificazione di recente introduzione, nata per rispondere ad una necessità del mercato di garantire a grandi organizzazioni (principalmente governi centrali, pubblica amministrazione e aziende operanti nell’ecosistema bancario) di poter verificare con assoluta certezza la validità e l’integrità di una firma apposta su un contratto o un documento, sia che essa sia stata apposta da una persona fisica (QESig) che da un ente (QESeal).</p>



 InfoCert sempre più European Champion of Digital Trust 



<p>Grazie a questo nuovo riconoscimento, aziende e pubbliche amministrazioni in Europa potranno facilmente integrare questa nuova soluzione completamente basata su API, ed affidarsi ancora una volta al più grande QTSP in Europa.</p>



<p>Il servizio di validazione delle firme è da sempre parte del portfolio dei servizi InfoCert, e finora era disponibile all’interno di GoSign Desktop, l’applicazione di firma più utilizzata in Italia: chiunque poteva caricare in GoSign un documento firmato e verificarne la validità, sia in Italia che in uno dei paesi europei dove il certificato veniva emesso.</p>



<p>Oggi tale servizio, certificato da Agid, diventa <a href="https://developers.infocert.digital/signature-validation/">disponibile anche via API</a> e i clienti InfoCert avranno l’opportunità di integrare lo step di convalida delle firme e sigilli in modo automatico all’interno dei propri processi di business.&nbsp; Tale verifica è effettuata in tempo reale e consente di validare i file firmati in qualunque formato, come ad esempio PDF, P7M, XML e JSON.</p>

 The Perils of Pre-Copernican Data&nbsp;Strategy <p>It’s an oft-told story but it has a new relevance. Back in the middle ages, people believed that the earth was the centre of the universe so that everything else, including the sun, circled round it. When they tried to track the movement of the planets through the sky they were presented with a puzzle. The planets’ motions didn’t represent a simple orbit. At certain times, they seemed to go into reverse, creating a complex jungle of ‘epicycles’ that astronomers struggled to explain. Their mappings of the movement of the planets, as seen from the earth, are shown on the left hand side of Figure 1. An extremely complex picture that is very hard to&nbsp;fathom.</p><p>Then came Nicolaus Copernicus. He said the sun was the centre of our universe, and that the earth orbited the sun. A simple switch of perspective — from earth-centric to sun-centric — created the enormously simplified picture of the planet’s movements shown in the right hand side of the&nbsp;figure.</p>Figure 1. Pre- and Post-Copernican views of the planets’ movements<p>Today, something similar is happening with data sharing. Back in the days before Copernicus, ‘everyone’ including the great, the good, the clever and the powerful, ‘just knew’ that the earth was the centre of the universe and that everything else, including the sun, revolved around it. Today, ‘everyone’ including powerful actors and decision-makers like the UK Government ‘just know’ that organisations are the centre of the personal data universe, and that everyone else including citizens revolves around these organisations.</p><p>That’s why the UK Government is <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">pressing ahead with organisation-centric plans</a> for the future of data sharing. Plans that, if implemented, will create a picture far more complicated than that shown on the left hand side of the illustration; a complexity catastrophe on multiple fronts: costs, data security, interoperability, governance and&nbsp;trust.</p> The complexity catastrophe <p>Let’s take a look at how this data sharing complexity catastrophe will&nbsp;unfold.</p><p>There are basically two ways to share personal data. The first is an ‘organisation-centric’ one: direct from organisation to organisation, with the data never being handled by the citizen the data relates&nbsp;to.</p><p>The second is a person centric one, where organisations deposit copies of details they hold about people in their personal data store, so that the citizen can forward share this data as and when&nbsp;needed.</p>Figure 2: Different models of data&nbsp;sharing<p>What is the difference between the two? If you look at Figure 2, which shows how the two models work, you may not think there is much difference. On the left hand side, if there are three organisations involved in data sharing, three connections between them are required: one each to the other two.&nbsp;Simple!</p><p>The person-centric approach to data sharing shown on the right hand of the diagram also requires three connections. But why bother adding a completely new entity — the citizen’s personal data store — into the equation? Doesn’t that just add cost and complexity?</p>Figure 3: What happens as data sharing&nbsp;scales<p>Now take a look at Figure 3, which shows what happens if eight organisations are now sharing an individual’s data. On the organisation-centric left hand side, the number of connections has grown to 28, whereas if the data is shared via the individual’s personal data store, the number of connections has grown to just eight. Instead of each organisation having to connect with every other organisation involved in data sharing (who they have never done business with before), the person-centric approach only requires one connection per organisation — with the citizen’s personal data store. This connection is with somebody they already have a relationship with: the&nbsp;citizen.</p><p>Figure 3 three shows that as the organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing scales, its complexity grows exponentially. And data sharing between eight organisations is just beginning.</p><p>How many Government services currently collect and use personal data? Well, you can get to a list of eight very quickly. How about DVLA (driving licence data), the Passport Authority, the Money and Pensions Service, the Disclosure and Barring Service, the Department of Work and Pensions, HMRC (tax data), the Ministry of Justice (for services such as Lasting Powers of Attorney), the Home Office (residency and citizen status). That’s eight. Without drawing a breath. And without even thinking about all the different parts of the National Health Service, care services, local authorities, and education authorities that also collect and use citizens’ data. And completely ignoring the third and private&nbsp;sectors.</p>Figure 4: The complexity catastrophe sets&nbsp;in<p>If we take the number of organisations involved in sharing data about individuals to fifty, the number of connections now needed by the organisation-centric approach rises to 1225. (See Figure 4) Whereas, if the data is shared via the individual’s personal data store, it rises to 50 — still tracking the number of organisations involved.</p><p>Which sort of system do we want to create? The organisation-centric approach to data sharing which creates a picture of pre-Copernican complexity or the person-centric approach which creates a picture of post-Copernican simplicity?</p><p>Perhaps pre-Copernican complexity would be justifiable if it brought tremendous benefits while the person-centric approach brought tremendous risks and harms. But the opposite is&nbsp;true.</p> Where the catastrophes lie <p>The pre-Copernican organisation-centric approach to data sharing doesn’t create just one complexity catastrophe. It creates many, involving costs, security, interoperability, governance and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Costs Let’s assume for the sake of argument that the costs of an organisation sharing data with another organisation and with an individual’s personal data store are the same. (As we show below, this is a bad assumption to make, because the costs of sharing data between organisations is actually much higher.) But keeping to that assumption for a moment, if 50 organisations are sharing data under the pre-Copernican approach, with the exponential rise in connections involved total costs across the system are around 25 times higher than with the person-centric approach. That’s because each organisation has to manage dealings with 49 other organisations instead of having to deal with just one other organisation — the personal data store provider.</p><p>Security The databases of organisations like the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Service (taxes) were designed to operate like moated and walled data castles, working on the principle of perimeter-based protection. They were designed to keep outsiders out. Rightly so. They were designed to protect the data of the people inside: citizens.</p><p>But with data sharing, organisations have to open their systems up — and the greater the number of connections they create, the greater the security risks. Once they are sharing data with 50 or more other organisations, their carefully built castle walls begin to look like a piece of Swiss gouda cheese: full of holes. But when sharing data with a personal data store, they only have to create one carefully managed and scrutinised API connection with the PDS platform.</p><p>Interoperability Because of the way our data systems have evolved, every organisation has its own, different software systems, formats, languages, standards and so on. For one organisation to become adept at sharing data with 49 other organisations it needs to become an expert not only at its own data systems but with 49 other organisations’ systems&nbsp;too.</p><p>It’s not going to happen. And if it does, it’s going to be extremely costly and time-consuming. That’s because this interoperability problem doesn’t have to be solved just once. Each of the 50 organisations involved in data sharing has to solve it again, for themselves, separately and independently — reinventing the same wheel 50 times over, once again multiplying total system costs many times&nbsp;over.</p><p>Whereas, when sharing data with a personal data store, the organisation hardly has to think about software systems, formats, languages and standards at all. That’s because it simply shares the data using the systems it already has. It is then up to the personal data store provider to manage these interoperability challenges. The big benefit here is that the PDS provider only has to solve these problems once for the solution to work with all 50 organisations.</p><p>Governance Who decides what data should be shared with who, for what purposes? Under the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">Government’s current proposals</a> this is left down to ‘senior leaders’ (e.g. civil servants) within Government departments. Will these ‘senior leaders’ ask citizens if they want their data to be shared? If not, what right do they have to make the decision?</p><p>With PDS-based data sharing, most requests for data to be shared come directly from individuals seeking to access or use a service. The governance, consents and permissions challenges of data sharing are addressed almost automatically as a by-product of the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Trust For all of these reasons, the pre-Copernican approach to the sharing of personal data is highly likely to generate its own knock-on trust catastrophe. But that’s just the beginning. Under the current system, when individuals share data with an organisation, they have at least some idea of what data they are sharing with who, for what purposes (unless something underhanded, devious and illegal is going&nbsp;on).</p><p>With the pre-Copernican organisation-to-organisation approach to data sharing, it becomes practically impossible for citizens to keep track of who has access to their data, for what purposes. The ideal of citizens being able to exercise control over their data becomes practically impossible and goes out of the window. Whereas, with a personal data store, citizens are provided with their own consents and permissions dashboard which enables them to see everyone they have shared what data with for what purposes, and can exercise control (changing these consents and permissions) easily, from within this dashboard.</p> Less than half the&nbsp;picture <p>The above analysis of pre- and post-Copernican data sharing only addresses operational issues. They are less than half the picture. The organisation-centric approach focuses only on what organisations need to do with personal data they hold. It ignores the challenges facing citizens when applying for, accessing and using services — challenges which personal data stores address by making citizens’ data available to citizens themselves.</p><p>It also ignores the immense potential benefits of making citizens the point of integration of data about themselves. What would happen if 50 or more different organisations each deposited data they hold about the citizen in that citizen’s personal data store? A totally new-to-the-world personal data asset would be created: one which starts to generate a complete picture of that individual. These new personal data assets could become the engines of most if not all data-driven innovation of the future — a driver of economic&nbsp;growth.</p><p>But if Government persists in its organisation-centric approach to data sharing, this opportunity will never be created because their data will remain dispersed across multiple service providers.</p> Conclusion <p>In machine learning, deep assumptions such as ‘the sun orbits the earth’ or ‘organisations are the only entities that collect and use personal data’ are commonly called ‘priors’. A prior is an initial set of beliefs that people bring with them to the experiences and challenges that they face. They are the lenses through which we see the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Pre-Copernican astronomers studied the workings of the heavens as closely as those that came after them. But because it never entered their heads that the earth might orbit the sun, every conclusion they drew was wrong. Today’s data strategies and policies are being made by a Government with the wrong, pre-Copernican prior belief that organisations are the centre of the personal data universe. As a result its policies are way off the&nbsp;mark.</p><p>Organisations are not the centre of the personal data universe. Citizens are. If Government put citizens at the centre of its data policies, the simplicity and power of the post-Copernican perspective would shine through everything it&nbsp;did.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">The Perils of Pre-Copernican data strategy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 One leap forward&nbsp;… <p>The UK Government has just published a landmark policy on data sharing. It represents a breakthrough in thinking, policy and strategy. Not just a step forward, but a genuine leap&nbsp;forward.</p><p>At the same time however, Its new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data-sharing-governance-framework/data-sharing-governance-framework">Data Sharing Governance Framework</a> is badly bungled. So badly bungled that, if implemented as it stands, it would actually result in three leaps back. Fortunately, this damaging outcome can be&nbsp;avoided.</p> The positive&nbsp;bit <p>The genuine leap forward is that the Government has, at last, recognised that a personal data ecosystem based solely on different, separate organisations each collecting and using data for their own purposes, in isolation to one another, guarantees that the full potential of this data will never be unleashed. It has recognised that we need to move from an outdated ‘One User, One Use’ approach to personal data to a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/how-to-unleash-the-full-potential-of-data-3676db8d7c03">‘Many Users, Many Uses’ approach</a>.</p><p>Some passages in the Framework couldn’t be better written. Here’s an&nbsp;example:</p><blockquote>“Data is essential to delivering good public services, developing and evaluating policy, and a wide range of government operations. The data needed to do this well is often held in different parts of government and needs to be shared so that it can be used&nbsp;… clear and common governance standards are needed to deliver data to the right place at the right&nbsp;time.”</blockquote><p>Clear, simple and absolutely spot on (as far as it&nbsp;goes).</p><p>The Framework also introduces a series of practical measures that are essential if data sharing is to be improved. These include organisations committing to developing data sharing strategies (instead of ignoring the issue as most have done until now), making it easy to start data sharing (by providing a first point of contact for example), building data inventories so that others can see what sorts of data you are holding, and developing common standards so that data sharing is made&nbsp;easier.</p><p>In our own work for the Scottish Government, on its <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/How_data_portablility_can_transform_public_services/How_data_portability_can_transform_public_services_Smart_Entitlements_Overview.pdf">strategy for Smart Entitlements</a>, we recommended the same sets of measures. So far, so&nbsp;good.</p> Three leaps&nbsp;back <p>The three leaps backwards are as follows. First, the Government’s vision of data sharing is purely inter-organisational. Personal data held by one organisation will be shared with another organisation without any citizen involvement. At first glance, direct organisation-to-organisation data sharing might seem sensible. But it’s not. It’s a recipe for a cost, complexity, security and trust catastrophe.</p><p>That’s because, in any system of organisation-to-organisation data sharing, as more organisations take part, the number of connections that are needed between them rises exponentially. If just three organisations are involved, data sharing between them requires just three connections. That’s manageable. If 8 organisations are involved, the number of connections jumps to 28. If 50 organisations are involved, the number of connections that are needed jumps to 1,225. Completely unmanageable. <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-perils-of-pre-copernican-data-strategy-974827845585">This blog</a> outlines the logic and the risks of inter-organisational data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>If the UK Government continues with this approach, it will quickly discover that as it attempts to make it scale it runs into a nightmarish thicket of complexity. We’ll be publishing a White Paper on this and the design requirements of a positive way forward in the next few&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Second, the Framework does not mention citizen consent. It does say that Government departments should comply with data protection regulations. But what it doesn’t say is that with its ‘bold’ plans to reform these regulations, it intends to all but <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">abolish citizen’s rights</a> to be asked for consent before their data is shared. If the Government’s plans for data protection reform go through, it’s not even clear that citizens would even be informed that their data is now being shared willy-nilly across Government departments. This is a recipe for a catastrophic loss of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Third, the Framework is silent about the actual purposes for which citizens’ data should be shared. The Government says civil servants working for Government departments should “make sure that you are sharing data responsibly” but (as with its proposals in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-a-new-direction-but-which-direction-da547b886ac0">Data: A New Direction</a>) it never defines what ‘responsibly’ might mean. In doing so, it places 100% of the burden of deciding what is ‘responsible’ on ‘senior leaders’ in Government departments. Civil servants. That’s not fair and is a recipe for ducking, diving and confusion.</p> A better way&nbsp;forward <p>There is a simple way for the UK Government to preserve its genuine leap forward without also making three leaps back — and that is to organise data sharing via the citizen whose data it&nbsp;is.</p><p>If Government shared the data it holds about citizens with these citizens by placing their data in citizens’ own independent personal data&nbsp;stores:</p>  the cost, complexity and security catastrophe created by inter-organisational data sharing would be&nbsp;avoided  citizens would remain in control of who they share their data with (thus enhancing rather than destroying trust)  citizens could decide what purposes they want to put their data to (thus taking the burden of making these decisions off civil servants in Government departments).  <p>This is the approach already embedded in the Scottish Government’s planned Scottish Attribute Provider Service — which represents a genuine leap forward without any of the drawbacks. As it stands, the UK is in danger of turning what could have been a genuine breakthrough into a damaging&nbsp;debacle.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/one-leap-forward-46b8b9942fe5">One leap forward&nbsp;…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code>: [<code>mn-security-config</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  ...
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:

          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:

            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Micronaut REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Start your app:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw mn:run 
 
 
 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email in it.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Micronaut App 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Micronaut app into a native binary:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=native-image 
 
 
 
 
<p>Start your Micronaut app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/app 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it with HTTPie and an access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps start up 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

 New technical capabilities allow influencers and communities to turn social tokens from one-dimensional curiosities into widely usable currencies carrying reliable real world value, that are far better positioned to capture additional value for their issuers and others through building substantial and automated economies centered around the&nbsp;token.   social tokens offer the promise of branded digital currency that allows creators to capture the value created by their community  in the first generation of social tokens, technical features are one-dimensional, allowing for sending back and forth and to be included in liquidity pools like Uniswap — they can be related, with hard work, to off-chain economic activity but have no on-chain economics — actual value is aspirational, not provable, reliable or predictable  social tokens hold promise but have yet to really take off like they should — leading platforms require programming or a permissioned facilitator, have limited capabilities — there’s no long tail&nbsp;activity  additional capabilities and low-cost permissionless, easy launches will unleash potential — built-in direct liquidity, stable and predictable values, attached namespaces to create a full spectrum digital goods economy centered on the token; real value creation that is direct and measurable through directly connected on-chain economic activity like nfts, fan profiles, memorabilia, tickets, discount codes, coupons, log-in unlock, etc; measurable economic activity with clear results attracts speculators who can measure and predict engagement that inevitably leads to real&nbsp;value  the Verus project, in non-stop development for five years, has built-in blockchain primitives that make these capabilities a reality now, offering more functionality, to more people — smart contract platforms cannot match these capabilities today absent an enormous engineering effort in bringing together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts  additional capabilities include privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, easy group&nbsp;dynamics  provable decentralized bridges to ethereum give the best of both worlds — intelligent next generation social tokens that can also emerge automatically, without programming, as&nbsp;ERC-20s  experiments to prove these concepts require no programming, are risk-free and extremely low cost — core protocols exist now, tooling and apps still require build-out in a collective effort   Social Tokens — the&nbsp;Promise <p>Googling the term “social tokens” brings a host of articles discussing socal tokens as the next big thing. The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of&nbsp;value.</p> The First Generation <p>Early market leaders soon arrived, such as <a href="https://tryroll.com/">tryroll.com</a> and <a href="http://rally.io/">rally.io</a>. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there’s not much to these tokens other&nbsp;than</p>  enforced digital scarcity — they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some&nbsp;skill  automated market making — they help set up Uniswap-like liquidity provision, but to gain actual liquidity creators must, in the words of the Roll website: “encourage their communities to contribute liquidity”  handing creators a roadmap and examples to “build value” — this generally involves activities, services or products that creators will offer to their fans so that they can get their communities to buy the token and then trade the token for these goods — the idea is to generate real-world demand for the&nbsp;tokens  <p>On the roll website, this last concept is pitched as: “After minting, you determine all the ways your token will be distributed and used across platforms, closing the loop that gives your social token its own independent value and starts your social token economy.”. But, as described in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/09/the-social-token-network-rally-friends-with-benefits-and-the-future-of-branding/">this article</a>, “I discovered that it’s just a sh**tload of work to keep a token&nbsp;going”.</p><p>The end result is that value in social tokens remains fleeting or aspirational. Liquidity through liquidity provision in automated market makers can be a big problem. For a liquidity provider, risks are high, probably untenable since impermanent loss risk in an AMM with a fragile token approaches 100%. It turns out that liquidity provision in this context is a wholly altruistic activity, or worse, done by people who are unaware of the enormous risks. WIth minimal liquidity provision comes little market depth and unstable&nbsp;value.</p><p>Also, value for the token is tightly locked to a creator’s ongoing real world efforts to provide experiences, or events, or products, in order to drive continuous demand for the currency. There are no automated economic activities. If the creator’s activity stalls, or dries up, the token will lose value rapidly. Predictably, the vast bulk of these currencies peter out, and are forgotten, living on as zombie ERC-20s on ethereum.</p> No Long&nbsp;Tail <p>Anyone that’s really interested in creating a social token is met with an odd reality in the “decentralized” blockchain world. Both Roll and Rally, the social token leaders, require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. The Rally website says they’re looking for: “1) Evidence of a significant community size,&nbsp;… 2) Evidence of current transaction activity within your community&nbsp;… 3) Evidence that you have strongly considered the role that a social token economy would play in your ongoing projects.” Creators then wait for a review before being approved. Roll’s business model is to take a portion of the creator’s token for themselves. Rally’s is a little more sophisticated, attempting to have value created in their own token and sidechain in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>This makes sense for Roll and Rally because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity. Creators who want to “do it themselves” are met with an arduous and limiting process — essentially, they need to be decent developers to get their tokens going. And to do all that for a one-dimensional token that can only be sent back and forth or placed in an AMM seems to be an unattractive proposition.</p><p>The result is that social tokens have yet to fulfill their promise. There’s no easy way for just anyone to do permissionless experiments at little cost, and little risk. And, when they do experiment, there is only the hope that by tying real world activities to their token, they might generate some value there, at least while they continue to offer those activities. This purported value is difficult to measure, and tough to capture, and exhausting to maintain. So there’s no real innovation and no “long tail” that allows unexpected modes of organization and value creation to&nbsp;emerge.</p> New Capabilities <p>What would it look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?</p><p>Easy launch — low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don’t yet understand.</p><p>Built-in Direct Liquidity — five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered <a href="https://blog.bancor.network/smart-tokens-101-63edc2cc5a89">smart tokens</a>, which they called “money that holds money”. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being “seeded” by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk — and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is “money that holds money” leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.</p><p>Attached Namespaces — tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new capabilities. For example, if someone called “Influencer” creates a social token called “Influencer”, they will have also defined a namespace called “Influencer”, opening up unique digital goods opportunities.</p><p>Digital Goods — a namespace on a blockchain protocol renders unique power; a simple model for digital goods on a namespace would&nbsp;include:</p>  object definition — a protocol could allow unique friendly name identifiers within the namespace, meaning fans could register identities/names that are associated with the namespace, eg. “fan.influencer@”, or an influencer could assign meaningful names to digital goods attached to their namespace, eg. “ticket0001.influencer@” or “coolnft.influencer@” or “schedule.influencer@”  object control and transferability — a protocol could allow defined objects to be controlled by private keys and to be transferable from one set of private keys to another, either by command, or in an atomic swap transaction, eg. fans could transfer their objects to and from each other at will, or on automated marketplaces without intermediaries  objects as destinations/addresses/endpoints — as addresses on a blockchain protocol, these objects could receive, send and hold funds, or control other objects; eg. money could be sent to or from “fan.influencer@”; also, objects could be endpoints, and so could receive messages or be unique points in a communications network  object metadata — objects could contain space for metadata, and leverage data structures and off-chain storage (either centralized or decentralized, like arweave) to allow for arbitrary and updateable data to be associated with the object. Coupled with #3 above this allows objects to exist as NFT art, or <a href="https://verus.io/verusid-lookup/mike@">verifiable online&nbsp;profiles</a>  object signatures — being cryptographically unique, objects could provide verifiable signatures to arbitrary data, thus allowing for applications like sign-on/access, or&nbsp;voting  <p>Immediately we see that meaningful digital goods economies could spring up around successful influencers. Examples of such digital goods would&nbsp;be:</p>  Fan IDs — the simple act of creating a fan ID/address for just a few dollars could be seen as a show of support, or status symbol in an influencer community; or fans could create and trade meaningful IDs  Nfts — influencers, or even their fans, could create digital collectibles/art/memorabilia to be auctioned, sold or given away to&nbsp;fans  Fan Profiles — updateable, verifiable fan profiles are&nbsp;possible  Ticket — an object could represent a ticket to an&nbsp;event  Coupons/gift cards — an object could represent a right to buy&nbsp;merch  Discount Codes — an object might give a right to get ongoing discounts on merch or&nbsp;events  Memberships — an object can provide exclusive membership to influencer clubs or&nbsp;forums  Log-in/access — an object can give rights to enter websites or other digital&nbsp;arenas  Voting — objects could be used to signal support for an initiative, idea or&nbsp;proposal  <p>This is far from an exhaustive list, and the “long tail” will surely draw out ideas which we’re not even capable of conceiving right now. Many of these goods would be automatic or community created and so could thrive even without continuous activity from the issuer. This is important for the longevity of the social token economy. It’s not difficult to see how strong community-created activity could thrive and&nbsp;persist.</p><p>An Economic Model for the Digital Goods — to capture value for the issuing influencer (and others), there is no necessity ever to sell tokens directly to the public (which might bring securities laws into the issue anyway). The social tokens would always be just a commodity/good/coupon that can be acquired to show support, or to be used (exclusively) to acquire digital goods like those described above. An issuer would always, likely, issue “free” tokens to themself as part of the creation process (a “premine”), or retain the right to issue new tokens at will (perhaps only after the passing of a period of time). They would also need to “seed” the token with a little bit of real world money to provide initial value to the token. Note that this seed money would never actually be at risk of loss, and could always be recovered; in fact, recovery (and more) would be quite easy in the case of thriving token economies. Once this is done, then fans could acquire the tokens (directly, without an AMM) by converting their currency, like USDC, into the social token. Every time a fan does this, they increase the supply of the token a little bit, and they also drive up its value. When they spend the token on digital goods (like ID creation, buying a NFT, getting a membership, etc.) the amount that they spend gets burned from the supply of the token, which reduces its supply and further drives up its value. During this process, too, the robustness of the reserves of “real” currency are improved, providing more depth and stability to the token’s value. It will become easier and easier for the issuer to start selling down their “premine”, or to issue themself new tokens, and thus capturing the created value, without crashing the value of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With this model, further value enhancement might come from speculators who see that an influencer is growing in power. Speculators like these would be analogous to collectors who have an eye for talent, and that can spot trends. All they need to do to profit is to get in early on the right tokens by the right influencers with the right potential economic activity that would *inevitably* drive value increases. In this way, market dynamics might allow influencers to capture future value&nbsp;today.</p> This Exists Today — the Verus&nbsp;Project <p>This is not just theory, but is about to be put into practice. Five years in development, and with a working network (minus these token capabilities) for the last three years, the <a href="http://verus.io/">Verus Project</a> has built the protocols. Verus aims to be a public good. There are no VCs funding the project and so no returns on investment that need to be drawn from users to pay back investors. It is a community developed FOSS blockchain protocol. The only fees involved in creating and using social tokens on Verus will be paid, as in bitcoin, to miners who power the&nbsp;network.</p><p>These capabilities as described do not exist on smart contract platforms today. Perhaps they could be engineered on a case by case basis by a team of competent smart contract developers. But, this would require complex interconnecting smart contracts to deal with all of the disparate elements. It would be an enormous engineering effort, fraught with risk and complexity. On Verus, using primitives as building blocks, these tokens can be issued in just a few minutes, with bespoke variables, by non-programmers, and at little&nbsp;cost.</p> Additional Capabilities <p>Apart from the core functionality of social tokens described above, there are also some interesting capabilities that enhance the concept. First, as a fork of zcash, Verus offers private transactions on its native currency. And, as a UTXO blockchain, wallets control multiple addresses which cannot necessarily be traced to the same wallet. This gives the ability for intelligent apps to protect user’s privacy as they interact with social&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Also, on-chain escrow mechanisms allow for issuers to timelock their holdings for arbitrary periods. This helps reduce potential moral hazard where fans and speculators might be concerned about issuers dumping their holdings and “rugging” their community. Roll has always been concerned about this possibility, and that led them to provide centralized escrow services for their issuers. Unfortunately, a <a href="https://tryroll.com/security-incident/">security incident</a> at Roll led to these “escrowed” amounts being stolen and liquidated.</p><p>Social tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.</p><p>Finally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Status <p>These protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop tools and applications and businesses leveraging the protocols.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/the-coming-of-age-of-social-tokens-518aed68c8f2">The Coming of Age of Social Tokens</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At the Gartner IAM European Summit in London a couple of weeks ago, Simon Wood, Ubisecure CEO, had the opportunity to share the stage with Lauri Immonen, Telia Company’s Head of Identity. Together they would provide insights to the audience on how the Ubisecure-Telia partnership has enabled strong reusable identity throughout Europe. The live session can be replayed for attendees in the Gartner Conference app, but for the benefit of our wider audience, I have summarised the session below.</p>
<p>As a background, Ubisecure and Telia have a unique relationship. Ubisecure is a European identity services provider, and Telia is a leading Nordic telco. Together the companies developed a solution (the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="Telia Identification Broker Service">Telia Identification Broker Service</a>) that connects Service Providers to the European strong reusable identity ecosystem. The ecosystem, while rich in high assurance Identity Providers, won’t reach its full potential until its issues around complexity are solved.</p>
<p>This blog talks through the why, the how, and what this solution delivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The three identity waves 
<p></p>
<p>To understand strong reusable identity, we first need to look at its evolution, or as <a href="https://www.fintechtalents.com/third-wave-in-digital-identity/">Rod Boothby coined</a>, the “waves of identity”.</p>
<p>Wave 1 refers to workforce identities. Companies give their employees identities and passwords to access work networks. The identities reside in enterprise directories and HR systems. Sometimes these identities can be federated and used on external services, but ultimately they remain controlled by the company.</p>
<p>Wave 2 refers to the identities businesses give to their Customers. Customers now have hundreds of identities. A particularly popular type of wave 2 identity is the social identity like Facebook, Google etc. These identities are low assurance, or perhaps better said as ‘self-assurance’, but highly prevalent. The user’s identity became the product.</p>
<p>Wave 3 refers to strong trusted identities. These identities are highly assured – issued by a bank, government or mobile provider. They deliver high value because they can be trusted. They are designed to replace many of the wave 2 identities by offering Customers a single, secure and privacy enhanced method of registering and authenticating to a service. But currently the strong identity ecosystem, particularly in Europe, contains many disparate identity providers – some regional, some national. They need connecting together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What defines a strong reusable identity? 
<p></p>
<p>Firstly, it cannot be self-certified, it must originate from a certified, trusted identity service. In our society we see three organisation types issuing the majority of such identities – banks, governments and mobile providers. All perform KYC (Know Your Customer) as they onboard their Customers or Citizens to digital services.</p>
<p>The identity must allow the Service Provider to authenticate and identify the user. This doesn’t mean attributes should be shared, in fact quite the opposite. A good identity service will share assertions and claims rather than actual personal data, and the identity owner will maintain total control over what specific data is ever shared. Think about the case of buying alcohol. The store clerk needs to know that the buyer meets the legal age to buy alcohol, not their actual birthday. This is the key difference between sharing personal data vs making a trusted claim. This in turn helps the Service Provider to build trust with the Customer over time, requesting identity assurance only when it is needed.</p>
<p>Finally, it should also follow a Zero Trust model of “never trust, always verify”. Once the “always verify” concept can be automated without causing friction on the user, Zero Trust can dramatically step up the anti-fraud benefits for both the Customer and the Service Provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why would a Customer or Service Provider want to use strong reusable identity? 
<p></p>
<p>We all have dozens, if not hundreds of accounts. There is considerable fatigue in being asked to create yet another account. Being asked to share private details yet again in the hope they will be adequately protected and not illicitly shared. And creating yet another password, or maybe reusing existing passwords (not a good idea, ever). Then, assuming we finish yet another registration process, we still have to remember or dig out the credentials every time we want to log into the service again. It’s time consuming and frustrating.</p>
<p>Customers want a simple registration process that is standardised, familiar and easy to use. One that allows single sign-on across connected applications. They don’t want to remember yet more passwords, and they want to control what data is shared, and why. Strong reusable identities deliver all this to Customers.</p>
<p>Service Providers have similar requirements. They want assurances that both new and returning Customers are who they say they are. Sometimes, for more valuable transactions, they might even want further assurances the Customer is really the Customer (step up authentication).</p>
<p>It’s notoriously hard getting people to sign up to new services. It’s incredibly frustrating, and wasteful, when a potential Customer abandons the registration process halfway through – which happens far more often if the process is lengthy or provides friction beyond reasonable security requirements.</p>
<p>If there’s a way to just get the Customer onto the system quickly and easily, churn can be reduced, and marketing investments maximised. Strong reusable identities deliver all this, and more, to Service Providers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 European Strong Identity 
<p></p>
<p>Now we know that strong reusable identities have a lot to offer both Customers and Service Providers, let’s review what is available in Europe.</p>
<p>The European identity ecosystem is very rich. It contains dozens of initiatives managed by both public and private entities. Plus, there are some public-private partnerships. All, however, are anchored on nationally issued identities, making them extremely high assurance and perfect for cross-border transactions and trust.</p>
<p>As disparate as it may be, the pool of identities is plentiful – covering millions of individuals throughout Europe. As attractive as the pool may be, with such a plethora of initiatives, and no (at least yet) harmonisation between the identity providers, if you are a Service Provider looking to support multiple providers, there are serious challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The challenges within the current European Identity ecosystem 
<p></p>
<p>The Customer perspective is easy to understand. They simply want their strong IDs to accepted in as many places as possible. They don’t care if the Service Provider is in Finland, or in Sweden etc. They just want to authenticate themselves to gain access to the service, with a consistent and familiar user experience.</p>
<p>Service Providers look at the current ecosystem and see opportunity, but also complexity. They see complexity in integrating many different Identity Providers (IdPs) to their service(s). And, they see complexity in having to manage many contractual relationships with the IdPs, especially banks in different regions. Finland is a good example here. To offer all bank-issued reusable IDs, a Service Provider would need to maintain contractual relationships and technical integrations with 14 different banking entities! The ecosystem is rich, but it is overwhelming, and few organisations have the resource to get it right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The strategic drivers for Telia Company 
<p></p>
<p>Service Providers want to tap into all the benefits of the strong identity ecosystem, but they don’t want the technical and commercial complexity of doing so. They want just one contract, and one single integration. They want a service that solves the problems, and opens up the ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is where the Ubisecure &amp; Telia partnership offers value. Telia is responding to its enterprise Customer (Service Provider) needs, while complementing other Telia identity services such as e-signing (AATL).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Telia Solution – One contract, one integration 
<p></p>
<p>One contract, one integration. This critical approach has opened the European identity ecosystem up to many more Service Providers than would otherwise have been able to use it. 200 Service Providers are now connected to 20 different identity providers, all through a single integration delivered as either an OIDC (OpenID Connect) or SAML API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How the Telia ID Broker works 
<p></p>
<p>The Ubisecure Identity Platform powers the 24/7, highly available ID broker system. In 2021 alone, over 58m strong authentications were brokered. The usage of the system is growing, with 40% YoY growth for Swedish and Finnish eGovernment services alone. All from a single integration, and a single contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future – eIDAS 2.0 
<p></p>
<p>So far we have examined the strong identity ecosystem from the Nordic and Baltic perspective. We should note that the system has been largely successful due to political pressure in these regions. Where such political appetite does not exist, we see fewer programmes that are less successful (such as in the UK). To help solve these regional differences, the European Commission is close to finalising a pan-European eIDAS 2.0 framework to:</p>
 
 Ensure that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services available online in other EU countries; 
 Create a European internal market for trust services, by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as their traditional paper-based equivalents. 
 
<p>With the eIDAS 2.0 specification due to be released imminently (May 2022), we are just around the corner from a true European ‘network of networks’. eIDAS 2.0 will enable so much more than just strong reusable identity for authentication. It is planned to also include identity wallets that can manage both identities and documents, such as driving licenses, medical data and more. This puts the identity holder in complete control over what is shared and how, while retaining a trusted cross border ecosystem.</p>
<p>By 2024, eIDAS will also support Organisation Identity – an underserved aspect of identity. As the #1 issuer of strong organisation identities through our Legal Entity Identifier business unit, Ubisecure naturally supports and contributes to enabling use cases where organisation and individual identity can be linked and expressed as a trusted relationship. More on this aspect in the future!</p>
<p>Identity brokering platforms will be essential in the success of such initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future – GAIN 
<p></p>
<p>The hope of eIDAS 2.0 is to open up the European strong identity ecosystem. The hope for GAIN (Global Assured Identity Network) sets its sights on the entire globe. If successful, GAIN will be a true global network of networks, mapping the trust between all the regional initiatives. It’s a lofty goal, but one that has a good chance of success thanks to the involvement of several key individuals and organisations, such as the IIF, OIX and GLEIF (Global LEI Foundation).</p>

 Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack&nbsp;: A Beginners Guide <p>If you’re a beginner in the Web3 space, the initial inertia of understanding things might be overwhelming for&nbsp;you.</p><p>I wrote this blog around three months ago when I started to get a gist of what Web3 is and how everything works coming from a Web2 world. I was bewildered about studying what, how, and whatnot when I started up. Some people say this blockchain is better, and others say another. Some include many products into their architecture, making it so complicated that it looks like a different world altogether. Just Google around looking for the Web3 tech stack — everyone gives you an explanation of what it is in their perspective, and a typical marketing blog is what I always find, I’d&nbsp;say.</p><p>So when I started writing this blog, my focus was just one thing — let’s transition our knowledge from Web2 to Web3 and know which technologies support what. Once that is figured out, it will become far easier to choose and start our developer journey into it. This blog will generally be over the top, although that’s what you need as a beginner, right?</p><p>But first, we need to understand what we mean by Web3 — the idea people might change the internet as we see&nbsp;it.</p> What is&nbsp;Web3? <p>One of my friends recently mentioned that Web3 is just another fancy name for the blockchain ecosystem. He’s partially correct, at the same time, wrong on a whole different level.</p><p>Although the foundation of Web3 is centered around blockchain, when you start developing over it, you’ll realize that blockchain is just a part of it. To draw a comparison, a blockchain in a Web3 app might be similar to how a database might be for a typical web app (Web2) you might develop. As a comparison, we&nbsp;take:</p><p>Web1 = the internet of information; i.e., The HTML CSS websites you cannot interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>Web2 = the internet of interactions; i.e., Modern platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc., that allow you to be connected end to end with&nbsp;others.</p><p>Web3 = the new internet of value, i.e., the internet where centralization of information is eliminated.</p><p>So if we try to define Web3, we can say that it is the concept that aids the development of decentralized applications(dApps). Yes — the same decentralized internet we heard from <a href="https://silicon-valley.fandom.com/wiki/Richard_Hendricks">Richard in Silicon&nbsp;Valley</a>!</p><p>However, we do not have a compression engine platform like what he had built to build this. Instead, we have a range of protocols and platforms that enable this development system. These protocols are a set of rules that govern how your application works, while multiple platforms facilitate the creation of your application.</p><p>Okay, fine, but why do we need dApps in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>The most significant benefit of creating a dApp is Ownership and Identity. Ownership of data, content, literally everything with your self-identity — a concept that got blurred with the coming of age of these top institutions like Google and Facebook.</p><p>Another significant benefits people talk about is Composability, one of the central pillars of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Every single software company out there right now is focused on collecting user data, which is their single biggest asset and differentiates them from one another. Not the product but the data they hold. Companies competing with each other, with similar UI/UX and slightly different business logic, are valuable independently because of the “data” they have aggregated.</p><p>This is what Web3 will disrupt, making every application composable by sharing &amp; consuming their data between different applications. Think about a metaverse where you can buy things from Meta and use them in the Microsoft ecosystem. This is the most exciting and interesting aspect of Web3. It is making the web genuinely composable!</p><p>But that’s not all; with the high amount of trust and reliability these applications bring in, the possibilities are endless; we haven’t even imagined what the future might look like with dApps being omnipresent. I feel Web3 might start the same revolution that open-source brought into the developer ecosystem.</p> Understanding the Web3 Architecture <p>Now that we have defined Web3, we need to understand how these protocols and platforms work together to help us build these&nbsp;dApps.</p><p>When we imagine a general web app, we envision an architecture constituting the&nbsp;follows:</p>Basic Web2 Architecture<p>Although I’ve not depicted things like caches, queues, etc., a general over-the-top architecture looks like&nbsp;this.</p><p>For a Web3 app, The frontend will remain the same, but some exciting changes start to happen on the backend side of things. Let’s see how that&nbsp;works:</p>Basic Web3 Architecture<p>If we compare Web2 and Web3, the Blockchain Node is doing the heavy lifting and managing our data, which is decentralized into a network of blockchains. Since it is expensive to store directly on the chain, we have some off-chain File Storage and a P2P Database facilitating data storage. Finally, to build a secure layer, we have a Wallet or a Private Key-based Authentication to verify the individual’s identity.</p><p>Please note that this is just an over-the-top depiction of the architecture. In reality, we have much more complex applications and need architectural parameters from both Web2 and&nbsp;Web3.</p> The Web3 Tech&nbsp;Stack <p>So far, we have learned what a Web3 architecture generally looks like. Now, let’s deep dive into each of these components to better understand the tech&nbsp;stack.</p><p>So let’s start from the&nbsp;bottom:</p> Blockchain <p>If I talk about selecting a blockchain to build upon, it is one of the most challenging tasks one needs to decide on. There are many factors at play here; decentralization, transaction throughput, gas fees, ecosystem/interoperability, and many more, and we won’t be debating them all as it’ll never end. It is like choosing your programming language. Every single one works; a few are better in specific cases and others for other use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Although, as a beginner, I might recommend starting with <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</a> with <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/">Solidity</a>. This is because of the massively present developer community around&nbsp;it.</p><p>EVM acts as the virtual machine, the bedrock of Ethereum’s entire operating structure. Ethereum brought in the concept of smart contracts and is the most used blockchain out there. Solidity is the language used to make smart contracts. It is very similar to JavaScript in syntax, which might be helpful if you’re a Web2 developer. Under the hood, Solidity is compiled into low-level instructions called <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodeshttps://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes">opcodes</a> for the EVM to interpret.</p><p>When you’ve learned this, it will be easier to understand the concepts of other technologies in the ecosystem, like:</p>  <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>: Another blockchain like Ethereum focuses on providing faster transaction times and cheaper fees. The smart contracts can be written in Rust, C, and&nbsp;C++.  Layer 2’s (L2): L2 refers to a secondary protocol built over an existing blockchain system, generally Ethereum, borrowing the main chain’s consensus security. There are many options here, but the top ones remain <a href="https://polygon.technology/">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://arbitrum.io/">Arbitrium</a>, <a href="https://starkware.co/starkex/">StarkEx</a> &amp; <a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNet</a>, <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a>, etc.  Application Chains: Although you won’t require this as a newbie, I feel this is the most exciting option out there. You can build your own blockchain/consensus system with platforms like <a href="https://tendermint.com/">Tendermint</a>/<a href="https://cosmos.network/">Cosmos</a>, <a href="http://polkadot.network">Polkadot</a>, etc.   Blockchain Node <p>For deploying an application in production, you need a server. A blockchain node does this job for blockchains. Blockchain nodes are network stakeholders or devices running the “blockchain software”. Hence, they are authorized to keep track of the distributed ledger, serving as communication hubs for the network tasks. A P2P (Peer to Peer) protocol allows nodes to communicate within the network and transfer information about transactions and new&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>You can self-run blockchain nodes or get a Node service provider like <a href="https://www.quicknode.com/">Quicknode</a>, <a href="https://moralis.io/">Moralis</a>, <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a>, etc., that offer APIs to create automated flows. For self-hosting, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blockchain/">AWS Cloud</a> and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/blockchain/">Azure</a> have images for you to spin up for the more popular chains. Otherwise, most chains make it easy for you to run your nodes/validators. The only thing that can be a hassle is to ensure uptime and maintenance, which depends on your&nbsp;network.</p> P2P Database <p>The first question that anybody would ask here is: Why do we need a database when we’re using blockchain in the first place? Additionally, will it not hinder our idea of a&nbsp;dApp?</p><p>As a simple answer to that, storing data on a blockchain is slow and expensive. We need an additional database to access data off-chain, ensuring that we’re not accessing the chain again and again. To have that decentralization part of it, we use peer-to-peer or P2P databases that store and host all of the data in streams to eliminate centralized database servers, blockchains, or local storage. Think about how your torrents get downloaded!</p><p>The <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic network</a> is the most common decentralized database provider out there, as I know of personally.</p> Decentralized File&nbsp;Storage <p>Like every other application, we need a dedicated file storage system (similar to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> for Web2 applications). Databases essentially are tabular data, while file storage is that folder-based data you need to store your large media files. <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is the most common P2P file system protocol with excellent community support. <a href="https://www.arweave.org/">Arweave</a> is another option focused on keeping data permanently. You can use platforms like <a href="https://docs.filecoin.io/about-filecoin/what-is-filecoin/">Filecoin</a>, <a href="https://siasky.net/">Skynet</a>, <a href="https://storj.io/">Storj</a>, and <a href="https://0chain.net/">0Chain</a> to host these file storage&nbsp;systems.</p> Authentication in&nbsp;Web3 <p>In my honest opinion, authentication is one of the most essential aspects of Web3. Without logging in users into the smart contract, one cannot access their wallets and make the most straightforward transactions. You should note that signing a transaction enables every interaction with a blockchain.</p><p>Looking at traditional login methods in the Web2 world, we have a simple form structure where the user details are stored in a database and cross-checked for verification. Additionally, services like Google &amp; Facebook offer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, enabling access to some basic information to the app directly, making the process seamless. Although this approach is convenient, this cannot be now used in a dApp since you need a private key to sign a transaction.</p><p>In Web3, we do not have the user’s data, but actually, we have wallets (which are essentially a wrapper around a private key), wherein cryptographic signatures are used to prove ownership of those blockchain addresses. It is essential to know how to access and interact with a user’s address and private key as a Web3 developer.</p><p>The fascinating aspect of owning a blockchain wallet is that once a user loses their <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography">private key</a> to the wallet address, no one can recover it for them. This is useful and scary at the same time. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump">stories of crypto millionaires</a> who have lost it all by storing their private keys in a lost hard&nbsp;drive.</p><p>Many projects have tried different ways to go around this and help users recover that key, the most common of them being Seed Phrases. The most famous wallet out there, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>, uses the concept of 12 word Mnemonic Phrases, which goes through a <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/mnemonic-generation-bip39-simply-explained-e9ac18db9477">BIP39 Algorithm</a> to generate the array of unique wallet addresses and private keys for you stored in your MetaMask account. But then again, remembering 12 randomly generated words in proper order for each wallet account group a user owns is difficult.</p><p>While trying to figure out a solution to a lousy UX like this, I encountered <a href="https://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a>, and interestingly enough, I ended up joining them within the next two months. Web3Auth is one of the most popular solutions for new users, bridging the Web2 and Web3 worlds. A simple auth infrastructure that gives those OAuth capabilities to Web3 applications in a self-custodial way for the user. By self custodial, we mean that the user has custody of the key and not the application or Web3Auth. This is done through a unique MPC architecture, and hence the private key is never stored in a single server/ node or method with complete access. Read more about the infrastructure <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/overview/key-management">here</a>.</p><p>I think it can be a massive thing for a project onboarding process. I would recommend checking it&nbsp;out.</p> Implementing the&nbsp;Frontend <p>Many developers might not know, but the frontend technologies for Web3 and Web2 are the same. The only difference is where you need to reimagine the UX of the application because the authentication, processing in the blockchain, and general flow of the application are slightly different from Web2 applications.</p><p>I would recommend going on with <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> &amp; <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> since most developers are currently using this in the Web3 world. I might be biased, but almost every other project presently features a React integration. If you’re using Webpack 5, make sure that there are certain polyfills you need to take care of while developing an application; the rest of everything is generally the&nbsp;same.</p><p>For the client-side backend, things get a bit different. Here is where you need to understand how to interact with the blockchain you’ve created. Web3 Interaction libraries help you with that, but you need to know how they work and interact with the blockchain properly.</p> Blockchain Interaction (Web3) Libraries and development tools: <p>Web3 libraries allow you to interact with nodes using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. These libraries help developers write intuitive, one-line methods to initialize the JSON RPC requests (under the hood) that interact with whichever chain you’ve&nbsp;chosen.</p><p>On Ethereum, some of the Web3 Libraries are <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/">Web3.js</a>, <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/">Ethers.js,</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openethereum/js-libs/tree/master/packages/light.js">Light.js</a>. On top of that, many chains have developer tools that provide features that allow for much faster iteration than public testnets. Tools like <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache">Ganache</a>, <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle">Truffle</a>, <a href="https://hardhat.org/">Hardhat</a>, and <a href="https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Brownie</a> are examples&nbsp;here.</p><p>For starting up with Ethereum development, I’d highly recommend checking out the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix IDE</a> — it is the best place for a beginner to learn Solidity and Ethereum concepts. You can easily directly interact and test out your code without setting up all these libraries.</p> Wrapping up <p>In all, I believe Web3 comes with an exciting opportunity for new developers out there to try out something different and break away from the traditional aspects of software development. At the same time, drawing this comparison and understanding where to start is extremely necessary for anyone looking to build decentralized applications since there will always be a combination of both in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Web3 is here to stay, but this does not mean that the concepts of Web2 are dead. Learning the new tech stack while understanding its key usage and characteristics is the only way a developer can pioneer this new industry.</p><p>I hope this blog might have helped you understand some key aspects of how a Web3 app is put together. Please do let me know if I’ve missed or messed something up because I’m still a learner trying out different stuff in this new world&nbsp;:)</p><p>Cheers!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/a-beginners-guide-the-basic-web3-architecture-and-tech-stack-81f2061d263c">A Beginners’ guide the basic Web3 Architecture and Tech Stack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

According to it, a blockchain-based system cannot be decentralised, private and scalable at the same time. Instead, insists the trilemma, trade-offs must be made. So when a blockchain protocol claims to have solved the trilemma, it is worth listening to. MetaMUI is an identity-based blockchain that dispenses with intermediaries, protects private information and is capable of settling millions of transactions per second. And to use it, nothing more elaborate than a smartphone is required. Which is why MetaMUI is attracting interest from issuers of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), security tokens and Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs). Its creators also think it holds the key to the Metaverse. Its secrets? Parallel transaction processing plus tying digital assets to digital identities.….”</p><p>Read more here:<br><a href="https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/05/19/article-metamui-uses-digital-identity-to-invent-a-fast-scalable-blockchain/">https://futureoffinance.biz/2022/05/19/article-metamui-uses-digital-identity-to-invent-a-fast-scalable-blockchain/</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions.

			 Stablecoins Were Not Made to Go to the Moon 
<p>As you may have heard, the recent news about TerraUSD (UST)’s major losses the past two weeks has generated much criticism and worry around the solidity of stablecoins.</p>
<p>In last month’s newsletter, I mentioned how stablecoin awareness and regulation have become a priority for regulators. In the weeks that followed, one of the main stablecoins in market cap de-pegged and crashed the whole crypto market.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say after the fact, but I wasn’t surprised that the UST fell apart. However, I had neither anticipated such spotlight from the financial and mainstream media, nor such impact on the crypto market. In my opinion,&nbsp;UST was clearly a stablecoin for speculation&nbsp;as the majority of buyers were using it to get the 19.5% APY on the Anchor protocol.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, on the Anchor website, it was clearly highlighted that the amounts lent were much higher than the amounts borrowed. There was bound to be a problem somewhere, and many forgot the crypto saying: “Do your own research”. Terra’s business model did not seem to be built for digital payment purposes. Instead, they emphasized incentivization for holders. Terra was actually betting on the success of the LUNA coin to compensate for UST’s stability. This ultimately led to an implosion within the LUNA ecosystem that, even with $3 billion injected from their reserves, could not prevent a collapse.</p>

			<p>This episode in the history of blockchain adoption reinforces our point of view:&nbsp;The future of stablecoins is probably permissioned, fiat-backed, and issued by regulated entities.</p>
<p>Only stablecoins issued by credible entities will survive, and governments are already thinking about how to regulate these issuers. We believe that all existing banks and payment service providers should be able to issue stablecoins. Hence, everything will be transparent on chain.</p>
<p>Also, keeping large reserves of various assets that are too volatile or not liquid enough will no longer be enough to convince stablecoin users. They will look for stablecoins for which it is possible to monitor the underlying assets in real time. Fiat-backed tokens will be easier to understand and use.</p>
<p>Regarding payments, the responsibility and system maintenance should lie with an entity that can help in the event of an error. Today, if you lose your wallet key or someone else accesses it, you will lose your USDC and there is nothing anyone can do about it. With a permissioned stablecoin, you could get your money back by proving your identity.</p>
<p>Our recent collaboration with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/jewel-chooses-erc-3643-and-tokeny-to-issue-bank-grade-stablecoins-on-polygon/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_X6oTtD5pGdbz_MbGqx6e7tZKWlnuzUr-qXoCGztLo84TL6SiHW33UaE3eFe6zbgLd98Zz">Jewel,</a>&nbsp;a digital asset banking platform,&nbsp;further cements our belief in the positive utility of permissioned stablecoins for payments and settlement.&nbsp;Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges and governments. It was clear to them that&nbsp;issuing permissioned stablecoins is the only way that fits into the concept of enforcing compliance and ensuring necessary controls over their bank-grade stablecoins.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you were not impacted too much by the recent crash. Crypto-believers will say that it is during bear markets that the best innovations are born. We’ll see 🙂</p>

<p>In short, Identity Brokers allow Service Providers to offer a selection of <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-provider/what-is-an-identity-provider-idp/" title="Identity Providers">Identity Providers</a> (authentication methods) to their customers via a single integration. An Identity Broker is an intermediary proxy service that connects multiple Service Providers (SPs) with multiple Identity Providers (IdPs). It offers a one-stop shop for SPs to integrate several authentication methods to their service(s).</p>
<p>The main benefit of using an Identity Broker is that SPs only need to integrate and manage a single integration and contract to be able to leverage numerous authentication methods for their users.</p>
<p>Without an Identity Broker, the SP needs to do this several times over, which would be complex and time-consuming. So complex and time-consuming, in fact, that many SPs simply wouldn’t attempt it – meaning they are far more limited in what authentication methods they will offer. However, offering more authentication methods is a huge customer experience and security win, as it makes it more likely for a user to be able to re-use an identity they have already created, without having to create another set of login credentials.</p>
<p>Within Europe, particularly in the Nordics, banks are the predominant IdPs. For example, Swedish banking customers can log into several third-party services with their BankID. And in some countries like Estonia, governments are very progressive in issuing digital identities. In some countries, it is the telcos and, in others – like Finland, it is a mix of these. Identity Brokering services solve the complexity involved in the usage of these different eIDs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples of strong identities available in Europe</p>
 
 Regulatory context for European Identity Brokers 
<p>eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) is an EU regulation aimed at harmonising the cross-border authentication of citizens and increasing transparency. The EU achieves this by requiring member states to create a common framework that recognises eIDs from other member states, and ensures their authenticity and security. For transparency, eIDAS aims to provide an easily accessible list of trusted services that may be used within the centralised signing framework.</p>
<p>Typically, Identity Brokers offer strong customer authentication methods, where the identity has been pre-verified to a standard of Know Your Customer (KYC). Thus, the traditional username and password, or social media IdPs (such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter etc.) might not be included in the concept.</p>
<p>As an example, in Finland, there is a law that requires private sector SPs to use the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/authentication/finnish-trust-network-ftn/" title="Finnish Trust Network">Finnish Trust Network</a> (FTN, ”Luottamusverkosto”) service to provide strong authentication methods (including bank and telco IDs). The FTN consists of IdPs and IdP Proxy operators (Identity Brokers). For public sector services, there is an identity broker service called Suomi.fi.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Components of the Finnish Trust Network</p>
 
 Example of an Identity Broker 
<p>Generally speaking, Finland is quite a unique country in the sense that it has 13 commercial IdPs and one governmental IdP through which you can get a strong digital identity. The 13 commercial IdPs include 10 banks and 3 mobile operators. The government IdP provides an eID that citizens can utilise with their ID cards. SPs can reach all these different IdPs via an Identity Brokering service.</p>
<p>For example, in Finland, the Telia Identification Broker Service (TIBS) is one such service from incumbent Telco, Telia Company. TIBS is an identity proxy service that does not store users’ SSN (Social Security Number) or other identity attributes. It only relays the necessary information between the eID vendors (IdPs) and the online services (SPs).</p>
<p>It solves several issues related to applying a strong digital identity, with several benefits such as:</p>
 
 Only one commercial contract – saving costs compared to setting up several contracts with each IdP 
 Only one technical integration – less complicated and saves time for developers 
 Solves lifecycle management issues when there are changes in the different IdP APIs at different times – much simpler to manage, as there’s no need for a separate IdP level project to fix issues related to changes 
 SP can reach almost the whole Finnish population with one contract 
 
<p></p>
<p>Typical authentication method selection dialogue for strong identities provided by identity broker service.</p>
 
 How to leverage Identity Brokering for your organisation 
<p>Reliable, trustworthy, strong customer authentication is required not only by regulation, but also as a customer experience and security driver for all sectors of business and government services – including B2B, B2C, G2B, G2C etc. A good example of this is physical shops which increasingly require an online presence. This increases the need for robust authentication services where not only the citizens of that particular country, but also customers from different countries, can access the online service and purchase products.</p>
<p>For this purpose, service providers need to be able to integrate seamlessly with different Identity Broker services. For this, the best option is to use an advanced Customer Identity and Access Management (<a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/customer-iam/what-is-ciam/" title="CIAM">CIAM</a>) system, such as Ubisecure’s <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/identity-platform/customer-iam/" title="Identity Platform">Identity Platform</a>, that allows communication between the different IdPs and your services.</p>
<p>Identity brokering services can also be built on a CIAM system. In the above example, Telia Company hosts its Identity Broker service on Ubisecure’s Identity Platform – European built and focused CIAM software. This allows Telia to buy ID transactions from all the legal eID vendors in Finland and combine them into one service. Find out more about why and how Telia Company built its identity brokering service in this <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Telia-Identification-Broker-Service-Ubisecure-Case-Study.pdf" title="case study">case study</a>.</p>
<p>For operators providing identity proxy services such as FTN and others, Ubisecure’s Identity Platform offers an ideal platform to federate all the required IdPs to offer strong digital identities and authentication methods.</p>

  Sign-In with Ethereum opens a path where large corporations can no longer strip a user's ability to access services or spy on their actions. It opens the door for a massive amount of impact in web2 apps and services.

<p>Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. It opens a new path where the user doesn't have to go through an Internet giant to access services, but instead owns the relationship directly. While web3 dapps are expected to benefit most dramatically and immediately from SIWE (as evidenced by ongoing adoption), it also opens the door for web2 applications to figure out their web3 strategy for their specific user demographics.</p><p>If you haven't read part 1, which explains why Sign-In with Ethereum is important for web3, check out the following post: &nbsp;</p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">  Why Sign-In with Ethereum is a Game-Changer - Part 1  Sign-In with Ethereum is a game-changer for user choice on the Internet. Instead of submitting to “Big Login,” users can now login using the same keys controlling their blockchain accounts--without an intermediary.  SpruceRocco    </a><p>Most dapps today cannot augment the user experience with saved preferences (light mode or dark mode), drafts of user-created content, or anything best not stored on a public blockchain for privacy, scalability, or access control. These are table stakes to provide an excellent UX frequently encountered in web2.</p><p>Fortunately, Sign-In with Ethereum has standardized the way that Ethereum users can enjoy all of these features via securely logging in to services with their existing wallets, all without a password to remember. After users log in to dapps, they can then enjoy rich contextual interactions with UX that rivals web2 applications. Dapps can now remember a user as more than just a public key, and bring profiles, credentials, preferences, and more to a session after users authenticate. </p>Wallets, but SIWE-powered<p>Using these new capabilities, it's now possible to bridge the gap between web2 and web3, with Sign-In with Ethereum as the first major entrypoint for how decentralized services respectfully deal with user data. With that, here are some of the advantages for web2 organizations to adopt Sign-In with Ethereum.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum is Free  <p>One of the simplest and low-risk ways that web2 companies can meaningfully engage the web3 ecosystem is through Sign-In with Ethereum. Sign-In with Ethereum serves as an integration path for web3 components that doesn't compromise on user experience nor relevance across an entire user base. It's secure, doesn't affect existing users who aren't interested in web3, and provides important user research that directly informs a web3 strategy for any web2 company.</p><p>In order to best illustrate this point, we can narrow it down to a simple message:</p>Minimal Assembly Required<p>SIWE costs nothing to end-users because they are just signing a message. There is no blockchain transaction required, and no gas to be paid to miners. SIWE is just a user confirming that they are logging in, and signing in order to do so. </p><p>With Sign-In with Ethereum, you can also let your existing users associate their Ethereum accounts, and use that as their means of authentication. In this case, the user is receiving a new form of passwordless login and can switch to an identifier that they control in the process. On top of all of this, existing users that aren't familiar with web3 need not worry because nothing that they already do is affected by this integration. They can continue to use the application or service as originally intended, without anything changing from the core user experience. </p><p>Sign-In with Ethereum simply adds an additional login option and offers users slightly more flexibility on how they engage with you. As a web2 company, you will have the opportunity to be a user's first touchpoint into web3, and to help them on their journey to control their own digital identity. This can naturally lead to increased user trust and growth for your brand.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum Powers Up Users  <p>Additionally, when users sign in with Ethereum, they may voluntarily introduce a bit more about themselves to your service, depending on the account they chose to login with. This can potentially come with an on-chain history (or not) which may enable you to offer additional benefits based on those facts. This gives rise to a new form of power user who has both history on an existing service, and new interests indicated by on-chain activity.</p><p>It's important to stress the fact that this depends on whether or not the user decides to share that particular history with a service, and we encourage services to make users aware of this fact. It should always be completely opt-in, and services should let users know that they can use fresh new accounts if desired. </p><p>Users can always generate new accounts to log in with, or log in with existing accounts featuring on-chain activity.</p>If you haven't met Session Sam, <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/sign-in-with-ethereum-is-a-game-changer-part-1/">check out the original post</a><p>When users can log in with their wallets or link them to existing accounts, they are able to share more with your organization on their terms, and this can add a lot of value for both parties. For example, a company can create gated experiences based on NFT holdings, DAO membership, or even DeFi activity depending on what they wish to incentivize, or what programs they wish to create. For example,</p>  Longtime fans of an artist holding their NFTs can purchase early discounted concert tickets before scalpers swarm the sales.  A special server hosting package may be made available for members of a DAO focused on developers.  Power users of decentralized exchanges may be given premium features at a financial services firm, such as leverage, credit, or a dedicated account manager.  <p>This also opens the door for companies to create new web3 experiences for their users, such as an NFT drop or POAP distribution to existing accounts that may have logged in using Sign-In with Ethereum. </p><p>In addition to providing direct benefits to users, organizations can also use SIWE to orchestrate network effects across all their digital properties, removing interoperability barriers across departments and external partners. For example, a sports event ticket stub can be represented as an NFT, and due to the significance of the event (e.g., championship victory), that same NFT lets users wear a virtual cosmetic item in a AAA video game.</p> Sign-In with Ethereum Equals New Users <p>Finally, as a champion of user-controlled identity and data, you can now introduce your product to millions of users excited to use services that care about them: web3 users.</p><p>This isn't just adding a feature for your existing user base, but introducing your service to millions of users that care about the web3 decisions you make.

Vitalik spoke about Key Management, many users were left upset at our booth (read to know more) and there were countless integrations with Web3Auth! Amsterdam Calling <p>Team Web3Auth was recently in Amsterdam participating first in Ethereum Foundation’s DevConnect and then later at ETHGlobal’s ETHAmsterdam. The venue for both events was the iconic Beurs Van Berlage, the former commodity exchange building.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1516702166353911808">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>Devconnect is a week-long in-person gathering that featured independent Ethereum events, each with a unique focus. The goal was to focus on depth-first sessions rather than size, and to bring the Ethereum community together in smaller groups to talk, learn about, or make serious progress on specific subjects. ETHAmsterdam is a hackathon gathering some of the top minds building on Ethereum with integration bounties being offered by some leading entities in the ecosystem.</p> When Vitalik opened the event and we couldn’t be more&nbsp;pleased <p>The opening of the event saw Ethereum founder Vitalik share insights on various topics pertaining to different aspects of the Ethereum ecosystem including the much awaited “merge”. Vitalik also jokingly predicted that Ethereum coins would touch 12,000 in value, but he did leave the currency unspecified. However, it was his insight on the importance of private keys that particularly struck a chord with us. Vitalik emphasized social recovery, an implementation where one has the ability to share a part of their key with people they trust, which is what the vision is for the <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">Auth Network</a> as&nbsp;well.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518209570648244224">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> What Happens in Amsterdam… <p>Our booth at the event caught quite some attention for its magical theme. Our team had developed a “horcrux” inspired mobile application to demo how our private key sharing infrastructure works.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517472026239328256">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><p>However, the “horcrux” demo was not the only attraction athe booth. We had a special attraction at the booth that left a lot of visitors rather upset. Why is that? Find out for yourself!</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1519716765990891520">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> The Team conducted workshops… <p>Our Head of Engineering Chaitanya Potti and Sr Software Engineer Subham Rathi conducted workshops on “how to Plugin self-custodial social logins into your app/wallet via MPC with Web3Auth”. Both workshops were attended by developers who were quite surprised to know that it is possible to use social log-ins to onboard users while continuing to keep the solution self-custodial.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517544150723350529">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/ETHGlobal/status/1517601383762907136">@ETHGlobal</a></p></blockquote> We did a UI/UX&nbsp;AMA <p>Our UX Team had offered free UX consultation for those who looked to increase their visibility and outreach. The consultancy booth was swarmed with visitors spending an average of 35 mins getting their queries patiently answered.</p> What if Elon Musk took over&nbsp;Twitter? <p>There were over 700 wonderful devs at the event and we caught them off guard with a few fun questions including what would they want Elon Musk to change about Twitter after purchasing it.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518634766572138496">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1517795743863562240">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Web3Auth was widely integrated and we offered over $8500 in&nbsp;bounty <p>Over 700 devs submitted 165 projects in the course of the hackathon and many of these projects had integrated with Web3Auth.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518231615004106755">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3Auth/status/1518234728284966912">@Web3Auth</a></p></blockquote> Until next time, Amsterdam! <p>All in all, DevConnect and ETHAmsterdam brought together some of the brightest minds in the Ethereum ecosystem who were acquainted with Web3Auth’s state of the art self-custodial private key management infrastructure in a fun and appealing way.</p> Stay in touch with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Website</a> | <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">Docs</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/web3auth">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://t.me/web3authdev">Telegram</a> | <a href="http://discord.gg/web3auth">Discord</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/web3auth">Linkedin</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/what-happened-ethamsterdam22-89562c5e8d18">What Happened @ ETHAmsterdam’22?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A currency gains value from its use — call it Community Contributed Value  National currencies aggregate this contributed value and centralize the benefit to the government and adjacent&nbsp;actors  People see this, and Community Currencies have been attempted to capture this value locally, instead of sending it on to financial centers and&nbsp;capitals  Community Currency experiments have generally failed for various reasons — difficulty of creation/use, lack of transparency or auditability, moral hazard, lack of immediate convertibility, instability of value, inability to see, measure and capture Community Contributed Value  Blockchains have shown a pathway to overcome some, but not all, of these roadblocks; until now, no successful local currency projects on blockchain  A new set of blockchain protocols has emerged in the Verus Project, which is developing rent-free public blockchain infrastructure — use of these open protocols allows for low risk, low cost experiments such as Community Currencies that overcome traditional roadblocks  Without programming, a community can quickly create a made to suit local currency that is easy to use, is transparent and auditable, defeats moral hazard, allows for instant conversion into other currencies, has a stable and predictable value, and can measure and capture Community Contributed Value, to be used for the betterment of the community  Adding intelligent namespaces to Community Currencies gives the potential to experiment with additional value enhancing opportunities, creating digital goods economies attached to the Community Currency  At this time, Verus is a project where developers are focussed on the core protocols. Rolling out a Community Currency for broad use would still require some additional work on user-facing apps.   The Problem <p>Like any other good, money is ruled by the laws of supply and demand. A currency in high use requires a constant float of supply to be circulating through its system. In the case of a fiat currency, the demand for holders to hold the currency gives it its value. In other words, as users of a currency, we collectively give value to that currency by our use. For something like the United States Dollar, its value comes from use in its domestic economy, as the global reserve currency, as the petrodollar, as the primary numeraire in financial markets, as the base currency for most foreign and corporate debt, as a predominant store of value, etc. etc. If we live in the United States and we zoom in, looking at our own local community, we can see that we are providing some small fraction of value to the overall value of the USD through our community’s aggregate use and holdings. However small that might be in relation to the global forces of supply and demand, it might still be a relatively large amount of value when considered from the community’s point of view. Little work has been done in quantifying this actual value provided by a community through its demand for a prevailing currency, but new technical tools might allow us to see this more clearly through actual experience. That’s what this sample case study is about — let’s call this value created by a community, “Community Contributed Value”.</p><p>Observing this in the world today, the first thing we see is that, at the local level, we have zero control of our own Community Contributed Value, nor do we experience much, if any, local benefit from it. The aggregate of all Community Contributed Value, worldwide, is centralized in the hands of the US government. In the fiat period, as the master of the global reserve currency, the US government has proven that this aggregate value is enormous, allowing the government and country to run persistently high budget and trade deficits, and expand the money supply at will, while still maintaining a strong&nbsp;dollar.</p><p>In addition, although specific research is hard to find on this issue, it does seem as if powerful private forces that are adjacent to the United States Government, such as Wall Street and the Defense Industry, are conferred certain advantages through their proximity to the controller of the USD. Connected and powerful people and corporations may be, directly or indirectly, tapping into this Community Contributed Value.</p> Solutions — pre-Blockchain <p>All of this is obvious enough to have given rise to a long history of efforts to start local community currencies, to keep some of this contributed value in the community. Prior to the development of the blockchain, these efforts really seem to have been doomed from the start. Currency issuance in the paper money world is difficult to control and has huge security and moral hazard issues (counterfeit, over-issuance, etc). These currencies cannot easily be made transparent, or auditable. The funds can’t be reasonably saved or protected in banks. There is no plausible way to have readily available conversion at market rates between the community currency and the USD, nor is it plausible to keep a local currency at a stable and predictable value. For users, using community currency was hard, and for communities, making community currency was hard — and so, except for a handful (or less), every effort ran&nbsp;aground.</p> Solutions — in the Dawn of the Blockchain Era <p>Interest in community currencies perked up in the blockchain era, as it became clear that auditable, transparent tokens could be created at will (eg. ERC-20s), and the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.</p><p>It seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues&nbsp;are:</p>  community currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement  there is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short&nbsp;term  there is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value  there are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods&nbsp;economy   New Solutions — Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a&nbsp;service <p>It is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {“CommCurr”}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, and hard to&nbsp;resist.</p><p>One of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency’s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn’t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>At about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin’s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of&nbsp;life.</p><p>They began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publicly available, including the ability to run advanced Community Currency experiments that are virtually risk-free for communities, can be carried out at low cost, and have several elements that will make them attractive and safe for broad community use.</p><p>Two key points to note about the Verus protocols, software and network&nbsp;are:</p>  no venture capitalists or investors have been involved in its financing or development, so there is no need to extract rent or payment from users to pay back investors — it is rent-free technology, the only payments necessary are network fees to provide sufficient incentive for outsiders to provide their compute resources to power the network;&nbsp;and  Verus does not use smart contracts — it is based on more traditional and longstanding distributed computing paradigms, and users access the software for basic primitives, which they then put into use and combine however they see fit. No contract programming or special blockchain engineering skill is required to carry out sophisticated actions. Recently, on the Verus testnet, one community member (a non-programmer) implemented a powerful community currency example in less than ten minutes with a few simple commands.   Currency Reserves — Convertibility <p>Verus provides the ability to define new tokens/currencies at will, without programming. Various options are available, as tokens carry a multitude of possible uses, from voting to tickets to currencies. For community currency experiments, one of the key options is to lock in reserves that are attached to, and back the value of, the newly issued currency. And, since Verus is bridgeable to and from the Ethereum network, you could back a new currency with ethereum or USDC or any other valuable currency from that&nbsp;network.</p><p>If a CommCurr is defined with reserves backing it, then users can freely mint new currency by converting their USDC, for example, directly to CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Reserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency — it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.</p><p>These few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we’ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies — USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of&nbsp;USD.</p><p>As a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr — it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the value of CommCurr will decrease a little. In other words, CommCurr has a dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and a floating conversion rate, depending on the demand for the currency.</p> Capturing the Contributed Value <p>When creating CommCurr the best way to capture value for the community will be to create the currency so that it is only partially backed. For this sample case study, let’s say it’s backed at 80%. A community can easily engineer this precise amount of backing (which never changes, as a percentage, through the life of the currency) by choosing an initial supply of CommCurr, say 1 million, and then contributing 760,000 USD as reserves, and 40,000 dollars worth of Verus as reserves. We’ll avoid going into detailed mechanics here but the result would be that, upon the launch of the currency, the community currency issuer would own 1,000,000 CommCurr, which is 80% backed by real value, but is convertible, as its initial price to acquire or to sell, 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>Now, as we described above, if the issuer just starts converting their initial holdings of CommCurr (1 million units) into USD, they’ll start depleting the reserves and driving down the value of the currency. In fact, if they just dumped it all, they’d get all their initially contributed reserves back and the currency would be rendered virtually worthless. So, instead of doing that, they’ll encourage use by the community. Perhaps they’ll simply promote its use, or maybe they’ll offer small discounts on community services, and encourage others to do so, to bootstrap use. The overall idea would be to encourage use by the community at large. If use emerges, and people start to acquire the currency (by contributing USD into the reserves), and the issuing community does not sell any of its initial holdings, the value of CommCurr will begin to creep up (provided that not all of this currency is immediately converted back by the recipients). Under these circumstances, It should be easy enough for community members to become comfortable with the value of CommCurr, as they see that it can always be acquired and disposed for USD, immediately, and at a predictable and stable price. It’s important to note that if the issuing community doesn’t sell/convert any of its holdings it is *impossible* that the value of CommCurr would fall below its initial value of 1:1 vis-a-vis the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>If regular use persists, there will be constant demand for the currency and a certain float will begin to remain in circulation. In our example, let’s say the community reaches the point where 100,000 CommCurr is more or less always outstanding, in some form of transit circulating through, or being held by, the community. This would tend to increase the value of CommCurr some amount. But, instead of allowing the currency to appreciate, the Community could begin to draw down on some of the 1,000,000 of initial supply that it holds in its reserves. In fact, in this example, they’d need to convert 100,000 of that supply into USD just to keep the price pegged 1:1 with the&nbsp;USD.</p><p>So now we would have an exact measure of Community Contributed Value — in this case it’s 20% of $100,000 = $20,000. If the demand in the community created a persistent float of $1 million, the issuer could draw down their entire supply converting it into USD, and it would still be backed at its original amount, and still be convertible 1:1 with&nbsp;USD..</p> No Free Lunch (well, maybe a free appetizer) <p>Did the issuer just make $1 million? No. Remember they had to commit $800,000 of value in the first place to set this up. And, although that investment is never at risk (they can always just convert everything into the reserves at any time to recoup them), there is a certain upfront capital cost there. However, they did clearly make $200,000, which, in this case would be a measurable amount of Community Contributed Value that they captured. There are also some minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network, which is paid to the miners and stakers, as block rewards, for mining the Verus blockchain, and powering all the community’s transactions. At current rates, it would amount to less than $200. Overall, the cost/risk/reward matrix is attractive.</p><p>It is important to remember that all of this is transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would be in instant possession of all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators.</p><p>Community members would have transparency on their spending too, which is unfortunate. However, as a fork of zcash, Verus does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus, and so there would be methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members.</p> Governance <p>There are other blockchain primitives that Verus enables which enhance CommCurr as an attractive and low-risk method to create Community Contributed Value. First, the protocols allow for virtually unlimited flexibility with respect to the governance of who is in control of the initial holdings of CommCurr. Multiple signatures could be required, up to, for example, 13 of 25, to authorize any spending or conversion activity. This would allow for fairly sophisticated approval mechanisms and safeguards for communities that are implementing this type of experiment.</p> Moral Hazard — Escrow <p>Another blockchain primitive is the ability to provably and irrevocably lock digital wallets for an arbitrary period of time (up to 21 years). In this way, a community issuer could reduce concerns about the moral hazard of dumping their holdings and crushing the value of a growing CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there’s no adoption, they wouldn’t have access to their original capital until the unlock period&nbsp;passes.</p> Wait, There’s More — Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the&nbsp;Currency <p>Possibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name “identities”. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the “identities” are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original&nbsp;issuer).</p><p>Community members might seek to register identities for many&nbsp;reasons:</p>  to signal support for the community  to have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. “member.CommCurr@”  to create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (“identities” are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)  to be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a&nbsp;club  To be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board,&nbsp;etc.  <p>These are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.</p> Conclusions <p>These are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.</p><p>Currently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It’s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.</p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">Discuss and explore all Verus has to offer on&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/VerusCoin">Follow on&nbsp;Twitter</a></p><p><a href="http://www.verus.io">Go to&nbsp;verus.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/community-currencies-a-case-study-to-explore-new-technical-possibilities-ede897433b55">Community Currencies: A Case Study to Explore New Technical Possibilities</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The road to zero trust can be bumpy for nearly any organization. While CISOs need to make data and services accessible to their users, they also need to protect the same data and services in order to prevent breaches. This means that security leaders need to balance the risk between easy access and advanced controls when moving toward a zero trust architecture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it only takes one point of access for a bad actor to gain access to critical company systems. For example, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/">Robinhood</a> discovered that millions of its customers’ names and email addresses were stolen in a data breach after a cyber criminal socially engineered a customer service representative via phone to gain access to customer support systems.</p>
<p>Similarly, on March 18th 2022, <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/en-us/march-2022-security-incident">Hubspot</a> reported that a malicious actor compromised a Hubspot employee account and leaked customer contact data.</p>
<p>As we can see from these recent incidents, user credentials are still the attack vector of choice for many cybercriminals. While most organizations have implemented 2FA, MFA and passwordless solutions to harden security, hackers and their attack methods are becoming even more sophisticated. Here is a non-exhaustive list of ways that hackers could get around 2FA, MFA and some passwordless solutions:</p>
 
 SIM swap to steal <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/2fa-and-mfa-capabilities/">2FA</a> codes 
 Convince a phone company to change a phone number associated with an account 
 Email helpdesk and request a phone number change 
 Target systems that are difficult to harden security 
 Convince user to link biometrics to criminal’s phone 
 
<p>All of these attacks are impossible to defeat without proving identity with real biometrics. Proving identity and to help meet Zero Trust guidelines requires a solution that:<br>
1) Establishes identity<br>
2) Proves authentication with the established identity</p>
<p>With this identity-based approach to authentication, identity is at the forefront of security so that organizations implementing a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/zero-trust/">Zero Trust</a> infrastructure know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.</p>
<p>When users have a quick and convenient way to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials, they can use their verified digital identity at login or transaction approval. This identity pre-proofing injects a level of trust into the Zero Trust implementation and provides users with a frictionless experience. Organizations will implement their Zero Trust deployment with a significantly improved access user experience and a high level of assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.</p>
<p>However, security leaders need to remember that not every system is created equal. While SSO can be used on many systems, they will still require additional security to prevent breaches. 1Kosmos BlockID will harden the security on these systems by adding passwordless, identity-based authentication and a secure password reset if or when needed.</p>
<p>In the instances where applications and systems don’t allow for an identity-based, passwordless experience a password is obviously still required. To help protect these systems, 1Kosmos offers an integrated password reset capability that eliminates the need for any assistance from the helpdesk. Through the 1Kosmos BlockID app or user portal, users can easily reset their passwords if and when needed. Integrating a password reset into our technology helps organizations deploy a strong and continuous authentication platform and meet the requirements of a username and password. The <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/datasheets/password-reset/">password reset</a> function also eliminates calls into the help desk, saving both user frustration and cost.</p>

 How <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum’s</a> cutting edge legaltech innovations solve the problems of trust and ownership on the blockchain <p>Actor and producer Seth Green has been an avid collector of NFTs and recently teased a trailer for a TV show called White Horse Tavern at the NFT conference VeeCon. This seems to be a sitcom based on the premise “What if your friendly neighbourhood bartender was Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398?” and is meant to be based on one of the Bored Apes Green owns. Or should I say “owned”; Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398 and the related IP that would have made White Horse Tavern possible are no longer owned by Green. He got caught out by a phishing scam in early May that ended up with someone swiping Bored Ape Yacht Club #8398 as well as two Mutant Apes and a Doodle, and has been reduced to pleading on Twitter with “DarkWing84”, who bought his Ape from the scammer, for its return so he can go forward with his&nbsp;plans.</p><p>This highlights intrinsic weaknesses with NFT trades; when you buy something you just have to trust the seller that what they are telling you about the thing is true; that it hasn’t been stolen and it is theirs to sell. Also, when you do have an NFT stolen, because blockchain transactions cannot be undone and there is no authority in charge, there is not much you can do to get your NFT or your money back. But what if it didn’t have to be that way? <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> have created a system that uses NFTs linked to physical objects or IP that is backed by warranties that have real legal force, allowing for disputes to be arbitrated in courts that understand the technology and whose judgements are legally enforceable in all 165 jurisdictions that are signatories to the 1958 New York Convention on Arbitration.</p><p>So, how does this actually work? There are increasing numbers of organisations starting to offer NFTs linked to physical objects, but none have done the in-depth legal groundwork that<a href="https://mattereum.com/"> Mattereum</a> has. This means that purchasers no longer have to just trust the seller of an NFT — experts, not just sellers, provide warranties around the facts in the NFT, with multiple experts combining to effectively create “mini DAOs” around the assets they warrant, maximising certainty and increasing the value of assets. When an expert provides a warranty to an asset in the <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> system, they back it with a financial stake which is legally enforceable, in other words they are saying “if what I say here proves to be wrong, I will pay the purchaser x% of the value of the asset”. The seller also warranties the item, so if it proves not to be theirs to sell, or they otherwise misrepresent it, they face financial and legal consequences. This provides a powerful incentive for everyone to tell the truth about an asset. It is even possible for an expert to come along and add an <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">adversarial warranty</a> to an asset, disputing the facts put forward by other experts, so a potential purchaser can see there are doubts and make their purchasing decisions accordingly. Warranties are put together in a <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Asset Passport (MAP) for each asset, secured cryptographically, and may be backed by insurance as&nbsp;well.</p><p>All NFT sales involve smart contracts, but a smart contract is not a legally binding agreement, it is merely a set of instructions based on what is defined in an agreement. If the underlying legal contracts are weak, the NFT could be compromised. <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> goes further and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract">Ricardian Contracts</a> which provide very, very strong protections for NFT buyers. These were invented in 1995 by <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Chief Scientist and financial crypto pioneer Ian Grigg and are a legally binding natural language smart contract. A Ricardian Contract turns law into code, which deals with the complexities of interpretation that arise from the rigidity and limitations of using code to express basic contract and relational terms. A Ricardian Contract exists in both human- and machine-readable format, requiring no coding expertise. They are electronically signed and recorded on the blockchain; cryptographic signatures bind parties, define intentions and execute instructions automatically. This means that if there is a dispute among the parties involved, the case can be resolved in court or through arbitration.</p><p>Even better, the new <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Trustable NFT provides another layer of protection to NFT buyers. In the UK there has been a serious push on upgrading the legal provisions for handling disputes over digital assets. The UK Jurisdiction Taskforce’s new <a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> establish the procedures for parties to contest things like who actually owns a particular NFT. If the NFT smart contract includes special procedures for legal disputes, in the UK the arbitrator (and no other party — not even the company that issued the NFT) has legal and technical capacity to transfer the ownership of the NFT without creating any new legal liability for any party. In short: you can go to a private court, plead your case, and if the NFT is a <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> Trustable NFT, you can get your digital property back. This legal provision is enforceable under international law in 165 jurisdictions. So, if Seth’s Ape had been linked to one of these, he’d have been able to get it back, no problem. We feel this is absolutely necessary for the evolution of the NFT field as more and more valuable IP and physical assets are bound to NFTs. BAYC, if you’d like to add this feature to future drops, <a href="https://mattereum.com/contact-us/">get in&nbsp;touch!</a></p><p>As a result, if you buy an NFT that has been created through the <a href="https://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> system you know the information about it is likely to be true, and if it isn’t there is a built-in path to legal redress. If someone steals your NFT you can put an <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">adversarial warranty</a> on it to that effect and take legal action to have it returned to you. That way, no one can make a monkey out of you over your Ape collection.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/so-someone-stole-your-ape-4bfc32a4faeb">So, Someone Stole Your Ape….</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Companies across the world are selling our personal data and making billions by doing so. But what if there was a way to get control back over your data and make money in the&nbsp;process?</p> Can You Earn Money From Your&nbsp;Data? <p>Maine recently passed a bill prohibiting internet service companies from selling your data without your permission? This proves that your data is valuable.</p><p>You might have probably heard many stories in the press about how search engines and social media sell your data for&nbsp;money.</p><p>While there isn’t much you can do about it, there are apps that let you sell your data for cash. You won’t be able to make a fortune, but you can definitely earn a few dozens of bucks a month to cover some of your purchases.</p><p>Below, we have listed some of the best apps to help you earn money passively if you don’t mind revealing your personal information.</p> 20 Apps That Pay You for Your&nbsp;Data  1. DataCoup — Share Your Social Media&nbsp;Data <p>Whether you believe it or not, your social network information is already out there. So, why not get compensated for&nbsp;it?</p><p><a href="https://www.datacoup.com/">DataCoup</a> bills itself as the “world’s first personal data marketplace” and the “only firm that allows you to sell your data for real, cold hard&nbsp;cash.”</p><p>It is a service that pays you for access to your social media accounts, including Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, and LinkedIn. While this might sound horrible, it’s not as bad. They’re not interested in your personal information. Instead, they’re interested in the type of content you look at and are interested in. Because this is the kind of information that businesses pay to&nbsp;learn.</p><p>You have complete control over the information you share, and the more social media profiles you connect to your Datacoup account, the more money you get to bag every&nbsp;month.</p><p>The data sources come with a certain market value attached to them. You’ll be compensated a specific amount when that data is bought. Expect to earn around $8 per month. You can withdraw your earnings once you’ve accumulated a minimum of $5 in earnings.</p><p>Because there is no set limit on how much you can earn, this app may be the most generous on the list. You can even choose who gets your information. Now, isn’t that a good&nbsp;deal?</p> 2. Monetha — Earn Rewards While&nbsp;Shopping <p>If you you are tired of waiting for discounts or searching for a deals, then <a href="https://www.monetha.io/">Monetha</a> is the app you&nbsp;need.</p><p>With Monetha, you can simply use your interest profile as a global rewards/discount card. It’s very simple and you can start getting benefits instantly. You simply download the app and use it while shopping online. Typically, the more money you spend, the more points you&nbsp;earn.</p><p>Your profile is valuable. When you share your interests with stores from our partners network they will offer you even bigger and more tailored benefits when you shop with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Perhaps, this is the most effective approach to profit from your data on the internet.</p><p>In case you are worried about your privacy, Monetha doesn’t have access to your information, all data is encrypted and you share your interests only when you decide and with the brands or stores you&nbsp;love.</p><p>If you would like to know more about getting rewards in exchange for your data, check out our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">reward&nbsp;sites</a>.</p> 3. UpVoice — Share Your Internet&nbsp;Activity <p>If you are a social media enthusiast, why not get paid for&nbsp;it?</p><p>A tracking app, <a href="https://www.joinupvoice.com/">UpVoice</a>, allows you to earn money without putting in any effort. All you have to do is install the app and start earning points every day. The program monitors your internet usage, particularly your social media feeds, and collects adverts anonymously.</p><p>The app is relatively safe to use, and UpVoice claims that it will not affect your device’s performance in any&nbsp;way.</p><p>By using the UpVoice app, you also get a chance to be an UpVoice panelist, whereby you can assist firms in developing brand strategies and marketing plans. What’s more, more benefits and rewards await you when you use participating sites.</p><p>UpVoice essentially compensates you for doing what you do every day while making a positive impact. Users get tokens that may be exchanged for e-gift cards. You should collect a minimum of 600 points to exchange them for a $10 gift card from a wide range of&nbsp;stores.</p><p>UpVoice also provides a variety of incentives to help you increase your earnings, such&nbsp;as:</p>  A 300-token welcome&nbsp;bonus  Ten tokens per day for accessing your social media platforms  Bonus points on reaching certain token milestones  Additional points for referrals  <p>Together, these incentives will help you earn around $175 every year or&nbsp;more.</p> 4. HoneyGain — Share Your Internet Bandwidth <p><a href="https://www.honeygain.com/">Honeygain</a> is similar to applications that allow you to rent out your unwanted items (or even space in your home). With Honeygain, you rent out your unused internet bandwidth for market research purposes.</p><p>Honeygain requires little effort on your part to earn money. Your work is finished after downloading the program and signing up using a valid email address. The Honeygain network will connect to the internet every time your gadget&nbsp;does.</p><p>The money you can earn with Honeygain varies. Generally, you can make up to $50 per month if you run it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. However, you can refer your friends and family to improve your chances of making more money. Use the online calculator on the Honeygain website to figure out your income potential.</p> 5. Paribus — Make Saving Money a&nbsp;Habit <p>Do you despise learning that an item you just purchased has gone on sale? Perhaps, try&nbsp;<a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus</a>.</p><p>An interesting data collection program, its primary goal is to help you get refunds on items by keeping track of your purchases and looking for price drops. If you buy something and it goes on sale a few days later, Paribus works on your behalf to get you a&nbsp;refund.</p><p>Paribus syncs with your email to monitor your purchases. But you also have the option to upload your receipts. However, that means you will have to put in the extra&nbsp;effort.</p><p>While this appears to be a straightforward service, much like the other apps, Paribus uses the information obtained to determine your shopping habits for marketing purposes. As for what you can earn, it generally varies based on your purchase patterns and the likeliness for prices to fall. It could be an excellent app for you if you frequently notice sales events after you purchase products.</p> 6. PhonePaycheck — Share Your Phone’s Processor <p>A free app, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neocortix.phonepaycheck&amp;hl=en">PhonePaycheck</a>, helps you earn money in exchange for allowing it to use your phone’s processor when you are not using it. The app runs when you plug your phone into a charger and leave it connected to Wi-Fi. The best thing is it does not consume any of your data plan or access any of your personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>After downloading the app, you sign in using your Google account, keep track of your earnings, and cash out your winnings as a PayPal payout or a gift card once your earnings reach&nbsp;$10.</p><p>To increase your earnings with PhonePaycheck, use the same Google account to download the application onto your old phones. On a single account, you can connect up to five devices. You’ll earn money as long as the phone is plugged in and connected to&nbsp;WiFi.</p> 7. Nielsen Computer and Mobile Panel — Grab Sweepstakes Entries <p>Sharing your mobile data is a passive way to get money. Hence, having sweepstakes entries can help you boost your revenue. A company well-known for tracking the behavior of television viewers, <a href="https://computermobilepanel.nielsen.com/ui/US/en/sdp/landing">Nielsen</a> pays consumers to download its app so it can track their device and internet&nbsp;usage.</p><p>You have almost zero work to do after you download the app on your computer, phone, tablet, e-reader, or any other mobile device. You can sit back and watch your passive income grow and hopefully enter into sweepstakes that you win. The prize pool for Nielsen for sweepstake draws is up to $10,000. But other than that, expect to earn nearly $50 per year with this app for your participation in consumer research.</p> 8. Achievement — Live a Healthy&nbsp;Life <p>What if you could earn points for taking healthy actions? With <a href="https://www.myachievement.com/">Achievement</a>, you can do exactly&nbsp;this.</p><p>Use Achievement to measure your progress in walking, meditating, sleeping, and even eating by connecting it with your other health applications. The app also has surveys that allow you to earn up to 200 points by answering simple questions.</p><p>The data from the app is used to assist businesses in the health and fitness industry improve their products and services. However, it is also a terrific way to stay motivated and consistently make healthy&nbsp;choices.</p><p>Once you have 10,000 points, you can swap your points for a $10 PayPal payout. If that sounds impossible, you should know that you can rapidly start accumulating points because each type of action can earn you up to 80 points every&nbsp;day.</p> 9. Permission Research — Share Your Internet&nbsp;Activity <p>An online market research tool, <a href="https://www.permissionresearch.com/">Permission Research</a>, tries to uncover internet trends and behavior. For this reason, it is considered one of the greatest data collection apps available that pay you for your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Unlike most survey companies, Permission Research works by having members download software to their computers. The information is then gathered and sold to organizations interested in learning more about how people use the internet.</p><p>While using the app, you might be invited to participate in surveys via email, which will help you earn even more&nbsp;money.</p><p>Permission Research takes great care to keep your personal information safe. They do not store sensitive personal data and employ both digital and physical security measures to protect your&nbsp;data.</p> 10. National Consumer Panel — Share Your Purchase&nbsp;Data <p>With the <a href="https://www.ncponline.com/">National Consumer Panel</a>, you get to earn points for submitting your purchase data. You keep track of what you buy with the National Consumer Panel’s mobile app or handheld scanner, which you use to scan barcodes on everything you&nbsp;buy.</p><p>You’ll get points every time you do so, which you may exchange for prizes or sweepstakes entries worth up to $20,000. You can also boost your profits by participating in specific surveys. NCP is a collaboration between Nielsen and IRi, two research&nbsp;firms.</p><p>As you will be paid in points, you can redeem them for prizes listed in the National Consumer Panel&nbsp;catalog.</p> 11. ScreenLift — Get Rewarded for Viewing&nbsp;Ads <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.screen.lift&amp;hl=en">ScreenLift</a> displays advertisements on your lock screen and rewards you for watching them, regardless of whether or not you engage with&nbsp;them.</p><p>All you have to do is unlock your phone like you usually would to earn rewards. In fact, the site features a mechanism that recognizes if you’re attempting to make extra money by using your phone in an unusual way. You will not be rewarded if this&nbsp;happens.</p><p>Swiping your phone to unlock it will earn you “lifts”-the app’s currency. By clicking the diamond button and completing games, you get to earn extra&nbsp;lifts.</p><p>You need around 7,100 lifts to earn $5. You can withdraw the money earned either through PayPal or in the form of an Amazon gift&nbsp;card.</p> 12. Dosh — Get Paid for&nbsp;Shopping <p>Almost all of us go shopping multiple times a month. So then, why not get paid for&nbsp;it?</p><p><a href="https://www.dosh.com/">Dosh</a> is a data collection app through which you can earn cash back on eligible transactions by linking your most-used debit or credit card. It is a great way to make a passive income channel from your everyday purchases.</p><p>You will find a list of participating stores and brands on the app. Simply follow these businesses and brands, and you will be able to bag a percentage of your purchase back every time you buy something.</p><p>However, there is a catch. You should use a credit card to pay for the purchase to be eligible for your rewards. Nonetheless, this also means you can automatically collect a percentage of your cash back without having to scan receipts.</p><p>With more than 1000 participating businesses and restaurants, you can earn up to 10% of your shopping and dining expenditure. You’ll be able to cash out your winnings once you have accumulated $25 either through PayPal or direct bank transfer.</p> 13. Killi — Allow Control Over Your&nbsp;Data <p><a href="https://killi.io/">Killi</a> states that companies significantly profit from your everyday data. Hence, they want you to control the data you own and earn money by completing easy tasks within the&nbsp;app.</p><p>Killi gives you complete control over who uses your data and compensates you for sharing it. While many businesses completely profit from your data, Killi lets you have a piece of the&nbsp;pie.</p><p>Your job is simple. Download the Killi app, complete your profile, specify your criteria, and they will take care of the rest as you earn a passive income. Killi awards point every Friday that can be redeemed for rewards. Expect to earn around $10 a week. However, the more information you share, the more you can&nbsp;earn.</p><p>Shopping, location, and profile rewards are the various ways you can make passive cash using this app. If you wish to increase your profits, participate in surveys or refer&nbsp;friends.</p><p>You can use Killi worry-free. It promises that all the personal information is protected and only data that has been given permission to be purchased is purchased.</p> 14. Pei — Earn Bitcoin&nbsp;Rewards <p>Another app that rewards you for shopping at your favorite stores, what makes <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pei/id1505818791">Pei</a> stand out is that you may opt to get your incentives in&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p><p>Create an account and link it to your credit card to get started. Pei keeps track of your purchases and awards you with points when you buy from partner&nbsp;stores.</p><p>You’ll need at least $15 worth of points to redeem your profits, which you may cash out through PayPal, gift cards, or Bitcoin. Depending on the retailer you bought from, Pei will reimburse you between 1% and 15% of your purchase.</p><p>When it comes to the earning potential, your earnings will vary depending on your buying habits, with shopping from partner retailers paying&nbsp;more.</p> 15. MobileXpression — for the&nbsp;Internet <p>Another option to get paid for data collection is <a href="https://www.mobilexpression.com/">MobileXpression</a>, a market research company that strives to shape the future of the internet. They achieve this by collecting data about your internet&nbsp;usage.</p><p>The app is available for both iOS and Android devices. Right after you install the app, it will start collecting data about your online browsing patterns. It gathers information about the pages you visit, the links you access, and your calls’&nbsp;length.</p><p>You will be paid credits for every week the application remains active on your device. After the first week, MobileXpression offers its users a $5 gift card. However, expect a $5 gift card once every few weeks afterward.</p> 16. Sweatcoin — Stay&nbsp;Healthy <p><a href="https://sweatco.in/">Sweatcoin</a> motivates you to get healthier and pays you for doing so. Available for Android and iOS devices, the app automatically tracks your steps indoors and outdoors. Of course, this means you will have to carry your phone with you&nbsp;always.</p><p>For every 1,000 steps, the app pays you 0.95 Sweatcoins. Though you can’t necessarily withdraw the coins as cash, you can exchange them for goods and services. For instance, you can get one month of Netflix subscription for 300 Sweatcoins or a $10 gift card in exchange for 100 Sweatcoins.</p><p>Sweatcoin is also launching crypto soon. So, start using the app now to reap the rewards&nbsp;early.</p> 17. SavvyConnect — Get Paid to Use the&nbsp;Internet <p>With <a href="https://savvyconnect.en.aptoide.com/app">SavvyConnect</a>, you can earn around $180 per year. You install the company’s software on any device and make $5 per device per month. So, the more devices you connect to, the more you can&nbsp;earn.</p><p>This is one true passive income channel, as all you need to do is use the internet as usual after installing the software. Furthermore, you also get to access SavvyConnect’s sister company, SurveySavvy. You will be invited to take surveys, which will help you further increase your earnings.</p><p>The minimum amount you can cash out is as low as $1. You can redeem your earnings through check at any&nbsp;time.</p> 18. UBDI — Exchange Insights for&nbsp;Cash <p>UBDI, the abbreviated form of <a href="https://www.ubdi.com/">Universal Basic Data Income</a>, is a service that pays you in exchange for your data and insights. UBDI’s primary goal is to help companies enhance their offerings. The data is shared anonymously, so you don’t have to worry about your personal information landing in the wrong&nbsp;hands.</p><p>When it comes to the earning potential, the rates aren’t specified. Nevertheless, UBDI states that users could earn up to $1,000 per year just by sharing their data. You can cash out your earnings via wire transfer.</p> 19. Money SMS — Receive Test&nbsp;Messages <p>A pretty straightforward app, <a href="https://moneysmsapp.com/">Money SMS</a>, pays you to receive test text messages. Once you install the app and connect to the internet, the platform starts sending you test SMS messages. There’s nothing else you should&nbsp;do.</p><p>Money SMS helps mobile network operators and telecom providers ensure the proper delivery of their messages through such test messages. The app pays you $0.20 per test message in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, or&nbsp;PayPal.</p> 20. CashMagnet — Browse the&nbsp;Internet <p><a href="https://cashmagnetapp.com/">CashMagnet</a> pays you for visiting specific websites. Once you download the app, your phone turns into a traffic network node that helps marketers boost the click numbers and traffic&nbsp;figures.</p><p>You are awarded points for your activity. For every 10 points, you get $0.01. CashMagnet has a low minimum redemption of $1, which equals 1,000 points. You can redeem your earnings in the form of Amazon gift cards, PayPal payments, Ethereum, or&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p> In a Nutshell: Do Apps Really Pay You for Your&nbsp;Data? <p>Though it is hard to believe, some apps pay you to accomplish seemingly insignificant tasks. You download apps and then give them permission to track your movements online and collect data about you. It may seem absurd, but they require the data and have to pay for the information anyway. Hence, going straight to the consumer saves them&nbsp;money.</p><p>Most of the businesses that pay you for your data are still in their infancy. Hence, it’s too early to determine whether they’ll make any profits. However, experts believe that we will be able to do so one&nbsp;day.</p><p>For those prepared to contribute their data, this is a terrific method of reclaiming some power over their data while earning money. However, it is to be kept in mind that not all data will be treated&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Those who have interesting lifestyles are perceived as influencers, have large networks, and whose data is valuable because it may influence others’ purchases will earn more than the next person. This means that not everyone’s data is equally valuable.</p><p>Lastly, before installing an app on your phone or computer, ensure it’s legitimate, and you are okay with collecting your&nbsp;data.</p><p>PS: if you’re interested in earning money from your data, you possibly should read <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/knowledge/data-ownership/">our article about data ownership</a>!

<p>If you’re a long-time reader of this blog, you’ll know that Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity through:</p>



  Products – building decentralized identity capabilities in the&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, which enterprises can leverage&nbsp;  Utilities – helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  Standards – being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards area  Open Source – contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.&nbsp;  



 



 Anonyome Labs supports decentralized identity blockchains 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome’s is helping to run decentralized identity blockchains – the foundation for any decentralized identity-based applications.</p>







<p>Anonyome Labs became part of the Sovrin blockchain in 2019. Sovrin is a public utility blockchain for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy technology. As a Founding Steward, Anonyome has run a validator node for Sovrin since its inception.</p>







<p>In 2020, Anonyome Labs was asked to help run the Indicio network. This is another Hyperledger Indy-based decentralized identity blockchain. Anonyome labs runs a validator node on the MainNet for Indicio.</p>







<p>In 2021, Anonyome Labs was approached to help run the cheqd network. This is a new decentralized identity network based on COSMOS/Tendermint. Anonyome runs validator nodes on both the MainNet and TestNet for cheqd. The most interesting aspect of the cheqd network is its introduction of a financial model and cheqd token.</p>



 



 We participate in standards groups 



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identity is an evolving area that has a strong focus on producing standards. These standards will ensure that Anonyome Labs’ decentralized identity software is interoperable with the standardized decentralized identity software created by other vendors. At Anonyome Labs we contribute to various decentralized identity standards efforts:</p>







<p>Sovrin&nbsp;is a public foundation for looking after the Sovrin network – the only public utility for decentralized identity based on Hyperledger Indy. Anonyome Labs is a contributor to the Technical Governance Board and the Stewards Council.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HyperLedger&nbsp;is part of the Linux Foundation and focuses on standards around blockchains. The decentralized identity based Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa projects are hosted at Hyperledger. Anonyome Labs contributes to the Aries Working Group.</p>



<p>Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)&nbsp;is home to many working groups that provide both standards documentation and code prototypes through GitHub:<br></p>



  identifiers and discovery  DID authentication  claims and credentials  DID communication  Sidetree  secure data storage  Keri  wallet security  applied crypto.  



<p>Anonyome Labs is co-chair of the DID Communication (i.e., DIDComm) working group and is a member of the DIF Technical Steering Committee.</p>



<p>Trust Over IP (ToIP)&nbsp;is also part of the Linux Foundation. It bring together the disparate standards into a comprehensive technical and governance model. Anonyome Labs is part of the Steering Committee and the Technology Stack Working Group.</p>



<p>W3C&nbsp;is the home of the decentralized identity identifier (DID) and verifiable credentials standards. This is probably the most-high profile of the standards groups. Anonyome Labs closely follows the work of both these groups.</p>



 We contribute to decentralized open source communities 



<p></p>



<p>Anonyome Labs contributes back to the open source community by providing source code, bug fixes, and to the core ACA-PY: Aries Cloud Agent – Python service. This is a cloud agent that provides verifiable credentials issuer and verifier capabilities, endorser (capability to write to various blockchains), and more.</p>

<p>In our continued updates on Sign-In with Ethereum (SIWE) support, we're pleased to announce that we've harmonized the behavior of our SIWE Core APIs across different languages, added a number of optimizations, and have released a new beta of our TypeScript library with the included changes. &nbsp;</p><p>While watching SIWE adoption we've identified multiple cases of how SIWE is typically integrated, and we decided to update our SIWE Core Packages to what we learned from our observations. We recently harmonized the behavior of our SIWE Core APIs across different languages with a focus on unifying handling for the parsing, validating, and verification of SIWE messages and all SIWE Core Packages (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/pull/76">TypeScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-rs/pull/31">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-go/pull/15">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ruby/pull/16">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-ex/pull/22">Elixir</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe-py/pull/27">Python</a>) have now been streamlined to support this.</p><p>All checks from EIP-4361 are now enforced, and we also implemented type checks for fields contained in SIWE messages stricter. One won’t be able to create a SIWE message with an Ethereum account that is not EIP-155 compliant, as required by EIP-4361. </p><p>Finally, verifiers (backend applications, APIs, cloud functions, lambdas etc.) which rely on the outcome of the verification process can now get more granular reasons in case some checks have failed and provide additional checks as needed (e.g., domain, nonce, timestamp). We've now also released a v2.0 beta version of our TypeScript library reflecting these changes: </p><a href="https://github.com/spruceid/siwe/releases/tag/v2.0.3-beta">  Release SIWE 2.0 Release · spruceid/siwe  SIWE 2.0 has been released. The interfaces have been updated to allow consistent usage across languages for SIWE message parsing, creation, and verification. Message parsing has been split into its...  GitHubspruceid    </a><p>The interfaces have been updated to allow consistent usage across languages for SIWE message parsing, creation, and verification. Wallet implementers are mostly interested in SIWE message parsing, so we also now have a SIWE parser package (TypeScript) to optimize for dependency footprint. <code>siwe-parser</code> allows implementers to utilize this functionality standalone without importing larger cryptographic dependencies.</p> Additional Developer Notes for the TypeScript v2.0 Beta Release  <p>The update introduces the following breaking changes (hence the major version update) and implements stricter checks from the EIP-4361 specification:</p>  <code>validate(…)</code> was deprecated and renamed to <code>verify(…)</code> with a new API. A backwards-compatible helper function exists to allow existing implementers to upgrade without concern for changed behavior, but SIWE 1.0 users are advised to review the upgrade section below.  <code>ethers</code> has been updated to a peer dependency, allowing for more efficient builds.  EIP-55 validation of EIP-155 is now enforced, and non-EIP-155 messages are considered as invalid.  The <code>type</code> and <code>signature</code> properties have been removed from <code>SiweMessage</code>.  The <code>not-before</code> message field is now checked during <code>verify</code>.  This update introduces more granular error types returned after verification or message parsing failures: <code>EXPIRED_MESSAGE</code>, <code>INVALID_DOMAIN</code>, <code>DOMAIN_MISMATCH</code>, <code>NONCE_MISMATCH</code>, <code>INVALID_ADDRESS</code>, <code>INVALID_URI</code>, <code>INVALID_NONCE</code>, <code>NOT_YET_VALID_MESSAGE</code>, <code>INVALID_SIGNATURE</code>, <code>INVALID_TIME_FORMAT</code>, <code>INVALID_MESSAGE_VERSION</code>, and <code>UNABLE_TO_PARSE</code>.  <p>Upgrading from SIWE 1.x to 2.0<br>For most implementers, the existing code will continue to work as expected without changes, but there will be a warning message that <code>validate()</code> has been deprecated and may be removed in future versions. To get rid of this warning, you can simply update instances of <code>validate(signature)</code> to <code>verify({ signature: signature })</code>.</p><p>Instead of <code>validate(...)</code>, SIWE 2.0 uses <code>verify(params, opts)</code>. The <code>verify</code> function accepts the primary argument <code>params</code>, which satisfies the following interface:</p> <code>export interface VerifyParams {
    /** Signature of the message signed by the wallet */
    signature: string;

    /** RFC 4501 dns authority that is requesting the signing. */
    domain?: string;

    /** Randomized token used to prevent replay attacks, at least 8 alphanumeric characters. */
    nonce?: string;

    /**ISO 8601 datetime string of the current time. */
    time?: string;
}</code> <p>The <code>opts</code> argument contains the options which dictate how the verification should proceed, namely:</p> <code>export interface VerifyOpts {
    /** ethers provider to be used for EIP-1271 validation */
    provider?: providers.Provider;

    /** If the library should reject promises on errors, defaults to false */
    suppressExceptions?: boolean;
}</code> <p>With the <code>suppressExceptions</code> option above, a <code>SiweResponse</code> with a populated error will be resolved instead of the promise being rejected, allowing for normal control flow handling. However, by default, promises are rejected to ensure defensive programming practices.</p><p>Finally, the <code>verify(...)</code> function returns an object of type <code>SiweResponse</code> defined as:</p> <code>export interface SiweResponse {
    /** Boolean representing if the message was verified with success. */
    success: boolean;

    /** If present `success` MUST be false and will provide extra information on the failure reason. */
    error?: SiweError;

    /** Original message that was verified. */
    data: SiweMessage;
}</code>  <p>If you're interested in integrating Sign-In with Ethereum into your dapp, app, or service, we are more than happy to help and provide any support we can. As we continue our work supporting Sign-In with Ethereum, we especially welcome implementers who already have users relying on similar workflows, authors of related EIPs, and wallet vendors who would like to do more to support user-owned identities to join us.</p><p>If you are interested in being involved, please join our Discord server:</p><a href="https://discord.com/invite/WjvuYqvm5Y"></a>

				  Decentralized Identity moves fast, don’t let keeping up feel like trying to drink from a fire hose.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>In this rapid fire review we will take a look at, and break down, the biggest recent stories in digital identity and what they could mean for business and the average person using the internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eic2022-centralized-decentralized-identity-converging-kuppinger/">EIC2022 Centralized &amp; Decentralized Identity converging</a></p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, the founder and principal analyst of KuppingerCole, weighed in on the recent European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) that concluded May 13. For those unfamiliar this is a conference, while the title says European, it brings together people from all over the world in the identity space, and as Martin describes, is a place where best practices and thought leadership around digital identities and IAM (Identity and Access Management) meet. He summarizes his biggest take away as the new trend of decentralized identity and traditional IAM converging, sounding extremely positive about the possibilities, and ending with the statement “It is time to explore the new possibilities and utilize DIDs to leverage your IAM to the next level.”</p>
<p>We couldn’t agree more with Martin’s assessment! EIC was an awesome event that Indicio was lucky enough to send a couple representatives to and present at, you can watch our recap video of the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlKYLlSRQE0&amp;t=5s">here</a>. One of the biggest takeaways that our team had was how many people had decentralized identity on their radar, but were under the impression it was a few years out at least. As one of our team at the conference pointed out, this point of view was because this was the first large identity conference where decentralized identity has had a sizable showing, and it was great to see, people couldn’t wait to learn more and talk about it. This conference had a huge impact on moving decentralized identity more into the public eye, and we are hopeful that for those that thought they had more time this came as a much needed wake up call, make no mistake, the technology is here today! It’s time to start thinking of how to implement it into your identity strategy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/buenos-aires-planning-ambitious-decentralized-digital-identity-system-with-biometrics">Buenos Aires planning ambitious decentralized digital identity system with biometrics</a></p>
<p>Buenos Aires is planning to establish a non-permissioned, blockchain-based, digital identity platform that includes biometrics for public and private sector use. The platform will use <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/?posttype=all&amp;s=DIDs">decentralized identifiers</a> (DIDs) and follow the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID-CORE</a> specification. The blockchain element is intended to maximize transparency, which is a key concern following a headline-grabbing hack of <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202110/potentially-devastating-digital-id-hack-in-argentina-could-have-many-ripples">Argentina’s digital ID system</a> last year. The digital ID system could be used by Buenos Aires residents to access city services, as well as transact with financial services providers, including enabling tax payments in cryptocurrency. The launch target is late-2022 or the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>This is a massive step forward for large-scale adoption of decentralized identity technologies and highlights a key problem that blockchain can solve: transparency across the network. Blockchain creates multiple ledgers for data transactions, allowing anyone with admin access to see what has transpired across the network. This is important for many use cases, but in Argentina, specifically, the government has had issues with police accessing facial data records to essentially track the greater population, which they shouldn’t be able to do. By using blockchain other users of the network would be able to see who is misusing their access.</p>
<p>Indicio is a proponent of starting simple and scaling to expand the benefits of these types of systems—because that approach has worked time and again with our clients—so starting with one city makes sense. The fact that they are looking at ease of use is key for end user adoption, as is maximizing the number of services that citizens can access, and pay through a variety of means. The more digital credentials can be used for day-to-day purposes, the greater the value they’ll be to people and the more they will be used. This plan signals forward thinking and we will be very interested to see how it develops.</p>
<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/londons-exclusive-les-ambassadeurs-casino-114600022.html">London’s Exclusive Les Ambassadeurs Casino Bets on Blockchain to Revolutionize Gambling</a></p>
<p>Casino players at Les Ambassadeurs will soon be able to transfer their winnings by using verified identity credentials. The aim is to improve customer experience, enhance safety and compliance, and reduce costs and administration. Set to be trialed this year, this solution will provide a secure way for casino players to withdraw their funds, or transfer them to another casino within the system. “Gambling is one of the big drivers of technology. Over 20% of the world population gambles and the global industry is worth over $711 billion”— <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=l1X6HhtY-xYiBnDB2CsAXl6f0Po5JFrZ_W9hCuL_4B2uCfMRtFd6oRokLNThOeFNnd-zj4OToSqKhXKxNWUWs-yLjTRxmNFZuraL2SdHtzeBQCmfMdTGWUNjoX-qY24ru0oo8sN3vZEKnwGY_yVVYzBXq5BDsqDofiHhG7MkPXci5eXU7OeVPWeZk_C94zqJpXKUH-1Rki8IofCm0ILKXDo5DZ1BXYFReIAmISwBs4s=">Rick Schmitz</a> (LTO Network CEO)</p>
<p>With staggering numbers of players and money involved, the gambling industry will show many people how this technology can make friction disappear and both the end user and the casino’s life easier: One no longer has to deal with the process of cashing out or managing their chips, while the other reduces the risk of fraud and lowers security costs. The adoption of decentralized identity in a leisure activity is also not to be overlooked, it’s one thing to implement decentralized identity into your life grudgingly because a government says you need it to access the things you need, it’s another to take it onto yourself to make sure you have it for something you want to do.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/28/fact-sheet-united-states-and-60-global-partners-launch-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet/">United States and 60 Global Partners Launch Declaration for the Future of the Internet&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The United States government recently announced its vision for the Internet and digital technologies. The goals include protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms online, promoting a global Internet that advances the free flow of information, and ensuring that all people can benefit from the digital economy.</p>
<p>There is a lot to unpack in this article, and if you want a more detailed interpretation, our own James Schulte did an excellent job in a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/the-white-houses-future-of-the-internet-is-available-today/">blog post</a>. The cliff notes summary: what the Biden administration is promising to work toward is largely delivered by decentralized identity technology. Concerns over user privacy and data protection is one of the biggest reasons many of the organizations we work with have turned to decentralized solutions. With 60 global partners signing this declaration, we see an uptick in blockchain identity solutions coming soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202205/us-digital-id-fraud-cost-52b-in-2021-javelin-estimates">US digital ID fraud cost $52B in 2021</a></p>
<p>This recent report by Javelin estimates that 42 million Americans were victims of digital identity fraud last year. It points the finger at pandemic-related shifts to digital services in the U.S. economy as the driver for the 109 percent jump in new-account fraud and 90 percent leap in account takeovers. The research firm ends by suggesting that banks add behavioral biometrics tools to personally identifiable information and device-based controls to shield customers.</p>
<p>This article is a great reminder of why enabling people to prove who they are online in a privacy-securing way is so important. Biometric tools and device-based controls are a good start, but keeping this information in a centralized database will always come with a level of risk. As more personally identifiable information (PII) is needed to manage user accounts for e-commerce and online financial services, the risk of fraud and data breaches is only going to keep increasing. Human nature being what it is, most people will choose frictionless convenience over time-consuming, multi-step security procedures. This is why the simplicity of verifiable credentials is the way forward: not only does it mean that PII doesn’t have to be stored to manage user authentication, the process of verification is frictionless.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.globalgovernmentforum.com/not-a-lot-to-show-for-australias-400m-digital-id-programme-says-former-government-cio/">‘Not a lot to show’ for Australia’s $400m digital ID programme, says former government CIO</a></p>
<p>A leader in the Australian government recently shared his thoughts on its digital ID program, concluding that it was over-engineered and has cost too much for what has been delivered. He said that there were many failings, a big one being that they missed their own deadline to introduce legislation designed to underpin the digital ID to Parliament in spring last year. Without the legislation people did not have a reason to adopt and the government did not have a reason to switch from legacy systems. Another problem was multiple identities for different governments causing confusion and inefficiency, with one person saying you may have up to 30 different logins for different government services.</p>
<p>This is an unfortunate situation but definitely one that everyone can learn from. Successful implementations of digital identity systems need a clear direction and multiple organizations to come together to make sure they work. At Indicio we direct customers through this roadmapping and can’t stress enough the importance of giving the end users a good user experience and a compelling reason to adopt. Buy-in from every stakeholder is critical; for example — in our successful proof of concept for Aruba it took coordination between the government, local businesses, and the airports to implement a single verifiable credential;&nbsp; a digital ID for multiple government services is absolutely doable, but arguably should be implemented incrementally, with each success becoming an opportunity to recruit new stakeholder buy in. If you’re curious about the work that went into successfully implementing that credential, you can read more <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-indicio-pave-way-to-safer-travel-experience-with-launch-of-aruba-health-app/">here.</a></p>

<p>Business email compromise is one of the many types of phishing attacks targeting both large and small corporations for financial gain.</p>
<p>What is a BEC attack? A BEC attack is a type of phishing scam where a hacker will email an employee pretending to be a higher up in their company, like a manager or executive, and ask for some type of payment.</p>
 What Are Social Engineering and Phishing? 
<p>When we think of hacking attacks, we often think about mysterious, malicious computer terrorists in dark rooms breaking encryption and accessing top-secret systems. The reality is less romantic, however. The most effective and prevalent form of hacking is actually built around social engineering.</p>
<p>Social engineeringI refers to leveraging human elements in IT systems to gain information about (or access to) those systems. This can include anything from tricking someone into providing their password to finding one on a Post-it note in a dumpster.</p>
 What Is Phishing? 
<p>One of the longest lasting, most effective, and ever-present forms of social engineering is email phishing. A phishing attack involves a hacker creating or forging fake emails claiming to be from a legitimate party or company to fool users into sending money, turning over information, or giving up their system security.</p>
<p>These attacks are by far some of the most effective, even with generations of digital natives having experienced them their entire lives. In 2018,<a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2017-internet-crime-report-released-050718"> the Federal Bureau of Investigations listed phishing</a> as the third-largest form of cybercrime, and <a href="https://ironscales.com/blog/ironscales-releases-findings-from-state-of-cybersecurity-survey/">security firm IRONSCALES reported</a> that 80% of respondents saw an increase in phishing attacks since 2020.</p>
<p>This makes sense: phishing is low cost, high reward, and a single victim can open an entire system to attack. Hackers can send hundreds or thousands of emails, and even poorly constructed fake emails can fool somebody at least some of the time. Many of the most high-profile attacks seen in the news, from ransomware to cloud-based malware, often originate from a successful phishing attack.</p>
 What Are Different Types of Phishing? 
<p>It’s critical to note the different types of phishing attacks and how they relate to BEC overall.</p>
<p>The different types of email phishing include the following:</p>
 
 Spear Phishing: Unlike traditional email phishing, which relies on high-volume but often low-effort emails to trick people, spear phishing uses more sophisticated email tricks and official messages to fool higher value targets, like managers or decision-makers with access to more important information. 
 Whale Phishing: The evolution of spear phishing, whale phishing, or “whaling,” targets executive branch members and often involves efforts to get these executives to directly transfer money or information to outside attackers. Due to the sophistication of these attacks, hackers will often coordinate their information gathering and spoofing across email and other technologies like video conferencing. 
 Clone Phishing: The attackers gain access to an official email, either from the company or someone in it, and then change it (for example, changing links or including attachments). They spoof the original sender’s address and resend the email with a note to the effect that the original sender “forgot” to include something. Trusting the original email, recipients then download attachments or click links from the new malicious message. 
 
 What Are Business Email Compromise Attacks? 
<p>Many phishing attacks will attempt to mix and match different approaches. For example, a hacker could clone a message in hopes of targeting a manager or executive as part of a whaling attack. The entire premise of the attack is to leverage some form of trust to get the target to do what the hacker wants.</p>
<p>With that in mind, one of the most insidious forms of attack is the business email compromise.</p>
<p>BEC occurs when a hacker spoofs or steals access to a business email account from inside your domain. These emails, appearing to come from someone in the company (often someone known by people in that organization), will look legitimate.</p>
<p>BECs can come in two different ways:</p>
 
 Spoofing: The emailer spoofs their email to appear to come from someone inside the company. This can mean either creating a generic email with a company domain (“hr@businessname.com”, for example) or using the name of a specific manager or executive. 
 
<p>Attackers can spoof emails in several ways, including the use of nearly identical domain names or faking information in the “From” field.</p>
 
 Account Theft: If a hacker has already gained access to someone’s business account, they can spam the business network with hacked emails. These BEC attacks are even harder to notice because the email comes from a legitimate account. 
 
<p>Account theft is a major concern, especially in cases of fraud where a hacker hijacks and spoofs an executive’s email account.</p>
<p>A trademark of BEC attacks is their tendency to seek specific private information. For example, BEC attacks will often go beyond simple login credentials to pursue the following kinds of engagement:</p>
 
 Money or Wire Transfers: BEC may target whales in the organization to instigate a wire transfer to an outside account. Because the email seems legitimate, the victim often doesn’t think twice about sending the money. 
 Personal Employment Information: The hacker may, if possible, reach out to finance or HR departments and gain access to tax information like W2 forms that contain earnings statements, social security numbers, and other personally identifiableg information. 
 Healthcare Information: If the attack undermines the email systems of healthcare institutions, they may seek protected health information from the staff working there. 
 Malware Deployment: If the email is sufficiently advanced, it could convince users to download infected documents or files, launching malware into the system. This, in turn, could lead to ongoing, long-term information theft or the installation of ransomware. 
 
 How Can You Prevent BEC Attacks and Scams? 
<p>BEC, like other email phishing attacks, can be prevented with a combination of training, awareness, and special tools. However, preparing your organization to address the unique threats of BEC may call for more target solutions.</p>
<p>Some of the approaches organizations can take to mitigate BEC include the following:</p>
 
 Implement a Business Culture of Awareness and Compliance: It’s your job as security or business management to ensure that your people understand the red flags and warning signs of BEC attacks. This includes ongoing training on new threats, how to notice fake email addresses, and policies that cover what employees should and should not ask for over email. Additionally, your people should clearly understand any compliance or regulatory requirements tied to email security. 
 Track Finances and Suspect Behavior: While an executive might have the final say over the distribution of funds, it doesn’t mean that they are infallible. Having safety measures in place to triple-check financial activity can stop a wire-transfer attack before the company ends up sending hundreds of thousands of dollars to a thief. 
 Layer Defenses Around Warning and Email Blocking: Email systems can block outside domains from sending emails—but that would make it hard to do business. Likewise, evolving threats may shift domains week to week or even day to day. Couple updated email filters with built-in visual warnings so that when employees open emails from outside the company (even if they look like they come from inside the company), they will get a heads up. 
 
<p>Additionally, using DMARC policies and DKIM signatures can help authenticate emails between organizations, but they aren’t foolproof.</p>
 
 Implement Multi-Factor Authentication or Passwordless Systems: If hackers seek to get login credentials, make it difficult to use those credentials. While a system of usernames and passwords or PINs is vulnerable to phishing, strong MFA that includes biometrics is much more difficult to compromise even with a phishing attack. 
 
<p>Even better, a passwordless system can almost eliminate the risk of a system breach from a phishing attack, including BEC.</p>

<p>The first step to solid phishing and BEC prevention is strong authentication. While strengthening security around system access is a no-brainer in the best situations, it also eliminates one of the attack surfaces that phishers count on—easily exploitable password systems.</p>
<p>1Kosmos BlockID provides that kind of authentication. With passwordless identity verification, identity management, biometrics, and decentralized, user-friendly interfaces.</p>
<p>1Kosmos provides the following features to help support strong authentication and security:</p>
 
 Identity Proofing: BlockID includes Identity Assurance Level 2 (NIST 800-63A IAL2), detects fraudulent or duplicate identities, and establishes or reestablishes credential verification. 
 Identity-Based Authentication Orchestration: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and validation. 
 SIM Binding: The BlockID application uses SMS verification, identity proofing, and SIM card authentication to create solid, robust, and secure device authentication from any employee’s phone. 
 Integration with Secure MFA: BlockID readily integrates with a standard-based API to operating systems, applications, and MFA infrastructure at AAL2. BlockID is also FIDO2 certified, protecting against attacks that attempt to circumvent multi-factor authentication. 
 Cloud-Native Architecture: Flexible and scalable cloud architecture makes it simple to build applications using our standard API, including private blockchains. 
 Privacy by Design: 1Kosmos protects personally identifiable information in a private blockchain and encrypts digital identities in secure enclaves only accessible through advanced biometric verification.

<p><a href="https://artifacts.ai/?post_type=post&amp;p=2606">Over the last 10 &nbsp;</a>months we’ve been busy working with our partners in the Lieberman Lab at the University of Notre Dame (UND) and their Distributed Pharmaceutical Analytical Laboratory group (DPAL) to develop a platform for conducting verification and reporting of drug APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) and safety.&nbsp; Our goal has been to develop a proof of concept and confirm that it can be deployed at scale. During this project, we <a href="https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/230">published a paper</a> with our friends and colleagues at DPAL about this innovation. And we were also invited by the National Science Foundation to submit a proposal to <a href="https://seedfund.nsf.gov/">America’s Seed Fund</a> based on our results. Let’s take a deeper look into what all of this means.</p>
 The current landscape 
<p>When we began working with the Lieberman Lab and its DPAL network of international collaborators, we knew that they were tackling a big, global problem. This has only been made more clear as we delve further into it. An estimated 10% to 30% of essential medicines are substandard in developing regions, and this problem has been exacerbated as the effects of COVID and the war in Ukraine continue to be felt. </p>
<p>Currently, a lot of time, effort, and resources are being directed at the physical tracking of products as they move through the supply chain . While this is useful – and important – monitoring of a pill’s journey from A to C via B, it doesn’t check the drug’s contents – specifically the active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). This is the critical gap we are addressing, through the combination of science and technology, by building a system that can be integrated at any and all points across the pharmaceutical supply chain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We are supporting the scientific research our partners at UND and DPAL conduct by providing a platform for the extension of their work across many more medicines and nations. Through this work, we have confirmed unmet needs in the market for a service that uniquely combines science with technology to report trusted data on medicine quality and safety. </p>
 Achievements so far and next steps 
<p>In a short time, we’ve made huge leaps forward with our partners to improve drug verification and reporting. These include: </p>
 
 Applying rapid, iterative design-development-testing-feedback methodology to achieve impressive results enabling us to stand up a platform for live use within our ambitious timeframe. 
 Connecting participants engaged in collaborative and rigorous scientific workflow processes that span multiple laboratories, continents, and institutions including field labs, universities, and national public health regulatory authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Demonstrating success securing provenance and chain of custody of drug APIs necessary for proving the validity of scientific findings for use by regulatory authorities, and supply chain participants, and healthcare providers in rooting out substandard or falsified products from the marketplace.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Having demonstrated a successful proof of concept, our system is now being licensed and introduced for active use by the DPAL community. DPAL will expand its use further to report on a broader range of essential medicines, which include generics and biologics. </p>
 Introducing ARTiFACTS Verify  
<p>This pilot has not only proved our ability to move at scale and speed, but also confirmed a market need for a novel service which fills a significant gap in the supply chain infrastructure. We are delighted to announce our newest product, ARTiFACTS Verify – the drug verification SaaS platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify combines innovative application of scientific processes with technology to provide an information platform that delivers trusted and actionable data for identifying and reducing the prevalence of substandard or falsified drugs in the market. Verify will sit alongside our current offering for researchers, now known as ARTiFACTS File.</p>
<p>Verify is relevant for those in your organization engaged in assuring supplies meet quality and therapeutic requirements. Verify can strengthen your safety programs wherever your teams are producing, distributing, or purchasing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals. To learn more about Verify and explore its value for you and your teams, please <a href="mailto:info@artifacts.ai">get in touch</a>. </p>

<p>As we prepare for the upcoming launch of OceanONDA V4, we are announcing new initiatives to accelerate the adoption of Ocean as the orchestration layer for web3 data sharing and monetization. Before moving forward, we need to take care of unfinished business. This blog post has two sections geared towards publishers, stakers and datatoken holders.</p>  Airdrops for Ocean&nbsp;V3  Pool Share Lock for OceanONDA V4  <p>Airdrops for Ocean&nbsp;V3</p><p>When Ocean V3 was launched in October 2020, it was immediately apparent that there were asymmetries between publishers, datatoken holders and stakers. For the past 18 months, we’ve worked to re-architect core components of the Ocean Protocol to make it safe for everyone.</p><p>We’re very happy with the involvement and support from the Ocean community. Many of you published datasets, acquired datatokens and staked them in pools. Some of you were able to make nice gains by leveraging the dynamics of the Balancer AMMs. Others weren’t so lucky and lost $OCEAN staked due to the dynamics of the AMM design. We fixed these problems in OceanONDA V4 and look forward to safe staking for everyone moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>But we also want to make sure that everyone that participated in Ocean V3 can come out ahead, not only with learnings but also financially. So as a token of thanks, we’re going to airdrop any token address that experienced a loss while publishing, staking or acquiring datatokens as of 25.5.2022. What follows is our plan for airdrops.</p><p>Ocean V3&nbsp;Airdrops</p>  Stakers: Every staker will end up with a gain of at least 100 $OCEAN. For any address that experienced a loss, you’ll get an&nbsp;airdrop.  Datatoken Acquiror: Reimbursement of the current datatoken value and a 50% bonus on-top, paid in&nbsp;$OCEAN.  Publisher: Every publisher will be airdropped respectively 1,000 $mOCEAN for datasets published on ETH and 500 $mOCEAN for datasets published on other&nbsp;chains.  <p>Airdrops will be deposited in your address as $mOCEAN on the Polygon&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want to understand the methodology we used to calculate the airdrops, go to the bottom of this blog&nbsp;post.</p><p>Pool Share Lock for OceanONDA V4</p><p>Over 500 datasets were published in the Ocean Market. With the launch of OceanONDA, we are asking LPs (publishers and stakers) to lock your pool shares into the Ocean V4 migration smart contract.</p><p>Pools with greater than 500 $OCEAN&nbsp;Reserve</p><p>Given the high gas prices on Ethereum, we are asking you to lock your pool shares for each pool which has more than 500 $OCEAN in reserve. As a thank you for locking your pool shares, you will receive a 10% bonus on the locked&nbsp;amount.</p><p>There are 36 datasets that meet the minimum threshold of $OCEAN reserve (see below for the list of eligible&nbsp;assets).</p><p>For the eligible assets, we are asking LPs to lock their pool shares starting now, 25.5.2022 at 10:00 UTC. You need to lock pool shares for each pool that you might have injected liquidity into.</p><p>Please expect that locking your pool shares will cost approximately $5–15 USD in gas&nbsp;fees.</p><p>The Ocean V3 to OceanONDA V4 pool share lock process will run until 15.6.2022 at 10:00 UTC. Any LP that did not lock their pool shares by this cutoff time will still be able to withdraw their stake using the smart contract directly and will not receive any bonus. If you choose to interact with the smart contract, instructions will be provided after 15.6.2022.</p><p>Pools with less than 500 $OCEAN&nbsp;Reserve</p><p>For pools with less than 500 $OCEAN in reserve, no action is required and datatoken holders will be compensated for the amount&nbsp;staked.</p><p>Migration Day 15.6.2022</p><p>On 15.6.22, all pool shares and datatokens will be burned, and airdrops will be sent to stakers, datatoken holders and publisher addresses in the Polygon&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you published, staked or acquired datatokens, please check your addresses for any credits and bonuses on or around 15.6.2022 by using either <a href="https://polygonscan.com/">https://polygonscan.com/</a> or the wallet of your&nbsp;choice.</p><p>Snapshots of all stakers, datatoken holders and publishers were made on 25.5.2022 at 07:00&nbsp;UTC.</p><p>Any changes to the liquidity pool or datatoken value from this time forward will not be taken into consideration for the&nbsp;airdrop.</p><p>Further, Publish, Add/Remove liquidity, and Swaps are now disabled on the Ocean Market until the launch of OceanONDA V4.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who joined the Ocean V3 phase. Anyone that participated will be fully compensated for participating, learning and getting familiar with Ocean&nbsp;V3.</p><p>OceanONDAV4 is almost here. Look out for the announcements and programs that are going to be kicked off in the coming weeks to accelerate an open Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Ocean V3 Airdrops Methodology</p><p>Airdrop for Participation in Ocean&nbsp;V3</p>  For each pool, the number of $OCEAN deposited and withdrawn per address was&nbsp;recorded  Some addresses participated in more than one pool. Thus, the $OCEAN deposited vs withdrawn for each address was calculated to get a total view of gains/losses per&nbsp;address.  In total — 2/3rds of stakers came out with less $OCEAN than they entered with. 1/3rd came out with&nbsp;more;  When gas fees were taken into consideration, an approximately 200 addresses saw net&nbsp;losses;  Anyone who had a cumulative loss or had a profit less than 100 $OCEAN will receive an airdrop. An airdrop for participation will be at least 100 $OCEAN but it could be up to the total amount $OCEAN lost plus a 10%&nbsp;bonus;  Addresses that came out with a profit greater than 100 $OCEAN, after gas fees — well-played, congratulations. You made a profit, figured out the dynamics and you won — no participation airdrop for&nbsp;you;  Approximately 2,250 addresses that are staked will get an airdrop totalling 6M&nbsp;$OCEAN.  <p>Airdrop for Locking Pool&nbsp;Shares</p>  For all stakers that lock their pool shares, an additional 10% bonus airdrop on the locked amount will be airdropped;  The amount airdropped is determined by the number and amount of pool shares locked between now and 15.6.2022.  <p>Airdrops to your addresses will show up on the Polygon network (<a href="https://polygonscan.com/">https://polygonscan.com/</a>). Be sure to check your address on or after 15.6.2022.</p><p>Datatoken Acquirors</p>  An extract of all datatoken holders was generated;  Active datasets with existing datatoken reserves and pool shares were identified;  Addresses with reimbursement amount less than 50 $OCEAN worth of datatokens were eliminated, as the gas fees needed to reimburse exceeds the amount to be reimbursed;  Active datasets with less than 500 $OCEAN as a reserve were also eliminated, as the gas fees needed to reimburse exceeds the amount to be reimbursed;  The remaining addresses, where datatokens are worth more than 50 $OCEAN and the pool has greater than 500 $OCEAN reserve, will receive an&nbsp;airdrop.  <p>In summary, 75 addresses that acquired datatokens will get an airdrop totalling around 100k&nbsp;$OCEAN.</p><p>Note: Publishers were able to mint datatokens for only the price of gas so they will not get any airdrop for minted datatokens.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1527355908908621825?s=20&amp;t=SGqBdu_xzxQXriK-__fBew">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “The history of blockchain development”. On May 22, 2010, a programmer bought a pizza with 10,000 bitcoins. Later, May 22 became the “pizza festival” for the blockchain industry. Ontology community members recalled the original intention of joining the blockchain industry.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion led by Benny, an Asian community Harbinger. He shared the key reasons why decentralized identity (DID) has become the underlying foundation for dApps to integrate, emphasizing the importance and necessity of protecting user identities and data security. He also discussed with community members “how Ontology promote the Web3 development team to build innovative applications based on DID technology”.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology has launched the framework upgrade which saw additional enhancements to ONT ID’s product suite, as well as some important upgrades, including the upgrade of Mercury, a secure, trustless, DID based peer-to-peer communication protocol. There are also additional upgrades being made to ONT Login, the trustless universal authenticator, and ONT TAG, Ontology’s Trust Anchor Gateway, providing easier integration of decentralized identity solutions for Web2 and Web3 application developers.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Cointelegraph — “<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-loss-of-privacy-why-we-must-fight-for-a-decentralized-future">The loss of privacy: Why we must fight for a decentralized future</a>”</p><p>“With time and distance no longer problematic in the internet age, Big Tech’s drive toward centralization is less surprising. Can we be astonished by the horrific results of attention-grabbing algorithms, such as attempted genocides or political manipulation based on psychometric analysis of user data? Centralization has consequences. Distributed ledger technology provides a practical alternative. Social media, messaging, streaming, searching and data-sharing on the blockchain can be fairer, more transparent and accessible, and less centralized. Conversely, this does not mean data has to be less private.”</p><p>Decentralization is not an accident of historical development, but a necessity. Decentralized identity (DID) is an important part of this development. The mature decentralized identity framework ONT ID, built by Ontology, truly guarantees the security of privacy by returning the autonomy of identity construction and data storage to users. Users can choose to sell part of their data, or users can gain higher status and rights in society by accumulating reputation.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

In this article, we take a detailed look at topics and individual statements that have been discussed in the media in recent times. In doing so, we examine more closely whether SSI can increase or reduce risks for data misuse in certain cases. We conclude with the core thesis that the misuse of personal data will remain possible regardless of the digital identity used – and how one can still protect oneself against data misuse&nbsp;with the help SSI. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Data Abuse &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom stands behind better digital identity solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First things first: SSI alone does not increase the risk of data being misused. Due to its architecture, it opens up opportunities to increase data security and privacy. The greatest risk lies in the fact that user data is passed on to an online service and then stored there. Today we all know this only too well as a user profile or account. From the moment I enter my details on a platform online, I have to trust that the service protects its database well and keeps my data safe from attacks by hackers and identity thieves. Unfortunately, experience shows that in the end, hackers are often successful and thousands of profiles and accounts fall into the hands of data thieves each day. This can become an absolute nightmare for those affected and motivates us at Jolocom to work on better digital identity solutions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>So we have two options, either we don’t give the services any more data or we force them to secure the data better. Of course, it would be best to do both: to transfer less data, and at the same time to create better data security. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Login – Continuous onboarding &nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to save less data with services and still be able to fully use what they offer, there is a great possibility offered by SSI that ensures that I have my data completely under control. The concept is called continuous onboarding and means that the profile data is retransmitted every time I log in (in the case of car sharing, for example, my relevant driver’s license data, my IBAN and billing address). As soon as the user logs out (and has parked the car again), the service can delete their data and only keep an individual code for itself, with which it recognizes the user on the next visit. Admittedly, one is dependent on the service actually deleting the data, but there are many incentives to do so, because the risk of a hacking attack with serious consequences decreases enormously. And not to forget, if something changes for one user (e.g. the telephone number), the service will be notified about this change via continuous onboarding the moment the user next logs into the service. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With SSI, data can be shared with one click, without any additional effort. Today, the process of continuous onboarding described above would be practically impossible, since the data would have to be entered manually for every visit, and even the driver’s license or ID would have to be confirmed by video. This is a complex process and unattractive for both sides. With SSI, data can be shared with one click, without any additional effort. The service also saves a lot of money due to this reduced risk, which is yet another reason to work with SSI. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it will not work entirely without regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as we can use SSI to help services stop storing data about us, there’s no guarantee they won’t. Regulation is the only way to ensure that they do not request more data from us than is necessary. Because in the situation in which we as individual users negotiate with the services, we often have less leverage. We want to use the service and the only way to do so is accepting their terms, whether justified or not. In a digital world in which we practically cannot do without many services, this is like blackmail. We are often at the mercy of data misuse and have to watch how we are either excluded from society or how our data is used for participation in the digital life. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom positions itself against data trading and tracking. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there already is a very promising legal situation in Europe. Because the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) sets clear limits on what can be demanded of users. Most recently, the Digital Markets Act was passed, which again strengthened the rights to services. While it’s true that SSI comes from liberal thinking, that doesn’t mean our European version of SSI should be completely unregulated. Do we just have to wait for regulation? However, such a regulation for SSI can also be implemented in very concrete terms even before the legislature acts, in that the actors involved in an SSI ecosystem give themselves common rules and determine the means to enforce them. The whole thing is called the Trust Framework. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In an SSI ecosystem, it can be restricted which data can be queried from the user and by whom. The Verifier must then clearly justify what happens to that data and is bound by the Trust Framework. We at Jolocom are also working on these trust frameworks as part of the BMWK (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klima) showcase projects and are supporting the development of eIDAS 2.0 in Brussels, a new regulation in which similar questions are addressed. In fact, eIDAS can be understood as a kind of European trust framework. The electronic identity card is already one of them today and in the near future, very likely, self-sovereign identity will be too. &nbsp;</p>



<p>To put it bluntly, one could say that with SSI you can only decide who you give your data to and by what means, but not what happens to it. However, that is a lot compared to the status quo. What happens to the data is then a new question and not a technical one. Then it is about the trust framework and the implementation of policies. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the whole thing has to be regulated via certification and approval. &nbsp;</p>



<p>While it is true that SSI comes from liberal thinking, that doesn’t mean our European version of SSI should be completely unregulated. In any case, in the medium term it can be assumed that only wallets that are also approved/certified in a trust framework and only speak to issuers and verifiers who are also approved can assert themselves on the market. The SSI system is not responsible for poorly secured databases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Does self-sovereign identity mean that I can decide everything for myself? &nbsp;</p>



<p>The idea that as a user of SSI I have complete sovereignty over my digital identity is often misunderstood. At its core, SSI is about my digital identity being under my own control, so I can decide to whom I show my data, when, and for what. This important principle is already contained in the first article on SSI by Christopher Allen from 2016. With SSI I can also create identity data about myself and, for example, claim to be an astronaut. But at the latest when I want to board a space shuttle with this identity, I would be exposed. In reality, we construct our identity primarily from what others say about us. Our identity card is only appreciated because it was issued by the state and a sovereign authority confirms my identity. It is similar with a student ID, which is only credible if it was issued by the university. &nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello. And today, our guest is a very special guest – it’s Aaron Painter, and he is the CEO of Nametag, the company who invented “Sign in with ID” as a more secure alternative to passwords. He is the former Vice President and General Manager of Microsoft China, Hong Kong, and Brazil as well as best-selling author of LOYAL, where he describes his key to leadership: fostering a culture of listening.</p>
<p>Hello, Aaron.</p>
<p>Aaron Painter: Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a pleasure talking with you.</p>
<p>Aaron: Thank you. It’s an honour to be here. I love the show. I learn so much from each episode so it’s really a privilege to be on.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Definitely, super interesting, the conversation we’re going to have actually about a topic we have not talked before in this show is the metaverse. So, let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. And of course, we first want to hear about our guest, so what was your journey to come to this world of identity?</p>
<p>Aaron: My journey was really growing up in technology. I spent about 14 years at Microsoft, started in Redmond near Seattle. And then the rest of my career was outside the US. I spent four years in France, two-and-a-half years in Brazil, five-and-a-half years in China, mostly doing international development, working with large customers of Microsoft’s, partnerships, helping Microsoft expand into new geographies. I loved it. I got to experience so many different people and cultures around the world.</p>
<p>I left and then went to run a cloud computing consultancy firm based in the UK called Cloudreach for a couple of years. And I left in December of 2019, just before the pandemic. That’s where it all started.</p>
<p>Oscar: Since when you started in identity, already in your work in Microsoft, you start entering, immersing yourself in this world of identity, or it came much, much more recently?</p>
<p>Aaron: Identity came to me much more recently. And it was because so many customers that I was working with at Microsoft and later at Cloudreach were fascinated with security. Increasingly, everyone had a question of how do I help protect my infrastructure? How do I make sure I’m speaking to the right customers, that I’m speaking to the right employees, that I’m hiring people, and the people that I hire are the ones accessing the network and accessing my services? But for me, the real start of it was much more personal.</p>
<p>And at the start of the pandemic, I had several friends and family members, mainly in the US at that point, who had their identity stolen. And I tried to help them recover. And I said, “Alright, let’s do this together. Let’s, you know, let’s call customer support. Let’s try and have some conversations and figure out how we can get things back on track for you.” And everyone we spoke with, to me felt like sort of the Dark Ages. It was the opposite of what I had learned and experienced in China where you could do almost anything from your mobile phone.</p>
<p>But in the context of – particularly in the US at that point – validating who you were when you’re on the phone with someone in customer support or trying to log into an account, people had no idea. They were using antiquated methods to try and validate a person. And almost every conversation resulted in “Well, why don’t you come see me in person? Or why don’t you come into the branch?” But it was the pandemic, everything was closed. There was no branch to go to. There was no office to go to. And that’s when I realised that this problem of identity was paramount in what we’re trying to solve in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that makes sense – I heard some stories like the one you just said that. Personally, or someone very close, got compromised, lost their identity, how to recover was one of these realisations that yeah, this is a big problem, it is a big problem. So fantastic, knowing you are working now in the world of authentication, identity verification.</p>
<p>And I know because you just have a quick chat before this conversation that your services you are offering to companies who are entering into this, I don’t know how new we could say but a new, sounds exciting world of the metaverse. The metaverse, I guess we’ll have several metaverses, right, in the future. If you can start telling us what is the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: Yeah. The metaverse has certainly grown in popularity in the last couple of years, probably most notably with Facebook rebranding their overall corporate brand as Meta has sort of a commitment from that organization that the metaverse really stands for the future. You know, other organisations like Microsoft have been very vocal and feeling like they’re able to create kind of a metaverse or a virtual community in the business world or in the enterprise.</p>
<p>And ideally, over time, it’ll be a place where people can interact in a virtual way, which oddly sounds similar to some of what we do today, right? We interact often, you might think of video game platforms as metaverse-like environments today where people spend their time, they interact, they make new friends, they play, they speak, they chat, and they build relationships with other people.</p>
<p>The metaverse ideally will provide more and more compute power, richer experiences and ways for people to build those relationships in new ways. And even richer technologies, perhaps things like holographic, 3D, augmented reality, wearing glasses, a whole bunch of richer ways to make those interactions seem more real life or more human.</p>
<p>For me, though, one of the scariest things about the metaverse is that we are inheriting a problem that we haven’t really solved in today’s world. And that’s this concept of how you trust someone online or over the phone or in a virtual or digital context. The history of identity to me gets really fascinating, because when you think about it in a physical world, you know, governments have mostly gotten pretty good at identifying their citizens.</p>
<p>I’d like to say, more so in developed markets, and… but you go to examples like India, or China and India with Aadhaar, and their digital identity programme to bring so many citizens into that realm of being recognised and identified. There’s been radical progress. But it wasn’t always that way. And if you go back hundreds of years, even in Europe, somebody would go somewhere new into a new territory, and they weren’t recognised. First, people would give them a letter or an attestation, saying, “Yes, this person is… I vouch for them.”</p>
<p>Eventually– maybe that was a king or some kind of leader. Eventually, that became a passport as we think of it in the modern form. So that when someone went somewhere new in the physical space, you could say this person can be trusted, because they have been identified, someone has gone through a process to make sure that they are who they claim to be.</p>
<p>And in the digital world, and then particularly in the metaverse, as you take that to the next level, we haven’t found a way to carry that over. In today’s online world, the closest thing we have to a passport is really a password. And a password is just not the same thing. You know, in the early days of computing, it was a smaller group. It was a more trusted community when networked computers started coming together, and you sort of knew who someone was based on the way they identified themselves, maybe it was an email address identified to an academic or a government institution, a password protected that account. But it wasn’t the same as a passport.</p>
<p>And as the ecosystem of the online world has gotten so big and encompasses so many people now, I would argue we have not as a society or as an industry come up with a solution yet that allows someone to be recognised and to keep their account protected. When you take that into the metaverse, it gets even worse.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, indeed, it’s a problem that yeah, your company, my company, many, many people are working on that. It’s a problem still being solved as you said. And how do you envision when people are already on the metaverse? So, what will be, I don’t know if the ideal or how do you think… Today there’s already some metaverse, right? But it’s based mostly on a Discord account or, yeah, whatever we have today, right? How do you think it’s going to be when the metaverse has become more popular, more people inside, how – yeah, how do you envision?</p>
<p>Aaron: What I’ve realised as I’ve dug so much into this space is that we often fall back on kind of the least secure method, particularly when things go wrong. So, if you take a parallel world and Web 3.0, separate from Metaverse slightly, but you think of NFTs, for example, you go and buy an NFT because it’s someone’s digital work of art, which is a wonderful thing. And it’s a great way to give creators the ability to express themselves through new means and to protect the ownership of what they create. But the creator in that sense is often identified by a Twitter handle, right? So, this person is selling me this NFT they created and you might go look them up on Twitter and see if their handle is the same on Twitter as it is as how they identify themselves in the NFT. And if they have a profile, and they posted some things, you say, “Oh, that must be the creator.”</p>
<p>And unfortunately, that doesn’t work. The least common denominator in that case is Twitter. And as we know in recent discussions alone, we don’t really know who people are on Twitter. Some celebrities or certain government officials might have a verified badge and maybe we trust that, but the vast majority of folks on Twitter, we don’t actually know who they are. Yet when you take that as the underlying framework of identifying someone and carry it into things like NFTs the problem gets even more challenging.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. That illustrates what you say, that the problem from the Web 2.0 is coming to the metaverse. And what do you think could be a solution for that? Have you heard from standards that will – or the same standards that are now in the Web 2.0 will come to the metaverse, what do you think is going to happen?</p>
<p>Aaron: Well, most of what we’re seeing in the metaverse today is identifying people based on their crypto wallet. You know, our wallet address, you can have as many wallets as you want. You can have them with different providers. And your wallet in a Web 3.0 or crypto-based environment is often like an email address, meaning just like a Gmail account, you can go spin up a new one and be identified by that. That’s how people typically identify themselves in this kind of Web 3.0 environment.</p>
<p>Other Metaverse communities, depending on who’s kind of running them will default back on whatever their method of authentication is. So, if you think of it in Microsoft context, let’s say, it might be your Xbox gamertag, and you take your Xbox gamertag and carry that in, or your username or handle on Roblox, or similar on kind of a gaming platform. All these concepts are sort of pseudonyms, the ability to operate by a username of some kind that recognises who you are.</p>
<p>My premise, though, is that safe communities know their members. It’s OK to operate by a pseudonym, or to have an alias when you’re in one of these environments. But I think that the platforms have a responsibility to know the authentic identity of the person behind it. Because when they do, it creates a deterrent for people to misbehave, to conduct themselves poorly, or, frankly, to be able to disappear and come back under yet another account.</p>
<p>I believe that platforms need to know the real identity of their users. A lot like, let’s say, you go to an event, and you walk into the room and there’s someone checking you before you walk in and they say, “OK, can I see your government-issued ID maybe? Can I see the invitation that you’ve got?” If so, they give you, coincidentally, a nametag that you might wear and you walk into that room, and then you know that the people in that room have all sort of been vetted. And they are who they say they are and the nametag that they’re wearing is accurate.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you board an airplane, they don’t ask you for your email address, they don’t ask you for your wallet address from your crypto account. They ask you for a government-issued ID. And with that, they allow you to come inside. And in theory, the area inside that airport is kind of a secure and a safe zone.</p>
<p>In the digital world, it’s the same thing. Platforms have a responsibility, in my opinion, to know the identity of the people that enter so that they can create a safe community where people can operate by pseudonyms or aliases or other things.</p>
<p>Oscar: So, it’s going to be, clearly, it’s going to be the platform is the one that run the metaverse’s big responsibility, as you are explaining pretty well, to have some sort of vetting or verification of the identity of people who are inside.</p>
<p>And another thing is, there will be several metaverses, right? You mentioned, I think you mentioned Microsoft as well, Facebook, there will be let’s say Disney, yeah, the gaming companies, so that there will be ultimately several metaverses who are somehow isolated, the same way Twitter is isolated from Facebook, for instance. And there might be of course a benefit that one person could go from one metaverse to another. So, what do you think– how do you envision that? Will it be possible that if I have one account in one metaverse, should I be able to come to the other one with my assets? And how do you think this could happen?</p>
<p>Aaron: Again I think is sort of a situation we haven’t fully solved well in Web 2.0, in the current environment. You can use your email address and go from place to place. And you might have a different username or an alias, let’s say on Twitter versus Reddit versus, you know, maybe even a dating platform, each of them have their own way of creating a sense of community, allowing you maybe to have a slightly different username or profile.</p>
<p>But again, the challenge we have in today’s world is that you don’t necessarily know who’s underlying that. You don’t know the real identity of the person who’s actually underneath that pseudonym, or that alias. I feel like there’s a solution from what we see in the real world and the physical world, the offline world, which is that of using someone’s government-issued ID. And some of the things as you know, we’ve talked about or you’ve spoken with others on this podcast, allow people to take their government-issued ID and put it into a digital context.</p>
<p>The most basic might be a, you know, scan your government ID, do a selfie, do we match these two things? More advanced might be new methods of using blockchain technologies to understand the raw certificate and where someone’s identity was issued, or from whom. All those things matter but I would argue there is a way to take something that’s consistent like your government-issued ID and make it pervasive so that you can use it across different platforms.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, so you think that the government-issued identities, like passports, should be part of this identity solution for the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: Yes, but what’s fascinating to me is today that’s where things often break down. Again, going to kind of the lowest common denominator, because the closest that people do with that today is sort of one-time ID verification. And typically it happens in financial services, typically with some sort of financial regulatory requirement like KYC, Know Your Customer, right? Where you might say, in order to open this bank account, I need you to scan your ID so that the bank can validate that you are the person maybe that you come from a certain nationality that allows with anti-money laundering laws or other things. The bank might check the box, OK, they’ve done that.</p>
<p>But then every other time you interact with the bank, they don’t use that anymore. They default to then asking you a password or PIN code or security questions. Maybe they’ve added things like multi-factor authentication to make your PIN code more secure, your password more secure, so they send you an SMS, or they asked you to set up an authenticator app. But those processes become disconnected.</p>
<p>And what typically happens then is when someone is not able to get into their account, because let’s say they lost their phone, they were locked out, their account password was compromised, they don’t remember the complicated answer to a credit check security question. Then they’re back on the phone with customer support, trying to get back into their account. And we fall to the lowest common denominator of that poor customer service agent who was trying their best to essentially be an identity detective and ask the person all these different questions, the best they can to guess, is this person who they say they are in order to reset access to their account?</p>
<p>And that becomes the weakest line of defence. That’s where typically in today’s world, accounts get penetrated. It’s where account takeovers happen. It’s where accounts are compromised. And as we all know, if somebody can be you, if they can impersonate you, they essentially can take over access to your digital assets.</p>
<p>Oscar: Often when we talk about identity, we think of identity of people, most of them. Most of the use cases go in that direction. But of course, there’s also identity of companies, organisations, more broadly speaking. So, with someone who is on the metaverse, there will be of course company, there will be business, you can buy something, or you could be able to buy even well-known brands should be– I guess they will be in the metaverse, so you can buy a property, right, real estate. How do you deal with these businesses, how they would prove their identity in the metaverse?</p>
<p>Aaron: We’re seeing growth and you’re absolutely right, different metaverse communities, Decentraland probably being a popular example, where brands are putting up shops. They are purchasing real estate, so to speak. And they’re putting up virtual storefronts as a way to make their brand known in new environments. And that’s an exciting development, that makes a lot of sense. It’s great for brand outreach for people that are engaging in those platforms to be able to see those brands.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, though, we run into the same kind of know your business, or the business-to-business same identity challenges that again, you talked about with so many on this podcast, where it’s difficult to know the authenticity of the of the brand, partly because we don’t know the identity of the individuals behind the brand. And so, if we haven’t solved the way to know who people are, when they’re interacting with platforms, or in a digital way or over the internet, it makes it even harder to link those individuals to brands to be able to trust that those brands are authentic.</p>
<p>And so, I think one of the first steps in solving for business is solving for the individual. If we can identify individuals in a consistent and secure way, we can then link those identities to business entities. And we can have a greater sense of confidence, is this business the one that we think is who they’re purporting to be on a platform?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, proving the identity of the individuals first, the ones who are behind the… yeah, those businesses that we could see on the metaverse. So, have you been yourself exploring them, some metaverses already?</p>
<p>Aaron: We have. You know, they’re so interesting right now, because we have a lot of new companies that are starting up trying to build metaverses as kind of the next generation of really building online communities. And a lot of them were fascinated with this concept of building trust. In fact, some of the newer upstarts that we’ve been working with that are kind of all getting ready to launch are very focused on building trust in their community in a way that hasn’t been done in a Web 2.0 context. And they see this identity as a solution to that.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll give you one of the worst examples I think today, unfortunately, is dating. You know, the dating industry online today is kind of scary. You know, you sign up with a username. Sometimes it’s linked to a social account. I don’t personally do a lot on the dating app scene, but it is a very big area where we engage on the business side from Nametag today. Because someone shows up on a dating app, you’re starting to get to know that person, you’re going to go meet in person offline, which requires an enormous amount of trust.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, we hear these stories. You’ve seen the Netflix show on catfishing. And, you know, The Tinder Swindler, and all these sorts of activities, because we don’t authentically know, the dating platforms don’t authentically know the identity of the people that are on there. And so, it’s difficult to build trust with someone that you’re about to meet online, if you don’t really know or the platform doesn’t know who they are.</p>
<p>So in the metaverse, companies that are trying to think about building next generation experiences, have either been kind of in two camps, I would say. One, they’re extreme on anonymity. And unfortunately, their early environments have seen high cases of harassment and in many different forms and places where people don’t feel comfortable or welcome. And then we’ve seen, I think, a newer generation that we’ll see emerge more even in the coming months, where they’re putting a greater priority on knowing the identity of the people to create a safe space.</p>
<p>Oscar: Well, definitely, it’s interesting hearing from your experience already talking with companies who are building the metaverse that there is interest in having proper identification of people. So that’s definitely great to hear.</p>
<p>Aaron: Identity is everywhere. It’s why this podcast is such an exciting topic for all of your listeners. It’s such a pervasive concept that we see, you know, so many of you talking about it in opening bank accounts and financial services, but it’s so much more. And when you start to think a bit in environments where people want to build trust, particularly social environments, which is what the metaverse really represents, places where people can be social, over time, be professional, but grounded in knowing who that person is, as opposed to just kind of making virtual friends that might be real. They might be human. They might be who they claim to be, or they might not be. I’m deeply optimistic that we can create this metaverse environment or the next generation of the internet or Web 3.0 with a greater sense of authenticity behind people to create safer and more trusted spaces.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely. I think we will do that. Well, very interesting conversation about the Metaverse and with your special view from working on Nametag. Finally, one question we asked all our guests is that for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Aaron: I’m very focused on this concept of kind of the weakest link. And I would encourage everyone listening to understand how their organisation responds when a customer, an employee, a user is locked out of their account and in need of support. All too often, the methods of getting them back in are the weakest link in their security posture. And I think we can improve that weakest link. We can make enormous strides in using identity to improve cybersecurity more broadly, both in the current Web 2.0 world and certainly as we move forward into the metaverse.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, thank you very much, Aaron. It was fantastic having this conversation with you. So, for people who would like to continue this conversation on the metaverse or anything identity, what are the best ways to get in touch with you?</p>
<p>Aaron: Check out our website at <a href="https://www.getnametag.com/">getnametag.com</a> or feel free to visit me on LinkedIn. We post a bunch of content and love engaging in discussion with people who are passionate on these topics.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Thanks a lot. Again, thanks for this conversation, Aaron. And all the best!</p>
<p>Aaron: Thank you, Oscar.</p>

 TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot Java REST API 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create a Spring Boot app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>https start.spring.io/starter.zip \
  bootVersion==2.6.7 \
  dependencies==web,oauth2-resource-server,native \
  packageName==com.okta.rest \
  name==spring-boot \
  type==maven-project \
  baseDir==spring-boot | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify <code>pom.xml</code> to use <code>tomcat-embed-programmatic</code> instead of the default Tomcat.</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-web&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;exclusions&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-core&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
        &lt;exclusion&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-websocket&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;/exclusion&gt;
    &lt;/exclusions&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.experimental&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-programmatic&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;${tomcat.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> class that returns the user’s information: [<code>sb-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.security.Principal;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Configure the app to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server by adding the issuer to <code>application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure JWT authentication: [<code>securityconfig</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(request -&gt; request.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Spring Boot REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw spring-boot:run 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test your API with an access token.</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a native Spring Boot App 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Spring Boot app into a native executable using the <code>native</code> profile:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw package -Pnative 
 
 
 






To build a native app and a Docker container, use the Spring Boot Maven plugin and <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code>.



 
 
 
<p>Start your Spring Boot app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/demo 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it with HTTPie and an access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps startup 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

The remaining 51.25%(512,500,000 MMUI) has been reserved for various purposes such as MetaMUI Treasury, Team, and Marketing/Operations.</p><p>Until 2021, the total supply was 1,000,000,000 MMUI, but our team had conducted a coin swap process during 2021. The migration was from the ERC20 MUI to MMUI, and there were 15,403,071.526791 MMUI coins unswapped, which were burned from the total coin sales amount(487,500,000 MMUI) eternally. Currently, the total supply is 984,596,928.473209 MMUI&nbsp;coins.</p>Total Supply of&nbsp;MMUIMetaMUI Coin&nbsp;Metrics<p>(Please click the link below if you’d like to see the article about the burning event: <a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-5-0-is-now-live-coin-burn-completed-7ed96b74234a">https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/metamui-5-0-is-now-live-coin-burn-completed-7ed96b74234a</a>)</p><p>Here are charts of the reserved supply, total coin sales, and circulating supply of MMUI&nbsp;Coin.</p>Reserved Supply of&nbsp;MMUI<p>The total reserved MMUI for the company is 512,500,000 MMUI. Only 12,500,000 MMUI coins(for Marketing/Operations) are circulating among the reserved coins. The 12,500,000 MMUI coins will be used for expanding the MMUI business and its ecosystem.</p>Total Sales of&nbsp;MMUI<p>482,750,000 MMUI Coins were sold during all the sales phases; as mentioned above, 15,403,071.526791 MMUI coins have burned among all the coin sales amounts.

The MetaMUI team has met and discussed with dozens of Central Banks worldwide during many CBDC conferences and official events. We’ve received numerous proposals from the Central Banks to show our CBDC demo online and offline, and our development team will present the demo to some Central Banks this week. Our development team is also upgrading our blockchain into a new version, and many new features will be updated on the MetaMUI SSID App in a few weeks. Please join our social channels at the bottom of this article if you want to know more about MetaMUI and upcoming&nbsp;news.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions truly. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings. Its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. MetaMUI has created a new identity-based CBDC system by combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism. It can protect users’ privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML), and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cardea.app">Cardea Community</a> at Linux Foundation Public Health is pleased to announce the third Interop-a-thon on June 16, between 8:00am and 12:00pm MST (UTC-7:00). Anyone building a Hyperledger Aries compatible product or system can sign up <a href="https://forms.gle/CQLRFRr4NexLoCf36">here</a>.</p>
<p>So what is an Interop-a-thon? The clue is in “interop.” We all want verifiable credential solutions to be interoperable because interoperability means adoption, scale, and ultimately, a network of network effects, as credentials are used across multiple networks.</p>
<p>An Interop-a-thon is an opportunity for companies and organizations building on the Hyperledger Indy and Aries codebases to come together and test their solutions against each other and against a reference implementation (Cardea). They can even bring their own networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also the fastest way to find out if you have any bugs in your build and fix them.</p>
<p>We held the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rYj_RaK0Pi4kGEz3X2Hc0iATi1tzywDNz7SOnK0Hn6c/edit?usp=sharing">first Cardea Interop-a-thon in 2021</a>, testing the core schemas, agents, and interactions key to the Cardea workflow. Everyone who participated found it really valuable and asked us when we’d be hosting the next…</p>
<p>…And so the<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZOSIs-Ncj02hyWfo-NOLEqQDS5U9KNzBXroq09FM0PY/edit?usp=sharing"> second Interop-a-thon was held in February 2022</a>. Participants could do the same testing as in the first but also test out of band invitations and a simple version of machine readable governance, a way to manage governance rules on information flows at the agent level which provides all kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>While the first Interop-a-thon was very much focused on sharing and verifying health credentials, Interop-a-thon II was a signal that these events had much more general relevance to the developer community, the out of band protocol in particular, as it was a chance to get ahead of a significant change to the Aries codebase.</p>
<p>For Interop-a-thon III, we’ll be testing all of the above and both a basic message protocol and a Q&amp;A protocol.</p>
<p>We urge anyone developing a Hyperledger Aries solution to join. These events enable you to quickly ascertain what isn’t working, fix it, and help to accelerate development and deployment. The more interoperable solutions deployed, the more decentralized identity wins!</p>

<p>Today’s small-to-mid-sized business (SMB) is evolving alongside the wider changes sweeping across finance, society and the workforce. While it’s still possible to run a successful business using traditional methods of capital access, customer acquisition, cost management and a myriad of other considerations, digital apps and services give business owners the greatest advantage. More and more, consumers are adopting open banking tools to spend, save and manage. SMBs are increasingly embracing digital platforms, apps and services in order to create the experiences that today’s consumers expect, and to thrive in a fast-paced competitive environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The supply chain and pandemic-related inflationary pressures of the last two years have caused a host of issues for business owners. According to Mastercard’s new <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking-sme/">Rise of Open Banking Small Business study</a>, rising costs and new methods of customer acquisition, talent acquisition and capital access are all front-of-mind for the SMB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has led to an encouraging trend: SMB owners have been quick to adopt digital tools to fund, manage and promote their businesses. Nine in 10 owners consider themselves heavy fintech users for both personal and business needs. Some other key findings from the research:</p>
 
 Eighty percent started using digital channels for loans in the past two years. 
 Eighty-four percent say technology makes them feel more confident when applying for a business loan.&nbsp; 
 Sixty-four percent have received a business loan through digital channels.&nbsp; 
 
<p>These digital adoption numbers are higher than consumer numbers. SMB owners are forward-thinking. They’re quicker to adopt better solutions, and they’re accustomed to adapting to market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Transformation is Meeting Small Business Challenges Head-On 
<p>The pandemic of 2020 changed how businesses operate, accelerating a trend toward digitization that was already gaining steam. Banking, finance, investing, saving and spending have all gone more digital, enhancing the convenience and functionality of mobile and online apps and services. Doing business <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20workers%20say%20they,closed%20or%20unavailable%20to%20them.">from home</a> and “on the go” is becoming the norm, and open banking is the foundation for the next-gen innovative financial tools that both consumers and businesses use every day. Small business owners are taking advantage of this transition, leveraging heavy use of fintech innovations to raise their financial IQ.</p>
<p>While business owners are learning as they adapt and adjust to uncertain and ever-changing norms, the Rise of Open Banking study shows that there are a few concerns at the top of their minds on a daily basis.</p>
 
 Inflation. Keeping up with rising costs is the number one stressor for SMBs. With price hikes at <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/11/cpi-april-2022.html">40-year highs</a>, businesses are having to find creative solutions to maintain sustainable profit margins. Forty-seven percent of owners cited rising costs as their number one problem. Consumer-facing industries like restaurants and retail face even more pressure, with over 50% of owners saying that inflation is their top issue. 
 New Customer Acquisition. Thirty-nine percent of SMB owners said that reaching new customers was their biggest pain point. Professional services businesses were more urgent about new customers, with 49% of owners saying it’s a continual concern for them.&nbsp; 
 Hiring Skilled Employees. Pandemic-related restrictions and social trends like “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/10/-the-great-resignation-has-changed-the-workplace-for-good-.html">The Great Resignation</a>” changed the employment landscape quickly and drastically. Thirty-five percent of employers are having trouble navigating the new dynamics of a workforce that has a strong preference to work-from-home. Doctors (42%) and farmers (44%) struggle even more to find the hires they need, as do many businesses that require employees to be in-store or in-office.&nbsp; 
 Managing Operations. Twenty-seven percent of owners said that efficient tools and systems to manage their businesses and business finances were a top issue. 
 
 Open Banking Innovations add Speed, Efficiency and Personalization to Banking and Financial Services 
<p>A full 85% of business owners are looking for faster, easier access to capital, creating a clear opportunity to partner with them for customized, agile funding solutions. The number one financial tool that SMBs rely on is business credit cards, but 81% are more interested in a loan that’s tailored to their business’s specific needs. Sixty-two percent of small businesses rely on loans as a lifeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Payments are at the heart of SMB digital use cases. To streamline the customer journey, owners rely on open banking, embracing digital wallets, cryptocurrency and other new fintech tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting accounts to manage business finances provides the opportunity to give personalized insights. It also adds convenience for SMB owners looking for a streamlined way to tackle critical business tasks like banking, invoicing, paying bills and managing cash flow.</p>
 SMB Open Banking Adoption is Strong 
<p>Owners are using open banking innovations to improve their financial fitness. They are creating more seamless operations within their businesses by using intelligent open banking tools that manage the complexities of daily data flow for them. Linking accounts, making payments, getting paid, banking and accounting are just a few of the crucial tasks that are becoming quicker, smarter and more secure through digitization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners are linking their financial accounts to take advantage of new apps and services. Eighty-eight percent are using open banking data to better manage their operations. Eighty-five percent are looking for the customized recommendations that can come from the analytics and machine learning that can be applied to owner-permissioned data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feeding intelligent, rich data into financial management tools is giving businesses the edge they need to grow and adapt, in this era of rapid change. They’re improving their financial health and decision making, while automating tasks and saving precious time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paying and getting paid is quicker and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evolution of banking and financial services is here, and SMB owners are embracing it. This is the first in a Rise of Open Banking series of blogs, where we’ll take a deep dive into some of the solutions powered by open banking for the SMB that is going digital.</p>

Explain what a Verifiable Credential is and what makes it verifiable.  Learn what Decentralized Identifiers are and how they work with Verifiable Credentials and Blockchain.  Discover the two important privacy-preserving techniques employed by Verifiable Credentials.  Understand what the blockchain is and what exactly is recorded on the blockchain when you're using it for identity management.    The 3 models of Identity Management    Transcript ⬇️   <p>To understand how decentralized identity works, it's important to look at what's currently happening and what has happened in the past so we can understand why people in this Decentralized Identity or Self-Sovereign Identity space, as it's also called, are so excited about what this new technology can bring.</p> Centralized <p>So what we have today is a centralized model where we, as users, sign up for an online service, often using something like email and password to create an account. But when we go to another online service, we have to go through the same process again, create another account, and so on. The user ends up with many passwords and credentials that they need to manage.</p><p>And as we're all told, all passwords should be different for security reasons. So that creates a bit of a user experience headache and a potential security risk. We've got all of these different passwords, and if we're not using password managers, we're probably reusing the same passwords for all these different accounts.</p> Federated <p>To try and solve this UX problem, we moved to a Federated model.&nbsp;</p><p>You might have seen this when you go to a site, and you can reuse login credentials that you've created with other companies. For example, Login with Facebook or Sign up with Google. Federated models like these remove some of the user experience headaches because they reduce the number of credentials a user needs to manage.</p><p>But a Federated model also erodes user privacy. When logging in to a website using your Google account, that service can see your behaviour online outside of their platforms. What other services are users accessing? When are they accessing them? That is eroding your Privacy. And, of course, these companies' business model is often based on knowing more about you and then selling that knowledge to advertisers. Or giving advertisers access to you based on your preferences and how you behave online.</p><p>Having companies that are highly motivated to know more about you and then can monetize that data is a very dangerous mix.</p> Decentralized Identity Management <p>Then we moved into the decentralized model. In this model, only the user manages and stores their credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credentials are not stored on centralized databases. They are kept with the user, typically in a digital wallet.&nbsp;</p><p>The users can then use those credentials, those digital identities, to access other systems. All the while, they are retaining control over their credentials. The users decide who gets access to their data and what parts of it they access.</p><p>The user can also attach different attestations, or what we'd also call claims, to those identities. We'll get further into this later when we discuss Verifiable Credentials.</p>    What are Verifiable Credentials?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Verifiable Credentials are digital representations of achievements, claims, licenses, permits, university degrees, etc. They're effectively credentials, but they are verifiable. A third party can check these credentials and know with certainty who issued the Credential and to whom they issued it.</p><p>This immediate verification is very powerful and, of course, very necessary online.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, all our credentials were physical. When we went for a job interview, we would potentially take a physical copy of our achievements, passport or ID document to the meeting. This is how we used to present our credentials and prove things about ourselves.</p><p>In recent years, things have rapidly moved online, and now we need digital and highly portable credentials. We need to be able to take them with us. But with digital credentials comes the problem of forgeries and tampering.</p><p>How do you know that a digital PDF document, for example, hasn't been photoshopped with a different name, photo or achievement title?&nbsp;</p><p>The need for credentials that can be verified will increase the further our lives go into the online world.&nbsp;</p><p>That's what Verifiable Credentials are for.</p>    What makes a credential verifiable?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Verifiable credentials are credentials that can be verified. What does that mean? With Verifiable Credentials, you take all the data you want to present as your credentials - your name, degree name, birthday, for example - and digitally sign it.</p><p>What does it mean to digitally sign something?</p><p>When a University is issuing you a Credential, they take all the information they want the Credential to contain and pass it through a very complex cryptographic algorithm. That produces a cryptographic hash. A hash is a long string of numbers and letters.</p><p>This hash is "deterministic". If you always make the same data go in, you'll always get the same hash out. But if you make any changes to the data that goes in, the hash that comes out will be different. If someone changes the name or date on a credential in the university example, the hash will be different.</p><p>Because of that, we can very quickly verify that the data in a credential hasn't been changed.&nbsp;</p><p>When someone presents a credential to a Verifier, the Verifier runs that cryptographic algorithm and can verify if the hash is the same. Verifiable Credentials allow you to start using cryptographic methods and algorithms to prove that the data hadn't changed from what it was when it was originally issued.</p><p>A Verifier can always know if the data was modified, which provides excellent protection against fraud and forgeries.</p>    What are Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>A Decentralized Identifier, or DID, is an identifier that belongs to you. It's like an ID, like your employer or student ID, and you can have more than one.</p><p>But the big difference is this: the University gives you your Student ID. You generate the Decentralized Identifier for yourself. You own it, and you control it.</p><p>When you use Dock to create your DID, that DID is written on the Dock blockchain. It becomes your representation on the blockchain. It's recorded forever there and can't be changed.&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that this DID has no personal details about you. A DID is a string of "crazy" characters, not meaningful to anyone when they see it.</p> Cryptography and DIDs <p>With Decentralized Identifiers come keys.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two different types of keys: the Public Key and the Private Key.</p><p>Here's an analogy to explain how these two keys work: You sometimes receive a "valet key" when you buy a car. So you'll have your regular key, which gives you full access to the car, the trunk, the glove box, everything like that. But then you can also have a valet key, which is a key that you can give to the garage, a hotel that has valet service, etc.</p><p>The valet key gives them access to open the door and start the car, but it doesn't give them access to the trunk or the glove box. So they only have restricted access with that key.&nbsp;</p><p>Private and Public Keys are sort of like that. The Private Key would be like the key that gives you full access to the whole car. And the Public Key would be like the valet key that provides you partial access to things.</p><p>You never share your Private Key! You never share your master key to the car.</p><p>So what happens is when an Issuer issues you a Credential, they use their Private Key to sign that Credential. Like they could sign it with their pen and ink, they can sign it digitally using these keys. This signing process uses advanced cryptographic math to produce a hash value.</p><p>After signing the Credential with that Private Key, that master key, the Issuer sends the Credential to the Holder.</p><p>When the Holder wants to present it, whoever verifies it can know who the Issuer was. The Verifier goes to the blockchain, gets the Public Key from the Issuer's Decentralized Identifier on the blockchain, and uses that Public Key to verify that the Credential was indeed cryptographically signed by the Issuer.</p><p>This is how Decentralized Identifiers come into play with Verifiable Credentials. That signing is the proof of authenticity. Like the rubber stamp from the olden days, the wax seal on the King's letter that proves the King sent it.</p>  An example of a DID created using Dock  <br>What is a blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>The blockchain is effectively just a public ledger or a public kind of storage of all transactions between several parties.&nbsp;</p><p>All data is available publicly or through a block explorer if it's a public blockchain. You can also have private blockchains, where only entities that have been granted permission can read it or write on it.</p><p>A blockchain is also immutable, and the transactions registered on it in the past cannot be removed or changed. As a result, you have this audit trail that all the parties can trust.</p>    Who created the blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>Blockchain technology was effectively shipped in early 2009. You have probably heard of Bitcoin by now, so that was when blockchain was available. The whitepaper for Bitcoin, which was called a "peer to peer electronic cash system", was published in 2008.</p><p>As the lore goes, no one knows which people or "peoples" worked on it. It was authored by a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto, and Satoshi's identity remains unknown.</p><p>Interestingly, the original concept of something similar to what we now know as a blockchain goes back a long time. One cryptographer called David Chaum designed a blockchain-like protocol. It's not exactly how it is today, but he put the idea forward in his 1982 dissertation called "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups".&nbsp;</p><p>People have been trying to work out how to make a blockchain or a decentralized ledger system for a while, but it really came into being in 2009.</p>    Why was blockchain created?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>At the highest possible level, blockchain was trying to solve the issue of having parties process transactions without using a trusted central intermediary.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, in a bank transaction, you would have a bank in the middle who you would trust to debit and credit your account correctly. If you're transacting with a third party, you would again be trusting the bank as an intermediary to process the payments as you ask them to. What Bitcoin was solving through blockchain was the ability for peers to transact without the central intermediary.</p><p>So, for example, if we sent you some bitcoin, you would receive it pretty quickly compared to how international Swift payments are. Only we would know about it, and the transaction fees would be minimal because there's no intermediary involved. So that's the main problem that they initially set out to solve.&nbsp;</p><p>With blockchain, they were also able to solve the double-spend problem. You obviously can't double-spend physical cash. If I have a ten Euro note and pay a shopkeeper with it, he now has the ten euro note. I can't spend that twice because I can't clone it, reproduce it, and give it to someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>But with an electronic cash system that has no intermediary guaranteeing that an account is credited and the other is debited, how do you stop that digital currency from being spent twice? And so, a big problem that Bitcoin and blockchain solved was the ability for digital cash not to be spent multiple times, to only be spent once.</p>    3 actors in the ecosystem - Issuers, Holders and Verifiers    Transcript ⬇️   <p>There are three main actors involved in the Decentralized Identity ecosystem.</p>  The Issuer: someone who is sending out the credentials.  The Holder: someone who is receiving a credential.  The Verifier: someone who verifies a piece of information contained in a credential.  <p>If we use the example of a University degree, the Issuer would be the University.</p><p>The University would issue that degree, that Credential, to the second actor, which is the Holder. The Holder is essentially a student. And then you have a third actor, which is a Verifier. For example, a future employer.</p><p>Their interaction would look like this: The University has a public identity (a Decentralized Identifier and an associated Public Key) on the blockchain. They would also publish that identity (and Public Key) somewhere - their website, for example - to allow people to find out what it is. Because of cryptography, everyone knows that only the University can issue a Credential from that public identity and respective Public Key. Only the University would know the Private Key corresponding to the Public one.</p><p>The University then issues a Credential to the student, the Holder, and they can store it in their digital wallets.</p><p>When the student finishes the University course and decides that they want to seek employment, the possible employer, a Verifier, would ask the student to send them a presentation of a Credential. This presentation would prove that the student is qualified or sufficiently qualified as they claim to be for the job.&nbsp;</p><p>The employer would receive a digital presentation of the Credential, digitally signed by the Issuer and the Holder. So the Verifier can then know with certainty who issued the Credential and to whom they issued it.</p> Anchoring <p>Aside from who issued it and who it was issued to, a Verifier can also know when a credential was issued. For that to happen, the Issuer needs to Anchor the Credential.</p><p>Anchoring is like putting a timestamp on a blockchain.</p><p>Note that the Credential itself - its contents, the Holder's identity, the qualifications achieved, et cetera - are not put on the blockchain. All that personal data is only stored by the individual in their wallet. This maintains privacy and security for users while allowing Issuers and Verifiers to guarantee that this digital document has not been tampered with and has not been forged.</p><p>Anchoring merely puts a hash of the Credential on the blockchain.</p>    Benefits of using Verifiable Credentials    Transcript ⬇️   <p>The benefits of using Verifiable Credentials depend upon who you are.&nbsp;</p><p>For an issuer - a University, for example - the benefit is offering their students a new, portable, and tamper-resistant documentation of their achievements. This is not possible with the current paper-based credentials.</p><p>Verifiers also have significant benefits. Let us look into the employer example. In many cases, employers spend money hiring companies that do identity and background verification.</p><p>An employer can remove that cost with Verifiable Credentials because they can instantly verify the credentials by checking their digital signatures. They don't have to phone or email the University or contact an overworked administrator to confirm if "John Smith" did get a medical degree during a specific year.&nbsp;</p><p>An employer can "look" at the Credential and know if John did or didn't. That's a very powerful thing, and it saves a lot of time. Some of those Credential verification processes can take several days, which can really slow up recruitment. Recruitment is super fast-paced, particularly in certain industries, and losing those few days can often cost you an applicant, which can be tough.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there's a lot of money involved in having your team manually verify credentials. Verifiable Credentials remove those processes.</p><p>On the credential holders' side, individuals are getting control over their credentials and their data. When they need to prove that they have a degree, they don't have to contact the University to get the certificate. Or request a duplicate if they lost it. Individuals will have their credentials in a convenient digital wallet on their computer or smart device, and they can quickly send this Verifiable Presentation to a Verifier. Knowing that when it's received on the other end, the person verifying that Credential can quickly confirm it's legit.</p><p>The entire experience gives much more control to the credential holder and speeds up any verification process as well.</p><p>Another significant benefit is Privacy. There's very minimal information that's actually on the blockchain. The actual contents of the Credential - whether that's a driver's licence, a degree certificate or some other form of identity - are held and stored by the holder in their digital wallets.&nbsp;</p><p>The users' data is not stored on a centralized database that serves as a honeypot for hackers.</p>    Why Verifiable Credentials are private-by-design    Transcript ⬇️   <p>You control and own Verifiable Credentials. You're the one that possesses them at all times, and you have control over who sees its contents. That's the first reason.</p><p>With Verifiable Credentials, you can also do Selective Disclosure. When you present your credential for verification, you can choose a specific part of that credential to share.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, someone wants to know how old you are. You can choose your "Birth Certificate Credential" but only share the birthdate attribute from that credential. They don't need to know anything else about you. They don't need to know where you were born or what country it was. All they need to know is that your birthdate proves your age. So you can limit how much information you share with whoever is asking you to verify things. Selective Disclosure is a great feature to increase your Privacy.</p><p>There's also a next step beyond that. You want to prove you have a certain age, but you don't want to give people your actual birthdate. You just want to say, "I am over 21, or I am over 18. Can I vote?". Whatever the situation might be. You can do that using Zero-Knowledge Proofs in what we call Anonymous Credentials. These allow you to build up a proof to say, "Yes, I have whatever you're asking for", but without revealing the data that supports that proof.</p><p>Let's use a voting example. Michael Scott needs to be 18 to vote. So when he arrives at the poll, the people managing the poll would say, "Prove to me you're over 18". Michael could give them a credential that proves it, but he doesn't want the person sitting there to know exactly how old he is, just that he's over 18.&nbsp;</p><p>Using Anonymous Credentials and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Michael generates a cryptographic proof that verifies that he meets their standard based on whatever they asked for. In our example: that he's over 18, and he does this without showing them his age or birthday.</p><p>If he's not over 18, they will get a "failure proof" that says, "No, he's not over 18".</p>    In Identity Management, data goes on the Blockchain?    Transcript ⬇️   <p>People are often concerned about what is stored on the blockchain. This is for a good reason. Blockchains are publicly readable, so you want to be careful what information you put on there.</p><p>In the Verifiable Credentials world, we don't actually put the full Credential onto the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Verifiable Credentials are verifiable without storing their data on the blockchain. Verifiable Credentials are verified through their DIDs and Public Keys.</p> Schemas <p>When you're designing a Credential - for example, if you're a University - you're deciding what a degree looks like and what fields should be included. It has got a date, a name, a place, the University name, and a degree name. All that is what we call a Schema. You can think of it as a template in your Word or text processing software.</p><p>The schema defines what fields are required for the Verifiable Credential, and that definition can be stored on the blockchain.</p> Expiration and Revocation Registries <p>Many times, Verifiable Credentials are only meant to last a short amount of time.</p><p>For example, in some countries, Driver's Licenses have to be renewed every few years. So the government would issue a Driver's License Credential, and that Credential can have an expiration date. That expiration date can be built into your Credential.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let's say you got into too many car accidents or did something that made the government decide to take away your Driver's License. The government would use the Revocation Registry for that.</p><p>On the blockchain, there's a Revocation Registry, which lists all the credentials that have been revoked. So if an Issuer decides that the Credential they gave you is no longer valid, or they want to take away that Credential from you, they would write to the blockchain that "this credential is no longer valid".&nbsp;</p><p>The Revocation Registry is a registry of IDs that contains no personal information, but that is checked whenever a Verifier wants to verify a credential.&nbsp;</p><p>After verifying that a valid issuer issued the Credential and that it passed all the cryptographic tests, the Verifier goes to the Revocation Registry to check if the Credential was revoked.&nbsp;</p> Anchoring <p>An Issuer can also choose to Anchor a credential to the blockchain to effectively timestamp it.</p><p>Anchoring stores one of those cryptographic hashes on the blockchain.</p><p>As we've explained before about hashes, if you rerun the same cryptographic algorithm later with the same input data, you should get the exact string back that matches the one on the blockchain.</p><p>Note that there's nothing personally identifiable in it. None of your personal information - date of birth, address, etc. - is written to the blockchain. Just cryptographic hashes are.</p>    How to create a Decentralized Identifier and issue a Verifiable Credential  <p>Create a DID and issue a Verifiable Credential for free using <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a>.

 Executive Director at Germany’s Financial Authority BaFin Calls out for Innovative EU-wide DeFi&nbsp;Rules  Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority BaFin called for innovative EU-wide regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/Kurzkommentare_BaFinTech2022/fa_bj_2203_Kurzkommentar_Rodolphe.html">a blog post</a> that was published on BaFin’s&nbsp;website. <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- Birgit Rodolphe, Executive Director at German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), mentions in a recently published blog post on BaFin’s website that unregulated DeFi space is putting consumers at&nbsp;risk.</blockquote><blockquote>- She believes that EU-wide regulation for DeFi is the only way to protect European consumers from the&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>- Citing Germany’s “Crypto Custody License” as an attractive crypto regulation, Birgit says that the EU should enact similar laws for decentralized finance.</blockquote><p>The European economic powerhouse Germany is known for its positive outlook toward digital assets due to various measures that the German authorities took to regulate virtual assets in the country. Thus, it has been topping the list of most crypto-friendly countries globally for a while now, as evidenced by the more recent report prepared by crypto exchange Kucoin which placed Germany as the first of 46 countries.</p><p>Recently, Birgit Rodolphe, Executive Director at Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority BaFin (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), called for innovative EU-wide regulations for decentralized finance (DeFi) in <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/DE/Fachartikel/2022/Kurzkommentare_BaFinTech2022/fa_bj_2203_Kurzkommentar_Rodolphe.html">a blog post</a> that was published on BaFin’s&nbsp;website.</p><p>Citing Germany’s crypto custody license as a positive and innovative approach toward digital assets, Birgit states that the European Union must also enact similarly attractive regulations for virtual assets. She reasoned that European consumers are at risk from the unregulated, decentralized finance&nbsp;space.</p><p>Looking at the share of DeFi hacks in all the crypto hacks that took place in 2021, it’s clear that Rodolphe is right about consumers losing millions due to “technical issues, hacks, and fraudulent activity” due to unregulated DeFi space. For instance, in 2021 alone, 76% of hacks in the cryptocurrency industry were from the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p><p>Thus, Rodolphe believes that the only way to mitigate these risks is to adopt innovative yet attractive decentralized finance regulations. She explains that EU-wide rules for the decentralized finance space will also ensure the nascent DeFi isn’t fragmented.</p><p>Although Rodolphe wants the European Union to draft attractive regulations for the DeFi space, she disapproves of the notion that the DeFi industry is all virtuous. She further points out that just because decentralized finance is based on new-age technologies, it cannot absolve the industry from playing by the rules and following the law of the&nbsp;land.</p><p>We knew that sooner or later, governments around the world would regulate the digital assets market. After all, the growth that the digital assets space experienced in the last couple of years made this nascent industry too large to continue operating without regulatory oversight. Thus, Shyft Network was built to enable multiple use-cases including the secure and privacy preserving infrastructure for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to swiftly adjust to the new reality where they will have to comply with digital asset regulations.</p><p>Take the Travel Rule, for instance. Currently, it is among the hottest topics among the regulators, and we already know DeFi is next. Shyft has got you covered. The Shyft Network is ideally positioned to support the growing presence of regulation in crypto in a way that protects user privacy and prevents the centralization of critical information.</p><p>So, visit <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">our website</a> to learn how Shyft can help you comply with the Travel Rule.

 Your StarkWare Account’s Security now available on&nbsp;Web2 As the wave for self-custodiality gathers momentum, Web2 applications can now allow users to use their StarkWare identities as an authentication mechanism. About StarkWare: <p>StarkWare develops STARK-based solutions for the blockchain industry.</p><p>StarkEx, is a standalone permissioned scaling engine that already powers few of the biggest applications such as dYdX, Sorare, Immutable, DiversiFi and&nbsp;Celer.</p><p>StarkNet is a decentralized permissionless STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup over Ethereum, that supports general-computation based on the Cairo language.</p> What is the StarkWare Curve and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>An account on any blockchain can be thought of as an identity that persists across applications on a blockchain. Ethereum has two account&nbsp;types:</p><p>Externally-owned accounts (EOAs) which can be controlled by anyone who holds the private&nbsp;keys</p><p>Contract — a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by&nbsp;code.</p><p>All accounts in StarkNet are abstract accounts enabled by contracts.</p><p>Token Transfers in Abstract Accounts work as follows&nbsp;:</p><p>- If someone sends a token to your account, they interact with the token contract to change the recorded owner from their address to your&nbsp;address.</p><p>- The contract then performs a check that the identity that made the transfer is recorded as the current owner of the&nbsp;token.</p><p>With abstract accounts, the address is what matters and not the signature.</p><p>A StarkNet user will still have an address that can be shared publicly so that someone can send a token to that address. The user still has a wallet with private keys that are used to sign transactions. The difference is that the address will be a contract. The contract can contain any&nbsp;code.</p> An Account Design on StarkWare <p>- A&nbsp;owner</p><p>- Verification of ownership using a STARK signature, Ethereum Signature, or simply a key&nbsp;pair.</p><p>- The ECDSA Signature algorithm using the native StarkNet&nbsp;curve.</p><p>For higher efficiency, the Public key for StarkNet must be produced from the private key using a curve that is different from the Ethereum curve. This is where the STARK curve enters the&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Why Does the Ecosystem Need a Sign-in With StarkWare?</p><p>Almost everybody in crypto knows the importance of self-custodiality by now. To a large extent, Web3, led by behemoths such as StarkWare has managed to do what for long seemed unimaginable — shifting the dynamic of ownership from large entities to the end-user. When we say ownership, we mean ownership of your assets, your data, and even your identity. It is impossible to deny that traditional Web2 entities have done a fantastic job in making the user experience incredibly intuitive and consequently onboarding humanity onto the Web. However, it has also come at a cost — the cost of privacy and security.</p><p>Security hacks even among the biggest names in cybersecurity are increasingly and scaringly common. Of course, the ads one is exposed to on a daily basis on their device should be testimony to the fact that there is excessive tracking and monetization of the users’ activity. Today, the average user is fed-up with these compromises and has major trust issues. Do check our recent <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/introducing-the-auth-network-b8fab1b5e1f6">announcement about the Auth Network</a> and its roadmap to address this&nbsp;problem.</p><p>When the Ethereum Foundation announced Sign-in With Ethereum(SIWE), it was only a matter of time until somebody extended SIWE to other&nbsp;chains.</p> Sign-in With StarkWare — You Own Your&nbsp;Identity <p>Right since its inception, the Web3Auth team has always been committed to making self-custodiality mainstream and after a series of announcements in this direction over the last few weeks, we are happy to share another milestone — Sign-In with StarkWare.</p> What is Sign-In with StarkWare and what does it&nbsp;solve? <p>Sign-in with StarkWare brings in the trust-free security of on-chain authentication to Web 2 which means that starting today, any user can log in to a Web2 application simply using their StarkWare account.</p> What Problem Does Sign-in With StarkWare Solve? <p>Additionally, Sign-In With StarkWare solves the following:</p> For Developers: <p>Ease of use: Our <a href="https://siwst.web3auth.io/">documentation</a> will show you, step by step, how to build a Log in with StarkWare flow and also clearly outline how to get the Login with StarkWare flow working, end-to-end. Do also check our demo website&nbsp;<a href="https://demo-siwst.web3auth.io/">here</a></p><p>Web3Auth Authentication suite: With Web3Auth, you can build secure, low-friction, self-custodial authentication flows for both Web2 and Web3 users with a single authentication provider. A single integration can fully support all users whether a user wants to log in with a Social account, their FaceID, Passwordless or their crypto wallet and a wide suite of authentication tools provided by&nbsp;us.</p><p>For the User: Sign in with StarkWare allows any Web2 application to authenticate users with their Web3 identities thereby bringing the security and privacy of Web3 authentication to Web2 for the&nbsp;user.</p><p>Today, there are multiple blockchain platforms and thus naturally, there arises a need to have a standard specification for authentication with Web3 identities. This led to the birth of <a href="https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/master/CAIPs/caip-74.md">CAIP-74</a> which allows for creating a chain-agnostic Object Capability (CACAO), based on a signing message as an IPLD object. Sign in with StarkWare endeavours to maintain compatibility with CAIP-74, thereby adhering to a chain agnostic standard.</p> Coming Soon… <p>We are pleased to see how rapidly the entire Web3 ecosystem is developing with the launch of new protocols and dApps every day. We will continue to lead the way in servicing authentication needs for the ecosystem retaining self-custodial principles of blockchain technology.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/sign-in-with-starkware-711d48f2dbbd">Sign-in With StarkWare</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Jolocom’s role is to empower everyone and everything capable of having a self-sovereign identity to freely communicate and share information with each other. Based on this principle, our company was founded back in 2014. While a lot has changed since then, our mission still remains the same. Read the full story of why Joachim Lohkamp decided to found Jolocom as a decentralized identity company <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/jolocom-who-owns-and-controls-your-data-effc7bc02ee8">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On our 8th birthday, we are grateful to look back on milestones, developments, and challenges that we have overcome. Beyond the tech, we believe in the importance of community and building a space for individuals and companies that are committed to the values of decentralization. We are happy to share our story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We especially and sincerely thank all of our partners, communities, advisors and individuals who have been contributing to what Jolocom is today.</p>



 2015-2016 



<p>These years saw the development of our first lightweight wallet, Little Sister (the opposite to Big Brother), the decentralized identity Wallet, library, and protocol. It was during this time (January 2016) that we joined the <a href="http://agile-iot.eu/">Agile Horizon 2020 project</a> to provide a trusted data sharing provider using SOLID and Ethereum for IoT devices. Want to learn more about our early work with Horizon 2020 and our tech of the day? <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/trusted-data-sharing-with-social-linked-data-solid-and-ethereum-in-the-internet-of-things-iot-7dc242944624">Check here</a>.</p>



 2017 



<p>As cannot be stressed often enough, we strongly believe in the spirit of community and are thus proud to work with a bunch of partners that inspire and motivate us further. Some of those include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Deutsche Telekom, T-Labs and Riddle&amp;Code to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WeCggqdNOGE">a fully decentralized emobility ecosystem</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Bundesblock, of which Joachim was an intitator and founding member, and with whom we authored the first of its kind <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/a-universal-identity-layer-we-can-only-build-together-e297ed5ae4ed">Self-Sovereign Identity Position Paper #SSIPaper</a>, with many leaders from the SSI space&nbsp;  Stad Antwerpen, the Flemish government innovation procurement department, and Digipolis to bring <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/blockchain-on-the-move-2722b467e31e">decentralized identity services to municipal employees and citizens in Flanders</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  INATBA, the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications, of which Kai is a <a href="https://stories.jolocom.com/inatba-advancing-blockchain-across-europe-706417d6f5d5">Board Member</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>For more information on who we are working with, visit our<a href="https://jolocom.io/partners/"> partners page</a>.</p>



 2018 



<p>Jolocom released its <a href="https://jolocom.io/resources/">technical whitepaper</a>, a comprehensive introduction to the Jolocom Protocol for digital identity. Those principles also found their way into our next edition of the SmartWallet (replacing the alpha version from March 2017), which was released in March 2018, running on our decentralized identity protocol. </p>







<p>Furthermore, we joined <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/bringing-self-sovereign-identity-to-flemish-citizens/">the “Blockchain on the Move” Project</a>, partnering with the Flemish government, the goal being to return control over their identity data back to citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



Kai presenting Jolocom’s SSI solution at Trefdag Digitaal Vlaanderen (29.11.2018)



 2019&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>One of our principles is that of interoperability. To apply it in practice, we took part in an interoperability focused proof of concept. The scope of the project was to achieve interoperability across a multistep use case, called OSIP 2.0. In the same year, we had the pleasure of traveling to the headquarters of Deutsche Telekom in Bonn for the official launch of Xride. This fully decentralized e-mobility pilot was initiated by T-Labs and built in collaboration with Riddle &amp; Code, Bundesdruckerei, Simple Mobility, and Jolocom. Find out more about our role in this project <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/xride/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Started in 2014, the DWeb community took off in February 2019 and soon formed a thriving network of Nodes with Jolocom as the leader of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/dweb-berlin/">DWebBLN Node</a> (formerly Digital Identity Meetups Berlin).&nbsp;</p>



One of the past DWebBLN in person events.



 2020&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Starting the new decade right, Jolocom participated as SSI technology provider in 4 of 11 competing regional showcase projects developing ecosystem solutions. The Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten (SDI) innovation competition was funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economics Affairs and Energy. Eventually, our projects <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas/">ONCE</a>, <a href="https://www.sdika.de/">SDIKA</a>, and <a href="https://id-ideal.de/">ID-IDEAL</a> were selected for a three year implementation phase. The SDI projects are special because they bring a broad and diverse group of stakeholders to the table who are working together to kick-start an ecosystem for decentralized identities. Interoperability is at their core, so that the use of digital identification does not remain inefficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



The scope of SDI



<p>Furthermore, the Jolocom SmartWallet passed a GDPR compliance audit, a major milestone to becoming fully <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/production-ready-smartwallet/">production-ready</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 2021&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>In spring we began the implementation phase for the project ONCE, followed by ID-Ideal in the summer of 2021. In the initial phase, the projects focused extensively on the development, implementation and integration of the technical components. Soon, however, the implementation of first use cases from the areas of public administration, mobility and tourism will come to the fore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, Jolocom pulled off a great number of project implementations. The focus here is of course on SSI. But Jolocom has also been able to acquire a lot of knowledge through active work in the field of technology or in networks of various bodies (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA) and consortia (e.g. Essif-Labs, SDI lighthouse projects). All that, in turn, helped to build out our core solution stack.&nbsp;</p>







<p>A great example is the ConDIDi project, where Jolocom built a use case for decentralized conference participant management together with the TIB Leibniz in Hannover, which can be tried out <a href="https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tech developments and projects with Jolocom are constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To Jolocom the community matters, and we believe that core protocols need to be shared to enable an open infrastructure. This is why Jolocom implemented two essential building blocks for SSI <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/jolocoms-contributions-to-dif/">(DIDCommv2 and KERI) in Rust, and donated them to DIF</a> (Decentralized Identity Foundation).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, Jolocom implemented the <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/Stacks-did-method/blob/main/README.md">did:stack:v2</a> for Stacks Foundation. Jolocom’s SSI integration for Stacks addresses the issue of properly verifiable and secure information from different parties.&nbsp;</p>



 2022&nbsp; 



<p>The year has started by launching the Jolocom Agent to further compliment the full Jolocom end-to-end solution. The Agent is for creating, issuing and managing verifiable credentials and define, perform and manage verifications. The Agent provides a Graphical User Interface for ease of use and rapidly bulding out your use case. An APIs is avalilable for a seemless integration in your backend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course much more has happened. A good way of keeping track of our progress, partnerships, community and more is getting <a href="https://jolocom.io/about/#newsletter">the monthly Jolocom’s SSI Digest</a> in your inbox.&nbsp;</p>



<a href="https://jolocom.io/about/#newsletter">Sign up to SSI Digest</a>



<p>What’s next: beside the launch of multiple use cases in the second half of 2022, we are also working hard to ship the Jolocom SDK 2.0 to you. Stay tuned!</p>

				  Indicio takes the stress out of managing this essential upgrade with two new integration packages  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>To learn more about the DID:Indy Method—and why you need it—we invite you to join us on May 24th for the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/">Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a> where we will have code authors to talk you through the details and answer your questions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>The Hyperledger <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/">Indy DID Method</a> is a major step forward in interoperability. As Indicio’s CTO, Ken Ebert <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-completes-hyperledger-indy-did-method-a-milestone-in-the-evolution-of-decentralized-identity-network-interoperability/">put it</a>, “The Indy DID Method paves the way for Hyperledger Indy credentials to scale globally by allowing Indy networks to seamlessly interoperate and create a ‘network-of-networks’ effect.”</p>
<p>But this can only happen if all those currently using Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries update their operating systems, nodes, and agents to use the new Indy DID method.</p>
<p>We can’t overemphasize this enough: If you want interoperability between Indy networks, you really have to have this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These code changes build in the resolution of DIDs, schemas, and other ledger objects to the network which contains them.Without these code changes it is very difficult to support multiple networks.</p>
<p>We understand this can be a time consuming process and, in the case of upgrading agents, it could be a heavy lift. So why not let the authors of the code implement it for you?</p>
<p>Enter Indicio’s DID:Indy Integration Service Packages!</p>
<p>Two packages: One for agents and one for networks<br>Upgrading customer agents is the most complex part of the process and where you’ll benefit most from knowledgeable implementation. We’ll also provide all the training you need to use the new update.<br></p>
<p>Agent Package</p>
 
 Cloud Agent updates for issuers, verifiers, and holders 
 Mobile Agent updates for holders 
 
<p>We can also upgrade your networks if you want to save time—or you don’t have a network operations person to do this work for you.</p>
<p>Networks Package</p>
 
 Full network operating system updates 
 Node software updates for each running node 
 
<p>Again, the Indy DID Method is not an optional upgrade. It’s a major development that delivers interoperability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re here to make it simple and stress free.</p>

By the end of this conversation, you’ll know how sharding has evolved over time, why danksharding is possible, how proto-danksharding will get deployed, and so much more.</p> <p>------ 📣 ALCHEMIX | Get a self-repaying loan today! <a href="https://bankless.cc/Alchemix">https://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALED ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🏦 ALTO IRA | TAX-FREE CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA">https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👻 AAVE V3 | LEND &amp; BORROW CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/aave">https://bankless.cc/aave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️ LIDO | LIQUID ETH STAKING <a href="https://bankless.cc/lido">https://bankless.cc/lido</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | NANO S PLUS WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a>&nbsp;</p> <p> ------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro &amp; Danksharding Explained 7:00 Panelist’s Backgrounds 8:34 How Sharding Has Evolved 15:56 Why Danksharding is Possible 23:40 Proto-Danksharding 27:15 Data Availability 35:40 Data Availability Sampling 48:00 Cryptography for Noncryptographers 56:10 How Does All of This Get Deployed 1:00:05 The Big Open Questions in Sharding Land 1:05:30 Closing Thoughts</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Vitalik <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Dankrad <a href="https://twitter.com/dankrad">https://twitter.com/dankrad</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Protolambda <a href="https://twitter.com/protolambda">https://twitter.com/protolambda</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Tim Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko">https://twitter.com/TimBeiko</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Proto-Danksharding <a href="https://www.eip4844.com/">https://www.eip4844.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

<p>Over the last few weeks we’ve been asked about data security from places as far afield as Lithuania and Korea. As one journalist from Asia Business Daily asked us: “Security issues are paramount in MyData. How does Mydex manage customer&nbsp;privacy?</p><p>There is no single ‘magic bullet’ that can guarantee data security or customer privacy. Indeed, the belief that there is such a magic bullet (usually some techno-fix such as blockchain) is one of the biggest dangers. That’s because data security is about system-wide design, where many different elements need to fit together to create a working&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Mydex’s approach to data security is therefore multi-faceted and multi-levelled. It includes:</p>  Encryption: all data handled by Mydex is encrypted in motion and at&nbsp;rest.  Architecture: big, centralised databases holding records about millions of citizens attract hackers. With our infrastructure, each individual’s personal data store is separately encrypted. This means that to get a million records, hackers would have to conduct a million separate, successful hacks.  Operating procedures: Each individual holds their own private key to their personal data store. Mydex itself does not know or hold this key, so Mydex employees cannot see the data held by citizens in their personal data&nbsp;stores.  Business processes: We only work with known, reputable organisations that themselves work to the highest standards (e.g. government departments). To connect to our platform they have to agree to Terms and Conditions and Information Sharing Agreements with citizens designed to protect citizens’ privacy and&nbsp;data.  Citizen control: Citizens can easily see what data they are sharing with which organisations for what purposes, via their own Consent Dashboard. They can use this Dashboard to view ‘consent receipts’ that confirm their agreements with each organisation, and can change or revoke these permissions if they wish&nbsp;to.  External audit and accreditation: All our systems and processes are independently audited to international standards. We have held ISO 27001 accreditation for Information Security and Management for the last nine&nbsp;years.  <p>We don’t believe it’s possible to ensure data security without thinking through how the system as a whole works, looking at it from every angle: structure, incentives, governance, processes and, yes, technology.</p><p>With the way our current data economy works however, many necessary elements are either missing or badly designed — generating incentives that undermine rather than enhance data security for example. That’s why our current system is so insecure, and why there is so little trust in&nbsp;it.</p><p>There isn’t a magic bullet for ensuring data security and customer privacy. But there is a way of tackling the challenge so that robust, reliable ways forward are&nbsp;found.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/getting-data-security-right-36d291cac156">Getting Data Security Right</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>Use SDKMAN to install Java 17 with GraalVM</p>
 
 
 
 sdk install java 22.1.0.r17-grl 
 
 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 access token 
 
 
 
 
<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta apps create spa</code>. Set <code>oidcdebugger</code> as an app name and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger website</a>.</p>

<p>Set the access token as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM... 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Quarkus Java REST API 
 
 
 
 
<p>Use Maven to generate a new Quarkus app with JWT support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.9.0.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.rest \
    -DprojectArtifactId=quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.okta.rest.quarkus.HelloResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt,resteasy-reactive"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Edit <code>src/java/com/okta/rest/quarkus/HelloResource.java</code> and add user information to the <code>hello()</code> method: [<code>qk-hello</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;
import java.security.Principal;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Authenticated
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Principal userPrincipal = context.getUserPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>: [<code>qk-properties</code>]</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HelloResourceTest</code> to expect a 401 instead of a 200:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
public class HelloResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
            .when().get("/hello")
            .then()
            .statusCode(401);
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Run and test your Quarkus REST API with HTTPie 
 
 
 
<p>Run your Quarkus app:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw quarkus:dev 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it from another terminal:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test with access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Quarkus App 
 
 
 
<p>Compile your Quarkus app into a native binary:</p>
 
 
 ./mvnw package -Pnative 
 
 
 
 
<p>Start your Quarkus app:</p>
 
 
 ./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner 
 
 
 
 
<p>Test it with HTTPie and an access token:</p>
 
 
 http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Startup time comparison 
 
 
<p>I compared startup times between frameworks by running each image three times before recording the numbers. Then, I ran each app five more times and averaged the results. I gathered these numbers on a 2019 MacBook Pro with an SSD, 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor, and 64 GB of RAM.</p>
 

 

 
 
 
<p>Versions used: Quarkus 2.9.0, Micronaut 3.4.3, Helidon 2.5.0, and Spring Boot 2.6.7 with Spring Native 0.11.5.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Memory usage comparison 
 
 
<p>I tested the memory usage (in megabytes) of each app using the command below. I ran it right after I started the app, after a single authenticated request, and after five authenticated requests.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ps -o pid,rss,command | grep --color &lt;executable&gt; | awk '{$2=int($2/1024)"M";}{ print;}'</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The chart below shows the memory usage after five requests.</p>
 
 

 
 
 What about the MacBook Pro M1 Max? 
 
<p>My MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) with Apple M1 Max builds much faster, apps startup 2x faster, but they use more memory.</p>

<p>In my <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/delivery-government-services/">last blog post</a>, I started discussing the implications of identity verification and facial recognition where organizations didn’t consider components of a zero trust architecture. Specifically, I covered the importance of preserving user privacy and facilitating secure access. Both of these previous fundamentals lead me to user experience and identity decisioning bias. These final two elements will move a facial recognition implementation from an add-on to and nice to have, to a trusted secure access environment providing high identity assurance that users want to use. Let’s investigate further.</p>
<p>Let’s face it, biometrics are way more convenient than passwords and one time codes. In surveys, 79% of users preferred 1Kosmos to passwords for logging into the corporate VPN, and 86% preferred it for accessing applications. Why? Because it takes 1Kosmos users little more than a blink and a smile to log in. But, to deliver this level of satisfaction the biometrics need to recognize the user and resist spoofing. Here another certification body called iBeta provides this assurance via their Biometric PAD-2 Liveness certification. In tests, the 1Kosmos BlockID platform achieved a false match rate (FMR) of less than 0.1% at 95% confidence interval (in iBeta’s 21 CFR 1311.116 test). Lesser solutions will frustrate users and produce drastically inferior results leading to manual processes and delays.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s discuss Identity Decisioning Bias. This thorny issue arises when a user’s biometric is evaluated by AI algorithms trained on a population that does not properly accommodate diversity. Depending on the identities in the data, the database can be skewed one way or the other. Meaning some users might not be recognized and denied access to services.</p>
<p>First off, let me be clear. At 1Kosmos we don’t do this! At no point in the company’s history have we ever needed to pool data to build so-called “intelligence” into decisioning. The technology available in mobile phone cameras (depth of field) can, with high accuracy, determine if the face in front of it is real. This eliminates the possibility of Identity Decisioning Bias in the 1Kosmos BlockID platform. The iBeta tests produced zero false matches in 200 live biometric attempts on iOS and Android devices, validating the reliability of the BlockID platform for accurately performing live biometrics for identity proofing. As a result, when it comes to guarding against algorithmic bias, our solutions set the standard.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos BlockID, citizens can conveniently self-verify their identity using physical documents such as a government-issued driver’s license or passport. The captured data during the verification process is stored in a digital wallet which enables a portable identity and allows citizens to manage and choose when and how they share their PII data.</p>
<p>From a government agency point of view, with a digital wallet, agencies can support citizens as they move through and require access to new or additional services. Placing all data in the 1Kosmos decentralized identity platform secures the PII data and the data is now a user-controlled wallet that is updated as the citizen needs new services or updates existing credentials.The data is never stored in a central location and is always controlled by the citizen. After the citizen identity is verified, 1Kosmos BlockID binds it to the citizen account to deliver highly secure and low friction online engagement. This way, citizens can easily and securely access critical government services such as Medicare or Social Security. With 1Kosmos, government organizations can verify citizen identities, increase citizen engagement, protect logins and reduce friction while maintaining the highest level of security with a frictionless user experience.</p>
<p>I began this post talking about biometrics and passwordless access, and clearly these are capabilities 1Kosmos has brought to market, but they are simply two capabilities of a solution designed for much more. We set out over five years ago to provide users with a private digital identity they could control and allow service providers to authenticate that identity and then know with certainty who has logged onto their network.</p>
<p>In doing this, the architects of our BlockID platform anticipated and addressed the security, privacy, usability, and efficacy challenges to deliver a new form of identity proofing and multi-factor authentication where the user is the authenticator and not some artifact of information such as a one time code. They then accommodated the need for flexible levels of identity assurance so that organizations could tailor controls to the needs of their business.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom’s Online Gambling market is one of the best performers in the world. It dominates Europe’s Online Gambling market, <a href="https://www.egba.eu/uploads/2020/12/European-Online-Gambling-Key-Figures-2020-Edition.pdf">accounting for over 30% of total online gaming revenue in 2020</a>, and has seen constant year-over-year growth.</p>



<p>From April 2020 to March 2021, the UK’s Online Gambling market saw a gross gambling yield of £6.9bn – an increase of 18.4% from the previous year. Of this, online casinos made up the vast majority, generating £4.0bn in GGY. This is followed by sports betting and bingo, according to <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/industry-statistics-november-2021">the Gambling Commission</a>.</p>



<p>Since becoming fully regulated following the enactment of the Gambling Act 2005, Online Gambling has steadily grown in the UK, with sports betting, online casinos, and bingo each being widely available. As of 2021, it’s reported that there are over 2,439 gambling operators in the UK market, the vast majority of which offer iGaming services.</p>



<p>Like all other regulated markets, the UK experiences its share of friction between operators and regulators. Online Gambling regulations in the UK have been present for quite some time and are somewhat of a double-edged sword for operators – some regulations provide benefits, but others limit operator freedoms.</p>



<p>For example, strict anti-underaged gambling and security regulations mean operators have to invest in strong processes. However, this benefits them in the longer term, as these processes aid in deterring <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/prevent-underage-gambling/">underaged gambling</a> and fraud. In parallel, there are also some regulations that don’t favor operators, such as a range of limits on advertising. This is the give and take inside a highly-regulated environment.</p>



 Why Online Gambling needs to be regulated in the UK 



<p>Regulation is crucial for the Online Gambling market in the UK. It’s beneficial to both operators and players, with the core focus of regulations being the safety of all parties. This is done through regulations that promote important points such as fraud prevention, anti-underaged gambling processes, and money muling.</p>



<p>With Online Gambling being easily accessible, each of these things – and more – are vital. The ease for underaged users to claim to be adults is quite high, so it is clear as to why we witnessed the introduction of regulations bringing in ID verification and other anti-underaged gambling tools. In the same light, using Online Gambling to ‘clean’ money is a common criminal practice, so this is why many regulations focus on anti-money laundering processes.</p>



<p>It’s also important to consider<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/online-gambling-regulation/"> how sports events impact Online Gambling and why regulation is vital in this segment</a>. Euro 2020 saw a huge <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ensure-player-friendly-id-verification/">increase in player verification</a>, with millions of pounds being waged throughout the tournament. It’s easy for fraudsters to attempt to slip through the cracks in such a busy period, where operators may be overwhelmed with player signups.</p>



 Online Gambling in the United Kingdom 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/united-kingdom-gambling-commission-ukgc/">Gambling Commission</a> is the key regulator of gambling in the United Kingdom, both traditional brick and mortar and online. It was created when the Gambling Act 2005 became law, and updated gambling laws and regulations to keep up with technology, particularly Online Gambling.</p>



<p>There are many different laws and regulations covering gambling in the UK. They include focus points such as fraud prevention, anti-underage gambling, know your customer requirements, anti-money laundering checks, operator advertisement limitations, and much more. Key regulations are outlined on <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/about-us/guide/gambling-related-legislation">the Gambling Commission’s website</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/19/contents">Gambling Act 2005</a>.</p>



<p>Some of the most noticeable regulations include customer identity verification requirements. They ensure that a thorough onboarding process checks customer identities before allowing them to gamble, which includes age verification checks, verification of names, addresses, and date of birth during the onboarding process.</p>



<p>The identity verification requirements come as both positive and negative for players and operators. On one hand, both are more protected, with underaged or at-risk users having a more difficult time being able to gamble. However, these requirements also lengthen the onboarding process, which is negative for both parties. Players may get bored while waiting, they may be missing required documents, or struggle with the process, thus potentially turning them away from the gambling website and a loss of customers for the operator.</p>



 The UK Gambling Commission’s new rules for September 2022 



<p>Changes are coming to the UK gambling market, with the Gambling Commission outlining new rules going into effect on 12 September 2022.</p>



<p>These rules aim to protect at-risk customers and require operators to:</p>



  Monitor a specific range of risk indicators, as a minimum, that identifies gambling harm  Flag risk indicators and place a requirement to take action in a timely manner  Implement automated processes for strong indicators of harm  Prevent marketing and the take-up of new bonuses for at-risk customers  Evaluate interactions and ensure the operator interacts with consumers at least at the level of problem gambling for the relevant activity  Provide evidence of customer interaction for high risk to the Gambling Commission  Comply with these requirements at all times, this includes ensuring the compliance of third-party providers  



<p>These changes only affect at-risk customers, so it is unlikely they will have a significant impact on the UK’s Online Gambling market. Operators will have to limit marketing and bonuses for at-risk customers, but the majority of changes will be on a technical side that won’t impact most players. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gambling-commission-sets-new-rules-on-action-for-at-risk-customers#:~:text=The%20new%20rules%2C%20which%20come,processes%20for%20strong%20indicators%20of">official Gambling Commission update</a>.</p>



 How to get a license as a gambling operator in the UK 



<p>In order to get a license as a gambling operator in the UK, operators must apply <a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/service/apply-for-an-operating-licence">via the Gambling Commission website</a>. This includes filling in a range of information, as well as paying a fee.</p>



<p>Of course, the most important part of this is being compliant with the rules and regulations, which are required to receive a license. There are many regulations and relevant information is provided when applying for a license, however, one of the most important things are no doubt the KYC requirements.</p>



<p>The requirements include verification of a customer’s name, address, and date of birth, which are generally verified through the submission of an official government document (such as a passport or driving license) and proof of address (such as a bank statement or utility bill). These documents must be verified during the onboarding process, or before a customer is allowed to deposit funds and start gambling.</p>



<p>Verification methods such as these can cause issues for customers, as mentioned previously, and its possible users will not want to wait to be verified or simply struggle with the process. This risk of operators losing potential customers is a concern, but solid industry figures such as IDnow go through remarkable efforts to address such matters.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent solution</a> is a major tool to address the customer experience as well as being quite secure.

 SEC Nigeria Releases Crypto Asset Rules to Regulate Cryptocurrencies, Aims to Boost the Digital Assets Market in the&nbsp;Country  The recently published crypto asset rules outline the registration processes and related compliance required to operate in the&nbsp;country <blockquote>Key Takeaways</blockquote><blockquote>- Under the SEC Nigeria’s new crypto asset rules, virtual assets will be considered securities in the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>- Any Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) that want to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians must obtain a VASP license from the SEC Nigeria&nbsp;first.</blockquote><blockquote>- Cryptocurrency exchanges must obtain a No Objection Certificate from the SEC Nigeria before listing any new digital assets on its platform for sale to Nigerians.</blockquote><p>The <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/#:~:text=ABOUT%20SEC-,The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission%2C%20SEC%20is%20a%20Government%20Agency,to%20the%20Nation%27s%20Economic%20Development">Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria</a> recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oluwaseunadeyanju/2022/05/14/nigeria-issues-crypto-asset-rules-in-a-move-that-could-boost-adoption/?sh=773e58b312e6">published the 54-page crypto-asset rules titled “New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms, and Custody of Digital Assets,”</a> outlining the registration processes and related compliance required to operate as a cryptocurrency service provider and custodian in the country. It took twenty months for the Nigerian SEC to release its latest regulations after issuing a statement saying that it had decided to regulate cryptocurrencies.</p><p>With this new rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria aims to boost the crypto market in the country. Given that Nigeria is already among the top ten fastest-growing markets in terms of crypto-asset adoption, as shown in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/18/new-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-user-global-map.html">Chainanalysis report</a>, the SEC’s stance will help it break into the top three markets globally.</p><p>That said, it also brings the SEC at crossroads with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which views Digital Assets as a threat to the country’s monetary system. Such is the extent of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s negative outlook towards virtual assets that it has barred Nigerian businesses from cooperating with any digital asset-based companies. That is about to change thanks to the SEC’s new rule, as it will grant the crypto businesses in Nigeria much-needed legitimacy. Thus, financial institutions in the country will be able to do business with them without worrying about legal uncertainty.</p> Things You Should&nbsp;Know <p>The new rule classifies Digital Assets as securities, and any businesses that plan to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians will have to obtain a Virtual Asset Provider (VASP) license. To get the license, the first thing that a VASP must do is submit their white paper and an assessment form to the regulator.</p><p>As for the number of licenses that a VASP may need, well, it depends upon their business category. Take Crypto exchanges, for example, defined as Digital Assets Offering platforms (DAOP) in the rule. They require VASP and DAOP licenses to operate in Nigeria or target Nigerians.</p><p>But the compliance burden doesn’t end after obtaining a VASP license. In fact, receiving a license is just a start, and the real deal begins after it. For instance, a licensed VASP must manage all the associated risks, ensure the availability of relevant resources to maintain operations round the clock, incorporate appropriate security measures to mitigate any security-related complications, and comply with the risk management framework.</p> Trading Volume &amp; Compliance Filings <p>A licensed cryptocurrency exchange must submit weekly and monthly reports on trading volume to the SEC Nigeria. Besides this, they must also submit financial &amp; compliance reports on a quarterly &amp; yearly basis. The deadline to submit audited financial statements is three months after the financial year ends. The cryptocurrency exchanges must also provide up-to-date compliance reports on any special conditions imposed by the regulator.</p> No Objection Certificate to List Digital&nbsp;Assets <p>Virtual asset exchanges must obtain a no-objection certificate from the SEC Nigeria before listing any digital assets for sale on the platform. The NOC rule applies to all individual crypto assets that the platform plans to list for sale to Nigerians. This rule intends to ensure that the exchange has all the necessary information about the associated risks that the respective digital assets may&nbsp;present.</p> Maximum Ceiling for Funding From&nbsp;ICO <p>The SEC has set the maximum amount a crypto project can raise from an ICO at NGN 10 billion. If deemed necessary, the financial regulator may also change this&nbsp;ceiling.</p> Freedom to Choose an External Custodian or Operate on Their&nbsp;Own <p>As per the rules, the digital assets offering platform (DAOP) can either choose an independent custodian or do it internally. The only case where a DAOP must only choose an SEC-vetted custodian is when a project is conducting an&nbsp;ICO.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

<p>The move to biometric authentication started as far back as 2004 when IBM introduced fingerprint readers. Biometrics went mainstream when Apple released TouchID on the iPhone in 2013.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve seen almost a decade of innovation leading to Biometric Authentication methods for the enterprise reaching the Slope of Enlightenment on the latest Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/interactive/hc/4004062">Hype Cycle</a> for Identity and Access Management Technologies, 2021.</p>
<p>Still, the jury is out on facial recognition technologies. Done right for authentication and as an integrated component of a zero trust architecture, they produce an excellent user experience, preserve privacy, facilitate secure access, and resist spoofing and hacks. But, facial recognition implemented as an add-on to an antiquated technology stack arguably causes more harm than good. Let’s dig deep.</p>
<p>Recently two specific issues with facial recognition have made <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/taxes/irs-to-back-off-third-party-facial-recognition-what-happens-to-id-me/">news</a>. The first relates to the importance of securing user biometrics and controlling access to personal information. The second raises the issue of Identity Decisioning Bias in algorithms designed to verify identity but built in a way that disadvantages certain populations. Both are serious concerns and both should be examined in light of the fundamental reason for replacing passwords with biometrics – namely to improve security and deliver a more convenient user experience. Privacy and efficacy are core to these objectives. I’ll address each issue in turn.</p>
<p>First, let’s cover security. There is and always will be a need to balance security and convenience. In regard to user PII, it can certainly be convenient to store and manage this information centrally, as has been the trend over the last two decades. Unfortunately, when a hacker breaches the perimeter and successfully gains access to admin credentials, they can gain access to the honeypot of PII data. We’ve seen this happen all too often, and that makes this trade of convenience over security a poor one made all the worse when the PII contains biometric data. The solution?</p>
<p>By storing PII in a distributed ledger (such as a private and permissioned blockchain) access and administration fundamentally change. There is no honeypot! A hacker with access to admin credentials cannot access PII which simply isn’t there. As for convenience, the entire landscape shifts. With no central administration of data, administration simplifies to managing the servers supporting the distributed ledger. This makes blockchain an ideal technology for storing and managing PII.</p>
<p>This leads me to my next point – privacy. Privacy has become a big problem for organizations to manage. Why? Because it’s complicated – it varies across regions and there are heavy fines for non-compliance. When an organization centrally manages user PII, questions about who has access to this data arise. Is the information truly private, and, again, what risks do the organizations assume when access credentials to this information get compromised?</p>
<p>By using public-private cryptographic keys for end users to control their data, user privacy is greatly simplified. But storage isn’t the only challenge. User’s personal information needs to be kept private at all points in a process. You can’t really have users transfer their PII in the clear and replicate it to other systems without proper controls and then still call it private because it’s stored in a secure location.</p>
<p>When it comes to using a user biometric in place of passwords, standards bodies such as FIDO and NIST have published certification guidelines to ensure privacy at every step of the process. This makes it important that any such solution used for biometric enrollment and/or authentication not only comply with standards, but undergo rigorous certification testing to ensure compliance to standards. Without these certifications, organizations really can’t rely on those solutions to comply at a business level with directives such as Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering.</p>
<p>In my next blog, I’ll continue this discussion by covering the importance of user experience and identity decision bias and what this means for deploying identity verification techniques.</p>

				 <p>The Digital Wallet market is quickly evolving, with many providers and increasing consumer adoption. They are critical to the evolving digital landscape, yet Digital Wallets can still be poorly understood. In 2018 we published a report, <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/The-Current-and-Future-State-of-Digital-Wallets-v1.0-FINAL.pdf">The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets</a>, providing an overview of the state of the digital wallet market and a forecast for its future growth at the time. The report defined what a Digital Wallet is, clarified the Digital Wallet industry and ecosystem, and provided guidance for organizations to move forward as the ecosystem continued to form. Fast forward to 2022, the Digital Wallet market is maturing as providers look to offer users a variety of features. From Apple to Google Pay, organizations are providing us with the ability to make payments online and in-person, store loyalty cards, and receive offers and discounts. As Darrell noted in 2018, this report would need to be revised or replaced as our understanding of Digital Wallets will evolve quickly, and it has.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets laid down a baseline for the understanding of Digital Wallets. On the fourth anniversary of publication, we revisit this report to further define where we all need to go. We hope you will, too.</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting to learn about digital wallets or have read it in the past, The Current and Future State of Digital Wallets is a valuable resource. As our real-world continues to mesh with our digital world, the state of the digital wallet ecosystem is an area we should be keeping a close eye on. After all, these wallets will be the holders of our identities and so much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are always looking for feedback and input from our peers and the public. If you have any questions or comments about Digital Wallets or the report, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We value your feedback and will respond as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>

 The State of Digital Wallets Series 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/introduction-state-of-digital-wallets/">Introduction – State of Digital Wallets.</a>The report is structured to lay down what a Digital Wallet is and what it can do then discuss where things currently stand—guiding approaches that organizations and businesses can take. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/what-is-a-digital-wallet/">What is a Digital Wallet? </a>The general idea of a Digital Wallet is pretty simple – it’s a Thing that we put our Stuff in. The hard part comes when we have to identify what is that “Thing,” what “Stuff” do we put into it, and what does it mean to put “Stuff” in it? What about getting our “Stuff” out? or Updating our “Stuff”? 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/digital-wallet-deeper-detail-digital-wallet-part-3-16/">Digital Wallet – Deeper Detail. </a>We’re beginning to sense that our Digital wallets will become more important than our physical wallets. Think about what you would rather leave at home when you go out – your phone or your physical wallet? Many of us can make it without a wallet, but we feel naked without our phones. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/detailed-capabilities-of-wallets-agents-digitalwallet-part-4-16/">Detailed Capabilities of Wallets &amp; Agents. </a>Mainstream Digital Wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay allow simple information to be “carried” inside them like credit and debit cards, plane tickets, loyalty reward cards and receipts. This section briefly describes some of the capabilities that Digital Wallets are beginning to (or will) support. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/guiding-principles-for-digital-wallets-digitalwallet-part-5-16/">Guiding Principles for Digital Wallets. </a>A few high-level guiding principles should be kept front of mind for those designing, building, and using Digital Wallets to create user experiences. This section looks at ​Consent-Driven, ​Privacy by Design, Security by Design, and ​Portable and Open by Default. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/stuff-in-a-digital-wallet/">“Stuff” In A Digital Wallet. </a>A Digital Wallet is not just a place to store your credit and debit cards. Over time more and more information will be useful in a Digital Wallet. This section provides a brief overview of some of the capabilities that Digital Wallets have or will soon have. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/enterprise-wallets-digitalwallet-part-7-16/">Enterprise Wallet. </a>Enterprises are more likely to have multiple agents – even of the same type – operating in a single Digital Wallet. Enterprise-grade Digital Wallets have requirements that are unique to managing the needs of an organization. Though some requirements may apply to People (e.g. scale), they become more critical when working at an enterprise level. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/agents-deeper-detail/">Agents – Deeper Detail. </a>Agents work on our behalf to make our Digital Wallet work for us. As the adoption of Digital Wallets increases, we will be able to deploy Agents to take care of the mundane, protect us from errors, and improve our lives. This section aims to provide a deeper view of where Agents can go. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/state-of-tech-art-of-the-possible-digitalwallet-part-9-16/">State of Tech / Art of The Possible. </a>We examine the current areas where Digital Wallets are working and discuss, at a high level, how well they are performing. There are still fundamental areas where the Digital Wallet space is facing or will face difficulties. We touch on the user experience, driving adoption and loss and theft protection as starting points to consider. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/further-research-and-effort-digitalwallet-part-10-16/">Further Research and Effort. </a>Research, Development, Education and other efforts are required to help move the Digital Wallet ecosystem forward. A few of the concepts explored here are Trust Registries, Credential Lifecycle, ​Certification, and Exclusions. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/standards-digitalwallet-part-11-16/">Standards. </a>There are few standards in the Digital Wallet ecosystem, and this lack of standards is partly due to the ecosystem still in an early stage of development. Formal standards have not been established in most areas, including self-sovereign identity stack, Wallet portability, etc. While informal standards may exist in some areas, they are not always followed. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/the-user-experience-challenge/">The User Experience Challenge. </a>Digital Wallets have been, for the most part, a miserable experience. Microsoft Passport was the first attempt over twenty years ago, and Apple and Google Pay haven’t been better. The success of Digital Wallets doesn’t feel like we are using a Digital Wallet, and they feel more like using a credit card or enhanced mobile payments. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/business-and-markets-digitalwallet-part-13-16/">Business and Markets. </a>Digital Wallet components will come from various providers, such as OS providers, hardware platform providers, and software providers. The ecosystem will evolve from discrete applications to a more plug-and-play world in the Digital Wallet business market where we can pick pieces. We discuss how the market will develop and then some early approaches that can be used to take advantage of the evolving Digital Wallet space. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/early-business-approaches-digitalwallet-part-14-16/">Early Business Approaches.</a>&nbsp;Digital Wallets should be based on clear, single-purpose use cases, and having a broad Wallet strategy is not advised at the early stages. To make progress, we should consider Single-Purpose Use Cases, ​Backup &amp; Recovery and ​Trust Hubs when building out a Digital Wallet strategy. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/influence-things-digitalwallet-part-15-16/">Influence Things. </a>Innovators and early adopters of the Digital Wallet can benefit by starting early. Three key activities will ensure the ecosystem’s success and that of the investment in this space: time, resources, and funds. We need to look at the necessary points of control and influence in the Digital Wallet space, and as we examine the various aspects, ask specific questions. 
 <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/the-upcoming-wallet-wars-digitalwallet-part-16-16/">The Upcoming Wallet Wars. </a>The Browser Wars have seen a lot of investment and changes. However, most browsers work similarly and are interchangeable. As browsers add Digital Wallet capabilities, the incompatibilities and feature mismatches will increase. The Digital Wallet realm will go through a similar process, with many players coming into play and vanishing.

 Upgrade sees the launch of decentralized identifier communication protocol Mercury, alongside enhancements to ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG <p>With a goal to build the infrastructure and deliver the tools that will power Web3, <a href="http://ont.io">Ontology</a> has been focused on the Decentralized Identity (DID) field since day one. <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a> is Ontology’s decentralized identity framework, designed to be both trustless and private, empowering users and further facilitating Ontology’s mission.</p><p>Having recently made our Verifiable Credentials Software Development Kits (<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ont-id-framework-upgraded-ontologys-verifiable-credentials-sdks-now-open-source-for-all-go-and-7f89f7585528">VC SDKs</a>) open-source for all Go and Java developers, the Ontology team is pleased to announce a new framework upgrade for ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>This framework upgrade will see additional enhancements to ONT ID’s product suite, as well as some important upgrades, including the upgrade of <a href="https://mercury.ont.id/">Mercury</a>, a secure, trustless, DID based peer-to-peer communication protocol. There are also additional upgrades being made to <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, the trustless universal authenticator, and <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s Trust Anchor&nbsp;Gateway.</p><p>In all, this upgrade makes our decentralized identity solutions more compatible and more easy-to-use, expanding Ontology’s ecosystem collaboration and accelerating the large-scale adoption of DID solutions.</p> Upgrades to&nbsp;Mercury <p>As a trustless, peer-to-peer decentralized communication protocol that allows entities to securely transmit messages, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations with each other, <a href="https://github.com/ontio/mercury">Mercury</a> will play an important part in Ontology’s ecosystem. In short, Mercury makes it easier for both Web3 and Web2 application developers to complete integrations with decentralized identity solutions.</p><p>Mercury defines several decentralized identifier-based sub-protocols for building connections and transmitting messages, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations between entities. The sub-protocol family defined by Mercury includes a connection protocol, a general (encrypted) message exchange protocol, as well a verifiable credential and presentation transmission protocol.</p><p>In Mercury, entities talk to each other through agents. There are three kinds of agents in this&nbsp;system:</p>  User Agent: A user agent is under the control of an end entity, and it can be built as or embedded into mobile apps or other data-rich clients. It is worth noting that user agents’ most important feature is that they cannot be online 24/7. Entities can keep the corresponding secret keys and store their verifiable credentials in their respective local storage, and then use user agents to initiate communication or transmit messages securely.  Cloud Agent: In some business cases where user agents cannot be online continuously, messages and credentials need to be relayed, forwarded, and stored temporarily. The cloud agents play important roles in routing these messages. The cloud agent itself has a public decentralized identity and an attribute of service endpoint, so its corresponding secret key needs to be kept&nbsp;secure.  Service Agent: The service agent itself is also a cloud agent. In addition, it also allows for the issuance of some verifiable credentials (such as diplomas from third-party institutions). The service agent should also have a public and certified decentralized identity in order to facilitate the secure management of secret&nbsp;keys.  <p>To expand on this further, let’s take a look at some examples.</p><p>Let’s say two Web3 application users want to communicate with each other. To do so, they must first establish a communication channel using the connection protocol. Following this, they can transmit messages or verifiable credentials and verifiable presentations using the corresponding sub-protocols.</p>  Connection Protocol: Using Mercury, entities who want to communicate with others outside their own network can establish connections using the connection protocol.  General Message Exchange Protocol: Once the connection has been established, they can send messages to each other through the General Message Exchange Protocol. Messages which are sent to communication partners are encrypted and signed using cryptographic schemes ensuring the highest levels of&nbsp;privacy.  Verifiable Credential and Presentation Transmission Protocol: The Verifiable Credential and Presentation Transmission Protocol defines the methods of how the three above roles interact with each other. The three actors are the holder, the issuer, and the verifier. The issuer can issue a verifiable credential to the holder at the holder’s request. The holder can then generate verifiable presentations from their credentials for proof purposes. The verifier who obtains the verifiable presentation does so using cryptographic proofs.   Upgrades to ONT Login and ONT&nbsp;TAG <p><a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a> is a decentralized universal authentication login component that helps developers shield the details of authentication implementation. ONT Login brings a quick, seamless, and secure login experience to the developers and users of&nbsp;Web3.</p><p><a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a> is an open and decentralized authentication platform based on ONT ID. It provides KYC services for people, finances, and things, making off-chain data encapsulated within verifiable credentials trustable. Through integrations with ONT TAG, entities can obtain different kinds of verifiable credentials from applications.</p><p>In the future, these SDKs and protocols will support additional decentralized identifier methods, as well as Ethereum Name Service (ENS) and other decentralized domain naming&nbsp;systems.</p><p>ONT TAG will allow users to obtain an NFT that can be used as their credentials, while ONT Login will be able to use NFTs to verify the users’ identities. Both will form an on-chain and off-chain data collaboration mechanism and improve the decentralized identity ecosystem as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>Ontology’s core focus on providing industry-leading DID tools and solutions is paving the way towards the creation of a safer Web3 for businesses, entities, and users. <a href="https://mercury.ont.id/">Mercury</a>, <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, and <a href="https://tag.ont.id">ONT TAG</a> are three essential components of the Ontology ecosystem that will make the Web3 space easier to interact with, more compatible, and ultimately, more&nbsp;secure.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>It was a magical night in Berlin, and literally so for Indicio, as we had just been thanked by SITA at the European Identity Conference for being “the magicians” behind their award-winning technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, there is magic in the technology we built, or at least, superpowers: Decentralized identity really can solve the chronic, destabilizing problems of verification, privacy, and security all at once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it only works like magic when you consider some of the other critical ingredients that went into this two-year development journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is vision.</p>
<p>SITA, the leading provider of technology to the air transport sector, saw the possibilities of digitizing the entire travel experience while preserving passenger privacy through verifiable credential technology—a vision that could be summarized in one, powerful, view of the airport of the near future: no lines, no queues.</p>
<p>The second is a challenge—or in this case, something we would all agree is better described as a crisis.</p>
<p>The vision of no airport lines was quickly realized in 2020 in the worst possible way by a global pandemic, which meant there were no passengers at all. How could travel restart under pandemic conditions—how could tourism-dependent economies reopen safely? Could decentralized identity solve this problem?</p>
<p>Yes it could, it could provide definitive proof of a person’s Covid test status without airlines having to integrate with centralized databases of health data, a path mired in complexity and legal liability. It could allow passengers to use this proof in a way that protected their privacy.</p>
<p>But where in the marketplace did such an end-to-end, decentralized identity ecosystem exist? It didn’t. There were, instead, bits and pieces of technology, some open source, some proprietary; and there were critical gaps that needed to be filled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we filled in and built out this ecosystem, step by step, something that could not have happened without the help of the government of Aruba and its openness to digital innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With each success came the renewed confidence to build further, until a technology solution that only existed in theory not only worked in practice, countries everywhere could avail of the open source codebase to deploy similar systems—thanks to SITA donating the code written to Linux Foundation Public Health (see Cardea.app).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third ingredient to this magical recipe is collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, that’s an effortless word, but in practice it requires effort. It was vital to understand what our partners in this project needed to succeed on their terms. We, as a company, weren’t just building a sell-and-forget product, we had to join our partners’ journey and make their destination our goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It fed our creative intensity through many late nights, it meant everyone pulled together to make obstacles disappear and trials happen. And together, we pushed the back of the decentralized identity envelope.</p>
<p>Yes, Covid has, hopefully, abated. But we have a powerful, privacy-preserving way to manage Covid testing and vaccination if the need again arises. And that same technology can now be applied to the entire hospitality and travel sector for any purpose where verifiable data is needed, can mitigate risk, reduce cost, and improve the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>While the Cardea project is now turning to new health data applications, the original vision of a digitalized travel experience has the working technology to take off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actionable data is within everyone’s grasp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And fewer lines.</p>

<p>“Internet governance: una questione di digital trust” è il titolo dell’articolo a firma di tre professionisti InfoCert pubblicato nell’ultima edizione della Rivista italiana di informatica e diritto (RIID 2022, 4, 10) dello scorso 12 maggio, sul tema “La Internet governance e le sfide della trasformazione digitale”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>La&nbsp;Rivista italiana di informatica e diritto&nbsp;(RIID) è un periodico scientifico telematico ad accesso aperto edito dall’Istituto di Informatica Giuridica e Sistemi Giudiziari del Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (IGSG-CNR), il quale si occupa di fare&nbsp;studi e analisi critiche sia sui problemi applicativi delle nuove tecnologie dell’informazione nel campo del diritto, sia sulla regolamentazione dello sviluppo dell’informatica e della telematica nelle moderne società.&nbsp;</p>



 Un nuovo ecosistema digitale per bilanciare gli interessi di cittadini e mercato&nbsp; 



<p>Una rete internet impostata su una governance affidabile e utilizzabile a livello globale ha sicuramente alla base due pilastri principali, capaci di renderla forte: regolamentazione e identità digitale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In un momento storico come questo, dove Internet ha creato una relazione molto intima con gli utenti è sempre più importante, infatti, che il regolatore prenda posizione.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nello scrivere il loro contributo “Internet governance: una questione di digital trust”, Igor Marcolongo – Head of Business &amp; Solutions Compliance, Lorenzo Piatti – Head of Trust Specialists, Business &amp; Solutions Compliance ed Alessandra Bossi Analyst, Business &amp; Solutions Compliance, si soffermano sul tema del trust digitale, analizzando più aspetti di fondamentale importanza. &nbsp;</p>



<p>L’analisi parte dal concetto di internet governance, cos’è e qual è l’impatto che essa ha avuto a livello teorico-filosofico, di conseguenza qual è il rapporto tra legge e codice, per arrivare alle evoluzioni portate avanti dai legislatori italiano ed europeo in ottica migliorativa, al fine di garantire un ecosistema in grado di bilanciare gli interessi dei cittadini e del mercato.&nbsp;</p>



 Quale ruolo ha in questo contesto l’identità digitale?&nbsp; 



<p>Nel corso del tempo sono stati&nbsp;numerosi i tentativi messi in atto da organizzazioni pubbliche e private&nbsp;per approcciare il tema dell’identità online, iniziali soluzioni centralizzate hanno lasciato spazio a proposte federate e le tendenze di democratizzazione e digital sovereignty hanno successivamente permesso il fiorire di un nuovo approccio, quello della Self Sovereign Identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Un’ultima riflessione necessaria è poi relativa alla normativa europea in vigore e sugli strumenti tecnici organizzativi che possono essere più idonei affinché il mercato digitale sia reso sicuro e affidabile. in un momento storico come questo, dove Internet ha creato una relazione molto intima con gli utenti è sempre più importante, infatti, che il regolatore prenda posizione.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you ever dreamt of shopping where you can earn rewards and spend extra cash without doing anything? Fortunately for you, many rewards sites appeared on the market over the last few years that can save you money online when purchasing on Amazon or another favorite shopping site of&nbsp;yours.</p><p>In this article, we will see what rewards sites are, how you can benefit from them, and the best ones you can find&nbsp;today.</p> What are Rewards&nbsp;Sites? <p>Rewards sites are websites that allow their users to start earning points and win different gifts, such as free products, or take a massive discount on their next orders. In return, they should be referring friends or conducting some tasks — like filling out surveys or submitting some sort of content that can help the&nbsp;website.</p><p>But one question arises. If these sites give you freebies, how do they earn their money? Is there some gimmick? Are they scamming you? These are some of the questions we will answer&nbsp;below.</p> How do Reward Sites&nbsp;Work? <p>Rewards sites generate their revenue by partnering with companies on affiliate terms. To make it simple, these platforms operate as affiliate websites with one key difference — they are sharing the rewards with customers.</p><p>Major brands and ecommerce marketplaces are interested in co-operating with rewards sites, as the latter could drive more traffic and increase sales. As a result, such businesses have more lucrative terms.</p><p>The outcome also favors the end client — they can have a decent share of the commission earned by the websites.</p><p>Customers can earn a cash back for each dollar spent on rewards sites (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">how cash back works here</a>). The good news is that users can also earn free points by taking surveys or watching videos — in other words, you’re <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earning money by sharing your data</a>. It all depends on the campaigns that are being promoted.</p> The 7 Best Reward&nbsp;Sites <p>Аs with every single niche, we have a lot of choices but not every rewards site can be an industry leader. Let’s see some of the notable names that each customer should&nbsp;know.</p> 1. Monetha <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/">Monetha</a> has hundreds of stores in 9 categories with rewards. Users earn Monetha Rewards for each euro that has been spent on the platform. If you find a good deal, you can get up to 800 Rewards per euro spent. You can convert the Rewards in crypto, gift cards, or donate to&nbsp;charity.</p><p>While the platform is considered a newer one, it holds a lot of value, considering its expansion and better offers popping up daily. Not only that, it also has a huge focus on privacy: user profiles are fully encrypted. It might be not important for majority of users now, but soon Monetha will allow users to share their profiles with stores for additional discounts and Rewards. It’s something not every rewards site can boast&nbsp;about.</p> 2. Swagbucks <p><a href="https://www.swagbucks.com/">Swagbucks</a> is a rewards site where you are able to earn points called SB. Users can use SB to purchase various gift cards and retail items, given as cash via PayPal, or donated to charities like the World Wildlife Fund. You can earn SB by taking surveys, shopping online and in-store, watching videos, downloading apps, playing games online and offline, and doing computer-related tasks.</p><p>You can get up to 10% cashback when It’s a rewards website worth checking out. According to Swagbucks, they’ve given over 530 million dollars to their website members, and they give 7,000 gift cards per&nbsp;day.</p> 3. Rakuten (formerly known as&nbsp;Ebates) <p><a href="https://www.rakuten.com/">Rakuten</a> is most widely known as the kit sponsor for FC Barcelona. However, it owns Ebates (the previous name of the reward site) for around eight years now. It is an excellent cashback service that lets you earn while you&nbsp;shop.</p><p>It’s easy to establish and connect your accounts, and Rakuten gives you plenty of opportunities to accumulate points through the various offers available there.</p><p>You usually earn points — like 1% for the value of all Apple products, 2% of all Nikes, etc. However, there are times when you can save a lot of money with up to 35–40% of the value of the products. All you need to do is seek great&nbsp;deals.</p> 4. BeFrugal <p><a href="https://www.befrugal.com/home/">BeFrugal</a> is a cashback site that gives you cash for every online purchase you make. When you shop at retailers from all over the web, BeFrugal makes sure you get outstanding offers from big stores like Macy’s, Walmart, Tesco,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>While you can get some of the best deals on the market (reaching up to 80% at times), you can earn cash back with each purchase. You can also qualify for a “Double Cash Back Event,” which can see you gain even better&nbsp;deals.</p><p>We have to mention that you have a $10 bonus for referring friends and $10 when signing&nbsp;up.</p> 5. Checkout51 <p>As the name indicates, <a href="https://www.checkout51.com/">Checkout51</a> is targeted at those who hit the road more often. Every time you visit gas stations supported by Checkout51, you can receive up to 25 cents per gallon when purchasing fuel and around 20 when buying&nbsp;goods.</p><p>What you need to do is download and install the app for iOS or Android, upload the receipts, and withdraw when you have at least $20 in savings in a&nbsp;check.</p><p>There are over 5,000 stores supported, and you can print your receipt in English, Spanish, and French. Check out for great offers, too. Every week they&nbsp;change.</p> 6. Groupon <p><a href="https://www.groupon.com/">Groupon</a> provides access to thousands of things to do, places to eat, and services that improve your daily life. With deals available for any meal of the day, any occasion in your home, and planned activities for you and your whole family, it’s easy to find something you’ll&nbsp;love.</p><p>Their app for Android and iOS is quite intuitive, and you can get some fantastic deals out&nbsp;there.</p><p>There are special offers like “Beauty Week,” where you can save up to 81% on cosmetic procedures or massages. It’s a place worth checking out, as there are new things to do and buy regularly.</p> 7. PINCHme <p>If you want to test a sample for free, then <a href="https://www.pinchme.com/">PINCHme</a> is the right choice. PINCHme works with hundreds of reputable brands and manufacturers, including Unilever, Nestle, Kraft, Mars, Pepsico,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>All you need to do is be active and provide feedback on the sample you have been given. It’s worth it, as you receive the product for free. But that’s not all. You also earn points that you can use to purchase other goods for a better&nbsp;price.</p> Conclusion <p>People have always valued different discounts. And while they are used to getting some cashback rewards via their credit cards, rewards sites take the mobile shopping experience to the next level. Customers who love product hunting are satisfied with the added flexibility of outstanding offers and coupon&nbsp;codes!</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

  <p>Micro frontends continue to gain interest and traction in front-end development. The architecture models the same concept as micro services - as a way to decompose monolithic front-end applications. And just like with micro services, micro frontends have complexities to manage.</p>

<p>This post is part two in a series about building an e-commerce site with Angular using micro frontends. We use Webpack 5 with Module Federation to wire the micro frontends together, demonstrate sharing authenticated state between the different front ends, prepare for deployment using dynamic module loading, and deploy it all to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>’s free hosting plan.</p>

<p>In this second post, we’re building on the site we created in part one, <a>How to Build Micro Frontends Using Module Federation in Angular</a>. Let’s add dynamic module loading to our cupcake e-commerce site, secure unprotected routes, and set up the site for deployment in Vercel, a service designed to improve the front-end development workflow. 🎉</p>

<p>In the end, you’ll have an app that looks like this publicly available through Vercel:</p>

 Review the Angular micro-frontends project using Webpack and Module Federation 

<p>Let’s start by refreshing our memories—dust off your project from the <a>first post</a>. Just like last time, we’ll need both IDE and the terminal.</p>

<p>We have the host application, <code>shell</code>, and two micro-frontend remotes, <code>mfe-basket</code> and <code>mfe-profile</code>. We’re using <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> to help facilitate the Module Federation plugin configuration. The cupcake basket functionality code resides in the shared library, and we share authenticated state using Okta’s SDKs.</p>

<p>Serve all of the Angular applications in the project by running:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>When you run the project, you should see all the beautiful cupcakes this store sells. You’ll be able to sign in, view your profile, add items to your basket, view your cupcake basket, and sign out. All the basics for handling your sweet treat needs!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: If you want to skip the first post and follow along with this tutorial, you can clone the code sample repo to get going. You will be missing quite a bit of context, though. Use the following commands in this case:</p>
     <code>git clone --branch local https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
npm ci
npm run run:all
</code>     
  <p>You’ll need to follow the instructions on creating the Okta application and updating the code with your Okta domain and client ID.</p>
</blockquote>

 Dynamic loading of micro-frontend remotes 

<p>So far, we’ve been serving the cupcake micro-frontend website using the npm script <code>run:all</code>, which serves all three applications at once. Let’s see what happens if we only try serving the host application. Stop serving the site, run <code>ng serve shell</code> to serve the default application, <code>shell</code>, and open the browser.</p>

<p>When you navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>, you see a blank screen and a couple of console errors. The console errors happen because <code>shell</code> can’t find the micro-frontend remotes at ports 4201 and 4202. 👀</p>

<p>These errors mean the host is loading the micro frontends upon initialization of the host, not upon route change like you might think based on configuring a lazy-loaded route in the routing module. Doh!</p>

<p>With the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> library’s <code>loadRemoteModule()</code> method, we can dynamically load the micro-frontend remotes upon route change with a few quick changes.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>.</p>

<p>The function we pass into the <code>loadChildren</code> property for the lazy-loaded routes changes to using <code>loadRemoteModule()</code>. Update your routes array to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { loadRemoteModule } from '@angular-architects/module-federation';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  {
    path: 'basket',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'profile',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)
  },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Now that you’re loading the remotes within the route definitions, you no longer need to define the remote URI in the <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code>. Go ahead and remove or comment out the remotes in the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. Another benefit of dynamic remote loading is that we no longer need to declare the modules to help TypeScript. Feel free to delete the <code>projects/shell/decl.d.ts</code> file. 🪄</p>

<p>Double-check everything still works by running <code>npm run run:all</code>.</p>

<p>Then stop serving the project and try running only the <code>shell</code> application by running the following command:</p>

   <code>ng serve shell
</code>   

<p>You should now see the shell application and only see a console error when navigating to a route served by a micro-frontend remote. Success!</p>

 Deploy your micro-frontend project using Vercel 

<p>Now that the cupcakes site is working locally let’s deploy this beautiful website using <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>. Ensure you’ve authorized Vercel access to GitHub because we’ll take advantage of the built-in integration to deploy changes from the <code>main</code> branch automatically.</p>

<p>First, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo">push your project up to a GitHub repo</a>. If you wish to obscure your Okta configuration, you can make the repo private. The Okta configuration code is not confidential information, as single-page applications are public clients. If you don’t like committing the configuration values into code, you can load the configuration values at runtime or use environment variables as part of your build step. I won’t get into the details of how to handle that here, but I will include some links at the end. Make sure to leave the checkbox for Intialize this repository with a README unchecked.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the Vercel dashboard, press the + New Project button to import a Git repository. Depending on what permissions you granted to Vercel, you might see your newly created GitHub repo immediately. If not, follow the instructions to adjust GitHub app permissions and allow Vercel access to the repo. Press the Import button for the repo to continue. You’ll see a form to configure the project within Vercel.</p>

<p>The idea behind micro frontends is to be able to deploy each application independently. We can do this in Vercel by creating a separate project for each application. Vercel limits the number of projects for a single repo to three in the free plan. What an extraordinary coincidence!</p>

<p>First, we’ll configure the project for the micro-frontend host, the <code>shell</code> application. To keep the projects organized, incorporate the application name into the Vercel project name, such as <code>okta-angular-mfe-shell</code>. You’ll also need to update the build command and output directory for the <code>shell</code> application. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Press the Deploy button to kick off a build and deploy the application.</p>

<p>You’ll see a screenshot of the application and a button to return to the dashboard when finished. On the dashboard, you’ll see the deployed URI for the application and a screenshot of the cupcakes storefront. If you visit the URI, the routes won’t work yet if you try navigating to the remotes. We need to deploy the remote projects and update the URI to the remotes in the route definition. Keep that URI for the <code>shell</code> application handy; we’ll use it soon.</p>

<p>Return to the Vercel dashboard, create a new project, and select the same repo to import. This time we’ll configure the remote application <code>mfe-basket</code>. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the deployed URI for the <code>mfe-basket</code> application.</p>

<p>Return to the Vercel dashboard to repeat the process for the final remote application, <code>mfe-profile</code>. Update your configuration to look like the screenshot below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Take note of the deployed URI for the <code>mfe-profile</code> application.</p>

 Update the routes to support micro-frontend paths for production 

<p>We need to update the route definition to include the URI for the deployed application. Now that you have the URI for the two micro-frontend remotes, you can edit <code>projects/shell/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. The values in the <code>remoteEntry</code> configuration option in the <code>loadRemoteModule()</code> method are where you’d define the path. But if we update this value to use the deployed URI, then you’ll no longer be able to run the application remotely.</p>

<p>We’ll use the <code>environments</code> configuration built into Angular to support both local and deployed environments and define a configuration for serving locally versus production build.</p>

<p>We’ll configure serving locally first. Open <code>projects/shell/src/environments/environment.ts</code> and add a new property for the micro-frontend remotes.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: false,
  mfe: {
    "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201",
    "mfeProfile": "http://localhost:4202"
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll use the values in the route definition. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and update the <code>remoteEntry</code> properties to use the new properties in the <code>environment.ts</code> file below.</p>

   <code>import { environment } from '../environments/environment';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  {
    path: 'basket',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeBasket}/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule)
  },
  {
    path: 'profile',
    loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
      type: 'module',
      remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeProfile}/remoteEntry.js`,
      exposedModule: './Module'
    }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)
  },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Feel free to serve the project using <code>npm run run:all</code> to double-check everything still works.</p>

<p>Now we’ll add the configuration for the deployed applications. Open <code>projects/shell/src/environments/environment.prod.ts</code> and add the same property for the micro-frontend remotes. Replace the URI with the deployed location.</p>

   <code>export const environment = {
  production: true,
  mfe: {
    "mfeBasket": "https://{yourVercelDeployPath}.vercel.app",
    "mfeProfile": "https://{yourVercelDeployPath}.vercel.app"
  }
};
</code>   

<p>Angular automatically replaces the <code>environment.ts</code> file to match when you build the project. So if you’re serving locally, you’ll use the contents from <code>environment.ts</code>, and if you run <code>ng build</code> to create the release, you’ll use the contents from <code>environment.prod.ts</code>.</p>

<p>Note: Vercel has a release promotion mechanism where you first release to a staging environment to conduct release verification, then promote the verified application to prod. With this flow, we’d need to add more complexity to the way we access the URIs. This tutorial will simplify things to only use one environment, but if you need to handle a multi-step release environment configuration, check out the links to blog posts at the end for handling per-environment configuration.</p>

 Add your deployment URL to Okta 

<p>You’ll need to update the Okta application with the new deploy location so that you can sign in. Open the Okta dashboard. Navigate to Applications &gt; Applications and select the Okta application you created for this project. On the General tab, press the Edit button on the General Settings section and add the new deploy URI for the <code>shell</code> application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, add the deploy URI as a Trusted Origin in Okta. Navigate to Security &gt; API and then navigate to the Trusted Origins tab. Press + Add Origin. Add the deploy location and select CORS for the type.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Commit your changes and push to your main branch. After the build succeeds, you should be able to use the deployed site from end to end!</p>

 Secure your micro frontends 

<p>Right now, you can access what should be protected routes by manually typing in the full URI to the profile route. Even though you don’t see any profile information, we aren’t guarding the route. Let’s make the site a little more secure by protecting the route.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. We’ll add a route guard that comes out of the box with Okta’s Angular SDK. Update the route definition for the <code>profile</code> route as shown below.</p>

   <code>import { OktaCallbackComponent, OktaAuthGuard} from '@okta/okta-angular';

{
  path: 'profile',
  loadChildren: () =&gt; loadRemoteModule({
    type: 'module',
    remoteEntry: `${environment.mfe.mfeProfile}/remoteEntry.js`,
    exposedModule: './Module'
  }).then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule),
  canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard]
},
</code>   

<p>Now if you navigate directly to the profile route, you’ll first redirect to Okta’s sign-in page, then redirect back to the profile route.</p>

<p>Route protection works well from within the micro-frontend shell. But what if you navigate directly to the URI where the profile micro frontend resides? You will still be able to navigate to the profile route within the micro frontend because there isn’t a guard within the profile application.</p>

<p>This brings us to an interesting concept. In order to fully secure your micro frontends, you should protect routes defined within your micro frontend as well. To add the Okta route guard, you’ll need to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> into the <code>mfe-profile</code> application’s <code>AppModule</code>, and add the same configuration as you did for the <code>shell</code> application. The Module Federation configuration shares the Okta library between the applications when accessed via the host application. In contrast, <code>mfe-profile</code> will need its own instance of authenticated state when accessed in isolation from the <code>shell</code> application. Having its own instance of authenticated state means you should add sign-in and sign-out capability in the <code>AppComponent</code> of the <code>mfe-profile</code> application too. This will also allow you to test each micro-frontend application independently.</p>

<p>Security + testing = winning!</p>

<p></p>

 Build the micro frontend on a relevant change 

<p>As mentioned in this post, the value of micro frontends is the ability to deploy each application independently. In production systems, you may need to handle multiple build steps and build out an entire workflow of CI/CD, but for this tutorial, we can cheat a little and still get the benefits of separate deployments. We will add a configuration in Vercel only to kick off a build when there’s changes in the relevant application code.</p>

<p>From the Vercel dashboard, open the Vercel project for the <code>mfe-basket</code> application. Navigate to the Settings tab and select Git. In the Ignored Build Step, we can add a Git command to ignore all changes except those in the <code>projects/mfe-basket</code> directory.</p>

<p>Add the following command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./projects/mfe-basket
</code>   

<p>Next, open the Vercel project for the <code>mfe-profile</code> application to update the Ignored Build Step command. Now add this command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD ./projects/mfe-profile
</code>   

<p>Lastly, open the Vercel project for the <code>shell</code> application to update the Ignored Build Step command. This command is a little different because we want to pick up any changes to the project excluding this changes to <code>mfe-basket</code> and <code>mfe-profile</code>. Add the following command:</p>

   <code>git diff --quiet HEAD^ HEAD -- ':!projects/mfe-basket' ':!projects/mfe-profile'
</code>   

<p>Now, if you make a change in a micro-frontend application, only that micro-frontend application will build and deploy. All three projects will notice the change and start building but will immediately cancel the build if the build step should be ignored for the project.</p>

 Beyond this post 

<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed creating and deploying this micro-frontend e-commerce site with beautiful pictures of tasty cupcakes. In this post, we used dynamic module loading to load micro frontends lazily within the host application, deployed the project to Vercel, added in multi-environment route configuration, and leveraged a micro-frontend benefit by enabling deployment upon relevant changes. You can check out the completed code for this project in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/deploy"><code>deploy</code> branch of the code repo</a> by using the following command:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch deploy https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git

<p>As you’d be aware, two of the most widely discussed software/service requirements are&nbsp;security&nbsp;and&nbsp;interoperability. Whether it be for user-level data protection or government-mandated legislative compliance, enterprises require innovative security solutions that help them meet emerging threats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized security solutions are built on security and privacy-focused paradigms, such as Ann Cavoukian’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">Privacy By Design</a>, which emphasize end-to-end encryption, least privileges (for data access), etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interoperability has also become a business necessity. While email is a ubiquitous interoperable standard, the more recent secure encrypted messaging systems have emerged as single company controlled “walled gardens” that create vendor lock-in rather than introducing new types of interoperable service offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The standardized decentralized identity service offerings will enable business to attain both strong security and cross-platform interoperability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve previously&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/07/the-business-benefits-from-using-decentralized-identity-technologies-for-customer-identity-management/">noted</a>&nbsp;on this blog that businesses that seize the opportunity to implement emerging standardized decentralized Identity technologies will create a long-term competitive advantage that will enable them to get ahead of the competition and maintain these advantages far into the future.</p>



 



 For proactive organizations, decentralized identity technologies will:&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 <br> 



  reduce the need for centralized databases (and the data items they contain) to the absolute minimum (e.g. for regulatory purposes) and thus give customers complete control and ownership over their personal data&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce vulnerability to data misuse by those charged with managing it, and to cyberattacks, fraud and other financial crimes&nbsp;  make customers’ lives easier by eliminating passwords for login and ongoing authentication&nbsp;  generate unprecedented levels of human trust between the organization and its customers and partners&nbsp;&nbsp;  reduce the compliance burden of managing customers’ personal data in services&nbsp;  allow participation in an open, trustworthy, interoperable, and standards-based identity management ecosystem&nbsp;&nbsp;  enable exciting new business alliances within which partners can communicate and exchange information securely to deliver services (e.g. in medical or education).&nbsp;  



 



<p>As we said at the start of this article series, Big Tech is scooping up users’ digital exhaust like candy and using it to generate massive profits. Big Data analytics technology is being used to commercialize knowledge of user behavior and influence their digital activities. The privacy crisis is real.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">Consumers want a solution</a>&nbsp;– and businesses, largely due to regulatory requirements, also want to increase user privacy and protect data entrusted to them by their customers. As businesses provide customers with innovative privacy-preserving solutions, customers will reward them with their loyalty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We believe the solution lies in returning control over personal information back to users through digital identities and decentralized identity technologies – the future of privacy and identity management on the internet.<br><br>Building on the Sudo digital identity and the Sudo Platform privacy and cyber safety capabilities – which contain integrated decentralized identity enhancements – enterprises can rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cyber safety solutions to their customers and create a significant competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talk to us about how we can help you.</p>



<p>Next week, in the final part of this series, we’ll explain how we are actively contributing to decentralized identity development.</p>

<p>Identity providers are a seamless way to authenticate your users and also maintain security on your enterprise network.</p>
<p>What is an identity provider? An identity provider is a service that verifies, stores, and manages digital identities. In business, IdPs help assign authorization to users so they can access certain areas while making sure all the sensitive information stays secure.</p>
 How Do Identity Providers Work? 
<p>An identity provider handles <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/digital-identity-management/">digital identities</a>, storing information related to these identities—including key identifying information and login credentials.</p>
<p>In the context of identity provision and management, a “user” need not be a human user. Rather, a user is an entity that connects to a system to access or provide data, use resources, or execute commands.</p>
<p>The purpose of an identity provider is much like that of a secure guest list: the provider stores user information, including their login credentials, and their partners or clients can access these identities for authentication and authorization as a service.</p>
<p>Outside of their actual clients, however, an IdP doesn’t provide user information to other companies. Instead, these companies can use the identities stored by an IdP to authenticate users without disclosing that information. They do this through three different messaging types:</p>
 
 Authentication Assertion: The IdP guarantees that users are who they say they are by comparing their credentials against their records. This process does not involve the sharing of user information. 
 Attribution Assertion: A request for user information. This assertion does involve the sharing of user information. 
 Authorization Assertion: A request to show that the user has the right permissions to access an online resource. 
 
<p>These assertions are one of the important tasks that IdPs perform, so much so that the National Institute of Standards and Technology includes an <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63c.html">entire section of their documentation on identity federation on how IdPs secure their assertion practices.</a><br>
IdPs will communicate with other online services through protocols like the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) or Open Authorization (OAuth).</p>
<p>Identity providers are flexible because they can mediate authentication requests across multiple participating service providers.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Identity Provider Protocols? 
<p>One of the most critical aspects of providing identity support for enterprise clients and consumers is ensuring there is a secure and reliable standard between them. These protocols help providers streamline communication between all parties without the unauthorized disclosure of information.</p>
<p>There are a few types of identity protocols, each serving a particular purpose:</p>
 
 IndiAuth: This decentralized model uses OAuth 2.0, which provides authentications via URL and authorization tokens for resource access. One of the important facets of IndiAuth is that it allows users to link their identity to different providers, including their own site or a third-party endpoint. 
 OpenID: OpenID Connect creates an identity layer on top of the OAuth protocol to support the release of authentication tokens using JSON structures and using RESTful HTTP APIs. 
 SAML: This domain model positions an IdP as an authentication authority that can authenticate users as part of a single sign-on profile. 
 
 What Is the Relationship Between an Identity Provider, Single Sign-On, and Federated Authentication? 
<p>When we’re talking about identity providers, there are often a lot of conversations around how users sign in to separate services. It isn’t necessarily the case, for example, that someone using an identity provider can sign in to all their accounts simultaneously. Several different technologies and services go into that process.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, there are a few technologies that need to be defined when discussing cross-platform authentication:</p>
 
 Federated Identity: <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/federated-identity-management/">Federated identity</a> is an agreement by several parties to allow their users to access resources with a shared set of credentials. An organization using a third-party identity management service can be said to be federating their identity management. 
 Single Sign-On: SSO is a subset of federated identity. Federation refers to the practice of organizations supporting cross-platform authentication through a single identity. SSO does the same thing but only in a limited domain, like a cross-section of services under the same company umbrella. 
 
<p>Different identity management types support these authentication schemes. For example, an IdM using SAML can serve as the basis for an SSO workflow for authentication. A user may attempt to log in to a local HR application with a username and password, and that request is transmitted to an IdP via SAML for verification. The IdP compares the credentials against their records, creates a SAML authentication response, and authenticates the user.</p>
 What Problems Do Identity Providers Solve? 
<p>IdPs provide a critical level of support for organizations who do not want or cannot afford to field their local identity management solution. These providers can offer more focused and targeted solutions that hit customer pain points better than out-of-the-box software installed on local systems.</p>
<p>Some of the major issues that IdPs solve include the following:</p>
 
 Proper Authentication and Authorization: if your organization has any level of flexible or open account management needs (for example, temporary or quest access), then an identity provider can streamline the onboarding and offloading processes as necessary. This reduces friction between you and your people without bringing in a lot of overhead. 
 Security: Authentication is a critical part of security, and identity management also requires a high level of security. Providers dedicated to identity management can also dedicate resources to proper security measures that protect identity information. This, in turn, can provide peace of mind to you, your stakeholders, and your customers. 
 Compliance: Enterprises in regulated industries face security and privacy regulations, many of which add a whole new layer of work to your existing operational capacity. Dedicated IdPs can help you outsource compliance by handling specialty security needs under frameworks like HIPAA, SOC 2, or PCI DSS. 
 Innovation Management: Updating, upgrading, and configuring new technology is a full-time job, and one you probably aren’t keen on shouldering. IdPs do the job for you and wrap the costs into your premiums.

				   Why You Don’t Want To Miss the Next IIW 
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.” Our team offers some insights into the biggest topics they discussed and some interesting trends they saw in our recent blog!</p>

<p>Community-driven platform powered by blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs&nbsp;</p>



<p>San Francisco, CA — May 18, 2022 – TRM Labs, the leader in blockchain intelligence solutions, along with crypto industry leaders including Circle, Solana Foundation, The Aave Companies, Hedera, Binance.US and Civic, have today announced the launch of a new community-powered scam reporting platform, <a href="https://www.chainabuse.com/">Chainabuse</a>, which empowers anyone in the crypto economy to warn others about scams, hacks or other fraudulent activity as they encounter it. The free tool enables crypto users, victims of financial crimes, and crypto businesses to take an active role in making the crypto ecosystem a safer place to operate.</p>



<p>Despite current volatility, the cryptocurrency industry has grown considerably over the last few years, peaking at a $3 trillion market cap in 2021. But as adoption has increased, so too has the rate of hacks and scams targeting crypto users. Warnings of scams are often reported on social media sites such as Twitter or Discord, but these posts can be difficult to validate, consolidate or track over time.</p>



<p>Chainabuse is the first purpose-built platform of its kind – a multi-chain reporting tool that allows crypto users to report illicit activity to a public forum where others can upvote, downvote or leave comments to contribute additional information. Reports on the same addresses or entities are consolidated and housed in a searchable database, which anyone can use to proactively check addresses or projects before engaging with them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In numerous recent attacks and instances of malicious activity, we have already seen the crypto community’s potential to come together to root out bad actors and help protect each other, “ said Joe McGill, former U.S. Secret Service and Postal Investigator, now part of the global investigations team at TRM and one of Chainabuse’s chief architects. “Chainabuse was designed to make it easier for more people to play an active role in advancing that culture and ensure that the spirit of community remains one of crypto’s most powerful attributes.”</p>



<p>The platform is powered by the crypto community and supported by leading crypto businesses, protocols, and foundations committed to making the crypto ecosystem a safe and trusted environment. Chainabuse provides partner crypto platform operators with a consolidated view of illicit activity reports from users, allowing them to identify prevalent, legitimate complaints and launch investigations more quickly.</p>



<p>“Chainabuse significantly enhances the depth and effectiveness of our compliance monitoring program by leveraging an aggregated view of the distributed efforts of the entire crypto community,”&nbsp; said Mandeep Walia, Chief Compliance and Risk Officer at Circle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The safety and security of web3 users is our top priority. Working with TRM Labs will enable us to reduce scams and hacks, which have cost people millions of dollars. Chainabuse will allow us to work together with industry partners to promote a better environment for the next million participants of DeFi and web3,” said Stani Kulechov, CEO of Aave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“TRM Labs is the industry go-to for blockchain investigations, and Chainabuse fills a missing part of a more trusted ecosystem with much-needed resources for scam victims,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We’re proud to forge a partnership with TRM Labs and build more intelligence into the investigative process together.”</p>



<p>“DLT and crypto requires a higher level of trust for more mainstream adoption, and tangible safety measures to protect consumers and users,” said Sam Brylski, Regulatory Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer for Hedera. “We are pleased to work with other industry leaders to deliver a multi-chain, community-driven, and freely available platform that lets users report and be warned about hacks, scams, and fraudulent activity, raising transparency for all.”</p>



<p>The platform launches publicly today with hundreds of reports <a href="https://www.chainabuse.com/browse">available to search</a> across eight blockchains – including over 100 scams related to Ukraine crypto fundraising campaigns and over 20 phishing domains and Twitter profiles targeting investors in a popular new gamified metaverse project.</p>



<p>“The latent fear of inadvertently investing in a rugpull – or being hacked – hampers mainstream crypto adoption and reinforces the call for industry-led solutions to consumer and investor protections,” said Esteban Castano, Co-founder and CEO of TRM Labs. “Chainabuse is the latest extension of TRM’s mission to build a safer and more trusted financial system for billions of people and we are proud to partner with leaders in the crypto industry to expand its impact and reach.”</p>



<p>How to support Chainabuse</p>



<p>Chainabuse is the first multi-chain, community-powered crypto scam reporting tool and is available for anyone to use for free. Organizations who are interested in becoming an official Chainabuse partner or want to learn more about scams reported on their platforms can contact the Chainabuse team at TRM Labs: <a href="mailto:chainabuse@trmlabs.com">chainabuse@trmlabs.com</a>.</p>

 Blockchain Veteran and Core Developer Bryan Bishop Teams Up With Shyft Network To Lead Global Security&nbsp;Efforts  The industry veteran will team up with Shyft Network’s core developers to strengthen security, scalability and interoperability. <p>BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 18, 2022 — <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> (“Shyft”), a public protocol designed to validate identity and power compliance directly into blockchain data, today announced that Bryan Bishop, a renowned Bitcoin core developer, technologist, and veteran of the blockchain industry, is teaming up with Shyft’s core development team to collaborate on strengthening the global network security, scalability, and interoperability.</p><p>Mr. Bishop’s decision follows the launch last month of <a href="https://www.veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, Shyft’s open-source, decentralized solution for the Financial Action Task Force’s Travel Rule, which requires the collection and exchange of customer data to ensure adherence to international rules against money laundering, sanctions evasion and other malicious activities. Veriscope enables digital asset exchanges to comply with the Travel Rule seamlessly and efficiently and solves for the corresponding “Sunrise Issue,” whereby exchanges in varying jurisdictions come into compliance with the rule at different times than their counterparties.</p><blockquote>Thomas Borrel, Chief Operating Officer of Shyft, said, “Bryan is a brilliant engineer whose significant experience as a developer and blockchain consultant will be extremely additive to our talented team of technologists and compliance professionals. We are excited to have Bryan help us strengthen our counterparty data transmission infrastructure, solve other complex security challenges, and continue to bridge the gap between permissionless and permissioned systems.”</blockquote><blockquote>Mr. Bishop said, “Veriscope is a necessary step towards continuing to bring crypto into the existing financial system. Travel Rule has presented an enormous regulatory challenge to the crypto industry, and it’s through open-source projects like Veriscope that I believe the industry will be able to come together and coordinate to solve the Travel Rule problem. It’s critical that we get this right, without increasing risk or harming users. Shyft has built out a platform to do just that, and I look forward to helping bolster the platform with more security for a variety of&nbsp;assets.”</blockquote><p>Prior to Shyft, Mr. Bishop served as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Custodia Bank (previously Avanti Bank &amp; Trust), a Wyoming bank specializing in digital asset payment and custody solutions for US businesses. Previously, he was an early technical hire and Senior Blockchain Engineer at LedgerX (now FTX US Derivatives), where he helped build the first federally regulated bitcoin derivatives exchange. He continues to serve on the Board of FTX US Derivatives. Mr. Bishop is a longtime software engineering consultant and contractor and has worked on behalf of companies including Blockstream and Genomic Prediction. Recently, he launched Webcash.org, a Proof-of-Work cryptocurrency without a blockchain. He was one of the first to receive the original Bitcoin email from Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and currently advises and consults companies in need of his expertise.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>Shyft Network is a public blockchain protocol designed to aggregate, embed, and leverage trust, validation, and discoverability to facilitate public and private data transfer between permissioned and permissionless networks.

 ADVERSARIAL CERTIFICATION — How Mattereum Asset Passports Express Doubt and Disagreement <p>By Dr JAMES HESTER FRSA, Head of Ontology, Mattereum</p>Alleged Cast of a Chupacabra Footprint<p><a href="http://mattereum.com/">Mattereum</a> recently had the opportunity to launch an <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/11/">Asset Passport and NFT</a> for a rather extraordinary object: a plaster cast of a footprint, in the possession of Mattereum team member Ian Simmons, which was allegedly made by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chupacabra">chupacabra</a>. This renowned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">cryptid</a> is famed for preying upon goats throughout Central and South America, and its existence has long been a matter of&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Of course, this particular footprint, though by tradition left by this elusive creature, is also well understood as being more likely that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_panther">Florida Puma</a>. So while it may not be definitive proof of the chupacabra’s existence, it is a fascinating piece of cryptozoological memorabilia that speaks to how stories about such creatures continue to stir the imagination.</p><p>The project also presented a unique opportunity for Mattereum. Normally, Certifiers adding information about objects to our Asset Passports focus on what that object is. For the first time, we had the chance to showcase the usefulness of an Asset Passport highlighting what an object likely is not. In many circumstances, this latter type of information can be just as important as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Mattereum has for a long time considered the usefulness of what we call ‘adversarial certifications’ in Asset Passports. These are pieces of information which, while contributing to a clearer understanding of the object, are not always entirely positive in nature. In some cases these could be added to an Asset Passport by the object owner themselves at the point of launch. However, these could also be added later by independent Certifiers who want this additional, sometimes unflattering, information to be a matter of record. These certifications would be backed by the same warranties as other certifications to ensure their accuracy, and to provide recourse if there was a dispute about that accuracy (which is particularly important to reduce the risk of baseless mud-slinging).</p><p>I want to speak briefly about two forms that these adversarial warranties might&nbsp;take.</p><p>The first could be termed a certification of ‘negation’. In this case, a certification is created stating that the object is not something. Our Asset Passport for the chupacabra footprint accomplished exactly this by stating that it was very likely (our certifier was pretty certain, but you never know) not that of a chupacabra. The presence of this assertion in the Asset Passport will make it very difficult later for someone to attempt to sell the footprint as being genuine unless they are able to produce a greater degree of verifiable proof to back up their&nbsp;claim.</p><p>A similar practice could be very valuable for passported items from asset classes prone to high levels of fraud and forgery, such as the art or luxury goods markets. Being able to flag an object as a known forgery doesn’t necessarily mean that nobody will ever want it (there’s actually a fairly decent market for artworks by famous forgers), but it does make it far more of a challenge for later unscrupulous sellers to try to fleece potential buyers by passing something off as something that it is&nbsp;not.</p><p>The second possible form of adversarial certification is more affirmational, but the information being affirmed might not necessarily be terribly flattering. At the moment, there is no requirement for those onboarding assets to disclose absolutely everything about them (although we do encourage them to do so, since the more info is known about an object, the more its value is affirmed and the more willing buyers are to pay for it). So it would be very easy for asset owners to omit information that they felt could impact the likelihood of a sale. In these cases, independent Certifiers could act as whistleblowers of a sort, providing information about objects which shines a light into dark corners to make sure that buyers have the ability to make more informed decisions about their purchases. Examples of this information could include associated carbon outputs from production, poor labour practices, or even evidence that the object had been trafficked or had otherwise concerning provenance.</p><p>Although the Mattereum Asset Passport can greatly assist in making an object more desirable on the market, it is, at its core, not solely a marketing tool. Rather, the Asset Passport is a faithful record of all information relating to an object, and at times that means ‘warts and&nbsp;all’.</p><p>Whether the warts are provided by those onboarding the assets, or by independent actors using their knowledge and expertise to ensure that the truth is made available, they are an essential part of ensuring that Mattereum’s mission of promoting truth in trade is carried&nbsp;on.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/adversarial-certification-how-mattereum-asset-passports-express-doubt-and-disagreement-2eb9e575a964">ADVERSARIAL CERTIFICATION — How Mattereum Asset Passports Express Doubt and Disagreement</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>Cybercriminals continue to cause disruption for organizations in 2022. Depending on the cyberattack type, those disruptions lead to various consequences, such as reputational/brand damage, financial losses, and monetary penalties. <br><br>One of the most prevalent types of cyberattacks is ransomware, accounting for approximately <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/2021/results-and-analysis/">10%</a> of all cyberattacks in 2021. <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">Ransomware</a> is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for decryption keys. <br><br><a href="https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-threat-report.html">Palo Alto Networks</a> states that the average ransom demand increased 144% to $2.2 million, while the average payment rose 78% to $541,010 from 2021 to 2022. According to a survey conducted by <a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/medialibrary/en/white-paper/2022-sonicwall-cyber-threat-report.pdf">SonicWall</a> in January 2022, 73% of respondents said they were concerned or extremely concerned about ransomware attacks. This was second only to targeted phishing attacks, which 77% of respondents said they were concerned or extremely concerned about.<br><br>SonicWall’s report also indicates that ransomware attacks grew by 105% in 2021 compared with the previous year, with 623.3 million attacks in total between January and December 2021. Since the annual numbers of ransomware attacks were a total of 187.9 million in 2019 and 304 million in 2020, we can say that organizations have a solid reason to be concerned about ransomware and the challenges arising from it. <br><br>Aside from 2022 trends below, the political and economic impact of the war in Ukraine, state-sponsored cyber-attacks, and the functioning “business model” of ransomware are likely to result in further increases in the number of ransomware attacks in the next few years. We do not expect ransomware attacks to slow down.</p>
 <br>Trends in 2022  
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.theiia.org/globalassets/documents/chapters-and-affiliates/north-america/united-states/georgia/atlanta/cyber-threat-landscape-2022.pdf">Deloitte</a> report states that the increase in cyber threats is directly related to digital transformation. The risk of getting exposed to malicious actors is increasing as businesses accelerate their dependency on digital services. This is contributing to the willingness of organizations to pay ransoms to keep the business running. An <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf">IC3</a> 2021 report forecasts that ransomware attacks in 2022 will focus on critical infrastructure, as governments accelerate their interests in digital transformation of the public health sector, the food and agriculture sector, commercial facilities, and the manufacturing sector.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>Ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS): There has been an <a href="https://www.venafi.com/blog/what-ransomware-service-raas-need-know-2022">increase</a> in demand for ransomware as a service in the past 18 months, and it is predicted to double its growth in 2022. <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/ransomware/ransomware-as-a-service-raas/">RaaS</a> is operated as a business model by the cyber-attack groups, where malicious solutions are made easily available to criminals. It is a subscription-based approach that makes ransomware accessible to criminals who have no expertise in this field. Moreover, the subscription includes attractive features such as customer support, licensing, subscription offers, customer reviews, and other research material to assist interested criminals in making their purchase decision. The subscription also includes access to analytics such as the status of the attack. RaaS is also offered as a profit-sharing solution, where the ransom is split between the RaaS operators and their customers. <br><br>Evolution of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs): As reported by <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/ransomware-threat-landscape-what-expect-2022">Symantec</a>, evolving tactics, techniques, and procedures will be the constant new threat from attackers in 2022. Ransomware operators have been using a combination of malware and OEM software features to generate new toolsets to launch attacks. PsExec and Cobalt strike ranked as the top two most frequently deployed TTPs for ransomware in 2021. Attackers in 2022 are focusing more on multi-extortion techniques by leaking the data of the victims and threatening to launch a DDoS attack as a follow up if ransom demands are not met. <a href="https://start.paloaltonetworks.com/unit-42-ransomware-threat-report.html">Palo Alto Networks</a> reported an increase of 85% in 2021 compared with 2020 in the number of victims of multi-extortion techniques. <br><br>Exploiting new software vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in software will continue to surface as long as there are attackers motivated to use it as a tool for ransomware. Recent examples include the Log4j vulnerability and evolution of ZLoader for deploying ransomware. For example, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/12/11/guidance-for-preventing-detecting-and-hunting-for-cve-2021-44228-log4j-2-exploitation/">Microsoft</a> reported a group of attackers from China exploited the Log4j vulnerability as a back door for infecting organizations with Nightsky ransomware. In 2022, ransomware operators will continue to take advantage of unpatched systems to launch attacks on vulnerable systems.<br><br></p>
 Recommendations 
<p>Believe in Zero Trust: Zero Trust is a security paradigm based on the principle of “Don’t trust. Verify!”. According to the Zero Trust concept, no device, user, workload, or system should be trusted by default. For further information, check out our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Comprehensive Guide to Zero Trust Implementation</a> insight.  &nbsp;<br><br>Create a Backup Strategy: Get prepared for the worst-case scenario. Plan and implement a backup strategy prior to experiencing an attack. <br><br>Do Planning: Create an incident response plan and allocate the tasks among security teams. Develop company-wide cybersecurity policies against ransomware. <br><br>Control Authentication and Authorization Methods: Manage your authentication and authorization methods, check privileged users, and if needed, separate duties and departments. <br><br>Deploy Endpoint Security Tools: Make sure that your devices are secured by an endpoint security product or service. Keep an eye on personal devices to eliminate Shadow IT risks. <br><br>Stay Updated: Patch and update your applications continuously. Keep your security leaders and other stakeholders well informed of the current state of ransomware attacks and cybersecurity trends. <br><br>Do not Click on Unknown Links: Avoid clicking on links and attachments from unknown websites and emails.</p>

<p>Around <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/online-shopping-statistics/">79% of the US population</a>, or 263 million consumers, are online buyers. The number will climb to 291.2 million in three years, making online stores a dominant way to purchase.</p><p>Despite these promising numbers, not every person that visits your online store is ready to convert. While potential customers may only browse something, compare products, or kill time on your website, you spend money on nurturing them.</p><p>So how to know which online shopper is worth the effort and which is&nbsp;not?</p><p>You should segment your target audience into types of online shoppers. Categorization will allow you to understand who you deal with, how to convert them, and whether it’s worth it at&nbsp;all.</p><p>This article covers the main groups of online customers to guide&nbsp;you.</p><p>Since there are no two identical customers, you need a custom approach for every person. Learn the most common types of online shoppers, what makes them drop off, and ways to convert&nbsp;them.</p> 1. Discount&nbsp;shoppers <p>Discount seekers (or best deal seekers) are not truly loyal to your brand and easily switch from one online store to another. It’s one of the most common types of shoppers. 97% of surveyed shoppers look for a deal when shopping, while 92% always seek the best deal. When these people find the product they need, they don’t usually purchase it right away. They google the necessary item to find it on multiple websites and compare the&nbsp;price.</p><p>Competing for this category is challenging since you won’t be able to offer the best price for everything. Regular discounts also aren’t an option since they will devalue your products.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Discount shoppers won’t convert if your benefits are not much better than the competitors’ ones. If they see that another store sells the same product cheaper (even a one-dollar difference), they will go there. These consumers may even have price comparison extensions in their browsers that automatically detect the website with the lowest price. A bargain-hunter may also delay the purchase if they believe that you will lower the price or provide a higher discount after some&nbsp;time.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>One of the simplest ways to convert a bargain-hunter is by giving them what they want. In a recent survey, most shoppers (52%) named percentage off as the best kind of discount. Flat dollar amount off, free shipping, and free products are also popular alternatives.</p><p>What kind of discount is the best for&nbsp;shoppers</p><p>Yet, you cannot live on occasional discounts only. Hence, apart from sales, you must also keep discount shoppers by building your brand. Use marketing to explain to consumers the benefits of buying from you, implement a loyalty program (following <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">our best practices</a>) to make them stick around, or offer unique products they cannot find elsewhere. It’s a more far-reaching approach than sales, coupon codes, or discounts.</p> 2. Wandering customers <p>Wandering buyers is another category of online shoppers that takes too much effort to make money. These guys spend a minimum amount to buy anything just for fun. They use quick Google Search or go from website to website, browsing pages and clicking on ads, to spend their free time. Maybe their work is too boring, or they don’t have what to do in the evening. These are also teenagers who love online shopping but cannot afford to buy. Anyway, wandering buyers are unlikely to stay loyal to one brand or make large, <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">frequent purchases</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this category of buyers has a high cart abandonment rate and often returns the purchased products. It means you will need to consider whether it’s worth targeting them carefully.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>They don’t come to your website with a clear intent and perceive shopping as an experience, not a necessity. Even if they buy something, the purchase is insignificant for a seller and doesn’t generate much&nbsp;revenue.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>Even though you shouldn’t focus on this target group, online stores have a smart way to convert them. Quick checkout is the secret weapon. When wanderers can purchase on your website in several clicks, they are the most likely to place an&nbsp;order.</p><p>You should make your checkout processes as smooth as possible and eliminate lengthy registration. Request only an email address and enable login through Gmail or social media websites.</p> 3. Need-based shoppers <p>These online buyers come to your website with a specific goal. They have a problem and need a particular product to solve it. That’s why need-based shoppers pay a lot of attention to detailed descriptions and often compare products on different websites. They rarely make emotional purchases or get something they haven’t planned to. Hence, instead of luring them into a purchase with a low price, you should stress&nbsp;quality.</p><p>Besides the product quality, need-based shoppers value relationships and flawless online customer experience. If they like what you offer and how you treat them, they will return to your brand and become repeat customers.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Need-based shoppers don’t convert because they are unsure whether your product meets the requirements. They either don’t have enough details about the product or doubt its quality. Overall, these buyers need the most time to make a purchase decision and don’t&nbsp;rush.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>There are many ways to nurture need-based leads to grow them into repeat customers. First, you have to create comprehensive product descriptions on your website. Indicate all valuable details (e.g., materials, size chart, colors, technical characteristics, etc.), add professional photos, and enable&nbsp;reviews.</p><p>Apart from that, create reliable support on your website. These may be a combination of web chat, phone, and email. Thanks to this, need-based consumers will be able to find answers to their questions to dispel doubts. They will perceive your website as more reliable.</p><p>Finally, invest in building a seamless customer journey and solid relationships. It’s essential to use multiple channels to connect with these customers and nurture them with quality&nbsp;content.</p> 4. Impulse&nbsp;buyers <p><a href="https://www.soocial.com/impulse-buying-statistics/#:~:text=95%25%20of%20Americans%20make%20in,would%20make%20an%20unplanned%20booking.">86% of Americans</a> have made impulse purchases online. It’s another large group of consumers to target. Like wandering customers, impulse shoppers don’t have a specific product in mind before placing an order. They are just navigating the web when the perfect match strikes them, and they realize they cannot live without it. Seconds after, they complete the purchase driven by emotions.</p><p>These customers are easy to upsell and open to recommendations. They are also ready to spend a lot on shopping and are generally quite profitable.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Impulse shoppers may change their minds and refuse to purchase if the checkout process is too time-consuming. As they fill out all details, emotions subside, and they take another look at the chosen product. They might notice it’s not as great as it seemed at first sight. Additional charges at the checkout, like expensive shipping, may also discourage this buyer group from completing purchases.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>When marketing and selling to impulse buyers, the main rule is to focus on emotions. Advertise your products as something super stylish and innovative every person should have. You may also consider running time-sensitive promotions to nudge website visitors into instant purchases. When a person realizes they have limited time to use a special offer, it triggers an emotional response.</p><p>Besides the listed approaches, you need to make the checkout quick and convenient. The faster instant buyers can place an order, the less likely they are to leave at the last&nbsp;moment.</p> 5. Loyal customers <p>Loyal customers are the favorite type of consumers across all businesses, no matter online or offline. These are brand ambassadors that frequently buy from you and invite friends. They make up 65% of a company’s business. They generate more revenue than other buyers but constitute a relatively small group since turning a lead into a loyal customer is a long process. It may take&nbsp;years.</p><p>Loyal customers also willingly leave positive reviews and comments if you ask them to. They spread a good word about your brand, convincing other people that you are an excellent choice. It’s good to attract new customers and convenience those who hesitate to buy a particular product.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>Loyal customers stop purchasing when you neglect them. They come across other brands as time goes by and may gradually switch to your competitors. They may also abandon you if one of their latest experiences was too disappointing. For example, they ordered an item, but it was never delivered. Such issues undermine loyalty and dispurt relationships.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>Loyalty campaigns are a standard yet still an effective way to generate and nurture loyal customers. <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/loyalty-program">66% of consumers</a> admit that rewards change their spending behavior (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">reward sites here</a>). Hence, by implementing such a program, you achieve two significant benefits. First, you create a roadmap to turn buyers into loyal customers step-by-step. Second, you provide existing loyals with bonuses to encourage repeat purchases.</p><p>In addition to loyalty programs, you may also show your special attitude to your brand ambassadors with custom messages. For example, send them a thank you postcard to express gratitude for staying with your brand for X years. A one-time discount or gift is also an&nbsp;option.</p> 6. Latest-product seekers <p>This category of buyers mainly resides in fashion and technology niches where novelty matters the most. These are the people who stand in queues outside Apple stores on the first day of product launch. They are obsessed with the latest products and readily pay several dollars more for something their peers don’t&nbsp;have.</p><p>For them, the price of the products you sell is less important than trends. Apart from novelty, they also value the brand story and image. You will need to put a lot of effort into brand marketing to make latest-product seekers&nbsp;convert.</p> Why they don’t&nbsp;purchase <p>These consumers won’t buy if you don’t sell trendy products or start selling them later than competitors. A poor image of your brand is an additional reason, among other factors, since latest-product seekers prefer renowned companies.</p> How to make them&nbsp;convert <p>You should be the first to distribute products that have just been released. It’s necessary to closely communicate with manufacturers to have such a privilege. Also, don’t forget to indicate the early access benefit on your website and your marketing materials.</p><p>You can also create online and print newsletters to inform buyers about new arrivals in advance. This way, fans of novelties will be waiting to purchase from you as soon as the new collection arrives.</p> Additional Tips on Converting Different Types of Online&nbsp;Shoppers <p>Besides the conversion tactics listed for each type of buyer, some universal approaches can also help. Check out these extra tips to consider in your marketing strategy:</p>  Remember that customers can change, and so should you. Even if someone was a discount seeker for years, they might become a need-based or loyal customer. The behavior also changes under the impact of external factors. For example, during holidays, <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/consumer-trends/holiday-impulse-purchase-statistics/">1 in 3 purchases is impulse</a>, which means other types of customers can act like impulse purchasers. Hence, you must continuously track your customer activity to adapt your sales approaches accordingly.  Calculate customer lifetime value before deciding whether you need to target a specific group. Different groups can bring different revenue and stay with your brand for several seconds to years. You’d better know what to expect before investing in reaching these consumers.  Implement marketing automation software for optimized and personalized marketing. Since you won’t be able to tailor messages to every customer without automation, advanced software is life-critical. You need tools that support triggered-based marketing and respond to customers based on their previous activity. They may, for example, email consumers tailored product selections based on what they’ve purchased, viewed, or added to favorites.   Why Not All Buyers Are Worth Nurturing <p>Before talking about the types of shoppers, we must say that not all leads deserve your attention. Customization is not only about tailoring your marketing and communication but also about channeling your&nbsp;efforts.</p><p>To engage a customer, online stores spend a lot of money. They invest in digital ads, remarketing, SEO optimization, content, and other elements of marketing and sales campaigns. If just another customer comes and leaves without placing an order, the investment on this lead never pays off. And the more leads fail to convert, the more money you put down the&nbsp;drain.</p><p>Therefore, you must understand what customers are the most profitable and what are unlikely to purchase. It’s valuable information to redistribute the marketing budget and choose the most effective customer acquisition and retention approaches.</p><p>We hope this information will help you segment your target audience and create an accurate customer persona. The types of customers you focus on should considerably impact your marketing and sales strategy.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Everybody wants an incentive to do something. Even when doing everyday things, people need external motivation.</p><p>Why should you exercise? Because you want to look good. Why should you eat at that particular restaurant? Because there’s a new menu item to try. Why do you buy groceries at this chain? Because you have a loyalty card and you get discounts.</p><p>This mindset is why incentive marketing works.</p> What Is Incentive Marketing? <p>Incentive marketing uses rewards and prizes for marketing a brand, product, or service. It is a highly effective marketing strategy that encourages consumers to spend&nbsp;money.</p><p>The Incentive Marketing Association explained the marketing strategy using an equation popular in psychology:</p><blockquote>Ability x Motivation = Performance</blockquote><p>This equation is primarily used in employment. People are hired for their ability. And when you add motivation or incentives, you can expect the person’s performance to&nbsp;improve.</p><p>This can easily be applied to marketing. For example, a customer is inclined to buy something from a specific brand because it manufactures high-quality products-or its ability to deliver. When you add motivation or incentive, such as a discount, you can increase&nbsp;sales.</p> Examples <p>Incentive marketing centers on consumer rewards to increase revenue and encourage customer loyalty. Some examples are <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/how-does-cash-back-work/">offering cash back</a>, having a <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty program</a> or <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">joining reward websites</a>. Here are a few more examples:</p> Buy One Get&nbsp;One <p>This is one of the most popular types of incentive marketing-the customer gets another unit of the same product for&nbsp;free.</p><p>A similar incentive can be an opportunity to buy a similar product at a discounted price. The central goal is to generate as many sales as possible.</p> Loyalty Programs <p>Existing customers are asked to sign up for a customer loyalty program for free, and they are given a card that is stamped every time they visit the store. Once they reach a certain number of stamps, they are rewarded with a free item or a discount.</p><p>In the digital age, many loyalty programs are now integrated into brand-specific mobile&nbsp;apps.</p><p>This is a very effective marketing tool because it instantly creates loyal customers. They have the motivation to keep coming back to get that prize after a certain number of visits or purchases.</p> Membership Rewards <p>Getting customers to sign up for a brand newsletter, mailing list, or membership can be challenging. These days, few consumers want to receive promotional emails from the brands they&nbsp;support.</p><p>But when you throw in a reward for signing up, your customers will be more than happy to do so. Rewards can come in the form of a discount every time they buy from the brand-another way to create customer loyalty. You can also give members a chance to purchase exclusive items that aren’t available to average customers.</p><p>Brands often require a membership fee for customers to enjoy premium items. In this case, the incentive should go beyond a simple member discount-a welcome basket with product samples, discount coupons, and exclusive offers can do&nbsp;wonders.</p><p>Another perk of membership is getting exclusive or first access to special brand promotions. They will also be among the first to be informed about sales and new product launches.</p> Raffle Draws <p>This is a popular incentive marketing tactic where customers that spend a certain amount of money will have a chance to win exciting prizes. For example, a grocery store can offer one raffle ticket for every $20 purchase. If they have a lot of enticing prizes, customers will spend more money to get as many raffle tickets as possible.</p><p>This simple yet effective strategy will increase sales and even encourage repeat and even impulsive sales. Because customers want more chances to win prizes, they will spend more money to get more raffle&nbsp;tickets.</p> Reward Points <p>A point program is another way to increase customer loyalty and encourage more sales. This is a financial reward that piles up whenever they purchase something from your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Reward points are given with each purchase. The points accumulate over time, and when enough points are collected, they can be converted to store credit. For example, for every $5 a customer spends, they get one reward point, and every 10 points are equivalent to $1 worth of credit. The customer can then use their store credits to purchase yet another&nbsp;product.</p><p>In this system, the customer is rewarded for their loyalty, and the brand benefits from yet another&nbsp;sale.</p> Exclusive Incentives <p>Some brands provide loyal customers or members with exclusive items and services. In some cases, chosen clientele will get early access to newly launched products or services. This is like having a chance to go to a premiere of a new movie a week before everybody else gets to watch&nbsp;it.</p><p>The incentive could also be the chance to own exclusive brand merchandise. It’s always exciting for a loyal customer to get something exclusive from a brand they&nbsp;support.</p> Why Is Incentive Marketing Important? <p>Almost everything we do in life is driven by motivation. Adults are motivated to work because we need food to eat and have a roof over our heads. Students are motivated to study because they want to get good grades and secure their&nbsp;futures.</p><p>What is important in one’s personal life is also important in business: motivation.</p><p>There are many incentive marketing strategies because they work. When offered these incentives, customers immediately get excited, which engages their attention and motivates them to purchase from&nbsp;brands.</p><p>When you integrate incentives into your marketing strategies, you can expect the following benefits:</p> Increase Profit <p>The exciting rewards offered by your incentive marketing programs will surely encourage customers to spend more and more money on your products or services. Loyalty programs, memberships, and discounts are meant to entice customers to open their wallets and bring in&nbsp;revenue.</p><p>To ensure continuous profits and long-term growth, you must structure your incentives to your brand’s advantage. Even when you give away something to your loyal customers for free, you must receive something in return, and exponentially so. Crunch the numbers and ensure that no matter how many attractive incentives you offer, you are still getting more from your customers than you are giving&nbsp;away.</p> Expand Clientele <p>When people hear about a particular brand’s attractive incentive program, they are much more inclined to check out their products and become a customer themselves. Even a loyal customer of a competing brand would be tempted to switch if the reward is especially enticing.</p><p>Aside from planning and building your own incentive marketing strategies, you should also study what your competitors offer. Try to construct ways to offer better and more attractive rewards than other related brands so you can bring more of your target audience into the&nbsp;fold.</p><p>When you gain more customers, you boost your profits, and you can enjoy business success for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p> Develop Relationships <p>When you offer fantastic marketing incentives, you will continuously expand your base of loyal customers. When your customers feel well taken care of by your brand, and you give them something in return for your loyalty, they will not shop from any of your competitors.</p><p>This creates an emotional bond that benefits both parties. The customer will become more and more attached to your brand, support every new product release, and even become an unwitting brand ambassador in their social circle. A simple word-of-mouth recommendation or social media post from an enthusiastic, loyal customer can do wonders for brand awareness.</p><p>When other people see a customer’s loyalty, they would be curious about it. And this simple curiosity may lead them to try something from your brand, too. One purchase can lead to another, and loyalty can be built as well. The chain continues and expands even further to create more connections and beneficial relationships.</p><p>This type of support cannot be bought or created in any other way, so it must be treasured and cultivated as much as possible by keeping customers happy.</p> 5 Ways to Use Marketing Incentives to Grow Your&nbsp;Business <p>Incentive marketing breeds customer loyalty. It can also help you grow your business. Here are the ways it could help your&nbsp;brand:</p> 1. Brand Awareness <p>Incentive marketing is a great way to introduce the brand to the public. Many new businesses offer free product samples when they start out; it’s one of the easiest ways to spread the word about a new entity in the industry.</p><p>For new restaurants or food products, the brand may offer free tasting during its launch. Companies offering new services may offer discounts during their first few days of operations.</p><p>Despite giving away products and services for free, brands must ensure they are of excellent quality for customers to want to come back and spend&nbsp;money.</p> 2. Lead Generation <p>Incentive marketing is also a great way to generate leads. You can offer customers or potential clientele ebooks, digital coupons, and other digital products in exchange for their names and email addresses. They will then be enrolled on your email marketing list, and you can send them more brand content that they can engage&nbsp;with.</p><p>An incentive will make marketing emails more tolerable to the recipient. Without an incentive, people might just consider your email as&nbsp;spam.</p> 3. Referral&nbsp;Programs <p>A referral program is another way to leverage marketing incentives to grow your business. You can offer something to your existing customers, and in return, they will give you a friend’s name and contact details for customer acquisition.</p><p>For example, you can offer a coupon for a 10% discount on a product or service for every person referred by your customers. There are endless variations of marketing incentives for referrals to increase customer acquisition.</p> 4. Encourage More Purchases <p>There are plenty of promotions you can carry out to encourage people to keep buying. There are loyalty programs through which customers can get free products or services once they rack up enough points. The more they spend on the brand, the more free stuff they get. Raffle draws also encourage sales-the more they spend, the more chances they have to&nbsp;win.</p><p>The more promotions you offer, the more the business will grow as loyal customers keep coming back and supporting the&nbsp;brand.</p> 5. Increase Retention Rate <p>Attracting new customers is essential, but one of the hallmarks of a successful business is its ability to retain them and create a vast loyal following.</p><p>Loyalty programs, exclusive marketing incentives, and membership programs are crucial strategies to retain customers and eventually turn them into loyal allies of the brand. This is easier said than done-you must give customers a reason to keep supporting your brand instead of opting for the competition.</p><p>These loyal customers will not just keep bringing in revenue. They are also crucial in converting their social network into supporting your brand and buying from you as&nbsp;well.</p> Best Practices for Marketing Incentives <p>Why do some incentive programs work and others don’t? How do you ensure that you aren’t wasting your time and money creating campaigns that will fall&nbsp;flat?</p><p>Here are some of the best practices that will help you build effective and profitable incentive marketing programs:</p> 1. Keep It&nbsp;Simple <p>The design principle <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikekappel/2021/09/15/keep-it-simple-stupid-applying-the-kiss-principle-to-reports-marketing--beyond/?sh=20fa5d437913">KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) </a>works for just about every aspect of marketing. It’s important to keep your incentive marketing strategies and procedures easy to understand and implement.</p><p>This is why loyalty cards and membership programs work-brands have been using them for decades, and they are incredibly easy to understand. All you need to do is provide customers with loyalty cards that cashiers will stamp whenever they go in for a purchase. As soon as the number of stamps has been achieved, the customer gets an incentive, usually a free&nbsp;product.</p><p>Starbucks runs one of the most famous and effective loyalty programs-their loyalty card has now become a rewards app. As the brand loves to say, “free coffee is a tap away.” Starbucks rewards purchases with a certain number of stars. And when customers get 50 stars, they get a free coffee, tea, or bakery&nbsp;item.</p> 2. Send Updates and Reminders <p>It’s always a good strategy to let customers know that you care. Sending them updates about special promotions or incentives will make them feel like their participation in these activities is essential.</p><p>Often, when the rewards expire, so does the customer’s loyalty. This is why brands must do everything they can to remind customers of the incentives they’re missing. So if the customer is unable to enjoy their reward for any reason, the brand is not to&nbsp;blame.</p><p>One of the best examples of this type of customer service is Tarte Cosmetics. Those who register for the brand’s perkswill immediately earn 100 points by signing up for a membership. They earn points when they shop from the brand and redeem them for exclusive rewards. Each month, the brand sends monthly roundup emails that summarize the customer’s rewards points and loyalty&nbsp;status.</p> 3. Make Sure Incentives Go Back to the&nbsp;Brand <p>It’s not an effective incentive marketing strategy if your business loses money when you implement it. The structure and implementation of your marketing efforts must benefit your brand and no one else. You must encourage as many sales as possible and continuously generate revenue as you entice more and more customers to opt&nbsp;in.</p><p>Customer rewards and incentives should not cost your brand too much. You must plan and execute these marketing campaigns to ensure that centering customer experience will not compromise your bottom&nbsp;line.</p> 4. Personalized Customer Relationship <p>Offering rewards for a loyal customer’s birthday and giving them something special is one of the best incentive marketing practices you can implement.</p><p>For example, birthday celebrants can enjoy a scoop of ice cream from Baskin Robbins or a $10 to $15 birthday gift from Victoria’s Secret.</p> 5. Know Your&nbsp;Customer <p>Market research is one of the most critical elements of an effective marketing campaign. If you don’t know your audience and your customers, you will not be able to target and calibrate your strategies to engage&nbsp;them.</p><p>When you know your customers, you know what incentives and offers they will be excited about. A great example is 7-Eleven giving away free Slurpees on June 11, which is now known as National Free Slurpee Day. After all, Slurpees are their signature product, and customers all over the world love&nbsp;them!</p> Conclusion <p>According to the Incentive Theory, a person’s behavior is dictated by the desire for external rewards. This is human nature, and it is the reason why incentive marketing works.</p><p>Some people think of incentive marketing programs as a fad or a cheap ploy to gain more customers. However, their resiliency and widespread use by the biggest brands in the world is proof that they still work. Incentives will always attract interested customers, who have the potential to become loyal brand ambassadors when the rewards programs give them something in&nbsp;return.</p><p>Creating clever and effective incentive marketing techniques will make your customers very happy and benefit your brand for years to&nbsp;come!</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

 Problems with Passwords 
<p>Are passwords the weakest link in cybersecurity? We all know that it is risky to authenticate workers, citizens, and customers with passwords. The proof is in the seemingly endless list of credential-based security breaches that we see in the news every day.<br>
There is also no doubting the devastating business impact of these breaches. It’s estimated that the average ransomware payment reaches almost $1.5 million and the average cost of business interruption from ransomware tops $5 million, according to a Lockton report.<br>
But what is actually the root cause of all of these breaches? Passwords really aren’t the problem. It’s anonymous users hiding behind compromised credentials that represent the weakest link in cyber security.<br>
What can we use instead of passwords that will prevent these breaches and keep our workforce, citizens, and customers safe? And when we finally decide to go passwordless, what should our strategy be? If eliminating passwords isn’t enough, what are the three things that are missing in your current passwordless strategy?</p>
 
1. Password Reset 
<p>When you go passwordless, it’s almost impossible to get rid of all of your passwords simultaneously. That’s why it’s important to build a password reset mechanism into your passwordless strategy. With BlockID Workforce, the user never has to contact the help desk to reset a legacy password. Instead, all a user needs to do is open the account screen on his or her BlockID application, select the persona associated with the invalid password, enter and confirm a new password, and authenticate with LiveID. Not only does self-service password reset create a substantially easier user experience, it also saves your company $50-$70 each time a user doesn’t need to contact the help desk to reset their password. Another benefit with 1Kosmos legacy password self-service is that in less than 30 minutes, BlockID can integrate with your workstation, network, cloud apps, remote access solutions, or identity platforms.</p>
 
2. Interoperability 
<p>You work with a multitude of platforms, all with a multitude of requirements and technologies, making it difficult to scale, securely manage, and modernize. Today one of the biggest challenges organizations face is interoperability. Interoperability is one of the limiting factors to digital transformations and passwordless experiences. You need to blend the new with the old to deliver services and data securely and efficiently. But how? You can’t rip and replace everything as that’s cost-prohibitive. When looking to new security standards your investment needs to look beyond the problem at hand. Many times when asking prospects what their 1-3-5 year road map is, they don’t have one, and that’s a problem. Without a plan, we end up with siloed infrastructures held together with duct tape and hope. So when investing in new technologies there are a couple of questions you need to ask yourself:</p>
 
 Is it built on modern architectures, and will it meet demands beyond my current needs? 
 Does it have open APIs and an SDK so that you can integrate with new and old technologies? 
 Can it scale to meet current and future requirements? 
 Is it certified? Does the technology adhere to industry standards and regulations like – ISO/IEC 27001, Kantara for Identity Proofing, FIDO for Passwordless and iBeta Biometric certification, etc.? 
 
<p>Answering these questions can set you on the path to success as you’ll implement a technology that is fit for purpose and will grow with the business. You’ll be able to connect the old with the new while you continue down your modernization path keeping everything online, accessible and secure.</p>
 
3. Identity 
<p>Identity is the foundational element to security. It’s critical you know who is accessing resources, so you can better determine what they should or shouldn’t have access to. The more you know about that identity the better. That’s why the 1Kosmos BlockID platform ensures that individuals are who they claim to be by using an identity-based approach to authentication. We bring worker, citizen, and customer identity into the security perimeter so that organizations know with certainty who is accessing IT assets and online services.<br>
This means we have a quick and convenient way for users to self verify their identity using government, telco, and banking credentials. Then, once verified, workers, citizens, and customers use their digital identity to be utilized at login or transaction approval. This provides users with a frictionless experience and organizations with a high level of assurance for the identity on the other side of the digital connection.<br>
By adding identity as a key pillar to network security, we help CISOs and Digital Experience leaders regain control of their IT services from anonymous users hiding behind compromised logins. With identity based authentication, organizations will no longer be held hostage to data breaches, ransomware, and financial fraud perpetrated via identity deception.</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning more? Edward Amoroso and I dig much deeper into all three of these points in our on-demand webinar, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/webinars/identity-based-authentication-journey-to-passwordless/">Identity-Based Authentication and the Journey to Passwordless</a>. Watch the session to explore passwordless security, zero trust, and understanding who is on the other side of your digital connections.</p>

				  ​Over 1 Billion People Worldwide Lack Legal ID 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m currently a member of the Trust Over IP Foundation <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/SSI+Harms+%28BGBU%29+Task+Force">SSI harms task force</a>, where we’re working to produce a white paper examining the design features of digital ID systems. This short post aims to identify some of the harms and disadvantages that SSI introduces and ways to mitigate those harms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today about 50% of the world’s population uses the internet, and according to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2017/10/12/11-billion-invisible-people-without-id-are-priority-for-new-high-level-advisory-council-on-identification-for-development">World Bank</a>, over one billion (10%) people worldwide lack some form of legal ID, and even more, they don’t have a digital trail, excluding them from participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, there are <a href="https://youtu.be/1-V7lyxrOmw?t=145">divides within</a>; 60% of those people live in lower and middle-income countries, 50% are in sub-Saharan Africa, and about 40% of the women in lower-income countries don’t have access to Identity. Inclusion in identity product and process design is necessary to enable economic growth and financial inclusion for excluded demographics. We need to prioritize inclusion to avoid exacerbating some of the existing divides.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I joined this task force because I wanted to learn more about how SSI and identity products can be harmful to people. I didn’t realize how much damage these products can do, but now I am more aware of the dangers. I am committed to doing what I can to help mitigate these harms, but I also recognize that I still have a lot to learn and work to do. Hopefully, the SSI harms task force can create a meaningful white paper that will be applied by organizations and governments building frameworks worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Does Digital Identity Mean?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID can provide an electronic version of trusted government identification. It offers better security and more robust privacy and can be stored securely on smartphones and other digital devices. Governments and organizations worldwide are developing digital identity frameworks enabling people and businesses to prove their identities online and in person, offering more effortless ways to access online services.</p>
<p>These frameworks are built on the idea that each person has unique, verifiable credentials used to sign up for programs, file taxes, and more, allowing people to control their data and share it with organizations as they see fit. It will also help protect people’s personal information by reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.</p>
<p>Good digital identity is based on convenience, security, and privacy. Convenient because it allows people to access government services and information online without visiting a physical office. It is secure because it is based on distributed ledger technology and private because it shares only the information that people want to share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why do Frameworks Need to be Inclusive? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital identity frameworks aim to create a standard for verification and authenticating identities in a digital space. Frameworks must be inclusive to be effective. Inclusion is key to creating an identity system that allows people to prove their identities without having to reveal too much personal information. An inclusive digital identity framework will also help combat fraud and identity theft while making it easier for people to access services and goods online safely and securely.</p>
<p>Many frameworks are being developed worldwide, but the most notable is the European Union’s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> and Canada’s <a href="https://diacc.ca/">DIACC</a>. These frameworks are essential for online interactions. However, most current digital identity frameworks are not entirely inclusive, leading to many negative consequences.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of the digital identity ecosystem is that it can help reduce online fraud. However, if the framework is not inclusive, it can <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/from-cheating-banks-to-faking-identity-aadhaar-frauds-peak-in-2018-report-118052300151_1.html">increase fraud</a> and even discrimination. For example, if identifying documents include a strict gender (or “sex”) marker, it can prevent transgender people from accessing essential services. More importantly, this categorization creates a basis for discrimination and inequality.</p>
<p>In addition, exclusionary digital identity frameworks can limit social and economic opportunities. For example, suppose a digital identity framework does not allow for the use of alternative identities (i.e. passport from another country). In that case, it can prevent marginalized groups from participating in the online economy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, inclusive digital identity frameworks are essential for enabling secure and efficient online interactions for all members of society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 When Frameworks Fail 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though digital IDs offer many benefits, they can also create exclusionary effects if not implemented properly. In India, the <a href="https://uidai.gov.in/">Aadhaar</a> program, despite its success, is still <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesks-money-reimagined/a-best-of-holiday-special-of-2021-indias-digital-identity-system/">plagued with technical failures</a> and exclusions. <a href="https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~kamurali/papers/Working%20Papers/ABBA%20(NBER%20WP%2026744).pdf">Evidence</a> shows that compulsory biometric authentication for the public food distribution system leads<a href="https://www.epw.in/journal/2017/50/special-articles/aadhaar-and-food-security-jharkhand.html"> to exclusion problems</a> and increased transaction costs. Many residents have been unable to access their IDs once issued; widowed mothers with children and the elderly who couldn’t pass authentication tests could not access social services or the public food distribution system. These failures can stem from anything by not being able to input your fingerprint or misplacing the ID number. All situations leave residents, especially vulnerable groups, unable to access essential social services. Consider that Aadhaar was initially created to increase inclusion, and things become a bit more confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Biometric authentication has also raised privacy and data misuse concerns. India has faced significant pushback against biometric national ID systems due to concerns regarding safety and misuse of collected data. Children below the age of 5 were issued Aadhar numbers with their <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/uidai-should-review-issue-of-aadhaar-to-children-below-5-yrs-cag-122040601441_1.html">parents’ biometric data</a>. This caused cases where different residents were given Aadhaar numbers with the same biometric data, exposing flaws in the process and issuance of Aadhaars on faulty biometrics and documents. In light of this, it is crucial to ensure that solid data privacy and security frameworks and systems are in place.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons to implementing digital ID requirements. It can help reduce corruption and ensure that only those meant to benefit from a program do. Yet, it can also create exclusion problems for vulnerable groups and increase transaction costs. Below are a few great stories highlighting the importance of inclusive identity frameworks.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				  
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  How Can We Ensure Inclusiveness?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensuring inclusiveness in identity products means taking a human-centred design approach. When designing a new product, it’s essential to think about the people using it, and they should be your focus when creating the product. Too often, designers focus on the technology or the business case without considering the people using the product.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.accessnow.org/usha-ramanathan-human-rights-hero/">Dr. Usha Ramanathan</a> points out in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesks-money-reimagined/a-best-of-holiday-special-of-2021-indias-digital-identity-system/">CoinDesk’s Money Reimagined</a> that in India, the well-off tech guys wanted to produce technology for the poor. However, the tech guys don’t know what it’s like to live in poverty. In the name of providing identity to people, the tech guys wanted to create technology for the poor that would, in turn, control their lives. There were claims that the poor lacked access to identity documents and couldn’t get welfare, but this was untrue. Dr. Ramanathan notes that less than 1% of the population lacked identity documents, so these claims were just an excuse for the project.</p>
<p>It’s about designing for people from different cultures and with different needs by people in those same groups. This includes people with different economic backgrounds, gender identities and sexual orientations. Digital Identity inclusiveness is about creating a product that everyone can use, regardless of their background or abilities. We all need to work together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inclusion is important in all aspects of life, including digital identity products. By ensuring that everyone is included in the development process, we can create products that meet the needs of everyone. This article discussed the importance of inclusion and outlined some ways we can make sure everyone is included in the development of digital identity products. Ensuring that the most vulnerable are included in the systems that the privileged take for granted every day is vital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Last week saw the collapse of TerraUSD (UST), the algorithmic "stablecoin" created by Terraform Labs. Intended to maintain a peg to the US dollar, the value of 1 UST plummeted from $1 to a low of just 9 cents – leading to billions of dollars in losses for UST holders.

<p>Upgrading your DID currently requires a deposit of 2 KILT. Let’s dive into why this deposit exists and how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>First it’s important to understand how DIDs (decentralized identifiers) form the core of your digital identity on KILT. After <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Create-KILT-Sporran-Identity.pdf">generating your DID in the Sporran wallet</a> for free, you can start building your digital identity by adding <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">credentials</a> such as your social media&nbsp;handles.</p><p><a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/Upgrading-to-on-chain-DID.pdf">Upgrading your free DID to an on-chain DID</a> and anchoring it on the KILT blockchain enables applications “built on KILT” that make Web3 more accessible. For instance, you can add a unique, easily readable <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/introducing-web3name-your-unique-digital-name-for-web3-the-internet-of-the-future-c301a18f75e8">web3name</a> to represent the DID’s string of numbers and letters. You can also link some of your credentials publicly, adding an extra layer of verification to your identity. You can also use your on-chain DID to sign any digital files — PDFs, audio, video, software — privately and securely using&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a>.</p><p>In simple terms, a blockchain is a digital, decentralized database, or record of transactions. Each digital bookkeeper in the system (in this case, collators on the KILT blockchain), has a copy of all the transactions on the chain. Since this amounts to a lot of data that is continually being replicated and must be accessible, it’s important that unnecessary data be&nbsp;deleted.</p><p>As a Kusama parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem, KILT uses an energy-efficient system in which the fee required to write and store this data on the blockchain is calculated <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-price-of-gas-why-kilt-chose-polkadot-over-ethereum-6bef9006a305">based on the size of the transaction</a>.</p><p>A simple token transfer or writing a hash (a number to represent data) on the KILT blockchain doesn’t use much computing or storage power, allowing low fees for transactions and credentials — as little as a few cents. In contrast, an on-chain DID requires a lot more storage power, as a DID can hold many different keys and endpoints in order to facilitate its functions. All this data needs to be stored on the KILT blockchain for permanent accessibility. Using a formula based on these storage needs, the sum of 2 KILT was calculated to meet these&nbsp;costs.</p> Deposits vs.&nbsp;Fees <p>Instead of charging a 2 KILT fee for an on-chain DID, deposits encourage users to delete DIDs they no longer need, and deters spamming.</p><p>The deposit stays on the balance of the account that paid, but is locked and can’t be used for transfers, staking or voting. If the DID owner later chooses to delete their on-chain DID, the collators (who run the KILT servers) will delete this DID from their database so that it is just recorded in the history but no longer occupies storage. The 2 KILT Coins are then unlocked and added to the payee’s free balance (minus a small transaction fee). This creates an incentive to delete unused DIDs rather than leaving them sitting on the blockchain and wasting storage&nbsp;space.</p> Scalability <p>However, since the total supply of pre-minted KILT Coins was around 150 million KILT Coins at genesis, isn’t this limiting the potential of the KILT blockchain to hold more than 75 million DIDs? Especially considering other factors such as the need for KILT Coins to pay transaction fees, for staking, for Treasury funding, and for future projects on the&nbsp;roadmap?</p><p>This is where the flexibility of the KILT blockchain comes into play, allowing governance on KILT to change the deposit as circumstances change. As the number of on-chain DIDs increases and more KILT Coins are locked as deposits, KILT Coin holders can propose and vote in an on-chain referendum to lower the deposit for future DIDs. A vote may also be initiated by any KILT Coin holder if the price of the KILT Coin should change in a way that makes the deposit unreasonably expensive.</p> Transferring Deposit&nbsp;Fees <p>While a change in the cost of a deposit for an on-chain DID may not be a major issue for individuals, even a small change could be significant for companies who have paid the deposit for a large number of employees. In this case, rather than being locked into the original deposit, they have the option of unlocking the difference. In that case, if the deposit was initially 2 KILT and was then reduced to 0.5, for example, then the company could unlock 1.5 KILT Coins for each deposit paid, while still covering the 0.5 deposit on the individual employee’s account for their&nbsp;DID.</p> Enabling Web3 <p>KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. On-chain DIDs and DIDsign are one step towards achieving this, using the KILT blockchain to create a decentralized digital identity and to sign digital documents privately and safely without unnecessary sharing of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Discover more about KILT on its <a href="https://www.kilt.io/treasury/overview/">website</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">blog</a>, brainstorm KILT use cases in <a href="https://discord.com/channels/847445252663148565/856523327011291137">Discord</a>, or follow KILT on <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest news.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>As discussed in the last edition of KC Navigator, public sector organizations are increasingly early adopters in digital identity, digital transformation, and cybersecurity, providing the opportunity for private sector organizations to learn from public sector implementations and follow their lead.</p>
<p>Within cybersecurity, government adoption of a Zero Trust approach to security, particularly in the US, is a prime example of where the public sector is providing a lead for the private sector to follow because both sectors are potential targets of the same cyber threats.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is not a new concept, but developments in technological capabilities, changes in the way people are working, accelerated adoption of cloud and Edge computing, and the continued evolution of cyberthreats have resulted in Zero Trust rising to prominence.</p>
<p>As organizations seek to improve their security capabilities, many are considering Zero Trust, but they are also looking at the concept of Secure Access Edge (SASE) which has risen to prominence for the same reasons as Zero Trust.</p>
<p>As a result, organizations are evaluating both Zero Trust and SASE to determine whether to adopt either, one, or both. It is therefore important to understand what each can potentially deliver and the exact nature of the relationship between them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>SASE refers to a concept that combines cloud-based software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) with a range of security services and unified management functionality for delivering security and SD-WAN capabilities to any edge computing location, such as branch offices, home offices, cloud services and storage, OT, and IoT.</p>
<p>SASE is designed to address the performance bottleneck issues of traditional networks that rely on traffic backhauling. Additionally, by integrating identity, business context and real-time risk assessment into every connection, SASE architectures promise to prevent a variety of cyber-attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the definition, SASE solutions typically include a networking component such as a software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) plus a wide range of security components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These security components are added to secure the communication on the network from end to end, provide consistent policy management and enforcement, add security analytics, and enable an integrated administration capability to manage every connection from everything to every resource.</p>
<p>These components typically include Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), which means a Zero Trust approach to security is one of the security components that enables SASE. In a sense, then, SASE is dependent on Zero Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero Trust is widely regarded as critical to protecting IT systems, data, and infrastructure because it is imperative that all organizations shift away from the traditional perimeter-based approach to security, which is no longer fit for purpose in an era of cloud computing and remote working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most important point to be understood about Zero Trust, is that it is not a product or solution that can be purchased and retrofitted over existing systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero Trust is an approach to security based on the assumption that networks can and will be breached, and the principle of “never trust, always verify”. Zero Trust, therefore, is essentially a concept and an architecture model.</p>
<p>Unlike the traditional approach of verifying once at the perimeter and then implicitly trusting everything and everyone within the perimeter, Zero Trust is about continual verification of each user, device, application, and transaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementing a Zero Trust approach, therefore, is about shifting to a trusted identity-based model of security that secures data, while ensuring it is accessible to those who need it. This increases security, boosts productivity, blocks lateral movement by attackers, and therefore often involves restructuring how resources are secured and accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this shift can involve the deployment of new tools, it often simply requires a focus on reusing existing tools, and redesigning security processes and policies. Therefore, Zero Trust is not something that can be implemented overnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a journey that begins with a long-term business strategy and focuses on a step-by-step implementation, using existing or readily available tools and technologies, while avoiding adding even more complexity to the existing architecture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Zero Trust is one of the security components that enables SASE, they appear to be complementary, but their relationship is a little more complicated. SASE solutions often include ZTNA as one of the capabilities, but it may be debated whether the reliance on SD-WAN as the underlying infrastructure does not stand in contrast to the basic principles of Zero Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risk is to assume that SD-WAN is always secure and can be trusted, but trusting a single element in the multi-layered security stack is the exact opposite of what zero trust is about. Therefore, is it important to consider this risk in any SASE implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the relationship between SASE and Zero Trust is largely complementary, so much so, that a well implemented Zero Trust strategy may address the security needs that some organizations might seek to address with SASE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another risk associated with SASE is the risk of supplier lock-in. If SASE is a one-stop shop, then the risk of being locked into the approach of a single supplier – sometimes with few selected partners – is great. SASE needs to evolve to become an open, flexible, standards-based architecture, where different services from different providers can be easily combined.</p>
<p>Considering these risks, it is recommended that organizations adopt a use case-based approach to any potential SASE implementation. Once the use cases are identified and understood, they may well be met by Zero Trust alone, which may be a better overall fit for your organization’s needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally speaking, SASE solutions may be a better fit for a traditional heterogeneous organization, however, even organizations with a lot of traditional IT are well advised to think about the use cases where they really will benefit from SASE, which is essentially an “old school” approach. For cloud-native startups, there really need to be very good reasons to opt for a SASE solution, which is likely to foster a tendency to conserve traditional approaches rather than moving to a more modern approach.</p>
<p>If, however, after the use cases have been carefully considered, SASE still seems like the best way to go, it is important to understand the risks of SD-WAN and supplier lock-in, and then ascertain exactly what is included in any prospective SASE solution to ensure that it contains everything necessary to meet current and future requirements.</p>
<p>Before going ahead with a SASE implementation, verify that it is a viable solution in your context and be clear whether SASE is a tactic to solve an immediate problem in the short term, or whether it is a strategic solution with benefits in the longer term.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the final analysis then, where SASE implementations make sense and Zero Trust alone is not enough to meet specific security requirements, SASE and Zero Trust are perfect twins with Zero Trust enabling and complementing SASE, but the risk of SD-WAN should not be overlooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In an <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/selectively-disclosed-verifiable-credentials-79a236b81ee2">earlier article</a> on ZKPs written at the end of 2020, we have taken a closer look at the core principles of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, their usage in Verifiable Credentials, and the state of available implementations back then. Now, in 2022 ZKPs are increasingly used as a solution for some of the blockchains’ scalability issues. We have also started to see improvements in its usage for privacy enhancements, though the topic of privacy seems to be in an earlier stage than scalability.</p> Primer on&nbsp;ZKPs <p>Essentially, a ZKP is all about trust between multiple parties. In simpler terms, this means one party is able to prove to a second party that it holds a certain piece of information without disclosing the relevant information to the receiving party. For instance, proving to the cashier that you are older than 21 without revealing your actual age. To get a better idea of ZKPs core principles, please refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c">this ELI5&nbsp;video</a>.</p> ZKP Infrastructure and&nbsp;Tooling <p>ZKP solutions discussed in this section focus on improving whole blockchain networks or on providing specialized tools for those. For blockchain networks, ZKPs can help with keeping the ledger size consistent or with providing an overall more efficient approach to Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). SDKs and tools can in return be used for writing ZKP logic and for compiling this logic into <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66037/what-is-the-role-of-a-circuit-in-zk-snarks">ZKP circuits</a>.</p> Mina Protocol <p><a href="https://minaprotocol.com/">Mina Protocol</a> is a layer 1 protocol that takes blockchain infrastructure to a new level by basing blockchain interactions on ZKPs. While other scaling solutions aim to decrease transaction size and cost, Mina has a more holistic approach. <a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en">Mina is a succinct blockchain, with a constant size of about</a>&nbsp;22KB.</p><p>With Mina, ZKPs are directly integrated into smart contracts and so-called zkApps that can be built using those ZKP-enabled smart contracts. zkApps manage their state off-chain (mostly synchronously) and then store a proof of their state on-chain once the computation is finished. Thus, Mina and zkApps allow the building of highly efficient applications. Fortunately, zkApps are built using Typescript not requiring learning a special-purpose programming language like Solidity with Ethereum.</p><a href="https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/zkapps">zkApp Architecture [2]</a> StarkNet/StarkEx <p><a href="https://starkware.co/starknet/">StarkNet</a> is a layer 2 network for Ethereum using the “StarkEx Protocol” for providing faster and more cost-effective transactions and increased privacy. Instead of directly sending transactions to layer 1 Ethereum, StarkEx uses <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/">zkRollups</a> for creating proofs for the transaction on layer 2 and then stores those proofs in batches on layer&nbsp;1.</p><p>The StarkEx Protocol is defined in five different components, i.e., <a href="https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/overview">Application, StarkEx Service, SHARP, Stark Verifier, and StarkEx Contracts</a> of which some are acting on-chain and others off-chain.</p><a href="https://docs.starkware.co/starkex-v4/overview">StarkEx (high-level)</a> architecture<p>The high-level architecture above shows how users will use an Ethereum-based application that sends transactions to the StarkEx Service. This service uses StarkWare’s <a href="https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/">Cairo language for creating zero-knowledge programs</a> that prove the application-relevant state. After a proof has been computed off-chain it is stored on-chain using StarkEx Contracts. The Stark Verifier can then be used to verify the proofs by either checking the state of the StarkEx Contract or by using the SHARP service in case one needs to prove the states of multiple different applications at&nbsp;once.</p> <a href="https://dusk.network/">DuskNet</a> <p><a href="https://dusk.network/">DuskNet</a> is a business-oriented ZKP-based blockchain with fast transactions for building <a href="https://research.binance.com/en/projects/dusk-network">privacy-preserving smart contracts and confidential tokens for the financial sector</a> that respect confidentiality agreements. Driving factors for DuskNet are mostly privacy concerns and compliance with GDPR rules and the essential need of companies to keep information secure.</p><p>To provide these properties in a blockchain network, <a href="https://dusk.network/news/zero-knowledge-plonk-demo">DuskNet uses PLONKs</a> that are in general faster than <a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/bulletproofs/">bulletproofs</a> but in need of a trusted setup. For more information on PLONKs, I can recommend <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/09/22/plonk.html">this blog from&nbsp;Vitalik</a>.</p><p>One interesting use case of DuskNet is the <a href="https://dusk.network/cases/security-tokens">XSC Security Token Standard</a>, which provides permission management for an asset's lifecycle. The ledger records all transactions, but the access rights of token holders are not lost once a token holder fails on a transaction or the access keys are lost. This property is an important requirement of securities law.</p> Nightfall 3 <p><a href="https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall_3">EY’s Nightfall 3</a> provides a secure and privacy-preserving solution for transacting ERC-20 tokens as well as ERC-721 tokens at low cost. <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/news/2021/07/ey-contributes-a-zero-knowledge-proof-layer-2-protocol-into-the-public-domain-to-help-address-increasing-transaction-costs-on-ethereum-blockchain">The successor of EY’s Nightfall called Nightfall 3 aims to improve the performance of such transactions even more while simplifying the developer experience</a>. In addition, Nightfall 3 provides the ability to transfer ERC-1155&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Nightfall’s performance improvements are achieved by combining the existing ZK solution with o<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/">ptimistic rollups</a>, creating a ZK-optimistic rollup hybrid. In this scheme, ZK transactions are grouped and then sent to the ledger as an optimistic rollup.</p> Aleo <p><a href="https://www.aleo.org/post/the-future-of-zero-knowledge-with-aleo">Aleo</a> promises to be the <a href="https://www.aleo.org/post/the-future-of-zero-knowledge-with-aleo#:~:text=Aleo%20is%20the%20first%20decentralized,%2C%20consumer%2C%20and%20enterprise%20needs.">“first decentralized, open source platform to enable both private and programmable applications”</a>. To further encourage the benefits Aleo uses the example of DEXs like Uniswap. A DEX on Aleo would keep the number of tokens you own disclosed or hide from where you got those tokens in the first place. Furthermore, all of this privacy is enabled without removing the ability to integrate with data from public blockchains.</p><p>Aleo comes with a variety of tools that should help new developers to build applications using&nbsp;Aleo.</p><p>Leo — Aleos programming language inspired by JavaScript, Rust, and Scala for writing ZKP applications.</p><p>Aleo Studio — Aleos IDE for writing applications with&nbsp;Leo.</p><p>Aleo Package Manager — For publishing the packages and applications written with Aleo&nbsp;Studio.</p><p>snarkOS — A decentralized OS for running Aleo. SnarkOS contains important logical components for writing ZKP applications and for proving states publicly.</p> ZKP Applications <p>Once you have decided on a certain infrastructure, may it be a ZKP-based blockchain network or a non-ZKP network you can build your own application. This is where ZKPs get interesting for the common user as the benefits are becoming more and more obvious at this&nbsp;level.</p> Hyperledger Aries <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Aries</a> describes itself as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries#:~:text=Hyperledger%20Aries%20provides%20a%20shared,peer%2Dto%2Dpeer%20interactions">“a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting, and storing verifiable digital credentials.”</a> We discussed Hyperledger Aries and their use of Hyperledger Indy’s “Anoncreds” in our <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/selectively-disclosed-verifiable-credentials-79a236b81ee2">earlier article</a>. Interesting to note at this point is that we can see the first integrations of <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+ signatures</a> (signature-based ZKPs) that enable selective disclosure.</p><p>Combined with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#json-ld">W3Cs JSON-LD credentials</a>, Hyperledger Aries could be one of the first movers in providing the ability to use ZKP-enabled W3C credentials in messaging, resulting in a more private and secure exchange of information between users or even&nbsp;devices.</p> Iden3 <p><a href="https://docs.iden3.io/">Iden3</a> is an open-source project aiming to provide a new and decentralized solution for digital identities. Based on ZKPs, Iden3 powers really neat use cases like <a href="https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/9cdef79316906f09753cbca69c965e92/iden3_ethcc_presentation.pdf">anonymous logins and reputation proofs</a> while not requiring users to disclose their actual identity. Although it is in the early stages of development, the use cases of an open-sourced and community-driven digital identity solution for end users seem manifold.</p><p>Iden3 developed its own Circom language and the <a href="https://github.com/iden3/circom">Circom 2.0 compiler</a> that allows creating <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/26/snarks.html">ZK-Snarks</a> (another type of ZKPs) on a more abstract and not mathematical level. This way, Circom allows for easy creation and integration of ZKPs. The figure below shows how <a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom</a> and SnarkJS can be used in combination.</p><a href="https://docs.circom.io/">Circom &amp;&nbsp;SnarkJS</a> Loopring <p><a href="https://loopring.org/#/about">Loopring is an open-sourced decentralized exchange using an Automated-Market-Maker(AMM) and zkRollups to provide a fast and cheap method for token exchanges and payment</a>s. Loopring and similar applications could very well introduce a significant improvement for multiple fields in the crypto industry like Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and NFT&nbsp;trading.</p><p>One of Loopring’s <a href="https://loopring.org/#/post/gamestop-nft-marketplace-powered-by-loopring-l2">latest announcements includes the hosting of GameStop’s upcoming NFT marketplace</a>. This might introduce the advantages of ZKPs to a broader audience.</p> dydx <p><a href="https://dydx.exchange/">dydx</a> is another <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/beginners-guide-perpetual-trading-dydx/">decentralized exchange mostly focusing on perpetual trading</a>. While dydx was initially launched on Ethereum’s layer 1 it <a href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/public">introduced trading as a layer 2 solution for Ethereum in mid-2021</a> through zkRollups. The solution used for enabling zkRollups is StarkWare’s StarkEx (described above). Using the layer 2 solution instead of the layer 1 solution provides various improvements to trading <a href="https://integral.dydx.exchange/scaling-with-starkware/">like instant off-chain settlement</a>. For a more detailed comparison of the benefits of the layer 2 approach please see <a href="https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-dydx-explaining-the-popular-crypto-derivatives-dex">this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p> Sorare <p><a href="https://sorare.com/">Sorare</a> uses ZKPs in an app for building your own soccer teams and trading your player cards. Like dydx, Sorare introduced its scaling solution of choice in the middle of 2021 by integrating the StarkEx Protocol. While there's nothing too special about Sorare, I think it is a great example of where the crypto (consumer) space is&nbsp;heading.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/sorare/scaling-sorare-on-ethereum-with-starkware-ccb1b0338ad3">In a blog entry, Pierre Duperrin explained the reasoning behind Sorare’s decision to use Ethereum layer 2 scaling solutions that use ZKPs instead of other scaling solutions</a>. The key argument for ZKPs seems to be the <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition">scalability trilemma</a>. While there are other scaling solutions out there, ZKP-based solutions provide the advantage of not compromising on security or decentralization while increasing scalability.</p> Conclusion <p>ZKPs help to improve the scalability and privacy of a lot of existing solutions in the crypto space — for instance decentralized exchanges. Furthermore, ZKP can be a key enabler for the Web3.0 by improving privacy — not just on a transaction level but also on a network level. Users will be able to interact almost anonymously while still being able to provide the necessary information to participate in networks and applications.</p><p>Tools like Hyperledger Aries and networks like DuskNet will further enable businesses to utilize ZKP technology in privacy-preserving solutions. I can also think of scenarios where businesses will be able to integrate private solutions with public solutions. For example, using ZKP-enabled digital identities to participate in open markets privately. Personally, I am confident to say that crypto’s public sector (especially DeFi) will experience a lot of growth in 2022 and early 2023 through ZKP-based scalability improvements. This can already be seen by examples like Sorare or Loopring but will only accelerate once more applications integrate ZKPs.</p><p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes GmbH</a> is a provider of crypto-economy solutions based in Stuttgart, Germany.</p><p>51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/improving-scalability-and-privacy-of-blockchains-2022-update-on-zero-knowledge-proofs-2d90615f0dd">Improving Scalability and Privacy of Blockchains: 2022 Update on Zero-Knowledge Proofs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Da oggi la PEC di Infocert – già scelta da oltre 2,9 milioni di imprese e professionisti -è disponibile anche per usi non professionali</p>



<p>Roma, 17 maggio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, presenta Legalmail Personal, la <a href="https://www.legalmail.infocert.it/prodotti/legalmail-personal/">casella di Posta Elettronica Certificata (PEC) Legalmail</a> dedicata esclusivamente agli utenti non professionali, per tutte le comunicazioni che necessitano di valore legale. Alternativa alla tradizionale raccomandata e più conveniente di una PEC dedicata ad imprese e professionisti, Legalmail personal è la nuova offerta InfoCert a supporto della digitalizzazione dei cittadini, in continuità con il successo di SPID che la società ha contribuito ad ottenere.</p>



<p>Con dominio @pecprivato.it, le caselle Legalmail Personal di InfoCert offrono – nella versione base – 1 gigabyte di spazio, la ricezione illimitata delle comunicazioni di terzi e un pacchetto di 5 invii inclusi.</p>



<p>Qualora si dovesse esaurire il plafond di GB a disposizione o di invii prima della scadenza, sarà possibile richiedere comodamente pacchetti addizionali. Viceversa, in caso di mancato utilizzo, giga e invii non andranno perduti ma saranno disponibili al rinnovo.</p>



<p>I servizi base Legalmail Personal possono essere arricchiti con tool extra di cybersecurity per phishing e password protection, per una difesa ancora più efficace dalle minacce informatiche.</p>



<p>“L’Italia sta progressivamente guadagnando posizioni in Europa in termini di digitalizzazione: lo testimonia il fatto che, nel giro di soli 5 anni, il nostro Paese è passato dalla venticinquesima alla ventesima posizione nel DESI Index. A raggiungere questo risultato hanno indubbiamente contribuito gli sforzi di professionisti, imprese e pubbliche amministrazioni in termini di trasformazione digitale, ma – parimenti – è stato fondamentale il cambio di passo compiuto dai cittadini, sempre più propensi a preferire i canali e gli strumenti digitali a quelli fisici e tradizionali.” Commenta Giuseppe Tusa, responsabile marketing di Legalmail, InfoCert – Tinexta Group “Per questo abbiamo realizzato la versione Personal della nostra storica PEC Legalmail: per offrire uno strumento semplice ed economico a tutti gli utenti privati che potranno inviare via PEC disdette di abbonamenti, iscriversi ad un concorso, gestire comunicazioni all’interno di associazioni o condomini e scambiare messaggi certificati alla PA.”</p>



<p>Come tutte le altre versioni di Legalmail, anche la casella Personal – disponibile in promozione da 4,90 euro fino al 31 luglio, IVA inclusa – è utilizzabile via WEB, tramite App mobile ed è anche integrabile nel client di posta già in uso dall’utente per l’invio e la ricezione dei messaggi e-mail “tradizionali.</p>

<p>US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has called for far greater regulation of the stablecoin market amid last week’s unprecedented volatility of TerraUSD (UST). The popular algorithmically-backed stablecoin was supposed to maintain a value of one dollar, but it fell to as low as 9 cents on May 16th. Previously, Janet Yellen had spoken quite positively and optimistically in regard to the stablecoin market and its potential for financial innovation and inclusion. Her remarks towards stablecoins were particularly hopeful considering her longstanding criticism of cryptoassets for reasons of volatility and overwhelming risk to the market.&nbsp;</p>

   The demands placed on front-end web applications continue to grow.  As consumers, we expect our web applications to be feature-rich and highly performant. As developers, we worry about how to provide quality features and performance while keeping good development practices and architecture in mind. 

 Enter micro-frontend architecture. Micro frontends are modeled after the same concept as microser

  <p>The demands placed on front-end web applications continue to grow.  As consumers, we expect our web applications to be feature-rich and highly performant. As developers, we worry about how to provide quality features and performance while keeping good development practices and architecture in mind.</p>

<p>Enter micro-frontend architecture. Micro frontends are modeled after the same concept as microservices, as a way to decompose monolithic frontends. You can combine micro-sized frontends  to form a fully-featured web app. Since each micro frontend can be developed and deployed independently, you have a powerful way of scaling out frontend applications.</p>

<p>So what does the micro-frontend architecture look like? Let’s say you have an e-commerce site that looks as stunning as this one:</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might have a shopping cart, account information for registered users, past orders, payment options, etc. You might be able to further categorize these features into domains, each of which could be a separate micro frontend, also known as a <code>remote</code>. The collection of micro-frontend remotes is housed inside another website, the <code>host</code> of the web application.</p>

<p>So, your e-commerce site using micro frontends to decompose different functionality might look like this diagram, where the shopping cart and account features are in their separate routes within your Single Page Application (SPA):</p>

<p></p>

<p>You might be saying, “Micro frontends sound cool, but managing the different frontends and orchestrating state across the micro frontends also sounds complicated.” You’re right. The concept of a micro frontend has been around for a few years and rolling your own micro-frontend implementation, shared state, and tools to support it was quite an undertaking. However, micro frontends are now well supported with Webpack 5 and <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/">Module Federation</a>. Not all web apps require a micro-frontend architecture, but for those large, feature-rich web apps that have started to get unwieldy, the first-class support of micro frontends in our web tooling is definitely a plus.</p>

<p>This post is part one in a series where we’ll build an e-commerce site using Angular and micro frontends. We’ll use Webpack 5 with Module Federation to support wiring the micro frontends together. Then we’ll demonstrate sharing authenticated state between the different frontends, and deploy it all to a free cloud hosting provider.</p>

<p>In this first post, we’ll explore a starter project and understand how the different apps connect, add authentication using Okta, and add the wiring for sharing authenticated state. In the end, you’ll have an app that looks like this:</p>

 Micro-frontend starter using Webpack 5 and Module Federation 

<p>There’s a lot in this web app! We’ll use a starter code to make sure we focus on the code that’s specific to the micro frontend. If you’re dismayed that you’re using a starter and not starting from scratch, don’t worry. I’ll provide the Angular CLI commands to recreate the structure of this starter app on the repository’s README.md so you have all the instructions.</p>

<p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example">Angular Micro Frontend Example</a> GitHub repo by following the steps below and open the repo in your favorite IDE.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
cd okta-angular-microfrontend-example
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Let’s dive into the code! 🎉</p>

<p>We have an Angular project with two applications and one library inside the <code>src/projects</code> directory. The two applications are named <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code>, and the library is named <code>shared</code>. The <code>shell</code> application is the micro-frontend host, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> is a micro-frontend remote application. The <code>shared</code> library contains code and application state we want to share across the site. When you apply the same sort of diagram shown above for this app, it looks like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this project, we use the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency to help encapsulate some of the intricacies of configuring Webpack and the Module Federation plugin. The <code>shell</code> and <code>mfe-basket</code> application have their own separate <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Open the <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code> file for either the <code>shell</code> or <code>mfe-basket</code> application to see the overall structure. This file is where we add in the wiring for the hosts, remotes, shared code, and shared dependencies in the Module Federation plugin. The structure will be different if you aren’t using the <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> dependency, but the basic idea for configuration remains the same.</p>

<p>Let’s explore the sections of this config file.</p>

   <code>// ...imports here

const sharedMappings = new mf.SharedMappings();
sharedMappings.register(
  path.join(__dirname, '../../tsconfig.json'),
  [
    '@shared'
  ]);

module.exports = {
  // ...other very important config properties
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      library: { type: "module" },

      // For remotes (please adjust)
      // name: "shell",
      // filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      // exposes: {
      //     './Component': './projects/shell/src/app/app.component.ts',
      // },        
        
      // For hosts (please adjust)
      remotes: {
        "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
      },

      shared: share({
        // ...important external libraries to share

        ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
      })
    }),
    sharedMappings.getPlugin()
  ],
};
</code>   

<p>In the <code>webpack.config.js</code> for <code>mfe-basket</code>, you’ll see the path for <code>@shared</code> at the top of the file and the configuration to identify what to expose in the remote application.</p>

<p>The <code>shell</code> application serves on port 4200, and the <code>mfe-basket</code> application serves on port 4201. We can open up two terminals to run each application, or we can use the following npm script created for us by the schematic to add <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code>:</p>

   <code>npm run run:all
</code>   

<p>When you do so, you’ll see both applications open in your browser and how they fit together in the <code>shell</code> application running on port 4200. Click the Basket button to navigate to a new route that displays the <code>BasketModule</code> in the <code>mfe-basket</code> application. The sign-in button doesn’t work quite yet, but we’ll get it going here next.</p>

<p>Note - Another option I could have used for the starter is a <a href="https://nx.dev/">Nx workspace</a>. Nx has great tooling and built-in support for building micro frontends with Webpack and Module Federation. But I wanted to go minimalistic on the project tooling so you’d have a chance to dip your toes into some of the configuration requirements.</p>

<p>The <code>@shared</code> syntax might look a little unusual to you. You may have expected to see a relative path to the library. The <code>@shared</code> syntax is an alias for the library’s path, which is defined in the project’s <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. You don’t have to do this. You can leave libraries using the relative path, but adding aliases makes your code look cleaner and helps ensure best practices for code architecture.</p>

<p>Because the host application doesn’t know about the remote applications except in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>, we help out the TypeScript compiler by declaring the remote application in <code>decl.d.ts</code>. You can see all the configuration changes and source code made for the starter <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/commit/b851320ca9418b8e28890fab15c7da5313eb8275">in this commit</a>.</p>

 Add authentication using OpenID Connect 

<p>One of the most useful features of Module Federation is managing shared code and state. Let’s see how this all works by adding authentication to the project. We’ll use the authenticated state in the existing application and with a new micro frontend.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You’ll need those values here soon.</p>

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-angular">Okta Angular</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta Auth JS</a> libraries to connect our Angular application with Okta authentication. Add them to your project by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@5.2 @okta/okta-auth-js@6.4
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to import the <code>OktaAuthModule</code> into the <code>AppModule</code> of the <code>shell</code> project and add the Okta configuration. Replace the placeholders in the code below with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
  scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email']
});

@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>After authenticating with Okta, we need to set up the login callback to finalize the sign-in process. Open <code>app-routing.module.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project and update the routes array as shown below.</p>

   <code>import { OktaCallbackComponent } from '@okta/okta-angular';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>Now that we’ve configured Okta in the application, we can add the code to sign in and sign out. Open <code>app.component.ts</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. We will add the methods to sign in and sign out using the Okta libraries. We’ll also update the two public variables to use the actual authenticated state. Update your code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import { Component, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { filter, map, Observable, shareReplay } from 'rxjs';
import { OKTA_AUTH, OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class AppComponent {
  public isAuthenticated$: Observable&lt;boolean&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.isAuthenticated ?? false),
          shareReplay()
      );
  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this.oktaStateService.authState$
      .pipe(
          filter(authState =&gt; !!authState &amp;&amp; !!authState.isAuthenticated),
          map(authState =&gt; authState.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')
      );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService, @Inject(OKTA_AUTH) private oktaAuth: OktaAuth) { }

  public async signIn(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  }

  public async signOut(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {
    await this.oktaAuth.signOut();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to add the click handlers for the sign-in and sign-out buttons. Open <code>app.component.html</code> in the <code>shell</code> project. Update the code for Sign In and Sign Out buttons as shown.</p>

   <code>&lt;li&gt;
  &lt;button *ngIf="(isAuthenticated$ | async) === false; else logout"
    class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
    (click)="signIn()"
  &gt;
    &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign In&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;

    &lt;ng-template #logout&gt;
      &lt;button 
        class="flex items-center transition ease-in delay-150 duration-300 h-10 px-4 rounded-lg hover:border hover:border-sky-400"
        (click)="signOut()"
      &gt;
        &lt;span class="material-icons-outlined text-gray-500"&gt;logout&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Sign Out&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/ng-template&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>. Now you’ll be able to sign in and sign out. And when you sign in, a new button for Profile shows up. Nothing happens when you click it, but we’re going to create a new remote, connect it to the host, and share the authenticated state here next!</p>

 Create a new Angular application 

<p>Now you’ll have a chance to see how a micro-frontend remote connects to the host by creating a micro-frontend app that shows the authenticated user’s profile information. Stop serving the project and run the following command in the terminal to create a new Angular application in the project:</p>

   <code>ng generate application mfe-profile --routing --style css --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>With this Angular CLI command you</p>
 
   Generated a new application named <code>mfe-profile</code>, which includes a module and a component 
   Added a separate routing module to the application 
   Defined the CSS styles to be inline in the components 
   Skipped creating associated test files for the initial component 
 

<p>You’ll now create a component for the default route, <code>HomeComponent</code>, and a module to house the micro frontend. We could wire up the micro frontend to only use a component instead of a module. In fact, a component will cover our needs for a profile view, but we’ll use a module so you can see how each micro frontend can grow as the project evolves. Run the following two commands in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng generate component home --project mfe-profile
ng generate module profile --project mfe-profile --module app --routing --route profile
</code>   

<p>With these two Angular CLI commands you:</p>
 
   Created a new component, <code>HomeComponent</code>, in the <code>mfe-profile</code> application 
   Created a new module, <code>ProfileModule</code>, with routing and a default component, <code>ProfileComponent</code>. You also added the <code>ProfileModule</code> as a lazy-loaded route using the ‘/profile’ path to the <code>AppModule</code>. 
 

<p>Let’s update the code. First, we’ll add the default route. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add a new route for <code>HomeComponent</code>. Your route array should match the code below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('./profile/profile.module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule) }
];
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll update the <code>AppComponent</code> and <code>HomeComponent</code> templates. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/app.component.html</code> and delete all the code in there. Replace it with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hey there! You're viewing the Profile MFE project! 🎉&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;
</code>   

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/home/home.component.html</code> and replace all the code in the file with:</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;
  There's nothing to see here. 👀 &lt;br/&gt;
  The MFE is this way ➡️ &lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, we can update the code for the profile. Luckily, Angular CLI took care of a lot of the scaffolding for us. So we just need to update the component’s TypeScript file and the template.</p>

<p>Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code> and edit the component to add the two public properties and include the <code>OktaAuthStateService</code> in the constructor:</p>

   <code>import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { OktaAuthStateService } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { filter, map } from 'rxjs';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-profile',
  templateUrl: './profile.component.html',
  styles: []
})
export class ProfileComponent {
  public profile$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; state.idToken?.claims)
  );

  public date$ = this.oktaStateService.authState$.pipe(
    filter(state =&gt; !!state &amp;&amp; !!state.isAuthenticated),
    map(state =&gt; (state.idToken?.claims.auth_time as number) * 1000),
    map(epochTime =&gt; new Date(epochTime)),
  );

  constructor(private oktaStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open the corresponding template file and replace the existing code with the following:</p>

   <code>&lt;h3 class="text-xl mb-6"&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div *ngIf="profile$ | async as profile"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Name: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.name}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class="my-3"&gt;Email: &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{profile.email}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Last signed in at &lt;span class="font-semibold"&gt;{{date$ | async | date:'full'}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Try running the <code>mfe-profile</code> app by itself by running <code>ng serve mfe-profile --open</code> in the terminal. Notice when we navigate to the <code>/profile</code> route, we see a console error. We added Okta into the <code>shell</code> application, but now we need to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and share the authenticated state. Stop serving the application so we’re ready for the next step.</p>

 Module Federation for your Angular application 

<p>We want to use the schematic from <code>@angular-architects/module-federation</code> to turn the <code>mfe-profile</code> application into a micro frontend and add the necessary configuration. We’ll use port 4202 for this application. Add the schematic by running the following command in the terminal:</p>

   <code>ng add @angular-architects/module-federation --project mfe-profile --port 4202
</code>   

<p>This schematic does the following:</p>
 
   Updates the project’s <code>angular.json</code> config file to add the port for the application and updates the builder to use a custom Webpack builder 
   Creates the <code>webpack.config.js</code> files and scaffolds out default configuration for Module Federation 
 

<p>First, let’s add the new micro frontend to the <code>shell</code> application by updating the configuration in <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. In the middle of the file, there’s a property for <code>plugins</code> with commented-out code. We need to finish configuring that. Since this application is a remote, we’ll update the snippet of code under the comment:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
</code>   

<p>The defaults are mostly correct, except we have a module, not a component that we want to expose. If you want to expose a component instead, all you’d do is update which component to expose. Update the configuration snippet to expose the <code>ProfileModule</code> by matching the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>// For remotes (please adjust)
name: "mfeProfile",
filename: "remoteEntry.js",
exposes: {
  './Module': './projects/mfe-profile/src/app/profile/profile.module.ts',
},
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the micro frontend in the <code>shell</code> application. Open <code>projects/shell/webpack.config.js</code>. Here is where you’ll add the new micro frontend so that the <code>shell</code> application knows how to access it. In the middle of the file, inside the <code>plugins</code> array, there’s a property for <code>remotes</code>. The micro frontend in the starter code, <code>mfeBasket</code>, is already added to the <code>remotes</code> object. You’ll also add the remote for <code>mfeProfile</code> there, following the same pattern but replacing the port to 4202. Update your configuration to look like this.</p>

   <code>// For hosts (please adjust)
remotes: {
  "mfeBasket": "http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js",
  "mfeProfile": "http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js"
},
</code>   

<p>We can update the code to incorporate the profile’s micro frontend. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code>. Add a path to the profile micro frontend in the routes array using the path ‘profile’. Your routes array should look like this.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'basket', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeBasket/Module').then(m =&gt; m.BasketModule) },
  { path: 'profile', loadChildren: () =&gt; import('mfeProfile/Module').then(m =&gt; m.ProfileModule)},
  { path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
];
</code>   

<p>What’s this!? The IDE flags the import path as an error! The <code>shell</code> application code doesn’t know about the Profile module, and TypeScript needs a little help. Open <code>projects/shell/src/decl.d.ts</code> and add the following line of code.</p>

   <code>declare module 'mfeProfile/Module';
</code>   

<p>The IDE should be happier now. 😀</p>

<p>Next, update the navigation button for Profile in the <code>shell</code> application to route to the correct path. Open <code>projects/shell/src/app/app.component.html</code> and find the <code>routerLink</code> for the Profile button. It should be approximately on line 38. Currently the <code>routerLink</code> configuration is <code>routerLink="/"</code>, but it should now be</p>

   <code>&lt;a routerLink="/profile"&gt;
</code>   

<p>This is everything we need to do to connect the micro-frontend remote to the host application, but we also want to share authenticated state. Module Federation makes sharing state a piece of (cup)cake.</p>

 Micro-frontend state management 

<p>To share a library, you need to configure the library in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>. Let’s start with <code>shell</code>. Open <code>projects/shell/src/webpack.config.js</code>.</p>

<p>There are two places to add shared code. One place is for code implementation within the project, and one is for shared external libraries. In this case, we can share the Okta external libraries as we didn’t implement a service that wraps Okta’s auth libraries, but I will point out both places.</p>

<p>First, we’ll add the Okta libraries. Scroll down towards the bottom of the file to the <code>shared</code> property. You’ll follow the same pattern as the <code>@angular</code> libraries already in the list and add the singleton instances of the two Okta libraries as shown in this snippet:</p>

   <code>shared: share({
  // other Angular libraries remain in the config. This is just a snippet
  "@angular/router": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-angular": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },
  "@okta/okta-auth-js": { singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: 'auto' },

  ...sharedMappings.getDescriptors()
})
</code>   

<p>When you create a library within this project, like the basket service and project service in the starter code, you add the library to the <code>sharedMappings</code> array at the top of the <code>webpack.config.js</code> file. If you create a new library to wrap Okta’s libraries, this is where you’d add it.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve added the Okta libraries to the micro-frontend host, you need to also add them to the remotes that consume the dependencies. In our case, only the <code>mfe-profile</code> application uses Okta authenticated state information. Open <code>projects/mfe-profile/webpack.config.js</code>. Add the two Okta libraries to the <code>shared</code> property as you did for the <code>shell</code> application.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to run the project using <code>npm run run:all</code>, and the cupcake storefront should allow you to log in, see your profile, log out, and add items to your cupcake basket!</p>

 Next steps 

<p>I hope you enjoyed this first post on creating an Angular micro-frontend site. We explored the capabilities of micro frontends and shared state between micro frontends using Webpack’s Module Federation in Angular.  You can check out the completed code for this post in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example/tree/local"><code>local</code> branch in the @oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example GitHub repo</a> by using the following command:</p>

   <code>git clone --branch local https://github.com/oktadev/okta-angular-microfrontend-example.git
</code>   

<p>In the next post I’ll show how to prepare for deployment by transitioning to dynamic module loading and deploying the site to a free cloud provider. Let’s continue building the site by reading “<a>Secure and Deploy Micro Frontends with Angular</a>”!</p>

<p>Nobody likes spending excessive amounts of money. Be it Elon Musk, or your neighbor down the street. Fortunately, banks have stimulated spending money with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/best-credit-cards-for-credit-scores-of-580-and-below/">credit cards</a> at grocery stores, movie theaters, sports events, etc. over the years, with one very swift move — cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Well, what’s the trick? Where does this money come from? In this article, we will review what cash back is, how it works, use cases, and 4 ways to earn cash&nbsp;back.</p> What is Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Cashback is a way of getting money back when you’re buying something, and it’s a feature that some credit cards have. Instead of paying the full price for things you buy with your credit card, you get a percentage of that cash&nbsp;back.</p><p>Credit cards with cash back rewards offer a certain percentage of every qualifying purchase back. For example, if you buy a pair of shoes with your credit card that offers one percent cash back, you’ll receive one percent of the amount you spent on the boots back into your&nbsp;account.</p><p>While not every credit card and bank works with the same percentage, typically it’s between 1–2% on average, with some unique campaigns in which you can earn even a more considerable rate.</p><p>This is not an enormous amount of money, but the bigger your credit card bill, the more significant the saving you can potentially make. If you make $2 per 100 spent, imagine what will happen if you spend $10,000. That’s $200 out of&nbsp;nowhere.</p><p>However, you should pay attention to the condition set by credit card issuers, before you go on a shopping spree. Some of them have limits (for example, up to $5,000 or $6,000 are eligible for earning cash&nbsp;back).</p> How Does Cash Back&nbsp;Work? <p>As the name indicates, cash back is money you receive in some way — be it via cash back rewards, money back into your account, or any other&nbsp;means.</p><p>Cash back credit cards are just one of many rewards credit cards out there, but this type of card is so popular because it can pay out at a high rate. For example, you can earn 5% cash back on your first $1500 in purchases every month. These rewards can also help you avoid paying interest charges or come close to them since they pay out money you would have otherwise spent.</p><p>All you need to do is find out if the grocery stores, gas stations, or other businesses that you regularly shop from are eligible for cash back, as banks don’t redeem cash from every place out&nbsp;there.</p> What About Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Cards? <p>There should be something for the bank, as cash back doesn’t come for free. You know the old&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>Money doesn’t grow on&nbsp;trees.</blockquote><p>That’s also valid here. Each credit card company (like VISA, Mastercard, and Amex) makes its money by applying a transaction fee on card payments (it’s floating, but let’s assume it’s around&nbsp;3%).</p><p>Since these companies are interested in you paying with a card rather than cash, they incentivize banks as mediators to offer you something in return. But banks also have another benefit — to promote their credit&nbsp;cards.</p><p>As we stated in the last point, not every place you shop from is eligible for cash back rewards. There is a criterion that should be met. Let’s see some of the common rules that&nbsp;apply:</p>  Unapproved stores — if you’re shopping from your local cafeteria, you might not receive a cash back, as the store is not recognized as a trusted&nbsp;seller.  Money exchange — if you use your money to exchange for another fiat currency, you won’t receive a cash back, as you are not spending&nbsp;money.  Gambling — gambling or anything associated with betting is among the spending categories that won’t qualify as eligible.   4 Ways to earn cash&nbsp;back  1. Cash back credit&nbsp;cards <p>I have already mentioned credit cards as the main way to receive cash back, but I’ll repeat myself again. If you’re not using cash back cards, you’re literally wasting cash. It’s the most straightforward way to get a percentage of almost everything you purchase. You can usually get 2–3% if you have good credit&nbsp;scores.</p> 2. Rewards&nbsp;sites <p>Another trend is <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/sites/">rewards sites</a>. They make things easier. Instead of getting a new credit card issued in your name and thinking of potential issues with interest and overspending, you can use rewards sites such as Monetha, where you receive awards for every purchase you make. You can then spend the cash rewards on gift cards from major shops and services, donate to charity, and even convert to crypto (visit <a href="https://monetha.io/">Monetha</a>&nbsp;now).</p> 3. Coupon&nbsp;websites <p>You can find fantastic promotional codes and offers on sites like Groupon, Livingsocial, and Rakuten. Not only will you receive a great deal on your purchases, but you can also earn money back in the form of discounts or cash back&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Post-purchase cash&nbsp;back <p>Post-purchase services provide cash back on purchases. The most common scenario is to get a percentage back after shopping, but you can also receive an extended warranty or join the lottery for free tickets to Paris or a new car. Some of these services are run by the stores you buy&nbsp;from.</p> How to Use Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Once you have generated enough cashback balance, then it is probably time for the sweetest part — to spend it somewhere. But where can you spend&nbsp;it?</p> As a statement credit <p>If you have a mortgage or some credit card debt, you can cover some of it with the cash back. The way it works is simple: it funds your available balance.</p><p>For example, you owe your bank $200 each month for a small housing decoration loan. When you generate $50 in cash back, in your statement credit report you will find the number -$150 instead of -$200, as a small portion, is absorbed by the cash&nbsp;back.</p> As an available balance <p>That’s certainly better than having a debt. Instead of financing your debt, you earn money that goes straight to your bank account, thus increasing your available balance.</p><p>Let’s say you have $1,000 available in your bank and have $100 redeem rewards. Once you receive them, you’ll have $1,100 to&nbsp;spend.</p> As a Gift&nbsp;Card <p>One common way to use your cash back is via a free credit for online shopping on Amazon, eBay, or other places. The gift card is a fixed amount that you can use either once or multiple times until the credit runs&nbsp;out.</p><p>There is one condition, though. The only way to pay the difference is by&nbsp;card.</p> As a&nbsp;Donation <p>It’s always a good idea to donate money to charity, and cash back is a good option to spend some money on good deeds without breaking the bank. In fact, you will pay a grand total of $0 of your own funds, but you will help people in a&nbsp;need.</p> When is a Good Idea to Have a Cash Back Credit&nbsp;Card? <p>Before we talk about the best cash back credit cards on the market, you need to decide for yourself if you’re up for it. Let’s see the ideal situation in which it’s worth having a&nbsp;go:</p>  You have good credit health — if you have an acceptable credit history, you will be able to access more cash back opportunities and grab better deals. This means you’ll have lower interest rates and much better paybacks.  You are disciplined — credit cards are a big gamble in the wrong hands. Failing to meet the deadline means you will pay brutal APRs which will often overshadow any perks of having cash back&nbsp;options.  You have shopping patterns — in order to get the best value out of your cash back provider, you have to shop from the same places to keep collecting points.   What are the Best Cash Back Credit Cards Out&nbsp;There? <p>Which are the hot offers if you would like to open a cash back credit card? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Discover it® Cash&nbsp;Back <p>This is the best option for huge spenders. You can get up to a 5% reward rate which is quarterly rotating spending categories. It comes with an impressive 0% annual fee and no minimum cashback redemption. It requires you to have a Credit Score of at least 700, and has a standard APR starting from&nbsp;12.24%.</p> 2. Capital One® Walmart Rewards®&nbsp;Card <p>There is a sweet 5% cash back bonus for the first 12 months of using the credit card. On top of that, there is a great 2% cash back that you can use for hotel stays and restaurants, which make it a very good option for Walmart shopping and traveling. You can apply with a Credit Score of 650+ points, making more people eligible. However, the APR is extremely high, often reaching up to&nbsp;30%.</p> 3. Chase Freedom&nbsp;Flex <p>Chase Freedom Flex is one of the best options for travelers, as it can rival even travel cards. There’s a generous welcome bonus of $200 and you pay $0 in annual fees. However, the APR is about 16–20% on average, and you should have an outstanding Credit Score of 700+ points to apply for&nbsp;it.</p> 4. Ink Business Unlimited® Credit&nbsp;Card <p>This credit card is one of the most generous, as you earn a $750 bonus cash back as a welcome bonus + 0% APR for the first year. You also don’t have an annual fee but you do have about 17%-20% APR on it. However, one of the main perks is the unlimited 1.5% cash back rewards on all purchases. This is great for businesses, but the Credit Score requirements are also high — 700+&nbsp;points.</p> 5. Amazon Business Prime American Express&nbsp;Card <p>If you’re constantly using Amazon for your online shopping, this card is the right choice. You can receive up to $100 cash back, there’s no annual fee, and you can earn up to 5% back from Amazon’s orders. You can also swap the 5% for 90-day 0% APR financing, which is the main benefit of the card. Bear in mind you should be an Amazon Prime member with a good Credit Score (700+ points), and the penalty APR is&nbsp;huge.</p> 6. U.S. Bank Business Triple Cash Rewards World Elite™ Mastercard® <p>One of the most generous welcome offers is the one promoted by the U.S. Bank. Up to $500 cash back as a welcome bonus, paired with a 0% annual fee, is a fantastic boost. It also has a promotional 0% APR + 3% cash back on different bonus categories. However, there’s one catch — there is a huge standard APR (it can easily exceed 25%), and there’s a balance transfer fee that can eat up you&nbsp;savings.</p> 7. American Express® Business Gold&nbsp;Card <p>Unlike other cards on the list, the AMEX Business Gold card works with points that you can collect. It is a superb value for money if you’re traveling a lot with up to 20–25% cash back on travel flights. You receive up to 60–70 thousand points and 4 points per dollar for the first $150,000. However, there’s a $295 annual fee which is steep. On top of that, the APR rate is not low, starting from 15% and going well beyond the&nbsp;20s.</p> 8. The Hilton Honors American Express Business&nbsp;Card <p>If you travel to luxurious destinations or prefer quality for your business trip, this is the right credit card. You get an excellent value for the annual fee of $95, and on top of that, you’ll get more than 100,000 points. There are no foreign transaction fees, which is a great added bonus, and it’s a great option if you are a Hilton hotel fan. However, you should bear in mind this card has no real value if you’re not a Hilton user. On top of that, there is a high APR fee of up to&nbsp;25%.</p> What Stores Give You Most Cash&nbsp;Back? <p>Of course, when we talk about generous offers from credit card issuers, we need to mention the stores that give the best credit card&nbsp;rewards.</p> 1. Kroger <p>Kroger is quite generous with its offer. You can get up to $120 cash back at the store with Discovery card, and you also have to up to $300 for debit cards. There are some things to consider, though: there is a $0.50 fee for cash back amounts of up to $100 and $1.50 for amounts between $100.01 and&nbsp;$300.</p> 2. Whole&nbsp;Foods <p>Whole Foods is pretty standard in its offering. They include all spending categories but can redeem $100 back which is not a bad&nbsp;amount.</p> 3. Walmart <p>Walmart limits you to $20 up to $100 cash back, and it depends on the bonus category you’ve chosen. However, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> 4. Target <p>Target lets you cash back up to $40 and just like Walmart, you cannot redeem more than $20 at&nbsp;once.</p> Final Thoughts <p>If you already have a credit card, you can benefit from a lot of bonus cash via cash back. It’s money that you can use for so many purposes — you can pay less, cover your debts, and even&nbsp;donate.</p><p>But in case you don’t have a credit card yet, you should consider the benefits against the disadvantages. If you’re not disciplined enough and cannot take control of your spending, you might end up in massive debt, as APR on credit cards is much higher than standard loans and mortgages.</p><p>And if you don’t have a credit card and have no intention to get one, we have to say that there are many options to get a lot of cash back. All you need to do is sign up with a rewards site like Monetha, and you can save as you&nbsp;spend!</p><p>If you like this article, check out our blog post about how to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/rewards/earn-money-from-your-data/">earn money from your&nbsp;data</a>!</p><p>*Disclaimer: All the information is based on Monetha’s research.

			<p>16th May, Luxembourg – <a href="https://www.dltjewel.com/">Jewel</a>, a Bermuda-based digital asset banking platform that has applied for a combined full-service bank and digital-asset license in Bermuda, seeks to offer a full range of digital asset services to institutional clients including payments, banking, custody and lending. In partnership with digital asset compliance infrastructure provider <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, Jewel will power real time settlement for digital asset institutions via its own bank issued USD stablecoin on the Polygon, the leading blockchain development platform, offering scalable and sustainable Web3 infrastructure.</p>
<p>Longer term, Jewel aims to offer a stablecoin-as-a-service solution to other digital asset and financial institutions B2B, allowing those businesses to provide cheaper, easier and near real time payments with stablecoins issued and redeemable directly at the bank level at Jewel.</p>
<p>As digital transformation flourishes across all industries and aspects of finance, banking, and payments, businesses are demanding payment solutions that are fast, inexpensive and programmable. Conventional payment systems are often fragmented and inefficient, creating a challenge for customers who trade and transact globally 24/7/365.</p>
<p>Jewel was an early driver for the use and acceptance of distributed ledger technology and stablecoins within banks tied to bank deposits. Today, Jewel’s bank direct approach is becoming an intelligent and appropriate risk-based approach that US and other regulators are now touting for the structure of stablecoins and their issuance and administration, as reflected in the Biden Administration’s recent Report on Stablecoins from the US President’s Working Group (stating their opinion that stablecoin should be issued by banks and other regulated deposit-taking institutions). This was then further defined under the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets. Jewel’s stablecoin, Jewel USD (JUSD) will eliminate the need for reconciliation and enable instant payments and transfers to members of its settlement network, “Jewel Settle”.</p>

		 
	 
    Our proposed banking license will allow us to service global firms from Bermuda as we issue fiat-backed stablecoins, first with USD and then a growing number of other proposed single fiat currency stablecoins globally. Through our partnership with Tokeny, we’re able to ensure compliant stablecoin issuance and management in a scalable and easy-to-integrate manner. As a result, we can devote most of our time and resources to further developing our business opportunities. We are already in discussions with exchanges, bank and non-bank financial institutions, and governments, and there is a considerable amount of interest in our offerings.  Chancellor BarnettJewel Founder and Chairman    
	 
		 
			<p>Jewel has chosen Tokeny, the leader in the tokenization field, as its technology partner to assist them with the issuance, transfer, and management of fiat-backed stablecoins on the Polygon Network. Through Tokeny’s API-based solutions, Jewel can issue ERC-3643 permissioned tokens, ensuring the necessary controls and compliance that are required by regulators.</p>

		 
	 
    We are pleased to provide our partner Jewel with a tailored technology solution, so they can focus on their core businesses without having to worry about technology. Together, we can transform the global payment system and accelerate the growth of the digital asset ecosystem.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny

<p>When great minds and visionary leaders come together, good things can happen. Better yet, when they come together with a shared interest to solve a challenge and bring along specialized teams with a common goal, fostered by a culture of innovation, great things do happen.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For 1Kosmos and AuthenticID our leadership teams assembled in Malibu, adjacent to the Pepperdine University campus, a few weeks ago when we first attended the <a href="https://a4h.org/">All for Humanity Alliance</a> gala.</p>
<p>Our primary goal: to discuss and plan a combined solution leveraging our unique strengths in digital identity proofing and passwordless multi-factor authentication. A solution that quite literally changes the security landscape as we know it.</p>
<p>As commercial enterprises, we of course exist for the benefit of our employees, customers and investors. But, we share a mutual desire to make the world a better place and that’s where the week started essentially in a rally to unite with non-profits, law enforcement and government agencies in the fight against the growing problem of human trafficking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Soon after our discussions turned to Identity and Access Management … with a focus on true digital identity as foundational to addressing the many cybersecurity challenges facing organizations today.</p>
<p></p>
 Identity Verification on the Web 
<p>Dating to well before a global pandemic focused many on <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/employee-onboarding/">remote onboarding of employees</a>, customers, and citizens, the founders of 1Kosmos realized that digital identity was a need for the future of business in a virtual environment.</p>
<p>The central challenge: How do you determine a person on the other side of a digital connection is real and is who they claim to be? This of course is a challenge at initial onboarding, but also at every subsequent online access event with the absolute need for objectivity, equity, and fairness at every step of the journey.</p>
<p>With a 99.6% Target Accept Rate (TAR) and .01% False Accept Rate (FAR), the solutions facial scan recognizes the human form over an Internet connection without racial or gender bias and verifies liveness so as to not be spoofed by photographs, videos and the many other tricks of the trade. This vastly exceeds human recognition rates and avoids nearly all machine introduced errors.</p>
<p>Matching to government issued credentials from over 200 countries around the world works remotely from just about anywhere on just about any device. For example, in the US alone there are over 650 or so variations of state IDs. Copies and fake IDs don’t fool it. And, if government credentials are not available or appropriate for use, identity can be verified via Telco, Banking, and SIM card.</p>
 Using Facial Recognition for User Authentication on the Web 
<p>Once we’ve proven a user is real and who they claim to be the first time, why not use this strong, verified identity to replace passwords, which by comparison are exceptionally weak?</p>
<p>For this, 1Kosmos has built passwordless multi-factor authentication across <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/microsoft-windows-and-windows-hello-for-business/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/macos/">Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/integrations/linux/">Linux</a>, and Unix operating environments. Where required, the platform accommodates device level biometrics, SMS and push notifications, and supports physical access devices such as Yubikey. It even supports self-service password reset capabilities for legacy systems that can’t go passwordless as well as the many corner cases requiring access without Internet connections, lost / stolen devices, and digital identity recovery options similar to those of crypto wallets.</p>
 The Importance of Consent and Privacy 
<p>But, as we know, passwordless access using <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/biometric-authentication-platform/">biometrics</a> (e.g., fingerprints, voice, facial, iris) need to be safely secured and kept private. In an age where data breach has become routine, storing user biometrics and all personally identifiable information becomes a primary security concern.</p>
<p>For this, the “privacy by design” of the 1Kosmos distributed digital identity solution secures information in a private, permissioned blockchain accessible only with user consent using a FIDO2 certified cryptographic public-private key pairing.</p>
<p>This means: 1) there is no central honeypot of user information or a user store for hackers to attack, 2) No 3rd parties have administrative access to user information, and 3) Users have sole authority over their information and determine what is shared or deny sharing with any online service at any time access is requested.</p>
<p>Given that there are somewhere north of 230 GDPR-like regulations around the world, this is an extremely powerful capability particularly as workers, customers, and citizens request online access to a growing number of remote services from organizations that deliver those services via cloud, hybrid, and on prem platforms.</p>
 The Architectural Advantage 
<p>While security has always been a balance between risk and convenience, it should never be about what is just good enough. The combined 1Kosmos / AuthenticID solution is a clean sheet approach to nagging issues that have plagued identity and access management over years and it solves the unique challenges of modern businesses operating in a rapidly evolving world requiring remote access to digital services.</p>
<p>It provides two best in class capabilities via a platform-based approach without significantly changing or disrupting IAM infrastructure or the user experience. And, it can be easily implemented via SDK / API alongside existing systems, which can then be gradually phased out to generate significant savings through a radically simplified IT approach.</p>
<p>Existing users can be migrated to significantly more secure and easy to use <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/passwordless-enterprise/">passwordless authentication</a> with little to no training, while new users get friction fee onboarding that reduces operating costs and secures personal information from end to end. Since only users possess the private key to their information and unlock it with their verified biometric, compliance and consent requirements are addressed at scale.</p>
<p>New account fraud, account takeover, and fraudulent transactions are virtually eliminated as is the risk of ransomware, phishing and data breach. Net – iron clad security significantly reducing the risk from fraud and identity-based cyber attacks, decreased costs, and significantly increased user safety and satisfaction that builds trust and loyalty.</p>
 Beyond Passwordless Authentication 
<p>As of late it seems fashionable to rush passwordless authentication solutions to market with hype and claims that are just a bit beyond reality. But 1Kosmos and AuthenticID have been developing solutions over the past decade to solve the problems with passwords, security, privacy and a bloated IT stack for IAM. In that time our solutions have undergone certification to strict industry standards that have evolved over the same period.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are certified to FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3, PAD-2, and ISO 27001 and compliant to WC3, SOC2 and GDPR. Our solutions are real and they are deployed, performing millions of identity proofs and authentications daily. 1Kosmos alone manages over 50m digital identities for some of the largest brands in the world. We’ve passed the rigor of those and other agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Everyday thousands of doctors onboard and authenticate through our platform to write prescriptions for controlled substances for patients in need. Employees and customers from multiple financial institutions around the globe authenticate through 1Kosmos for secure, easy access to the systems and accounts they need. Our solutions also address the needs of public sector organizations to identify citizens and deliver constituent services while avoiding the type of fraud that has devastated so many programs intended to help those in need.</p>
<p>From the start our mission has been clear – to provide individuals with a secure digital identity that provides control of their credentials and enables service providers use, with consent, to fight identity fraud.</p>
<p>Of course passwordless is a part of this, but in a way it’s only a feature. We didn’t need to build a platform for only passwordless authentication. We built a platform that closes the door on fraud by identifying the identity of every user accessing digital services, satisfies privacy and compliance, and that onboards and authenticates users with ease.</p>
<p>Our identity and authentication platform is the first of its kind to address the needs of users, administrators, and developers to solve the evolving security challenges faced by organizations every day and in all corners of the world. This goes beyond passwordless to digital transformation of the Identity and Access Management to drive significant cost savings, efficiency and agility.</p>
<p>“It’s a wonderful thing to have a shared, mission-driven purpose with 1Kosmos of using technology for good. Knowing our&nbsp;solutions help fight and protect vulnerable people is what unifies us and inspires our employees and partners every day” commented Jeff Jani CEO of AuthenticID.</p>
<p>“Together with AuthenticID we share a vision of combining strong identity proofing with strong passwordless MFA. It’s very gratifying to see this come to life in a distributed digital identity that protects businesses from cyber threats and delivers individuals an experience they control and truly enjoy,” said Hemen Vimadalal, CEO and founder of 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>We are excited to come together with the AuthenticID team later this month at a joint webinar titled Fighting Fraud in Government Services with Digital Identity. Please <a href="https://webinars.govtech.com/Fighting-Fraud-in-Government-Services-with-Digital-Identity-141012.html?appCore=https://cms.erepublic.com/common/forms/ajax_form/141012">register today</a> to join us for the session.</p>

<p>Brand loyalty measurement is more challenging to measure than you think. Consumers are smart and savvy. They change their habits when they are presented with other options that better meet their needs and&nbsp;desires.</p><p>There is an ultimate cost-benefit analysis happening in the mind of consumers on a constant basis. Each time you recommend, highlight, or show off your brand, however, you are adding value. That value must exceed your competitors for it to be effective and build brand&nbsp;loyalty.</p> What is Brand&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>What is brand loyalty? It’s the tendency for consumers to remain loyal to specific brands. A consumer who exhibits brand loyalty will remain loyal even when alternatives are less expensive or offer more features. When a consumer demonstrates brand loyalty, they develop personal feelings toward the brand and its products that influence their choice of brands in a category. Some reasons why consumers exhibit brand loyalty can&nbsp;include:</p>  An emotional attachment to the brand and its&nbsp;identity  A belief in the company’s mission statement and its products/services  A belief in the company’s quality and reliability  <p>Some businesses use loyalty programs to reward frequent customers for returning (learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">loyalty programs best practices here</a>), while others attempt to build customer loyalty through marketing campaigns or social media interactions.</p> Why is Brand Loyalty Important? <p>Brand loyalty can be important for several reasons. For example, it helps to build a positive reputation for a company and its products. If a customer is satisfied with their experience with a brand, they are likely to tell other people about their positive experience. Word of mouth is an extremely powerful tool that can bring in new customers.</p><p>A loyal customer base can also be extremely helpful to any business, because they are more likely to remain loyal to the company’s products even if they encounter other products that may be comparable or better, as long as they have had a positive experience with the brand. This is especially helpful in the case of businesses that sell very specific products or services where it is unlikely that there will be many comparable products on the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Another major advantage of brand loyalty is that it can help companies save money by reducing marketing costs and increasing sales. Loyal customers are more likely to purchase items from the same brand over and over again, so businesses don’t have to keep investing in advertising campaigns to promote their products.</p> What is the Difference Between Brand Loyalty and Customer&nbsp;Loyalty? <p>Brand loyalty and customer loyalty are two terms that are often used interchangeably; however, there is an important difference between the&nbsp;two.</p><p>Customer loyalty refers to <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/customer-commitment/">customers’ feelings of commitment</a> or dedication to a company, brand, or product. Brand loyalty refers to customers’ feelings of commitment or dedication to a particular product within a company’s line of products.</p><p>This can be confusing because many companies use the term “loyalty” when speaking about both brand loyalty and customer loyalty. To avoid confusion, it is important to recognize the difference between these&nbsp;terms.</p><p>The main differences between brand and customer loyalty&nbsp;are:</p>  Brand loyalty means that customers will buy anything that comes from a particular company/brand, while customer loyalty means that customers will only buy a specific&nbsp;product.  Brand loyalty usually refers to brands in the same industry, while customer loyalty usually refers to related products within the same industry.  Brand loyalty can be measured over time, while customer loyalty can be measured once the sale is&nbsp;made.  Brand loyalty is not as strong as customer loyalty because of potential changes in the company/brand’s image.  <p>Another significant difference between brand and customer loyalty is that brands tend to be valued by consumers for their symbolic meaning in a way that companies themselves can’t control, whereas customer-company relationships are mostly based on subjective evaluations of a company’s products and services.</p><p>For example, Coca-Cola has been <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/coca-cola-christmas-marketing/">associated with Christmas</a> for many years now, and people just associate it with this holiday — that’s what makes it a brand. However, Coca-Cola can’t control these associations in the same way it can determine how its products or services are perceived by customers.</p> How to Measure Brand Loyalty: The 6 Key&nbsp;Metrics <p>Brand loyalty is an important thing to measure because it will tell you how customers feel about your brand. If you have high brand loyalty, that means that you’re gaining customers who will purchase your products again in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>High brand loyalty can also mean that you have a high customer satisfaction level, which is always a good sign for any business.</p><p>To determine brand loyalty, you’ll want to measure the following metrics:</p>  Customer churn rate&nbsp;(CCR)  Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS)  Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV)  Customer Retention Rate&nbsp;(CRR)  Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR)  Purchase Frequency (PF)  <p>Once your target market feels connected with your company, they’ll be more likely to show brand loyalty towards&nbsp;it.</p> 1. Customer Churn Rate&nbsp;(CCR) <p>Customer churn rate (CCR) is a ratio of customer losses to total customers. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers lost during a period by the total number of customers at the beginning of that period. It is often expressed as a percentage value.</p><p>When calculating CCR, only leave-of-absence cancellations should be included in the numerator, and future expected cancellations should be excluded from both the numerator and denominator.</p><p>The resulting value represents an estimation of how many customers will cancel service during a given period, whether because they are not satisfied with the service or because they are leaving the region where the service is provided.</p><p>Counting and excluding cancellations correctly is important for assessing both how well your company retains its existing customers and how much future revenue will be generated by current services.</p> 2. Net Promoter Score&nbsp;(NPS) <p>There are a number of metrics that can be used to measure brand loyalty. The most common is called the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures how willing customers are to recommend your business to other people. NPS is calculated by having your customers rank their likelihood of recommending your business on a scale from 1 to&nbsp;10.</p><p>Customers that answer with a 9 or 10 are considered “promoters” of your brand, and customers that answer with a 6 or lower are considered “detractors.” The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters and provides you with your NPS score. This score can go from -100 (all detractors) to 100 (all promoters). The higher your NPS score, the more loyal customers you&nbsp;have.</p><p>NPS consists of a survey that asks one question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company/product/service to a friend or colleague?” The answers range from zero (not likely at all) to ten (extremely likely). Customers who answer with a nine or ten are called “Promoters.” Customers who answer with seven or eight are called “Passives.” And finally, customers who answer with six or below are called “Detractors.”</p><p>To calculate NPS, subtract the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. Passives count toward the total number of respondents, but they don’t count toward the score itself. So if 50% of your customers are Promoters, 40% are Passives, and 10% are Detractors, your NPS is&nbsp;40%.</p> 3. Customer Lifetime Value&nbsp;(CLV) <p>Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the most commonly used metrics to assess brand loyalty. It predicts your customer’s worth to your company, so it’s a great way to show how much the customer values you and your brand. The higher the CLV, the more loyal the customer is likely to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Once you have an idea of the monetary value of your customers, you can use that data to determine the cost of customer retention.The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) gives you an idea of how much revenue a single customer can bring to your business over their lifetime as a customer. It is basically a measure of the value of each individual customer to your business.</p><p>When calculating CLV, you’ll need to estimate the average amount of time that a customer remains loyal to your company. This is fairly simple: just divide the total number of months you’ve been in business by the number of customers you have lost since&nbsp;then.</p> 4. Customer retention rate&nbsp;(CRR) <p>Customer retention rate (CRR) is a term used by businesses to describe the percentage of customers that return to purchase additional products or services. A company usually measures its CRR as a ratio, showing how many returning customers there are for every 100 new customers that are acquired. The higher this ratio, the more confident management is that the company will be able to make future sales and keep growth&nbsp;steady.</p><p>The purpose of calculating CRR is to figure out how effectively a business is retaining customers: if it can retain more customers than it loses, management knows that it is not going to lose money in the long run. It’s also a way of evaluating how well a business communicates with its existing clientele and what type of loyalty program would be best at encouraging them to stay. One thing important to note here: CRR only measures the number of current customers who purchase again from the business, not those who switch over to another brand or&nbsp;company.</p><p>In most cases, managers will calculate CRR by dividing the total number of returning customers by the total number of new customers acquired in one year. There are other ways to measure this ratio-like dividing the number of returning customers by the number of active accounts-and they will yield very different results.</p> 5. Repeat Purchase Rate&nbsp;(RPR) <p>Repeat Purchase Rate, also known as Customer Loyalty Index (CLI), is a business metric that measures how much customers come back to buy from a brand again and again. Repeat Purchase Rate is a strong indicator of your customers’ loyalty to your brand. To calculate Repeat Purchase Rate, add up all the sales you had in one period and divide that number by the number of customers who purchased at least once during that&nbsp;period.</p><p>For example, an RPR that is calculated for a month can be thought of as the proportion of customers who made a purchase at some point in that month and then went on to make another purchase during that same&nbsp;month.</p><p>RPR can be divided by industry because customer behavior can vary dramatically between industries. For example, Amazon has an impressive RPR due to their expansive product offerings and low prices. A local hardware store may have a lower RPR because their product offerings are more&nbsp;limited.</p><p>In general, a high RPR indicates that your customers are happy with your products and services, and are therefore likely to make repeat purchases from you. A low RPR may indicate that your customers have had negative experiences with your brand, or that they were not able to find what they were looking for in earlier purchases. This could be due to many factors including poor product quality, unfavorable pricing, or poor shopping experience on your&nbsp;site.</p> 6. Purchase frequency (PF) <p>In order to measure and increase brand loyalty, companies can use <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/purchase-frequency/">purchase frequency</a> (PF). Brand loyalty is a consumer’s inclination to remain committed to one product in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>Product loyalty is most often measured by customer purchases of the same brand(s) over an extended period of time. Loyal customers are far more likely to repurchase, more likely to purchase more products, and less likely to switch&nbsp;brands.</p><p>To understand why consumers become loyal, researchers have studied consumer loyalty from all angles: demographic, psychological, and behavioral, among others. Demographic factors include age and income level. Psychological factors include product beliefs and attitudes toward the brand. Behavioral factors include frequency of purchase and product involvement.</p> How to Build Brand Loyalty in 4 Easy&nbsp;Steps <p>Building brand loyalty is a process of identifying, anticipating, and meeting the needs of customers. It is important to know when and how to best reach potential new customers.</p><p>Here are some tips on how to build brand&nbsp;loyalty:</p> 1. Create an exceptional customer experience <p>All companies should strive to create an exceptional customer experience that makes customers feel as though they are getting more value than what they paid for. When a company creates an exceptional experience, customers feel like they have been treated extraordinarily well, which causes them to return and buy&nbsp;again.</p> 2. Reward customers for their&nbsp;loyalty <p>Companies should reward customers for their loyalty in order to encourage repeat purchases and increase sales revenue. If a company does not reward loyal customers, then the loyal customers may stop returning because there is no incentive for them to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p><p>PS: if you’re looking for ways to get customers to buy from you more often, don’t miss our article about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/incentive-marketing/">incentive marketing</a>.</p> 3. Encourage referrals and word-of-mouth <p>Advertising through social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter where customers can share with friends about how great their experience was with your&nbsp;company.</p> 4. Offer discounts on future purchases <p>If they refer someone new who makes a purchase within 24 hours of being referred by one of these loyal customers who already has an account with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Creating brand loyalty begins with the customer. The customer needs to feel a sense of trust and engagement toward your company, which requires that you build a relationship with them. Building this relationship includes knowing what your customers want, being able to get it to them at the right time, and offering them incentives for doing business with or continuing business with&nbsp;you.</p><p>Keep in mind that when attempting to build brand loyalty, as well as other types of marketing strategies, you should always consider the long-term effects. You want to make sure that you are having a positive impact on your customers’ lives and that they will continue to do business with you over the&nbsp;years.</p> Give Your Brand Loyalty a&nbsp;Boost <p>How do you make sure your customers aren’t just content with your product, but in love with your&nbsp;brand?</p><p>Create an emotional connection between them and your products and vice versa. Learn more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">the psychology of loyalty</a> and make use of these important insights.</p><p>It’s all about getting to the root of what makes someone feel connected to a company. Find out what makes them tick, why they buy the things they buy, and how to make their experience feel like more than just a transaction, but an experience.</p><p>And don’t forget about surprise and delight tactics. Even if you have a lot of repeat customers and people who are completely loyal to you, keep them on their toes. Make sure there are always new reasons to come back for more from your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Brand loyalty is one of the most important metrics in marketing, and yet it is poorly studied. Most brand loyalty studies focus on repeat purchases. Socially conscious consumers are more likely to purchase from brands that align with their values. Brand alignment is a commonality between the social consumer and the brand that creates additional loyalty beyond repeated purchases.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/brand-loyalty-measurement/">https://www.monetha.io</a>.</p>

<p>Commitment is a bold word, and we can all agree on that. And while in some situations, it’s a positive word bringing a lot of vibes-for example, a marriage, in another context, it might have a negative connotation-if you’re into debt, paying it is a commitment. It isn’t necessarily beneficial for&nbsp;you.</p><p>But we will discuss one other type of commitment in this article-customer commitment. In this article, we will see what customer commitment is, review its importance, mention the types, and give you some tips and tricks on how to improve&nbsp;it.</p> What is Customer Commitment? <p>You can find one of the best descriptions of customer commitment in the book <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/explaining-customer-loyalty-to-retail-stores/238383">Explaining Customer Loyalty to Retail Stores: A Moderated Explanation Chain of the Process</a>. According to Arturo Vasquez-Parraga and Miguel&nbsp;Sahagun,</p><blockquote>Customer’s engagement or continuous obligation to buy the same product or use the same&nbsp;company.</blockquote><p>In simpler terms, companies are making their services so influential for customers that the latter willingly (or not) keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> Why is It Important? <p>It’s essential to give your customers a reason to come back after you have converted them for the first time (see more about <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/ecommerce/types-of-online-shoppers/">types of online shoppers and how to convert them here</a>). Offering your customers discounts, loyalty programs, and social share programs are all ways to build lifetime value with them. Innovative e-commerce features such as an app store, in-app payments, rewards, and one-click purchasing keep your clients returning again and again. People want to feel like a part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>Going the extra mile will be rewarding for your business and your customers. Let’s see&nbsp;why.</p> 1. Better relationships with your customers <p>If you invest in the relationship between you and your clients, you will make them more satisfied with your products. Customers value the personal approach and will always highly regard companies that use it in their marketing strategy.</p> 2. More sales over the long&nbsp;term <p>Every company that invests in its customers will get more committed visitors. Instead of looking for products, they will try to find ways to add more items to their cart, even if they don’t have much money left in their banks, because they like you and your business!</p> 3. Growth potential <p>Customer commitment makes company growth possible. Repeat purchasers can help you invest more in adding extra personnel and investing in new customers, as you will have the available funds.</p> 4. Reduced marketing cost <p>Running an e-commerce store is a challenging endeavor, as advertising on Google, Facebook, and all the other platforms out there is not cheap anymore. However, if you have enough committed customers to your brand, you will drive revenue without spending excessive money and reducing your profit. According to Forbes, converting leads into customers is 5 times more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jiawertz/2018/09/12/dont-spend-5-times-more-attracting-new-customers-nurture-the-existing-ones/?sh=39d455325a8e">expensive</a> than investing in your current&nbsp;clients.</p> What are the Types of Customer Commitment? <p>Okay, we already told you about customers’ commitment and why it’s crucial to have more customers coming back to you. But what are the three main types, and how is each one different from the other ones? Let’s find&nbsp;out.</p> 1. Affective Commitment <p>Affective commitment is the emotional attachment to a brand. If a customer’s emotions are wrapped up in a brand, they’ll become more likely to keep coming back. This means that businesses should be sure to create genuine connections with their audience and make consumers feel like they’re part of the&nbsp;family.</p><p>But to generate affective commitment, it’s not enough to achieve high customer satisfaction. There should be more offered on the table, something exclusive. Affective commitment is like creating a “cult” toward a brand and its&nbsp;product.</p><p>Affective commitment is what each company should be fighting for, and it creates brand advocates who are a great asset for future&nbsp;success.</p> Affective Commitment Examples <p>Apple</p><p>Apple is a common example of a brand that drives customer loyalty because of a “cult” around its name. There are plenty of people who choose the company and buy the latest products. Whenever a new iPhone is released, there are massive queues for people who desire to have the latest model, no matter the cost. Typically, Apple’s products are more expensive than the competition, yet they drive more interest than their&nbsp;rivals.</p><p>A lot of customers’ devotion to Apple is explained by the <a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/psychology-of-loyalty/">psychology of loyalty</a>, which we have talked about on a previous&nbsp;article.</p><p>Ferrari</p><p>It’s a dream come true for customers who can afford to drive the “Red Horse” badge. And while the cheapest model from their product range (Ferrari Roma) starts with a base price of over $200,000, successful people would love to join the list of people who have access to this masterpiece. Sadly, you can’t go full-throttle in town, but still — it’s better to wait in traffic with a “Red Horse”, rather than in a Fiat,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Nike</p><p>Nike is one of the brands with the most brand advocates among sports fans. Being promoted by some of the most notable sports names — like Cristiano Ronaldo, Michael Jordan, and Rafael Nadal- attracts clients who wear a jersey of their favorite sports clubs and buy the iconic Air Jordans or Air Max&nbsp;series.</p> 2. Continuance Commitment <p>Continuance commitment occurs when customers are not that highly impressed by the company. They choose to stay because they give it more value than other choices, and they pick it for logical&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>Although continuance commitment is an important factor of loyalty, it doesn’t bring the “buzz” effect. There is a thin line between affective commitment and continuance commitment.</p><p>Affective commitment focuses on customers choosing a service provider because they feel attached to the brand, while continuance commitment happens when customers choose because it is reasonable.</p> Continuance Commitment Examples <p>Microsoft</p><p>Microsoft is a typical example of a company that customers find reliable and trustworthy. Nobody is proud of using Microsoft Office or Windows. However, most users engage with the company because they know what to expect: consistency, predictability, and good value for&nbsp;money.</p><p>Walmart</p><p>While Walmart doesn’t attract such devoted fans as Apple or Tesla, it has become a synonym of great deals. While some people love the company, most customers shop there because they can find various brands and purchase goods at outstanding prices. The company slogan “Save Money. Live better.” perfectly fits the customer&nbsp;base.</p><p>IKEA</p><p>Just like Walmart, people know what to expect when they buy from IKEA. Reasonable prices and a variety of products. But that’s not all. IKEA has built a name for Swedish quality and minimalistic design, often attracting customers. While luxurious furniture fans cannot usually be seen there, IKEA is a go-to place for millions of customers worldwide.</p> 3. Normative Commitment <p>Instead of customers remaining committed to a brand because they enjoy doing business with it, the term normative commitment refers to when a customer remains committed to a brand because they feel they have to keep using the service, despite their&nbsp;will.</p><p>However, normative commitments are the worst of the three types, as customers who experience them are not happy. While we still have customer retention, this is the last stage before customers abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Normative commitment is also found in the relationship between employers and employees where the latter want to leave but have no better options at the&nbsp;moment.</p> Normative Commitment Examples <p>Adobe</p><p>Adobe is known for its excessive charges. You cannot buy any of Adobe’s products. Instead, you should subscribe to a single software or get access to all of them. $52.99 per month on an annual basis is what you should pay for one license. It’s definitely a steep price no one wants to pay, but since it’s an industry-standard software, you can’t really settle with a cheaper alternative, as they are not good&nbsp;enough.</p><p>SAP</p><p>If you ask employees, 90% of them probably do not like working with SAP. It’s a monolith platform, has a very outdated UI, costs a fortune, and is very heavy. But why do most Fortune 500 keep using it? Because it is proven to work with large batches of data, and it’s one of the legacy companies of its kind, so migrating to a competitor might be a disaster for clients; thus, they stay despite the shortcomings.</p><p>T-Mobile</p><p>Mobile service providers are often topping charts of unpleased customers simply because there isn’t much competition. T-Mobile is a leading provider, yet it receives very poor feedback for lack of mobile signal, unstable 5G connection, and poor customer service. However, customers keep using it, as loyal customers can still get better plans. Otherwise, if they change their carrier, they risk losing the perks that were stacked over the&nbsp;years.</p> How to Increase Customer Commitment <p>There are many ways to increase customer commitment, and fortunately, it isn’t hard to achieve better results. Let’s see some of&nbsp;them:</p> 1. Offer discounts <p>One of the most popular ways to create a more committed customer base is to offer occasional discounts. Of course, it’s not a good practice to have discounts 24/7 available on all products. But coming up with different offers makes people maintain their interest in your e-commerce platform and check out the website/app more frequently.</p> 2. Reward frequent purchases <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/blog/customer-loyalty/programs-best-practices/">Loyalty programs</a> are a superb way to reward repeat purchasers. It is an opportunity for you to connect with your customers personally and build your relationship with them. A rewards program gives your customers a unique feeling of gratitude, regardless of the order value or the amounts of orders they&nbsp;make.</p> 3. Set up subscription services <p>Many subscription-based programs offer incentives to customers that other e-commerce sites don’t. For example, a customer can pay $50 per year and in return receive free shipping and a 10% flat discount on all orders. It is a strong reason for customers to keep coming&nbsp;back.</p> 4. Ask for feedback and reply to&nbsp;it <p>Users can feel more involved with your brand if you offer the option to write a review for your product or service. This way, you show them that their opinions matter to your business. But do not forget to respond. It may take no more than 1–2 minutes to come up with a reply, but the effect can be huge. You can thank them for each positive review and provide an apology and explanation for negative&nbsp;reviews.</p> 5. Offer a “Thank you”&nbsp;email <p>A “Thank You” email isn’t much effort to create, and it has become a common practice among companies. All you need to have is email automation software and some original ideas. Your effort ends with no more than a couple of hours of work until you write a good&nbsp;one.</p> 6. Personalize your&nbsp;message <p>Countless advertisements can work against your brand, especially when you oversaturate the market with web banners and newsletter pop-ups. However, by adding personal touches to every campaign and interacting directly with an audience, you can stand out from the competition by giving something that clients&nbsp;want.</p> 7. Focus on delivering a great customer service experience <p>To improve your store’s performance, you need to make yourself available to your customers. Adding customer care agents will significantly improve your performance. Try to add as many channels as possible: email, live chat, phone. Having quick-to-react customer service might make the difference between affective commitment and customers quitting your&nbsp;brand.</p> Conclusion <p>Customer commitment is vital for your business, and it can help your brand generate more money by capitalizing on existing customers and converting leads into new clients. But if you fail to offer something any short of the best, your clients can quickly abandon your&nbsp;brand.</p><p>Did you like this article?

To get there, we need open Standards, Protocols and Alliances that help individuals, as well as businesses of any size, to participate in a digital future inside the metaverse and beyond - just like trade unions helped the working class during the industrial revolution to fight for their rights. In this panel session, we will discuss about the enablers of such a different approach and the requirements to actually be successfull.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-gain-future-internet"></a>

  <p>Ethical Hacker Joseph Carson will demonstrate a real-world use case of how a cyber adversary gains an initial foothold in your network through compromised credentials and then elevates control and moves laterally to identify and exfiltrate your critical data. He will share insights into how the mind of a criminal hacker operates based on his experiences and steps you can take to stop them in their tracks.</p>
<p>Staying up to date and learning hacking techniques is one of the best ways to know how to defend your organization from cyber threats. Hacking gamification is on the rise to help keep security professionals up to date on the latest exploits and vulnerabilities. This session is about helping you get started with hacking gamification to strengthen your security team.</p>
<p>In this session Joseph Carson Chief Security Scientist and Advisory CISO at Delinea will select two systems from Hack the Box and walk through each of them in detail explaining each step along with recommendations on how to reduce the risks. Going from initial enumeration, exploitation, abusing weak credentials to a full privileged compromise.</p>
<p>What will I learn?</p>
 
 How attackers gain access to IT environments and systems and escalate privileges 
 What a real-world hack looks like in a use-case demonstration 
 Best practices for combating attackers by establishing multiple layers of security to minimize risk 
 
<p>Get answers to these important questions:</p>
 
 How has moving to the cloud affected cyber security from a PAM perspective? 
 What are the most common types of attacks that criminal hackers use to compromise cloud environments? 
 What are common misconceptions that lead to cyber security “blind spots” of vulnerability?

The risk of data misuse, of being hacked or manipulated has become a significant challenge and and requires a new approach in times of an emerging web3 and its core capability of transferring value. Is decentralized, DLT based Identity the solution that finally will enable DeFi, NFTs and DAOs? Join this awesome keanote panel to controversially discuss this topic.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-panel-idm-web3"></a>

  <p>Trust is not just technical, and it’s not just derived from a process or an organisation. The need for Trust is also variable based on the risk involved in a transaction or the risk appetite of the service provider. Sometimes trust is almost irrelevant. Digital doesn’t make things any easier as we often have multiple parties involved in the communication of trust from issuer to holder of credentials, and on to a relying service not to mention requirements for onboarding, verification, issuance, and authentication to name but a few along the way.</p>
<p>Emerging standards and relentless innovation make many things better, but they also introduce challenges when we want multiple systems to work together and for trust to be largely independent of the underlying technical stacks.</p>
<p>To make Trust work in diverse ecosystems we need clear rules of engagement that champion the needs of all participants and clearly define their responsibilities to one another, and to the wider legal and business ecosystems they ultimately interact with. Efforts in multiple jurisdictions in both the public and private sector are developing these rule sets right now – this is what we can learn from the rise of the Trust Framework.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-cooper-trust-rules"></a>

The addition of consumer-permissioned data from an open banking platform allows early-stage FinTechs access to the data they need to mitigate fraud, maximize confidence, and provide more choice in payment transactions to improve user experiences.</p>
<p>“Mastercard’s open banking platform provides consumer-permissioned data that is critical to enabling all ecosystem players, opening the door for the future of financial experiences, and can help streamline account verification to reduce friction between apps and consumers,” said Andy Sheehan, Executive Vice President, U.S. Open Banking at Mastercard. “Mastercard and Synctera’s partnership enhances the support and collaboration that is critical to FinTech innovators and will allow entrepreneurs and developers the ability to go to market quickly and ultimately deliver more consumer choice.”</p>

				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>IIW was established in 2005, and boasts over a hundred sponsors, with hundreds in attendance. As the focus is on “getting things done” the agenda is created live each day by attendees present at the opening of the day, giving you the opportunity to establish what you want to talk about and getting the real time ability to see which topics others will be deliberating that you might want to join in on.</p>
<p>IIW is an un-conference, which means that there are no keynote speakers, presentations, or sales pitches (for the most part). Participants are encouraged to come with topics they would like to discuss with the community in attendance, with the goal of “moving topics, code and projects downfield.”</p>
<p>The Take Aways</p>
<p>Because of the unique style of this conference you are sure to take part in, sit in on, or just overhear a variety of conversations on all kinds of work in the identity space. Here are some of the topics Indicio’s team at IIW found interesting.</p>
<p>Trust registries and Machine Readable Governance: The question, “How do we know which Issuers to trust?” was brought up several times at IIW with “Trust registries” being a common response. But&nbsp; there seemed to be a division over what a trust registry is or should be. One interpretation saw it as a third party fulfilling a top-down, command-and-control, pay-to-play, API-to-call function in determining which credential issuers can be trusted. The other saw it as something collaborative, a resource for governance files that allows those files to be cacheable among agents through machine readable governance. This triggered interest in what machine readable governance was, how it made a trust registry portable,&nbsp; and how it could be implementedThere</p>
<p>DIDComm as a Control Channel: This concept is all about using DIDcomm as a coordinating service, connecting two endpoints that want to communicate and handling everything from authentication to coordinating money transfers or shipping details, while also adding an additional security layer for the end user. While it was a new idea to many, there were a few people that raised their hands and said that they have already implemented something like this and showed some real world examples, increasing excitement around the possibilities and promoting further adoption.</p>
<p>Interoperability: As usual, many people were concerned with how to solve interoperability challenges in the community. The crowd was very keen on the idea of running an Aries Interop-a-thon (based on the hackathon style events Indicio has run for the Cardea Project at Linux Foundation Public Health) The idea that IIW tickets be issued as credentials so the community can personally test its solutions and try to iron out some of the interoperability challenges was proposed, and has a good chance of moving forward.</p>
<p>The really thought provoking discussion was about the current state of identity interoperability vs interoperability in other areas of tech. When compared to browsers, it was said it is tempting to feel like we are in the Netscape era of standardization. When in reality we are likely more in line with the Compuserve-AOL era of standardization and have much further&nbsp; to go.</p>
<p>AnonCreds VS W3C JSON-LD Creds: Our team expected some disagreement about this topic, but both sides seemed to realize that delivery is what matters here, and additional argument isn’t going to help. Multiple sessions were run trying to identify which credential format to use, resulting in 7+ different formats being discussed, with Anoncreds &amp; W3C JSON-LD being the most popular for debate. The ISO mDL 18013-5 credential format was also brought up for use in drivers licenses.</p>
<p>Why should you participate in the next IIW?</p>
<p>No wrap up or bullet point list can capture every conversation. This year was the first in-person conference since the start of the pandemic and every member of our team was excited to go.</p>
<p>While it was cheaper to attend over zoom, the conversational opportunities presented by in-person attendance—the ability to to really dig into the technology, simply don’t occur online. While this could be said for any conference, the unconference style of IIW encourages much greater audience participation. The number of engineers in these discussions drives challenging, exciting, and insightful ideas, so much so in fact, that In the middle of this IIW they decided to do the next one in person, rather than one remote and one in person per year as had been previously planned.</p>
<p>And worse case scenario, you can use the opportunity of bringing your team together for some sweet photo ops like our team did.</p>
<p>Tickets sell out quickly so for more information and to make sure you can join the next event we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">IIW website</a>!</p>

<p>Es zirkulieren falsche Annahmen und Missverständnisse in den Medien über das Potenzial und die Risiken von SSI. In diesem Artikel setzen wir uns mit einigen Missverständnissen auseinander und fassen die wichtigsten Kernthesen über SSI zusammen. So entsteht am Ende ein übersichtliches Bild darüber, was SSI ist, und vor allem: was SSI nicht ist und sein soll.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Können SSI Daten gestohlen und ohne mein Wissen verwendet werden? Ermöglicht SSI einen Datenmarkt und weiteren Missbrauch von unseren Daten?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei SSI stehen die selbstbestimmte Nutzung und gleichzeitige Datensicherheit für das Individuums im Mittelpunkt. Gleichzeitig ist Datensparsamkeit wichtig: der User sollte immer nur das erforderliche Minimum der Informationen über sich preisgeben müssen, das für die Nutzung eines Dienstes notwendig ist. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass man bei SSI nur entscheiden kann, wem man die Daten gibt, nicht aber, was mit ihnen passiert – was keine technische Frage ist, sondern den Trust Frameworks und der Umsetzung von Policies geschuldet. Dies wird über Zertifizierung und Zulassung geregelt, da so Vertrauen in die am Ökosystem beteiligten Akteure hergestellt werden kann. SSI selbst bietet keinen allgemeinen Schutz vor Datenmissbrauch. Dennoch stellt es die Möglichkeit dar, durch das Prinzip der Dezentralität die eigenen Daten sicher und selbstbestimmt zu verwalten. Die Dienste, an welche man persönliche Daten übermittelt, sind letztendlich ebenfalls an die Datenschutzgrundverordnung gebunden. Man kann nicht nur entscheiden, wem man die Daten gibt, sondern auch wie (bspw. als ZKP oder als VP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso bietet SSI mehr privacy als derzeitige Systeme?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weil wir unsere Daten nicht an Hunderte von Plattformen auslagern, sondern zentral bei uns verwalten. So wären im Idealfall beim Hack eines Dienstes keine Tausende von Userprofilen mit sensiblen Daten zu erbeuten, sondern nur wertlose peer to peer connects. Dadurch entstehen mehr Privatsphäre und Eigenverantwortung über die persönlichen Daten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Schon im ersten Artikel zu SSI von Christopher Allan steht: Der User kann und soll selbst entscheiden, wem er oder sie persönliche Daten zeigt und wofür. Voraussetzung dafür ist Interoperabilität und Portabilität der Identitäten. Diese Idee ist gewissermaßen der Kern von SSI. Doch die Aussage, dass ich als User die komplette Hoheit über meine digitale Identität habe, wird oft missverstanden und ist in dieser Form falsch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ist SSI mit Klarnamenpflicht gleich zu setzen und verliere ich meine Anonymität?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Welche Daten ein Dienst einfordert liegt beim Dienst und an den gesetzlichen Vorgaben. Ist der Dienstanbieter nicht an eine Klarnamenpflicht gebunden, also nicht verpflichtet einen Klarnamen abzufragen und zu überprüfen so kann er das auch nicht vom Nutzer einfordern (nach Datenschutzgrundverordnung). Tut er dies trotzdem, muss der Benutzer zustimmen und es muss ein konkreter Grund genannt werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wieso hat SSI nichts mit Blockchain zu tun?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>SSI wird oft mit der Blockchain Technologie gleichgesetzt. Dadurch entsteht der Eindruck, dass SSI nur gemeinsam mit Blockchain funktionieren kann. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall. Wir haben eine umfassende Erklärung hier zusammengefasst: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/">https://jolocom.io/blog/dezentrale-identitaten-not-blockchain/</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week we released a new version of Holochain Launcher with a lot of new features. I took it for a test run and I have to say… I'm excited. It feels like something my dad could actually use! The new Launcher is much more welcoming to non-technical users. I’m going to unbox it below, but first, the Holochain release notes for this week.</p> Holochain 0.0.139: Keystore version bump, simpler link CRUD <p>Breaking changes: none<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129, 0.0.130, 0.0.131, 0.0.132<br>Compatible Lair version: 0.1.3</p><p>This release is another small one, albeit with a couple meaningful changes for devs and users:</p>  The compatible Lair keystore has been bumped to version 0.1.3 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1377">#1377</a>). This brings mostly documentation updates, but also fixes a <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/all-agents-busy-please-stand-by/#holochain-00137">bug</a> involving spaces in Lair’s socket/pipe path (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/91">lair #91</a>) and gets more strict about the version of Lair that it intends to connect to (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/lair/pull/95">lair #95</a>).  The link CRUD functions <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html"><code>create_link</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_link_details.html"><code>get_link_details</code></a>, and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/link/fn.get_links.html"><code>get_links</code></a> now take any DHT hash that can be converted to a <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.132/hdk/prelude/type.AnyLinkableHash.html">linkable hash</a>, rather than requiring you to convert it yourself. On the flip side, entry, header, and external hashes now have <code>Into&lt;AnyLinkableHash&gt;</code> implementations to make this all possible. Surprisingly, this isn’t a breaking change, as it all happens in the HDK before getting sent to the host. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1365">#1365</a>)   Unboxing the user-friendly Launcher 0.4.4 <p>Compatible Holochain versions: 0.0.127, 0.0.131, 0.0.132, 0.0.136</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a>, it’s a user-friendly manager for running hApps. This will eventually be our end-user offering, and one of the primary ways you’ll be able to distribute web-based hApps to your users.</p><p>Version 0.4.4 is a huge jump toward the goal of user-friendliness, in a few ways:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/devhub-dnas">DevHub</a>, a built-in package manager that lets your users download and install hApps right from within the Launcher!  It supports multiple Holochain versions, which means that you don’t have to worry quite as much about whether your users have the right Launcher installed. It also means they also won’t have to perform any more factory resets and lose their data!  <p>Okay, let’s unbox this thing.</p> 1. First run <p>Here’s something new: When you start up Launcher 0.4.4 for the first time, there’s already a hApp running! It’s the first public preview of the new DevHub hApp. (I’ll talk more about that at the bottom of this Dev Pulse.)</p> 2. hApp Library <p>If you click on the ‘Install new app’ button, instead of getting a file dialog, you see the new App Library! It’s powered by the DevHub DNA, and it lets you download, install, and start a hApp with just a couple of clicks. Currently there’s only one hApp with a public release, called Notebooks, but it’s a fun one.</p> 3. Installing a hApp <p>As you can see, I didn’t have to hunt around for a hApp bundle file on the internet, and I didn’t have to hunt for the downloaded file on my device’s storage. The Launcher just downloaded Notebooks and showed me a simplified installation dialog. The membrane proof fields are hidden; all I have to do is change the hApp’s name if I feel like it.</p> 4. Behold, a newly installed hApp <p>Now I have two hApps, DevHub and Notebooks. They each require a different conductor version, but that’s no problem; you can see that Launcher started up 0.0136 automatically for me. Users probably won’t notice or care about this detail, but what it means for them is that It Just Works.</p> 5. Using Notebooks for the first time <p><a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/notebooks">Notebooks</a> is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to HackMD or Google Docs. It’s built using a framework called <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/decentralized-next-level-collaboration-apps-with-syn/">Syn</a>, created by Eric Harris-Braun and his son last year. I’d like to say more about Notebooks, but for brevity’s sake I’ll say this: I was surprised by how delightful it was to use. The real-time editing experience is smooth and snappy, just like you’d expect from a cloud app. But I’m comforted by the knowedge that all the stuff I care about is on my machine!</p><blockquote>So, now that you’ve seen the new Launcher, why not <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases/tag/v0.4.4">give it a try</a>? I invite non-developers to try it out too!</blockquote> DevHub public preview <p>So the other big news that got bundled with Launcher 0.4.4 is, of course, the first public preview of the DevHub hApp. It’s not ready for prime time yet (that will likely happen after the Stable Validation milestone) but I’m still excited by the possibilities it hints at.</p><p>So what is DevHub? If you’re a developer, it’s easiest to think of it as a package manager and distributed repository for hApps, built on Holochain. You can distribute releases of your zomes, DNAs, hApps, and web-based UIs for other developers to remix, or for users to download.</p><p>If you’re a user, it’s like an open-source hApp store or library. As we’ve seen, the Launcher can talk to the DevHub DNA natively, giving it the power to search, download, install, and update hApps.</p><p>The DevHub hApp comes with a web-based GUI that attempts to serve both devs and users. In the future, it will split into two GUIs — one specifically tailored to devs, and a user-focused ‘hApp store’ experience.</p><p>This demonstrates that you don’t have to use a hApp’s default UI — you can fork it, create your own, or even build it into a desktop app, as the Launcher’s native support demonstrates. This is what happens when an app’s API is totally accessible to you on your machine. It’s all under your control!</p> Unboxing the DevHub GUI <p>Now let’s take a look at this first iteration of the DevHub GUI. It’s being redesigned at the moment, but this will give you a taste of what the DNA is meant for.</p> 1. Main page <p>When you open up the GUI, you see a listing of hApp packages, sorted by date. You can get info on a package, add your own hApp, or choose instead to look at individual DNAs and zomes if you’re interested in remixing and creating your own hApp.</p> 2. hApp info page <p>Let’s take a look at the Notebooks listing. We can see some information about the hApp — what it’s for, how fresh it is, who wrote it, etc. Below that, you can see all the individual releases of the hApp.</p> 3. Release page <p>Let’s take a look at the 0.0.1 release of Notebooks. It was published on 9 May 2022, and we can see the changelog. To the right we can see the DNAs that comprise it — `syn` and `notebooks` — and download a headless `.happ` package or a full `.webhapp` package.</p><p>That’s all for now — once I learn more about DevHub I’d like to do a more in-depth study of what it can do!</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@spacex?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">SpaceX</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

<p>To the ShareRing Community,</p>



<p>It’s been a tough few days for many people and we understand that the resulting challenges may be with us for quite some time. Transparency drives the core values of ShareRing, and we aim to maintain a level of consistency in being transparent with you, our community members who have supported us through the highs and lows.</p>



<p>As a company we have always strived to maintain consistent transaction fees, in particular when it is within our control. When external protocols are required in the transaction, it becomes more challenging to do so. The average cost of Ethereum transaction fees have risen exponentially over the last few days, and as a result we are going to temporarily increase the swap out fees from SLP3 to ERC20.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Swap out fees will be increased from 5000 SHR to 10,000 SHR. This takes effect immediately as of the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Our team closely monitors the market costs and we are always positioned to make the necessary adjustments to reflect the trends.</p>



<p>The ShareRing Community has always been the core of our business, and we endeavour to work through the challenges together, as a whole. Short term challenges prepare us for prospective growth and we look towards the shining light at the end of the tunnel, not just as a community and company, but the industry a whole.</p>



<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jonathon, </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> The need for authentication standards 
<p>In the cybersecurity industry, many new technologies–particularly those related to identity management and authentication–are constantly driving change and innovation. Yet one thing remains the same: the use of passwords continues to pose a threat to an organization’s IT security. As long as passwords continue to be used, users and organizations will remain vulnerable to attacks. Fortunately, due to the development of new solutions and authentication standards, replacing passwords as the dominant form of authentication on the Internet now seems to be possible.</p>
<p>Various annual surveys demonstrate that password compromises are associated with 70-80% of data breaches. As a response to the over-reliance on passwords, the non-profit organization FIDO ("Fast IDentity Online") Alliance was launched in 2013 to develop and promote authentication standards. With the help of the FIDO Alliance, a set of open, scalable, and interoperable specifications has been developed to replace passwords as a secure authentication method for online services. The alliance has also worked with companies such as Microsoft, Google and Apple to integrate and adopt FIDO standards across their operating systems.</p>
 <br>FIDO Alliance reveals its latest whitepaper 
<p>Most recently, the FIDO Alliance and the W3C WebAuthn working group published a whitepaper in March 2022 explaining how the introduction of multi-device FIDO credentials will enable FIDO technology to supplant passwords for many consumer use cases. The framework goes further by outlining two proposals for phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms:</p>
 
 Using your phone as a roaming authenticator: Essentially, this involves connecting the user's smartphone (which becomes the FIDO authenticator) and the device from which the user is trying to authenticate via Bluetooth. Since Bluetooth requires physical presence, the use of proximity-based authentication should be resistant to any phishing attacks. As a result, the smartphone becomes a sort of smart card while providing the necessary FIDO requirements to the device from which the user is trying to authenticate. 
 
 
 Multi-device FIDO credentials: To improve user experience, the second proposal encourages FIDO authenticator vendors to adapt their authenticators in the event of lost or stolen devices. As users move from device to device, FIDO credentials should be available on a user’s new device without the need of implementing a password.&nbsp; For example, a smartphone, a desktop, and a USB token could act as a mutually exchangeable FIDO authenticator. 
 
<p>The whitepaper argues that the syncing of FIDO credentials, together with the Bluetooth alternative, allows FIDO authentication to be a secure and convenient solution for existing two-factor deployments. Furthermore, the paper makes it clear that the proposal is not a change in standards, but rather a set of prescriptions for vendors to implement themselves.</p>
<p><br>However, there is one crucial point that the FIDO and WebAuthn proposals seem to ignore. So far, the whitepaper has not specified whether users will feel comfortable with a password successor where the cloud operator has access to secret keys. If users roam enterprise-issued keys via potentially insecure clouds, organizations must understand the risks that come with convenience when syncing is not end-to-end secured.&nbsp; At the end of the day, it comes down to what end users will do and only time will tell if they are willing to trust<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless"> Microsoft</a>,<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/protect-gce-vms-with-managed-fido-security-keys"> Google</a>, and <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/expanded-support-for-fido-authentication-in-ios-and-macos/">Apple</a> as the ultimate confidants of their organization's credentials.</p>
<p><br>In addition, if the deprovisioning of access within applications is not properly implemented, former employees might gain access to cloud-based applications when leaving an organization and returning their physical FIDO key. By not having proper controls in place, this new level of convenience will increase the risk and reduce the level of control an organization is able to exert.<br>Therefore, KuppingerCole believes that companies and other organizations that are looking to modernize and improve authentication solutions should understand the consequences beforehand. If done right, this solution has the potential to provide a frictionless user experience while improving security at the same time. We expect to see a significant number of FIDO authenticators, vendors, servers, and compatible web apps in industry over the course of the next few years.</p>

<p>Nel numero 57 del magazine <a href="https://www.impresacity.it/">IMPRESACITY</a>&nbsp; uscito lo scorso Aprile 2022, è possibile leggere un’intervista rilasciata da Carmine Auletta – CISO di InfoCert – all’interno dello speciale dedicato alla sanità digitale.</p>



<p>Nel corso di questi ultimi anni una serie&nbsp;di progetti innovativi, come&nbsp;l’invio digitale, certificato e sicuro, delle comunicazioni di inizio quarantena per Covid da parte dei medici di base ai propri assistiti&nbsp;o&nbsp;ancora, la raccolta del consenso informato dematerializzato dell’avvio della campagna vaccinale di inizio 2021 hanno contribuito in maniera forte alla digitalizzazione nel campo sanitario.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“L’obiettivo è giungere a una digitalizzazione completa di tutte le fasi dell’iter pre-intervento di un paziente per garantire ai cittadini maggiore efficienza e anche migliore qualità di comunicazione con le strutture sanitarie.”</p>Carmine Auletta, CISO di InfoCert</blockquote>



<p>Negli ultimi anni la sanità è stata oggetto di numerosi&nbsp;cambiamenti, dettati prima dalla pandemia e ora dagli investimenti in ambito Pnrr. In questo contesto numerose sono state le soluzioni digitali adottate nel campo sanitario, facendo sì che ad oggi la digitalizzazione della sanità risulti essere uno dei pilastri dei recovery plan di tutta Europa. &nbsp;</p>



<p>InfoCert è da sempre protagonista della digitalizzazione nel mondo Health Care grazie soprattutto a LegalCare e ProxySign, le soluzioni Trust studiate per la digitalizzazione dei processi&nbsp;di lavoro clinici e amministrativi e già adottate da importanti Aziende Sanitarie Italiane.&nbsp;</p>

  What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first Silicon Salon, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReR

<p>What if semiconductor manufacturers made chips especially intended for crypto-wallets? That’s the topic of Blockchain Commons’ first <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Silicon Salon</a>, which will feature two different chip manufacturers who are expanding into the crypto industry. The first is CrossBar, a leader in Resistive RAM (ReRAM) technology, which can implement high-performance physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Together, ReRAM memory and PUF solutions enable a new class of secure computing and storage with physical countermeasures — and CrossBar is interested in bringing that to digital-asset management. The second is Tropic Square, whose tropic01 secure element offers a fully transparent and auditable chip as a basis for better hardware security. They use transparency as a driver for innovation.</p>

<p>Because Blockchain Commons is dedicated to bringing together a community of developers and manufacturers to jointly develop specifications that will empower the entire industry, we’ve seized upon our work with these two companies to produce our first salon since the pandemic: a virtual Silicon Salon, where semiconductor manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and other interested parties can come together to talk about the next generation of semiconductors, which for the first time ever will be specialized for our cryptographic needs.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon is scheduled for June 1st, running three hours beginning at 9am PT (noon ET, 6pm CET). Signups for the Salon are now available on <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">Eventbrite</a>, with tickets limited to the first 40 participants.</p>

<p>The first hour of the Salon will feature presentations from silicon manufacturers, crypto-wallet makers, and experts in the field about how semiconductor design can support cryptographic functionality. Companies CrossBar, Tropic Square, and Proxy and experts Bryan Bishop and Christopher Allen are all scheduled to talk.</p>

<p>The other two hours of the Salon will feature facilitated discussion of topics intended to determine the needs of the hardware-wallet community. Specific topics may include: the importance of MCU and secure enclave integration; the importance of secure and persistent storage; the need for physical countermeasures; the advantages of hardware and software cryptography; the use of open licenses for hardware; and discussions of how new semiconductor designs intended for cryptography can improve security and efficiency. We don’t have all the answers: one of the most important goals of the salon is to find out the needs and thoughts of the community!</p>

<p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">join us</a> to learn a bit about what’s already going on and to share your ideas, requirements, and expertise!</p>

<p>We are limiting the number of attendees to allow for Q&amp;A from the community, thus we are charging US$25 to hold a space at this unique virtual event. So <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/silicon-salon-hosted-by-blockchain-commons-tickets-338323152657">sign up</a> soon! If you are already a <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/sponsors.html">Patron</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">monthly sponsor on Github</a> of Blockchain Commons, please check your email: we will be sending you a free invite code automatically.

  <p>Again and again, I am asked how one can start with the topic of security in an agile project environment. What are the essential first steps, and what should you focus on at the beginning? Of course, this raises the question of suitable methodologies and tools. At the same time, the strategic orientation of the company must be included in this security strategy. We have also learned in the recent past that attacks like the “Solarwinds Hack” are becoming more and more sophisticated and that the attackers now focus on the entire value chain. What tools are there, and where should they be used? How can I start tomorrow to prepare myself for the future against the challenges of cyber attacks? And that’s exactly what you will get an answer to here.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2022-ruppert-solarwinds-cybersecurity"></a>
